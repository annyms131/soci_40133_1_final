16250705,"Social cognitive and physical health determinants of exercise adherence for HIV-1 seropositive, early symptomatic men and women.","This study examined social cognitive and physical health factors that might explain variations in exercise adherence in a 3-month supervised exercise intervention for a group of mildly symptomatic, HIV-1 seropositive men and women. The social cognitive predictor variables were outcome expectations and self-efficacy. The physical health predictor variables included CD4+ cell counts, self-report inventories of physical symptoms, and physicians' examinations. Self-report inventories of physical symptoms were associated with physicians' examinations and combined into a composite measure of physical health. Criterion variables included exercise adherence rates, VO2max change, and status as a 'remainder' versus 'drop-out.' The composite measure of physical health emerged as a significant predictor of adherence rate and gave perfect prediction of remainers and a moderate prediction of dropouts. No significant associations were observed between the social cognitive predictors and adherence. Results suggest that for this population physical health status is a better predictor of exercise adherence than either perceived self-efficacy or outcome expectancy.",International journal of behavioral medicine,1998,England,1998,90
16203507,The interplay of drinking patterns and other determinants of health.,"The health effects of alcohol are determined not only by level of intake but also by patterns of alcohol use and many other health determinants. This study seeks to identify groups of individuals who share various features in terms of drinking styles and other health indicators. Data used are a subset of the 1990 Ontario Health Survey, corresponding to men and women aged 20-64 with complete data in four substantive areas: alcohol use; demographic characteristics; current health status; and various behavioural risk factors for chronic disease. Cluster analysis was used to groups of male and female respondents who were similar in terms of their style of alcohol use, along with other constructs relevant to health risk and health status. For both sexes, clusters were identified which matched expectation in terms of drinking patterns and other relevant variables. For both sexes, clusters were found with generally higher social class indicators, generally positive health behaviours and health status and drinking patterns which did not include drinking to excess. Clusters were also found for which high-volume drinking occasions corresponded with poor health status and high levels of risk factors for chronic disease. Other unanticipated patterns were also identified. This information may assist in identifying confounding effects in epidemiological studies as well as identifying the characteristics of unique sub-populations which are likely to be the focus of primary prevention efforts.",Drug and alcohol review,1998 Dec,Australia,1998,90
15647133,Paranoid cognition in social systems: thinking and acting in the shadow of doubt.,"Distrust and suspicion are common and recurring problems at all levels of social organization, ranging from the interpersonal to the collective. Unfortunately, our understanding of the origins and dynamics of such distrust and suspicion remains far from complete. A primary aim of this research, accordingly, was to articulate a new framework for conceptualizing a form of exaggerated distrust and suspicion termed paranoid social cognition. Drawing on recent psychological theory and research, this framework identifies the social cognitive underpinnings of paranoid cognitions. It also specifies some of the situational determinants of such cognition and elaborates on the psychological, behavioral, and social dynamics that sustain them.","Personality and social psychology review : an official journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc",1998,United States,1998,90
15259193,Elite formation under occupation: the internal stratification of palestinian elites in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.,"This paper examines the internal stratification of Palestinian elites in the West Bank and Gaza Strip under Israeli occupation. Our general aim is to clarify the extent to which social and political subordination to outside rule influences the development of indigenous elites in stateless societies. In contrast to nation-state societies, such elites may be horizontally stratified into a wider range of institutional settings, and vertically stratified by anti-occupation activism alongside the attainment of occupational prestige. In addition, context-specific determinants of their stratification patterns, such as refugee status, regionality, and country in which educational credentials were acquired, should be considered. A secondary content analysis of interviews conducted by the Palestinian Panorama centre with 249 elite members reveals, that the vertical stratification of Palestinian elites along occupational attainment and anti-occupation activism constitutes two quite independent status dimensions. A multinomial logit regression shows that, horizontally, elite groups are embedded in four distinct types of institutional activity, further demonstrating the multi-faceted formation of Palestinian elites. Contextual resources, such as refugee versus non-refugee status, regionality, and the acquiring of Western credentials, have differential effects on the vertical and horizontal stratification of Palestinian elites. The implications of these findings for further research on elite formation in the post-Oslo Palestinian society and in other stateless societies are discussed in conclusion.",The British journal of sociology,1999 Sep,England,1999,90
15073910,QUALYOP project 2: monitoring the dismantling of Italian psychiatric hospitals. Psychotropic drug use in 1072 inpatients.,"OBJECTIVE: This study describes the use of psychotropic drugs in a sample of eight Italian psychiatric hospitals. METHODS: A cross-sectional approach was used to collect information about sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the inpatient population, and about medications prescribed. Prescribing behaviour in the hospitals was compared using three indicators: the number of patients taking psychotropic drugs, the use of high doses of neuroleptics and the use of multiple neuroleptics. RESULTS: More than a thousand patients were resident in the eight hospitals on the census day, 56% of them males. Half the population had an ICD-X diagnosis of schizophrenia, one third of mental retardation. Sixty-nine percent of the sample was on neuroleptic therapy, nearly 47% on benzodiazepines and 4% on antidepressants. Twenty percent of the sample did not take any psychotropic drug on the census day. After adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical variables, setting-related variables resulted as determinants of psychotropic drug use. CONCLUSIONS: These data call for continuing education in psychopharmacology towards a more rational use of drugs; longitudinal audits of clinical practice should be implemented to guide clinicians toward a more rational use of psychotropic drugs.",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,1999 Aug,England,1999,90

14618012,Factors associated with health perception of Saudi elderly.,"To study the pattern and determinants of health perception among Saudi elderly a cross-sectional house-hold survey of 6,139 elderly in Saudi Arabia performed between January 1994 and December 1995. A stratified two stage sampling technique was used to select the elderly subjects (60 years and above). Using a pre-designed, pre-tested questionnaire, the subjects' physical, mental, social and environmental health status and health perception were assessed via personal interviews completed by trained researchers. The poor health perception was predominant among females and more with advanced age (75 years and more). It was also found to be associated with more social and economical underprivileges, and independence as measured by an Activity of Daily Living (ADL) scale. Multivariate analysis revealed the most significant determinants of poor perception of health as follows: inability to perform prayers standing (OR = 3.36; p < 0.0000), and the number of diagnoses (OR = 3.33; p = 0.000). A significant correlation was found between hospital visits, number of diagnoses and health perception. These socio-demographic and socio-medical factors found to be important determinants of health perception among Saudi elderly need to be modified.",Journal of cross-cultural gerontology,1999 Dec,Netherlands,1999,90
14528548,Psychosocial correlates of cancer relapse and survival: a literature review.,"This article reviews literature on the psychosocial correlates of cancer relapse and survival from 1979 through 1995. The factors studied were structured according to a theoretical model of coping with cancer. Reviewed studies have shown that factors most frequently evaluated were depression, anxiety, hopelessness/helplessness, hostility, marital status and social involvement. Mainly inconsistent results were found. The strongest evidence for a relationship between psychosocial variables and prognosis was found for social involvement/social support; in 7 of 15 studies a positive relationship was demonstrated, while no negative associations were found. Coping styles e.g., fighting spirit and stoic acceptance, and severe/stressful life events were found to have no conclusive influence on the length of survival. Important determinants of the coping model, such as uncertainty and information given by the specialist were not studied as possible predictors of survival and/or relapse free period. Among the factors that showed no correlation at all was multidimensional health locus of control. For the inconsistent findings, a considerable number of methodologic shortcomings with respect to study design, sample size, measure and statistical analysis are enumerated.",Patient education and counseling,1999 Jul,Ireland,1999,90
12689499,Personal and social variables as co-determinants of noise annoyance.,"This paper starts with the fact that noise annoyance is partly due to acoustic factors, partly due to so-called moderating variables, i.e. personal and social aspects of the residents. Noise annoyance is considered to be the (long-term) negative evaluation of living conditions with respect to noise. This evaluation is not simply dependent on past disturbances, but on attitudes and expectations, too. The personal factors influencing the evaluation and described here are: Sensitivity to noise, fear of harm connected with the source, personal evaluation of the source, and coping capacity with respect to noise. The social factors described here are: General (social) evaluation of the source, trust or misfeasance with source authorities, history of noise exposure, and expectations of residents. For most of these variables, data from different community studies are used in order to illustrate the respective moderating effect on annoyance. In addition, some of the moderators are presented as possible tools in order to reduce noise annoyance. It is expected that a significant decrease in a negatively moderating variable is as effective in reducing noise annoyance, as is a significant decrease in noise level.",Noise & health,1999,India,1999,90
12349718,Correlates of child mortality in Pakistan: a hazards model analysis.,"This study investigated factors associated with child mortality in an area in Rawalpindi, one of the large cities of Pakistan. Using both demographic and anthropological methods, the research was conducted to specifically examine the process and mechanisms whereby a link is established between child mortality and its covariates. Controlling for the socioeconomic status as a determinant of child mortality, the study population was limited to a lower income stratum living in a homogeneous environment where all households had equal access to health-related and other facilities. Results of the proportional hazards model analysis on 1301 index children suggest that non-economic factors like maternal health-seeking behavior were related to high child mortality. The cultural norm of bearing a large number of children was the most significant correlate. In order of significance, this was followed by contraceptive use, current age of the mother, age at marriage, and the hygienic conditions of the household. The study provides strong evidence of familial clustering of mortality by order of the household.",Pakistan development review,1999 Spring,Pakistan,1999,90

Separate affluence and deprivation effects on illness and mortality are identified from a single-level analysis, both exceeding the influence of social class, urbanity or ethnicity. A multi-level perspective is then adopted to explore ecological associations operating both at micro-area and higher level spatial scales. Contextual effects (higher level variability in the impacts of ward level variables) are identified in the effects of small area deprivation on mortality and illness, as well as cross-level interactions; thus the impact of small area social structure on health is partly defined by the wider regional and district setting.""",International journal of population geography : IJPG,1997 Sep,England,1997,90

It is confirmed that migrants in public housing are less likely to migrate long distances than owner-occupiers and that the proportion of public housing in a SAR area, and the absolute reduction in public housing in a SAR area between 1981 and 1991, does not have a significant effect on the distance that in-migrants have moved.""",International journal of population geography : IJPG,1997 Sep,England,1997,90
12322581,Predictors of risk for sexually transmitted diseases in ninth grade urban high school students.,"This study examined risk factors associated with acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV in adolescents, using the AIDS Risk Reduction Model. The study participants were 985 students who were 54% female, ethnically/racially diverse, had a mean age of 14.7 years, and were mostly 9th graders (74%). Logistic regression was used to predict sexual experience. Linear regression was used to predict risky sexual behaviors and condom use within the previous month. The results indicate that demographic factors are associated with being sexually experienced, but few demographics are associated with specific STD-related risk behaviors. STD and AIDS knowledge are not associated with any risk behaviors. Use of alcohol and drugs is associated significantly with being sexually experienced and sexual risk. The results also indicate that peer affiliation, perceptions of peer norms, perceptions of risk, perceptions of self-efficacy, and social support are associated with STD-related risk among sexually experienced youth.",Journal of adolescent research,1999 Oct,United States,1999,90

This question is approached within the general framework of human capital theory.... A model is introduced in the form of a system of two simultaneous equations with qualitative endogenous variables. The test is based on a 1993 survey of 1,176 young rural people of seven areas of France. A main finding is that migrations of young rural people are essentially the result of professional preoccupations. However, migration is not a factor which always helps in finding a job, when people are unemployed. When a young person has a good initial training, he or she has to migrate (and leave a rural area) to get a job. Yet, migration does not seem to be necessary for less trained people.""",Environment & planning A,1999 Aug,United States,1999,90

Migration information is mainly drawn from China's 1995 1% National Population Survey....

12295915,Children as income-producing assets: the case of teen illegitimacy and government transfers.,"This paper develops a classical model of the teen fertility decision in the presence of public income transfers. The theoretical model predicts that welfare payments will encourage fertility, holding constant other economic opportunities, and that better economic opportunities will discourage fertility. Considering the possible simultaneity of illegitimacy rates and benefit levels, due to the collective choice process, the authors confirm the theoretical model's predictions with state-level data from 1980 through 1990. The authors find that including fixed effects in the regression to control for unobserved differences between states does not sufficiently control for endogeneity. After controlling for endogeneity, real welfare benefits are strongly and robustly related to teen illegitimacy. The point estimates of the elasticity with respect to changes in the illegitimacy rate are around +1.3 for White teens and +2.1 for Black teens. Real wages for women with a high school education or less are negatively related to teen illegitimacy for White teens, with an elasticity of around -0.4. Finally, male wages appear to have little effect on the illegitimacy rate for White teens but appear negatively correlated with the illegitimacy rate for Black teens in some model specifications.",Southern economic journal,1998,United States,1998,90

The analysis tests the hypothesis that the negative effect on educational attainment often associated with living in a mother-only or stepfather family stems primarily from the reduced level of economic resources available to these households. Empirical findings indicate that living with a widowed, divorced, or separated mother has little or no effect on educational attainment once we control for economic status. However, living in a stepfather family appears to have a persistent negative effect on high school graduation rates.""",Journal of population economics,1998,Germany,1998,90

This article presents a descriptive history and theoretical analysis of the migration, placing it in the context of Israel's reliance on noncitizen labor from the occupied territories. Dual labor market theory is particularly helpful in analyzing labor migration to Israel, but only by also analyzing the determinants of state policy can we understand how these recent flows began. The Israeli case thus suggests a cumulative model of the initiation of labor migration flows: structural factors create a predisposition toward use of foreign labor, and political factors determine whether and how that predisposition will be actualized.""",The International migration review,1998 Summer,United States,1998,90

The empirical strategy adopted is to apply a framework designed specifically to explain labor migration to the case of asylum migration, and the social networks approach is identified as the most appropriate. This paper examines the role of social networks through the asylum cycle, focusing on the decision to migrate, the choice of destination, and adaptation in the host society. The key conclusion is that the validity of the distinction between refugee and labor migration varies through the asylum cycle even for the same individual.""",The International migration review,1997 Fall,United States,1997,90
12224661,Development of physical activity behaviors among children and adolescents.,"Physical activity is a key component of energy balance and is promoted in children and adolescents as a lifelong positive health behavior. Understanding the potential behavioral determinants necessitates understanding influences from three fundamental areas: 1) physiologic and developmental factors, 2) environmental factors, and 3) psychological, social, and demographic factors. The literature to date has generally investigated potential predictors of physical activity in children and adolescents in each of these three general areas, although existing data rely largely on cross-sectional studies in which it is difficult to distinguish a determinant from a correlate. In all likelihood, aspects of each of these three areas interact in a multidimensional way to influence physical activity in youth.

Our main interest is in understanding the behavioral response of potential immigrants to changes in the U.S. immigration law regime (as well as in the origin-country determinants of demand for immigration to the United States) and how these affect and have affected the skill composition of immigrants.... [The authors] assembled a new data set based on annual INS records of all new, legal immigrants over the period 1972 through 1995.... Inspection of our new data indicates that since the mid 1980s the average skill of new, U.S. legal immigrants has been rising relative to that of the U.S. population. An econometric analysis of a panel of country-specific measures of the skill of immigrants based on these data over the period 1972-1992 indicates that these changes are due in part to changes in immigration law and to the overall rise in the real purchasing power of countries outside the United States.""",Working paper series (National Bureau of Economic Research),1998 Oct,United States,1998,90

A second distinguishing feature is that it utilizes a unique vector of variables relating to the presence and characteristics of various social programs in source countries. The models developed here emphasize the importance of both differential economic advantage and the ease with which a prospective migrant can transfer skills to the U.S. labor market.

Yet the development and implementation of these programs has been much too slow and, at times, inappropriate to the prison environment. Further, the effectiveness of current and proposed policies and programs must be evaluated to ensure that the goal of reducing HIV transmission is achieved. To address these issues, a team of University of Toronto researchers undertook a study entitled ""The Social and Structural Determinants of HIV-Related Risk Behaviours among Prisoners: Implications for Prevention.""

11624023,Childhood mortality and quality of care among abandoned children in nineteenth-century Italy.,"A great deal of scholarly attention has been devoted in recent years to the large-scale abandonment of new born babies in the European past, with special emphasis given to the staggering rates of infant mortality among the foundlings. For the most part, scholars have agreed with the foundling home officials of the past in assigning much of the blame for this excess mortality to the women who took in the foundlings as wetnurses and subsequently as foster mothers. This article takes issue with this view, based on an examination of the children abandoned at the foundling home of Bologna, Italy in the nineteenth century. Four cohorts of foundlings are examined - those abandoned in 1809-30, 1829-30, 1849-50, and 1869-70 (N=3615) - as we trace the changing pattern of infant and early childhood mortality.

Nursing habits were of critical importance as were diet and hygiene. It is suggested that there were differences in the frequency of breastfeeding with the landless being more and the farmers being less likely to breastfeed their children. In areas where cows milk was readily available as a substitute for breast milk other influences on infant mortality were the contamination of drinking water and the water in which feeding utensils were washed. At the end of the eighteenth century, in the south-west of Finland, the introduction of the potato created a suitable food for women and children and lowered the mortality rate of infants aged 3-6 months. By contrast, in the regions where the first solid food given to infants was chewed by the mothers, infant mortality remained high. In the part of Finland adjacent to St Petersburg infant mortality actually increased as local mothers were engaged as wet-nurses by the city's foundling hospital.",Social history of medicine : the journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine,1998 Aug,England,1998,90
11416429,Heart Failure in Elderly African-Americans.,"Heart failure has emerged as one of the most important cardiovascular diseases in the elderly and has a major functional, economic, and social impact in older individuals. Racial differences in the morbidity and mortality, as well as in rates of hospitalization, have been reported in national surveys and epidemiologic studies. Because of the higher prevalence of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in African-Americans compared to whites, these risk factors may be the principle determinants of the hemodynamic and clinical features of heart failure in African-Americans. The contribution of coronary disease with left ventricular remodeling secondary to myocardial ischemia or infarction varies among African-American populations, depending on the prevalence and impact of traditional risk factors for coronary heart disease. Atherosclerosis may play a greater role in the pathogenesis of heart failure in African-Americans as the impact of urbanization and the adoption of unhealthy lifestyles results in increased prevalence of risk factors for coronary artery disease. The hemodynamic and functional features of ventricular dysfunction in African-Americans with heart failure may range from asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction to typical systolic dysfunction. The differentiation of diastolic from systolic dysfunction, and hypertensive from ischemic cardiomyopathy, may be difficult in African-Americans and usually requires utilization of noninvasive cardiac diagnostic techniques. In addition to the type of ventricular dysfunction and the role of neurohormonal activation, consideration of age-related differences, ventricular structure and function, and variations in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics are important.",The American journal of geriatric cardiology,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90
11081011,Quality of life in systemic lupus erythematosus patients during more and less active disease states: differential contributors to mental and physical health.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants of mental and physical health as a function of disease state in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A sample of 129 SLE patients (mean age 42.01 years; SD 11.09) was recruited from 9 immunology/rheumatology clinics across Canada. Patients completed questionnaires assessing psychological distress, social support, coping, stress, and health-related quality of life. Physicians rated disease activity (using the revised Systemic Lupus Activity Measure; SLAM-R) and damage (using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index). Mental and physical health composite scores were derived from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36. Patients were subdivided into more active (SLAM-R > or = 10; n = 38) or less active disease states (n = 91). RESULTS: Better mental health was predicted by more education and less emotion-oriented coping in the patients in a more active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.46). Better mental health was predicted by less stress, less emotion-oriented coping and more task-oriented coping in patients during a less active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.45). Better physical health was predicted by more emotion-oriented coping in patients in a more active disease state (P = 0.04; R2 = 0.11). Better physical health was predicted by less stress and younger age in patients during a less active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.20). CONCLUSION: The positive association between emotion-oriented coping and better physical health in patients during a more active disease state suggests that this style of coping may be more adaptive in situations that are considered uncontrollable (e.g., SLE flare). Predictors of mental health were similar to those found in the literature, especially for SLE patients in a less active disease state.",Arthritis care and research : the official journal of the Arthritis Health Professions Association,1999 Dec,United States,1999,90

During the period 1989-1996, data were collected by annual surveys, with response rates varying from 66% to 76%. This study included 1,694 adult current smokers or persons who had quit smoking during the past year, out of a total of 6,011 respondents. Smoking cessation attempts during the past 12 months were examined as a dependent variable. Reported exposures to mass media and interpersonal health communication were examined as possible determinants of smoking cessation. Weekly exposure to mass media health messages was significantly associated with cessation attempts among men only. In contrast, interpersonal health communication, or social influence, was a significant determinant of cessation attempts among both sexes. Exposure to both mass media and interpersonal health communication had an even stronger impact on cessation attempts. Thus, interpersonal communication appears to be an important catalyst of community programs, and its inclusion should be emphasized to obtain a higher impact with community programs.",Journal of health communication,1998 Apr-Jun,United States,1998,90
10972304,Determinants of the annual pattern of reproduction in mature male merino and Suffolk sheep: modification of endogenous rhythms by photoperiod.,"In mediterranean environments, pastures are very poor during the autumn and consequently small ruminants, such as sheep, would have been losing body mass for many months so, during mating, gamete production would be depressed in both sexes. Effectively, the nutritive requirements for a photoperiod-driven, annual reproductive cycle are out of phase with seasonal changes in food availability. The problem could be overcome through more flexible timing of reproduction, perhaps explaining variations in seasonality between breeds that originate from differing latitudes. To study these concepts and the mechanisms involved, the endogenous rhythms and responses to photoperiod were compared in rams of 'mediterranean origin' (Merino) and 'temperate origin' (Suffolk). Groups of 16 rams of each breed were given a constant food supply and subjected to 16 months of constant equinoctial photoperiod (12L : 12D) or simulated 'mediterranean' changes in daylength (from 14L : 10D to 14D : 10L). With nutritional and photoperiodic inputs held constant, Merino and Suffolk rams showed similar endogenous rhythms in reproductive activity. Under constant nutritional inputs and a mediterranean photoperiodic cycle, the endogenous rhythms were modified differently in the two breeds, with the Merinos starting and finishing their seasons about 2 months earlier than the Suffolks. These observations partially explain the patterns observed in rams kept under field conditions. It is now necessary to test whether the rhythms of reproduction in these breeds are also modified by changes in nutrition and social cues.","Reproduction, fertility, and development",1999,Australia,1999,90
10933632,Variables independently associated with self-reported obesity in the European Union.,"OBJECTIVE: The rapid increase in obesity rates over recent years suggest that cultural and societal influences are affecting the adjustment in the energy balance equation in addition to other physiopathological or genetic determinants. Therefore, a pan-EU study was carried out to explore the influence of sociodemographic factors as well as some attitudes (smoking and exercise) on the prevalence of obesity in the adult population of all 15 member states of the EU. DESIGN: Overall, a sample of 15,239 individuals aged 15 years and upwards in the EU completed the questionnaire. Subject selection was quota-controlled to make the sample nationally representative following a multistage stratified cluster sampling. Self-reported height and weight were used to calculate body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: From the EU average results, it can be seen that only about half of the EU population (48%) is within the normal weight range, while the obesity (BMI > or = 30 kg m(-2)) prevalence was about 10% in the EU and the overweight prevalence was 36.6% and 25.6% among men and women, respectively. UK subjects had the highest prevalence of obesity (12%), while Italians, French and Swedes had the lowest levels of obesity (about 7%). Concerning age and social class interactions, logistic regression analysis showed that high social class and younger individuals in all groups had a lower odds ratio for obesity prevalence. People with a higher level of education are less likely to be obese, while the interaction between educational levels and obesity was different for men and women. A low participation in various leisure-time physical activities, the lack of interest (precontemplation) in being involved in exercise/physical activity and the increasing number of hours sitting down at work appear to be predictors of obesity. Single individuals were less prone to become obese than couples or widowed/divorced people. Finally, smoking status was statistically linked to the prevalence of obesity, since non-smokers or ex-smokers for more than 1 year presented a higher tendency for a BMI > 30. CONCLUSIONS: This survey confirms that a priority area for health intervention aimed at preventing the development of obesity should be to increase levels of physical activity, although the approach will depend on the population, especially with respect to educational and socioeconomic aspects.",Public health nutrition,1999 Mar,England,1999,90
10924032,The future of social medicine.,"The future of social medicine is based on 150 years of history and the rapidly evolving context within which medicine functions in modern societies. There are two views of social medicine. One is based on the vision of Guerin and, particularly, Virchow 150 years ago that: ""Doctors are the natural advocates of the poor, and social problems are largely within their jurisdiction."" The New York Academy of Medicine's Institute on Social Medicine 50 years ago reflected this broad view. Medicine, however, enamored of the biomedical paradigm and the advances in knowledge through biomedical research, largely abandoned this broad perspective, even as the knowledge about the social, behavioral, and environmental determinants of health was advancing rapidly. A second view of social medicine, and one that has influenced many in the past 30 years, was defined by McKeown and Lowe: ""Social medicine is concerned with a body of knowledge and methods of obtaining knowledge appropriate to a discipline. This discipline may be said to comprise (a) epidemiology, and (b) the study of the medical needs of society, or in the contemporary short hand medical care."" Social medicine, in my view, includes not only the definition of McKeown and Lowe, but the broader context within which medicine fits in society. The context is changing. The social contract as defined by Bismarck and Beveridge has to be redefined. Just as the New York Academy of Medicine provided the vision of social medicine 50 years ago, the Academy has given us a new vision with the publication of Medicine and Public Health: the Power of Collaboration in 1997. Authored by Dr. Roz Lasker, director of the Academy's Division of Public Health, the book identifies the key changes required by medicine and public health to advance the goals of medicine and public health for the benefit of both individual patients and the population as a whole. The book points the way for the future of social medicine by identifying not only what needs to be done, but also how to do it.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,1999 Jun,United States,1999,90
10924027,Does social medicine still matter in an era of molecular medicine?,"To ask whether social medicine still matters may seem to be in poor taste at a symposium to honor Martin Cherkasky, but social medicine has always had the courage to take on difficult questions. There is all the more reason to do so when its legitimacy is challenged. The extraordinary findings emerging from the human genome project will revolutionize diagnostic and therapeutic methods in medicine. The power of medical interventions, for good and for harm, will increase enormously. However, in the next millennium, as in this one, social factors will continue to be decisive for health status. The distribution of health and disease in human populations reflects where people live, what they eat, the work they do, the air and the water they consume, their activity, their interconnectedness with others, and the status they occupy in the social order. Virchow's aphorism is as true today as it was in 1848: ""If disease is an expression of individual life under unfavorable conditions, then epidemics must be indicative of mass disturbances of mass life."" Increasing longevity resulting from major economic transformations has made ours the age of chronic disease. Changes in diet and behavior transform genes that once conferred selective biologic advantage into health hazards. Although disease risk varies with social status, medical care makes an important difference for health outcomes. Access to care and the quality of care received are functions of social organization, the way care is financed, and political beliefs about the ""deserving"" and the ""underserving"" poor. It is a moral indictment of the US that ours is the only industrialized society without universal health care coverage. In educating the American public about the social determinants of health, a goal Martin Cherkasky championed, the very power of the new molecular biology will help make our case. Social medicine is alive and well.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,1999 Jun,United States,1999,90
10857252,Genetic and environmental influences on transitions in drug use.,"Genetic and environmental factors influence drug abuse, but abuse represents the culmination of a sequence of events. Different levels of use may have different determinants and these determinants may differ across drug types. Approximately 3200 male-male twin pairs from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry were interviewed by telephone. Data were obtained regarding exposure to six categories of illicit drugs, initiation of use, continuation of use, regular usage, and diagnosis of drug abuse/dependence. Genetic, common environmental, and unique environmental influences on transitions of drug involvement, defined as movement from one level of drug use to the next, were investigated. Marijuana had the highest conditional probability for the transition from exposure to use, from use to use more than five times, and from use more than five times to regular use. The rate of transition to regular use of heroin was higher than the rate for amphetamine, cocaine, sedatives, and psychedelics. Cocaine had the highest conditional probability for the transition from regular use to abuse/dependence. Significant genetic influences were observed for a number of transitions in marijuana, amphetamine, and cocaine usage.",Behavior genetics,1999 Nov,United States,1999,90
10857245,Genetic and social determinants of initiation and age at onset of smoking in Australian twins.,"Retrospective data on age at onset of smoking, reported by 3810 adult Australian twin pairs, were analyzed to determine the role of genetic and environmental factors in the onset of smoking. Results of nonmetric multidimensional scaling supported a two-process model in which different etiologic factors determined which individuals were at risk of becoming smokers and the age at onset of smoking in those who were at risk. Parametric model-fitting confirmed this difference. For female twins and younger male twins (aged 30 years or less), the onset of smoking was strongly influenced by genetic factors, with shared and nonshared environmental effects having a more modest impact. For older male twins, shared environmental influences on onset of smoking were very important, and the influence of genetic predisposition was slight. The age at which smoking onset occurred, however, was influenced by both genetic and nonshared environmental effects, but not by shared environmental effects, in both sexes and both cohorts.",Behavior genetics,1999 Nov,United States,1999,90
10857244,The genetics of smoking initiation and quantity smoked in Dutch adolescent and young adult twins.,"Not much is known about the genetic and environmental determinants of various aspects of substance use in adolescents. This study examined whether the inheritance of initiation of tobacco use in adolescents is independent of the inheritance of the number of cigarettes smoked. Alternative multifactorial threshold models were applied to data on tobacco use in 1676 Dutch adolescent twin pairs. The three models that were considered are (i) the single liability dimension model, (ii) the independent liability dimension model, and (iii) the combined model (CM). The results showed that there is not one underlying continuum of liability to smoking. The CM was the best-fitting model. This model postulates that there are separate initiation and quantity dimensions but allows for the possibility that there are some individuals who are so low on the liability to level of consumption that they are not using tobacco. There were no differences between males and females in the magnitude of the genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in smoking initiation and quantity smoked. Smoking initiation was influenced by genetic factors (39%) and shared environmental influences (54%). Once smoking is initiated genetic factors determine to a large extent (86%) the quantity that is smoked.",Behavior genetics,1999 Nov,United States,1999,90

10842504,Determinants of the risk and timing of alcohol and illicit drug use onset among natives and non-natives: similarities and differences in family attachment processes.,"This study examines data from Native Ontario reserve residents (Embree, 1993) and a sample from the Ontario Health Survey Supplement (1990-91) in order to compare and contrast the importance of family attributes such as parent-child attachment to Native and Non-native patterns of drug and alcohol use onset. Proportional Hazards modeling (Cox, 1972) was employed to identify factors associated with the risk and timing of onset of alcohol and illicit drugs for both cultural groups. For both Natives and Non-natives alike, and considering both drinking and drug use onset together, age cohort predominates as a risk factor, with youngest groups at greatest risk, and especially in the case of drug use other than alcohol. For the model of drug use timing, age of alcohol use onset is the second best predictor for Natives, although its effect is still apparent, albeit weaker, in the case of Non-natives. As for family characteristics, a number of factors emerge as determinants of risk and depend, in part, on the cultural group and the substance under consideration. Consistent with attachment theory's prediction about the universal applicability of the need for close parent-child relations (Bowlby, 1969), the findings for both Natives and Non-natives alike point to the salience of psychosocial attachment and other indicators of family functioning in affecting early onset drinking and drug use, behaviors well-recognized to lead to potentially adverse mental and physical health consequences as well as to negative social outcomes.",Social biology,1999 Spring-Summer,United States,1999,90
10842501,Premarital childbearing in northwest Kenya: challenging the concept of illegitimacy.,"A number of African countries, including Kenya, have experienced a marked rise in births among unmarried women. In Western countries, reproduction outside of marriage is assumed to be illegitimate and a social problem. One hypothesis used to explain the increasing incidence of premarital fertility in Africa is a breakdown of traditional social controls by the extended family over the sexual behavior of adolescents. A competing hypothesis suggests that unmarried women use sexual relations to achieve goals such as marriage. Among Turkana pastoralists of northwest Kenya, we find a pattern of premarital birth that fits either hypothesis only loosely. Premarital fertility among the Turkana is both widespread and culturally acceptable, with over 30 per cent of women having at least one child prior to marriage. Although women with premarital births initiate childbearing on average one year earlier than women with only marital births, women's marital status does not influence the length of the interval between first and second births. Marriage among the Turkana is not a social trigger for the onset and continuation of reproduction or a means to legitimate reproduction. Marital status of the parents simply determines the custody of a child. In a premarital birth, the father pays a set fee to the mother's family, and the custody of the child remains permanently with the mother's family. If the parents later marry, the father must purchase custody of the child by another fee at that time. Since the Turkana have experienced few effects of modernization, the existence of such a practice suggests that cultural factors must be taken into account before assessing premarital fertility in Africa as a social problem.",Social biology,1999 Spring-Summer,United States,1999,90
10836318,Antioxidant intake and adult-onset wheeze: a case-control study. Aberdeen WHEASE Study Group.,"An increase in prevalence of wheezing illness in the UK has coincided with a reduction in the consumption of natural antioxidants, which may modulate the lung's response to oxidant stress, limiting the expression of airway inflammation and respiratory symptoms. The hypothesis that intakes and plasma levels of natural antioxidants would be determinants of adult-onset wheezing illness was tested. A nested case-control study was conducted in 94 cases with adult-onset wheeze and 203 controls aged 39-45 yrs identified in a 30-yr follow-up survey. Antioxidant intake was measured by a food frequency questionnaire, and plasma and red cell measurements of antioxidant status were obtained. Outcome measures were onset of wheeze since age 15 yrs (ever wheeze) and wheeze occurring in the past 12 months (current wheeze). After adjusting for the effects of smoking, socioeconomic status, atopy, family history of atopic disease and total energy intake, intakes of vitamin E (odds ratio (OR) = 4.02 for low compared to high tertile of intake) and plasma levels of ascorbate (OR = 0.98 per unit) and alpha-tocopherol:triglyceride ratio (OR = 0.34 per log(e) unit) were inversely related to adult-onset wheeze. In analyses stratified by social class and smoking, intakes of vitamin C and E and plasma levels of ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol:triglyceride ratio were inversely related to current wheeze in the manual social class and among current smokers. No independent associations of vitamin A, beta-carotene or total plasma antioxidant capacity were found. The results support the hypothesis that deficiencies of vitamins C and E are associated with wheezing symptoms. Smokers in the manual social class are particularly susceptible to these effects.",The European respiratory journal,1999 Jan,England,1999,90
10817147,Social determinants of food choice.,"Food choice is influenced by a large number of factors, including social and cultural factors. One method for trying to understand the impact of these factors is through the study of attitudes. Research is described which utilizes social psychological attitude models of attitude-behaviour relationships, in particular the Theory of Planned Behaviour. This approach has shown good prediction of behaviour, but there are a number of possible extensions to this basic model which might improve its utility. One such extension is the inclusion of measures of moral concern, which have been found to be important both for the choice of genetically-modified foods and also for foods to be eaten by others. It has been found to be difficult to effect dietary change, and there are a number of insights from social psychology which might address this difficulty. One is the phenomenon of optimistic bias, where individuals believe themselves to be at less risk from various hazards than the average person. This effect has been demonstrated for nutritional risks, and this might lead individuals to take less note of health education messages. Another concern is that individuals do not always have clear-cut attitudes, but rather can be ambivalent about food and about healthy eating.

Involving the public in environmental decision making first requires a broad understanding of how and why the public perceives various risks. The Savannah River Stakeholder Study was conducted with the purpose of investigating individual, economic, and social characteristics of risk perceptions among those living near the Savannah River Nuclear Weapons Site. A number of factors were found to impact risk perceptions among those living near the site. One's estimated proximity to the site and relative river location surfaced as strong determinants of risk perceptions among SRS residents. Additionally, living in a quality neighborhood and demonstrating a willingness to accept health risks for economic gain strongly abated heightened risk perceptions.",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,1999 Dec,United States,1999,90
10730470,"[Social differences in cancer incidence, fatality, and mortality in Turin].","INTRODUCTION: The study of social differences in health is today focused on determinants. The knowledge of determinants is useful for the definition of policies to tackle inequities. The aim of this paper is to analyse the social distribution of cancer incidence, fatality and mortality in the city of Turin during the 80's and to estimate the amount of inequality produced within the health system. SOURCES OF DATA: The social distribution of the risk of death in Turin during 1981-1989, estimated from the Turin Longitudinal Study, is compared with incidence and fatality during approximately the same time period. RESULTS: Among men, the relative risks for all cancer sites, among social classes, appear to confirm the hypothesis of a multiplicative model of incidence and fatality. In particular, colo-rectal, prostatic, bladder cancers and lymphoma and leukaemia show relative risks similar to the expected ones. Cancers of larynx, lung and stomach seem to be less coherent. Among women, colon-rectum, lung, breast and lymphoma and leukaemia show coherent results, whereas relative risks for uterus are far from the expected. DISCUSSION: The coherence with the expected values of the social distribution of mortality suggests the adequacy of the multiplicative model for the provision of mortality from incidence and fatality. Therefore it is possible to state that the portion of inequality in health originated within the health system is big enough to suggest the need to put the equity in the access to health services in the agenda of interventions.",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,1999 Oct-Dec,Italy,1999,90
10728240,Correlates of drinking during the third trimester of pregnancy in Alaska.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine characteristics related to drinking during pregnancy among a population-based sample of women. METHOD: We analyzed data related to third-trimester drinking collected from the Alaska Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). PRAMS used a population-based, stratified sampling design to survey 9733 of the approximately 44,000 live births to Alaska-resident women during 1991-1994. We defined regular drinking as one or more drinks per week on average during the third trimester. Analyses included bivariate and multivariate associations with any and regular drinking. RESULTS: Of women mailed a survey, 6973 responded and answered the questions related to alcohol consumption. Nine percent reported any drinking during the third trimester and 2.5% were regular third-trimester drinkers. The strongest risk factors for both any and regular third-trimester drinking were older age and marijuana or cocaine use. Other risk factors for any third-trimester drinking included prenatal cigarette smoking, greater education, non-Alaska Native race, the experience of significant life stressors, and residence in a community that did not restrict the sale of alcohol. Other risk factors for regular third-trimester drinking included prenatal cigarette smoking and the experience of domestic violence. Prenatal counseling regarding the effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and adequacy of prenatal care were not significantly associated with either outcome variable. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to decrease prenatal alcohol consumption should be directed at older women and should address social determinants of health, such as education, domestic violence, drug use, and the availability of alcohol. In the absence of these efforts, prenatal alcohol education by health care providers may have little impact on pregnancy-related drinking.",Maternal and child health journal,1997 Sep,United States,1997,90
10724473,The social determinants of health: a contribution to the analysis of gender differences in health and illness.,"While it is established that socioeconomic status and social integration influence the distribution of health and illness among men and women, little attention has been paid to the different ways in which women and men experience socioeconomic opportunities and social attachments to others. Drawing on evidence from the literature, the position developed in this article is that gender mediates the influence of both socioeconomic status and social integration on health, and for women, these are intricately linked. Women's relationship to the labour market establishes and perpetuates their socioeconomic inequality relative to men, and may produce contradictory influences on women's health. Furthermore, for women, the marital relationship is paradoxical: marriage may at once improve economic and social support opportunities, while diminishing control over paid and unpaid work--potentially increasing as well as compromising the health status of women. The article is intended to contribute to the growing body of literature on gender and the determinants of health.",Scandinavian journal of public health,1999 Dec,Sweden,1999,90
10723646,The correspondence between intention to avoid childbearing and subsequent fertility: a prospective analysis.,"CONTEXT: Retrospective studies of pregnancy intendedness have revealed some characteristics that can help identify which women are more likely than others to experience an unintended birth. A comparison of these findings with those from a prospective analysis may shed greater light on the characteristics associated with unintended pregnancy. METHODS: Data were taken from the 1988 National Survey of Fertility Growth and a telephone reinterview of respondents conducted in 1990. Separate analyses were conducted of women intending to postpone childbearing for at least three years and of women intending to forgo all future childbearing. Logistic regression models were used to identify the effects of social and demographic characteristics, as well as change in marital status and certainty of intentions, on the odds of experiencing a birth in the interval between interviews. RESULTS: Only 10% of women intending to postpone pregnancy for more than three years and 8% of respondents seeking to forgo future childbearing had a birth in the interval between interviews. (These births, referred to as unpredicted births in this article, are roughly analogous to those labeled unintended in retrospective analyses.) Women with incomes below the poverty level were 2-3 times as likely as women with incomes between 100% and 199% of poverty to experience an unpredicted birth. Race was not a significant factor among women intending to avoid future childbearing, and became nonsignificant among those intending to postpone when change in marital status and contraceptive status were taken into account. Women aged 35 and older who wanted no more children were significantly less likely than women aged 20-29 to have an unpredicted birth. Women aged 30-34 who wanted to postpone childbearing were roughly 70% less likely than women aged 20-29 to experience an unpredicted birth. Overall, women who were at risk for a pregnancy but not practicing contraception were 2-3 times more likely than women using an effective method to have an unpredicted birth. CONCLUSIONS: There are at least two potential explanations for instances where the correlates of unintended births in the prospective analysis differ from those identified in retrospective studies. Certain subgroups of women may be more likely to classify births as wanted when they are asked retrospectively; alternatively, they may be more likely to experience changes in their living conditions that alter their fertility intentions.",Family planning perspectives,1999 Sep-Oct,United States,1999,90
10724741,Predictors of demand for emergency prehospital care: an Australian study.,"INTRODUCTION: Determining the predictors of demand for emergency prehospital care can assist ambulance services in undertaking policy and planning activities. HYPOTHESIS: Demand for prehospital care can be explained by demographic, health status, and economic determinants. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design to investigate the association of demographic, health status, and insurance factors with the use of prehospital, ambulance care. Core data items including age, gender, marital status, country of origin, triage score, diagnosis, time of presentation, method of arrival, and patient disposition were collected for every patient who presented at the Emergency Department of the study hospital over a four-month period. Ambulance usage was analysed using Poisson regression. RESULTS: For the 10,229 patients surveyed, only a small number were triaged as having the highest level of urgent medical need (0.8%), but the majority of these used prehospital emergency medical care (90.2%). Predictors of ambulance use included age > 65 years (Prevalence Ratio [PR] = 2.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.35-3.63), being married or in a de-facto relationship (PR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.60-0.79) or divorced, separated, or widowed (PR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70-0.98), triage score level 1 or 2 (PR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.68-2.28), or triage score level 3 (PR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.38-1.72), diagnosis involving either mental (PR = 4.29; 95% CI: 1.84-10.01), nervous (PR = 2.74; 95% CI: 1.19-6.31) or trauma (PR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.03-5.27) conditions, and insurance status (PR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.40-1.71). Ethnicity, gender, and time of day were not associated with usage. CONCLUSION: Demand for ambulance services can be predicted by a number of demographic, medical status, and insurance variables. Age and triage levels are key influences on demand for ambulance services. Ambulance insurance status provides an economic incentive to use ambulance services regardless of the urgency of the medical condition.",Prehospital and disaster medicine,1999 Jul-Sep,United States,1999,90
10714355,Structure-activity relationships of G protein-coupled receptors.,"The primary function of cell-surface receptors is to discriminate the specific signaling molecule or ligand from a large array of chemically diverse extracellular substances and to activate an effector signaling cascade that triggers an intracellular response and eventually a biological effect. G protein-coupled cell-surface receptors (GPCRs) mediate their intracellular actions through the activation of guanine nucleotide-binding signal-transducing proteins (G proteins), which form a diverse family of regulatory GTPases that, in the GTP-bound state, bind and activate downstream membrane-localized effectors. Hundreds of GPCRs signal through one or more of these G proteins in response to a large variety of stimuli including photons, neurotransmitters, and hormones of variable molecular structure. The mechanisms by which these ligands provoke activation of the receptor/G-protein system are highly complex and multifactorial. Knowledge and mapping of the structural determinants and requirements for optimal GPCR function are of paramount importance, not only for a better and more detailed understanding of the molecular basis of ligand action and receptor function in normal and abnormal conditions, but also for a rational design of early diagnostic and therapeutic tools that may allow exogenous regulation of receptor and G protein function in disease processes.",Archives of medical research,1999 Nov-Dec,United States,1999,90
10703183,Innovative multidisciplinary research in environmental epidemiology: the challenges and needs.,"The ability of epidemiology to determine the relationships between health and environmental insults has become exceedingly difficult. The multifactorial nature of disease and the diversity of the insults, which include biologic, physical, social and cultural factors, combined with genetic susceptibility, suggest the need to develop better models of multidisciplinary epidemiologic investigation. This paper highlights the needs of an environmental epidemiologic team, discusses ways to incorporate new ideas across disciplines and to integrate constructs and paradigms of social, ecological, cultural and population determinants with individual-based exposure assessments. Innovation will be the key to the survival and increasing importance of epidemiology in addressing the public health needs of the future, but what are the ways to enhance and encourage creativity in environmental epidemiology? The process of self-renewal and continuing education will be highlighted. Additionally, the complexity of the problems and the need for clear supervision and control of multidisciplinary research efforts require a forum of communication and an 'information-processing approach' beyond those in traditional epidemiologic studies. New approaches in data management and medical informatics must be incorporated into the epidemiologic investigative framework. Methods to be included should focus on opportunities for computer-supported sharing of ideas. Such capabilities minimise the geographic distances and the disparate knowledge and training of the investigators and bring the team closer to the objectives and functions inherent in multidisciplinary investigation.",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,1999,Poland,1999,90
10696158,[Psychosocial determinants of lithium compliance in patients with bipolar disorder].,"Physical, cognitive, and social factors play a central role in the lithium compliance of people with bipolar disorder. However, studies provide only a partial understanding of this phenomenon and there is currently no nursing model that takes into consideration a combination of factors. This study, based on Pender's preventive health beliefs model, was intended to identify the psychosocial determinants of lithium compliance. A random sample (n = 149) of outpatients at a large Montreal psychiatric hospital was used to measure lithium compliance on the basis of 5 criteria: compliance according to the nurse and according to the patient, appointment compliance, and compliance according to two criteria related to hyperuricemia. Polytomous logistic regression analyses were computed by regressing a composite of these criteria on sociodemographic variables and on the variables of the Pender model: susceptibility, seriousness, control over health, motivation to be healthy, perceived benefits and obstacles, and triggering factors. It appears that being female, being elderly, living with a partner, and perceived treatment benefits and obstacles are determining factors in lithium compliance. These results are all the more important in light of Quebec's newly implemented drug insurance plan, which could increase the obstacles to medication. Nurses will have to be increasingly vigilant with respect to these new obstacles and will have to adjust their interventions accordingly.",The Canadian journal of nursing research = Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres,1999 Sep,United States,1999,90
10686760,Achieving population health goals: perspectives on measurement and implementation from Australia.,"Health goals and targets have been widely used to indicate strategic direction and priority for health improvement on a population basis. This paper provides an overview of Australia's experience in using health targets and considers the relevance of this experience for Canada. It gives special attention to the challenge of developing a broadly based set of targets that reflect the social, economic and environmental determinants of health alongside more traditional measures of health status. It examines how the technical challenge of measurement, the bureaucratic barriers between government departments, and the political conservatism inherent in federal systems of government present formidable barriers to effective action on comprehensive national health targets. The paper concludes with a reminder of the need for inter-sectorial action to address the determinants of health. Based on the Australian experience, it suggests for Canada an ideal combination of a national population health framework to guide direction and priority, to be implemented through action at a more local level, through well-defined partnerships.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1999 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1999,90
10686756,From concept to practice: including the social determinants of health in environmental assessments.,"The present paper examines the historical evolution of health impact assessments as part of the environmental assessment process. The development of a coherent public health framework must be based on the model of determinants of health, integrating toxic and infectious risks and social impacts of projects. The integration of common concepts, processes and methodologies from the area of public health and social impact assessment challenges the quantitative model approach to risk assessment. The expert-driven risk assessment is transformed into a social learning process where local knowledge and scientific input foster a dialogue among stakeholders. The issue-oriented, iterative and participative assessment process may be applied to the health impact assessment of public policies. Sustainable development with its social objectives of empowerment, participation, equity, poverty alleviation, social cohesion, population stability and institutional development is an appropriate framework for conducting health impact assessments.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1999 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1999,90
10686755,Indicators that count! Measuring population health at the community level.,"We begin with a discussion of some vitally important conceptual and methodological issues. These issues concern our understanding of community, of health, of population health and its determinants, of the concept of 'measurement' and the values that underlie it, and our reasons for wishing to measure these constructs. We then present a framework for indicator categories, propose some criteria for indicator selection and suggest an initial set of core indicators. This indicator set reflects not simply health status--no matter how broadly defined--but also the environmental, social and economic determinants of health and the ""healthfulness"" of the community itself. Our most important conclusion is that if the information that is contained in the data of the indicator set is to be transformed into knowledge that can empower and emancipate the community, it has to be developed in consultation with the local community and local users of the information.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1999 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1999,90
10686752,Collective lifestyles as the target for health promotion.,"The last five years have witnessed intense debate among health researchers in Canada regarding the overlap of the health promotion and population health discourses. Meanwhile, strong currents within health promotion have attempted to move the field beyond a focus on individual behaviour towards the influence of social environments on health, although the tendency is often to fall back on individual behaviour modification as the primary lever for change. The Population Health research agenda bypasses behavioural determinants of health and explores instead social determinants. This body of knowledge provides useful insight for addressing some of the tensions in the health promotion discourse. This paper explores two of these tensions: whether individuals at risk or general populations should be targeted for change; and whether lifestyle is an individual or a collective attribute. We propose the notion of collective lifestyles as a heuristic for understanding the interaction between social conditions and behaviour in shaping health.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1999 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1999,90

(ii) to estimate the impact of social, economic and educational factors identified above on the likelihood of a positive decision and; (iii) to explore the policy implications of the analysis. DESIGN: Cross-sectional national household sample survey. SETTING: South African Health Inequalities Survey, 1994. SUBJECTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand three hundred and thirty three South African women aged between 16 and 64 years. INTERVENTIONS: Descriptive/inferential non-intervention study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respondent's decision to ask one's new partner to use a condom during sexual intercourse. RESULTS: The study revealed that condoms have a contraceptive benefit; AIDS epidemic is spreading rapidly across South Africa; people in ones own community are using condoms to avoid getting AIDS; and AIDS can be transmitted by having sexual intercourse with someone without using a condom were positive and statistically significant at p < or = 0.05. CONCLUSION: Equipping women with above mentioned forms of knowledge would go a long way in empowering them to exercise their rights to uncoerced choice to have safe sexual relationships.",East African medical journal,1999 Sep,Kenya,1999,90
10681904,Public policy frameworks for improving population health.,"Four conceptual frameworks provide bases for constructing comprehensive public policy strategies for improving population health within wealthy (OECD) nations. (1) Determinants of population health. There are five broad categories: genes and biology, medical care, health behaviors, the ecology of all living things, and social/societal characteristics. (2) Complex systems: Linear effects models and multiple independent effects models fail to yield results that explain satisfactorily the dynamics of population health production. A different method (complex systems modeling) is needed to select the most effective interventions to improve population health. (3) An intervention framework for population health improvement. A two-by-five grid seems useful. Most intervention strategies are either ameliorative or fundamentally corrective. The other dimension of the grid captures five general categories of interventions: child development, community development, adult self-actualization, socioeconomic well-being, and modulated hierarchical structuring. (4) Public policy development process: the process has two phases. The initial phase, in which public consensus builds and an authorizing environment evolves, progresses from values and culture to identification of the problem, knowledge development from research and experience, the unfolding of public awareness, and the setting of a national agenda. The later phase, taking policy action, begins with political engagement and progresses to interest group activation, public policy deliberation and adoption, and ultimately regulation and revision. These frameworks will be applied to help understand the 39 recommendations of the Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health, the Sir Donald Acheson Report from the United Kingdom, which is the most ambitious attempt to date to develop a comprehensive plan to improve population health.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,1999,United States,1999,90
10681885,Epidemiology of socioeconomic status and health: are determinants within countries the same as between countries?,"Within societies, health and ill-health follow a social gradient: lower socioeconomic position, worse health. The slope of the gradient has varied over time. It is likely that social and economic circumstances play a role in this changing slope. Within Europe, differences in health between East and West have also varied in magnitude. The advantage in the West increased through the 1970s and 1980s. Although similar in their health trends up to 1989, the countries of central and eastern Europe have diverged quite sharply subsequently. It is again likely that changing social and economic fortunes account for these trends. There is evidence to support the role of psychosocial factors in relating to socioeconomic differences within and between countries.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,1999,United States,1999,90
10659457,[Anxiety disorders. The variability and determinants of the therapeutic approach of primary care physicians].,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the influence of independent factors, relating to the characteristics of primary care doctors, patients and the illness, on therapeutic attitudes and their variability before anxiety disorders. DESIGN: Observational study of people attending primary care family medicine clinics who are identified as suffering anxiety disorders. SETTING: The autonomous Communities of Castilla and Leon, the Basque Country and the Valencian Community. PARTICIPANTS: 3247 patients over 18 classified by their doctors as suffering an anxiety disorder. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During 1995, 317 primary care doctors collected information from patients with anxiety disorders (CIE codes F40 and F41). The information was gathered with the same questionnaire in the three communities. The data were validated monthly before the final analysis. Women doctors gave less medical advice than male doctors (OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.36-0.65). Patients with anxiety in Castilla and Leon were at greater ""risk"" of receiving drugs treatment than those in the Basque Country (OR: 1.64, CI: 1.31-2.06). When the consultation was for any mental symptom or when the kind of anxiety was a panic disorder (OR: 2.39, CI: 1.53-3.65), phobic disorder (OR: 2.17, CI: 1.52-3.08) or mixed anxiety disorder (OR: 2.20, CI: 1.77-2.73), patients were more likely to be referred for specialist treatment. If it was decided to prescribe drugs treatment, women doctors used more often than their male colleagues a mixed treatment with anti-depressants, anxiolytic drugs and drugs for psychosis (OR: 1.60, CI: 160-4.28). Castilla and Leon, and the Valencian Community were less likely to use mixed treatment than the Basque Country reference group. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the variability in the difficulties encountered in diagnosis and finding a common standard of conduct for primary care doctors faced with patients suffering anxiety disorders. Although the treatment used for anxiety can be considered adequate in most cases, there is high variability, which depends mainly on the type and other characteristics of the process, the patient and the professional.",Atencion primaria,1999 Dec,Spain,1999,90
10656104,Determinants of self rated health for Canadians with chronic disease and disability.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with self rated health of people with and without chronic health conditions or long term disability. SETTING: Canadian household population. DESIGN: Analysis of 1994/95 National Population Health Survey interview data with 13,995 respondents aged 20 years and older. Determinants of poor and good compared with excellent health were examined using multivariate nominal logistic regression. Factors included in the analyses were illness related (chronic disease, long and short-term disability, and pain) demographic, lifestyle (smoking, physical activity, drinking), and social psychological resources (mastery, chronic stress, distress, self esteem, and social support). RESULTS: Illness related variables were associated with poor health, with smaller but significant contributions from demographic and lifestyle factors. Psychological resources, especially high mastery and self esteem, are associated with better health in those with chronic conditions or disability. CONCLUSION: The determinants of self rated health for people with chronic illness and disability make the greatest contribution to the findings for the overall population.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1999 Nov,England,1999,90
10656467,Dietary questions as determinants of mortality: the OXCHECK experience.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether responses to simple dietary questions are associated with specific causes of death. DESIGN: Self-reported frequency intakes of various classes of foods and data on confounding factors were collected at the baseline survey. Death notifications up to 31 December 1997 were ascertained from the Office for National Statistics. Relative risk (RR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with baseline dietary factors were calculated by Cox regression. SETTING: Prospective follow-up study based on five UK general practices. SUBJECTS: Data were used from 11,090 men and women aged 35-64 years (81% of the eligible patient population) who responded to a postal questionnaire in 1989. RESULTS: After 9 years of follow-up, 598 deaths were recorded, 514 of these among the 10,522 subjects with no previous history of angina. All-cause mortality was positively associated with age, smoking and low social class, as expected. Among the dietary variables, all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in participants who reported relatively high consumption of vegetables, puddings, cakes, biscuits and sweets, fresh or frozen red meat (but not processed meat), among those who reported using polyunsaturated spreads and among moderate alcohol drinkers. These associations were broadly similar for deaths from ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cancer and all other causes combined, and were not greatly attenuated by adjusting for potential confounding factors including social class. CONCLUSIONS: Responses to simple questions about nutrition were associated with mortality. These findings must be interpreted with caution since residual confounding by dietary and lifestyle factors may underlie the associations.",Public health nutrition,1999 Dec,England,1999,90
10653046,Patient factors and compliance with asthma therapy.,"Compliance by patients to prescribed treatment regimens can be considered as the interface between effective therapy and effective disease management. Compliance can be affected by the nature of the relationship between the practitioner and the patient, and their attitudes towards each other. It has also been suggested that practitioner behaviour can influence patient behaviour and health status. However, each individual patient is influenced in his or her attitudes, and reactions to disease and its management, by a wide variety of patient-related factors. These include psychological variables such as mood, beliefs, and the knowledge, motivation and ability of the patient. Social factors may also play a role: these include age, marital and socioeconomic status and level of education. Results from a range of studies in patients with pulmonary or other diseases show that the psychosocial determinants of compliance are only poorly understood, and suggest that compliance cannot be predicted from patients' health status and that social factors are weak indicators only. Furthermore, it appears from available data that patients' beliefs about health issues are not as useful as indicators of likely compliance as was previously believed.",Respiratory medicine,1999 Dec,England,1999,90
10650681,Predictors of use of traditional Korean healers among elderly Koreans in Los Angeles.,"Many ethnic groups are known to use traditional healers often in conjunction with Western biomedical medicine, thus combining treatment regimens and medical advice as they see fit. Awareness of the use of traditional healers is an increasingly salient issue due to the growing diversity and aging of the U.S. population. To explore the determinants of use of traditional healers, we studied demographics, health status, and social support networks of a representative sample of elderly Koreans in Los Angeles County, California. The results revealed that chronic conditions such as arthritis, lung disease, and stomach pain, fewer depressive symptoms, availability of health insurance, and stronger social networks were significant predictors of use of traditional healers. Better understanding reasons for and patterns of health care use may enhance the delivery of care to the heterogeneous elderly population by preventing potential treatment complications and increasing health providers' cultural sensitivity.",The Gerontologist,1999 Dec,United States,1999,90
10647902,Inheritance of heart rate variability: the kibbutzim family study.,"Heart rate variability (HRV) measures are associated with coronary heart disease incidence and mortality. Therefore insight into the genetic and environmental determinants of these measures may have clinical relevance. We assessed the role of genetic and environmental factors of time domain and frequency domain HRV indices. Participants were 451 kibbutz members, aged 15 and up, belonging to 80 families. HRV indices were calculated from Holter recordings measured over 5 min. Our data indicate that for the two time- and four frequency domain indices, a mixture of two normal distributions fit the data significantly better than a single normal distribution (P<0.05). We used complex segregation analysis to infer the modes of inheritance of these HRV measures. We found evidence for possible involvement of a recessive major gene in the inheritance of the root mean square of successive differences in RR intervals (RMSSD), which is predominantly vagally mediated. A putative major gene explains 28%-34% of the adjusted inter-individual variability. The SD, determined by a mixture of mechanisms, is influenced by environmental and polygenic effects, but not by a major gene. The findings regarding the heritability of the frequency domain indices were not conclusive. However, the involvement of genetic factors was not rejected. Additional studies in extended families are needed to confirm the involvement of major genes in the determination of the autonomic activity.",Human genetics,1999 Dec,Germany,1999,90

10641810,Primordial prevention: the path from Victoria to Catalonia.,"Primordial prevention seeks to prevent future disease by influencing its social determinants. Henry Blackburn's writings are prime portrayals of social factors causing premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). His classic paper, Diet and Mass Hyperlipidemia, identified changes needed in professional attitudes, medical economics, food production, food labeling, and food advertising. The 1982 WHO report, Coronary Heart Disease (Blackburn, rapporteur), introduced the term ""primordial prevention,"" starting a cycle of initiatives, all with considerable influence worldwide. He participated in the now widely disseminated Victoria Declaration on Heart Health (1992), which contained 64 policy recommendations, many focussing on broad social forces that influence modern CVD epidemics. The path he initiated led to the Catalonia Declaration: Investing in Heart Health (1996), which echoed many of his pleas for resources necessary to influence CVD rates. Some roots of CVD's recent decline in many countries are thus clearly attributable to Blackburn's prescient wisdom and visionary scholarship.",Preventive medicine,1999 Dec,United States,1999,90
10633741,Causes of strain affecting relatives of Swedish oldest elderly. A population-based study.,"We examined determinants of carer strain in a random sample of 170 relative of dependent elderly persons in Sweden aged 80 years or more. These persons were interviewed at home by means of the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). Carer strain was assessed in interviews with carers who bore the main responsibility for care of an elderly relative. The response rate was 92%. Multiple logistic regression showed that cohabitation of carer and recipient was the sociodemographic variable most significantly associated with various stress factors and consequences or manifestations of stress; strain connected with ADL assistance given to the elderly person, strain arising from the elderly person's uncooperative or recalcitrant attitude or behaviour, worsening of the elderly-carer relationship, and encroachment on the carer's social life. Correlations between strain and various categories of physical and mental impairment were much lower, and in some respects were even negative. We conclude that support programs for relatives caring for dependent elderly persons should aim primarily at creating continuous relief for the carers and improving their opportunities for contact with other people generally.",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,1999,Sweden,1999,90
10633211,Public health research: between science and action?,"In this text, we first propose a concept of public health research as a multidisciplinary endeavor whose aim is to identify the main determinants of people's health status, analyzed at the collective level. The public's health is thus envisioned as a socially determined reality, in which risk factors include biological phenomena as well as a given community's social and economic environment. Second, we argue that public health research should be applicable research, i.e. that it should be useful to decision-makers.

METHODS: A cohort of 1797 pregnant women who attended antenatal care clinics at the two 700 bed hospitals in Hatyai city was recruited from September 1994 to November 1995. The pregnant women were followed up from the 17th week of gestation until delivery. The socioeconomic indicators selected were family socioeconomic status, maternal education, maternal occupation, family income and work exposure characteristics based upon Karasek's job content questionnaires. Pregnancy outcomes were birth weight, low birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm delivery. MAIN RESULTS: Mean birth weight correlated with socioeconomic status and income but after adjustment for parity, maternal age and height, weight at delivery day, baby sex, obstetrical complications and antenatal care utilisation, only family income remained correlated with birth weight. No association with any socioeconomic status indicators was found when using dichotomous outcome (low birth weight, small for gestational age or preterm delivery). Only high psychological job demand was associated with small for gestational age. Confounder adjustment indicated that the observed social status differences in pregnancy outcomes were mainly attributable to mother's characteristics and antenatal service use. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic indicators alone were not associated with reduced fetal growth or preterm delivery in this study, which recruited mainly lower or middle class women. Karasek's psychological job demand was only weakly correlated with small for gestational age infant.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1999 Oct,England,1999,90
10615570,The social class determinants of income inequality and social cohesion.,"The authors argue that Wilkinson's model omits important variables (social class) that make it vulnerable to biases due to model mis-specification. Furthermore, the culture of inequality hypothesis unnecessarily ""psychopathologizes"" the relatively deprived while omitting social determinants of disease related to production (environmental and occupational hazards) and the capacity of the relatively deprived for collective action. In addition, the hypothesis that being ""disrespected"" is a fundamental determinant of violence has already been refuted. Shying away from social mechanisms such as exploitation, workplace domination, or classist ideology might avoid conflict but reduce the income inequality model to a set of useful, but simple and wanting associations. Using a nonrecursive structural equation model that tests for reciprocal effects, the authors show that working-class position is negatively associated with social cohesion but positively associated with union membership. Thus, current indicators of social cohesion use middle-class standards for collective action that working-class communities are unlikely to meet. An erroneous characterization of working-class communities as noncohesive could be used to justify paternalistic or punitive social policies. These criticisms should not detract from an acknowledgment of Wilkinson's investigations as a leading empirical contribution to reviving social epidemiology at the end of the century.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1999,United States,1999,90
10609591,The social determinants of emergency department and hospital use by injection drug users in Canada.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and human immunodeficiency (HIV) status of a cohort of injection drug users (IDUs) on their self-reported health service utilization. DESIGN: Interviewer-administered questionnaire. METHODS: IDUs who had injected illicit drugs within the previous month were recruited through street outreach. They underwent serology for HIV-1 and questionnaires on demographics, drug using behaviors, housing status, and health service utilization (hospitalization overnight and emergency department visits) in the previous 6 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent associations with the use of health services. RESULTS: Of 1,103 cohort participants, 65% were male, 63% were white, and 23% were HIV positive. Cocaine was the most frequently injected drug used. Almost half (47%) had used health services in the previous 6 months. The following variables were associated independently with health service utilization (adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval): unstable housing, defined as living primarily in a hotel, boarding room, or transition house or on the street in the past 6 months (1.44; 1.11-1.86); female gender (1.45; 1.11-1.89); HIV-positive status (1.43; 1.06-1.92); injection of cocaine (1.50; 1.12-2.02); and primary care I physician visit in past 6 months (1.91; 1.39-2.64). CONCLUSION: IDUs with unstable housing were more likely to report emergency department and hospital use, which may be a reflection of their disorganized lifestyle or poorer health status. Further studies are required to assess the effect on the health status and health care use of IDUs of interventions that increase the availability of safe, affordable housing.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,1999 Dec,United States,1999,90
10606101,"Goal orientations, beliefs about success, and performance improvement among young elite Dutch soccer players.","Extending past work testing goal perspective theory in sport, one purpose of this study was to examine, via a longitudinal design, the relationship of goal orientations to the beliefs about the causes of success in the case of elite male Dutch soccer players. A second purpose was to determine the relationship of goals and beliefs to ratings of performance. Seventy-five male pupils representing five teams from an internationally renowned soccer school in The Netherlands completed the TEOSQ and a measure of their perceptions of the determinants of success in soccer at the onset and conclusion of one season. Assessments of the coaches' appraisal and athletes' self-reported performance in soccer were carried out at the same time. In line with other studies, a positive association between ego orientation and the belief that ability or innate talent are determinants of success was revealed. Task orientation was linked to the beliefs that effort, team play, and parental support contribute to achievement in soccer. An increase in skilled performance over the season (as appraised by the coach) corresponded to a stronger task orientation and the beliefs that soccer success stems from hard work and having supportive parents.",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,1999 Dec,Denmark,1999,90
10605254,"[Social differences and indicators of perceived health, chronic diseases, disability and life style in the 1994. ISTAT national health interview survey].","In this paper social differences in health, analysed by different dimensions (perceived health, chronic diseases, functional deficits and disability) and social differences in lifestyle, in particular smoking habit and use of health services for the prevention of some female tumours, are described. The study is based on the data collected in the National Interview Survey on Health Status and Use of Health Care Services, conducted by ISTAT in the 1994. The analysis has been performed separately for males and females, computing Prevalence Rate Ratios (PRR) standardized by age. Educational level and social class, based on Schizzerotto's classification, have been used as determinants of differences in health and lifestyle. Unfavourable perception of health status and most of chronic diseases, referred as diagnosed by a doctor, show an increasing prevalence with decreasing educational level. Less striking differences are observed in the occurrence of injuries and in the restriction of daily life activities caused by diseases. A lower educational level corresponds to a regular increase in the proportion of disabled subjects. Females show higher differences than males in overweight and underweight prevalences in favour of more educated. Smoking habit shows an inverse correlation with education in males and a direct correlation in females, while attempts to quit smoking are more common among more educated individuals. Among women, the tendency to use screening tests for the prevention of some tumours is directly proportional to the educational level. Similar findings were obtained using the social class, with small bourgeoisie and working class showing similar excess risks, compared to bourgeoisie. This study found significant social inequalities in health status and in lifestyle in Italian population in 1994. The discussion argues that in absence of preventive interventions on disadvantaged groups of the population an increase of social differences in health is predictable.",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,1999 Jul-Sep,Italy,1999,90

The census data allow an evaluation of socio-economic status of each subject, using variables such as education or occupation, or constructing indexes inclusive of deprivation indexes. Follow-up is from the census up to 1995 and for specific causes of death from 1987 (Leghorn) or 1991 (Florence). Estimates of risk are computed comparing rates of mortality among socio-economic groups, by means of poisson regression models, or by means of Standardized Mortality Ratios using the indirect method. The causes of deaths have been selected mainly because explained by known and strong determinants. As far as overall mortality, the results suggest the persistence of gradients by social class, more often negative among males. Mortality from lung cancer has a strong negative social class gradient among males, and a divergent gradient among women in the two towns, which is interpreted as the effect of a different prevalence of smoking by period, social class and sex. High RRs among lower socio-economic groups have been detected for liver cirrhosis mortality. Excess mortality of AIDS and overdose, an expression of the recent drug crisis, concentrates on the lower social strata and in young adults. Whereas mortality from AIDS has been detected among both sexes, deaths from overdose are occurring among males only. Being AIDS and overdose recent diseases, they stress the persistence of social inequalities over time.",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,1999 Jul-Sep,Italy,1999,90

DATA AND METHOD: Cross-sectional population survey including questions on social background, body-height and health, and retrospective questions on childhood living conditions. The data derive from a representative Survey on Living Conditions collected by Statistics Finland in 1994. The response rate was 73%. Male and female respondents > or =20 years were included in the analysis (N = 8212). Statistical methods include regression analysis and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Body-height was strongly associated with year of birth, region, childhood living conditions and education among adult men and women. Body-height was also associated with limiting long-standing illness and perceived health as below good. Tall men had the best health and short men the poorest health. Among women the association of body-height with health differed from men, as tall women showed high levels of limiting long-standing illness, notably musculo-skeletal diseases. Adjusting for the background variables weakened but did not abolish the association between poor health and short stature among men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Short stature is associated with poor health among Finnish men and women. A non-linear association among women was found for musculo-skeletal diseases. The studied social background factors explained only little of the association between body-height and health.",International journal of epidemiology,1999 Oct,England,1999,90
10597987,Risk factors for the incidence of hyperuricaemia: a 6-year longitudinal study of middle-aged Japanese men.,"BACKGROUND: Few longitudinal studies on the determinants of increase in serum uric acid (SUA) have been completed. METHODS: In all, 1445 hyperuricaemia-free (<7.5 mg/dl SUA, no medication for and no past history of hyperuricaemia) male office workers aged 30-54 years of T Corporation in Osaka, Japan were re-examined for six successive years. Subjects who were found to be hyperuricaemic or had started medication for hyperuricaemia during repeat surveys were defined as incident cases. RESULTS: Among the subjects (n = 1365) not receiving medication for hypertension, diabetes mellitus or renal disease, multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model indicated that the incidence of hyperuricaemia had significant relationships with body mass index (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.13 for a 2 kg/m2 increase; 95% CI: 1.02-1.26), mean blood pressure (HR = 1.07 for a 5 mmHg increase; 95% CI: 1.00-1.13), log triglyceride level (HR = 2.21 for a 10 mg/dl increase; 95% CI: 1.12-4.37), alcohol intake (HR = 2.33 for drinking 46.0 g of ethanol per day or more relative to non-drinking; 95% CI: 1.55-3.50) and smoking (HR = 0.65 for current-smoking relative to non-smoking; 95% CI: 0.46-0.92). Age (HR = 0.89 for a 5-year increase; 95% CI: 0.78-1.00) and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (HR = 0.89 for a 0.5% increase; 95% CI: 0.78-1.00) achieved marginal significance. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, high blood pressure, high triglyceride level, and alcohol intake are contributory factors for the development of hyperuricaemia among middle-aged Japanese men.

The dynamic nature of the American identity is first presented, along with implications for differential health status. Next discussed are emerging paradigms in research and intervention that incorporate the dynamic nature of the American identity as both an explanation and an opportunity for remedy of health status disparities.

Each of the above factors of an individual's social situation was described by a 4-level scale. Each factor was found to exert a highly significant residual effect on stature throughout the three decades considered, even after the effects of other correlated factors were partialed out by three-factor ANOVA. However, the stratifying force of each factor, as expressed by the dispersal of the level-specific main effects around the national mean, has been changing over time. For example, the growth-stunting effect of the condition of coming from a large sibship was dramatic in the 1965 cohort and considerably attenuated in 1986 but ceased to diminish thereafter. The growth-enhancing effect of the condition of being a large-city dweller, initially marked, has almost disappeared; but the growth-stunting effect of the condition of being a rural dweller has remained equally strong across all cohorts. These and other shifts in the relative importance of the social factors, as presumed determinants of family living standards, are described and some explanations attempted.",Journal of biosocial science,1999 Oct,England,1999,90
10578802,Determinants of the breastfeeding pattern among working women in Sao Paulo.,"The needs of breastfeeding women who work away from home differ from those of other women, particularly those who breastfeed exclusively. Sixty-nine factory workers were interviewed in Sao Paulo, both during pregnancy and when they returned to work. Median durations of exclusive (EBF), predominant (PBF), and any breastfeeding (BF) were found to be 10 days, 70 days, and 150 days, respectively. Despite having used the 4-month leave to which they were entitled, by 1 month, 86% of the respondents had given tea, 50% water, and 42% artificial baby milk. Only 2 women were still exclusively breastfeeding when they returned to work. Various personal characteristics were associated with longer duration of breastfeeding. Maternity ward routines were generally not supportive, but duration of PBF was longer where better support was received. Duration of EBF was longer among women with support for breastfeeding at work, and shorter for those working on weekends or doing shift work. Thus, women may have adjusted their feeding patterns based on whether or not they anticipated workplace support. Only weekend work and socioeconomic status were linked to shorter duration of breastfeeding. Stronger social and health care support for EBF may be needed before the full impact of workplace support can be usefully studied in Brazil.",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,1999 Sep,United States,1999,90
10479365,Social determinants of reproductive failure in male common marmosets housed with their natal family.,"Postpubertal male common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, engage in little or no sexual behaviour while living with their natal families. The social mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been identified but have been assumed to include reproductive suppression by dominant males and/or avoidance of mating with closely related females. We evaluated these two possible components of male reproductive failure. Seven postpubertal males and their fathers underwent a series of 45-min sex tests, in which the son, the father, or the son and father together were allowed to interact freely with the mother/mate or with an unfamiliar, unrelated adult female. We measured testosterone, luteinizing hormone and cortisol concentrations in blood samples collected from males immediately following each test, and in basal blood samples collected on three different occasions. Sons, but not fathers, engaged in very low rates of sexual behaviour when tested with the mother/mate. When tested with unrelated females, however, sons engaged in significantly more sexual behaviour than they had when tested with their mothers and showed no differences from their fathers. When sons and fathers were tested together, both males performed significantly less sexual behaviour than when tested alone with a female; however, they showed no overt competition for females and engaged in little agonism. Hormone levels did not differ significantly between fathers and sons. These results indicate that avoidance of mating with familiar females and possibly father-son competition, but not specific, rank-related suppression, contribute to reproductive failure among postpubertal male marmosets living with their natal family.

10573234,Prevalence of respiratory and atopic disorders among children in the East and West of Germany five years after unification.,"Living conditions in eastern Germany have changed rapidly since unification in 1990 and little is known about how these changes affect the prevalence of atopic diseases. This study describes methods and prevalences of a large epidemiological project investigating determinants of childhood asthma and allergies in eastern (Dresden and Leipzig) and western (Munich) Germany in 1995/1996. Community based random samples of 9-11 yr old children in Dresden (n=3,017) and Munich (n=2,612), and of 5-7 yr old children in Dresden (n=3,300), Leipzig (n=3,167) and Munich (n=2,165) were studied by parental questionnaires, bronchial challenges with hypertonic saline, skin examination, skin-prick tests, and measurements of specific and total serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E using Phase II modules of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). In 9-11 yr old children, the prevalence of physician diagnosed asthma (7.9% versus 10.3%; p<0.01) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (15.7% versus 19.9%; p<0.05) was lower in Dresden than in Munich. No difference between Munich and Dresden was observed in the prevalence of diagnosed hay fever, skin test reactivity to > or = 1 allergen, and increased levels (>0.35 kU x L(-1)) of specific IgE against inhalant and food allergens. Symptoms and visible signs of atopic eczema tended to be more prevalent in Dresden. Similar East-West differences between the three study areas were seen in the younger age group. These findings are in line with recently observed increases in the prevalence of hay fever and atopic sensitization, but not of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, among 9-11 yr old children in Leipzig.",The European respiratory journal,1999 Oct,England,1999,90
10565967,[Satisfaction with primary medical care: population determinants].,"OBJECTIVES: To study the level of satisfaction with the family physician in the general population, and to evaluate the influence of characteristics of the individual and the available health care services. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey with a representative sample of 1,505 beneficiaries of the Social Security, older than one year, from the city of Matar inverted question marko (Barcelona). A questionnaire, administered by home interview, examined the socio-demographic situation, health status, health care organizations and services used and the preferences and knowledge in relation to them. Satisfaction was measured on the scale of Hulka BS et al. developed at Andalusian primary care centres. RESULTS: Satisfaction with the family physician had, on a scale from 0 to 100, a mean score of 61.3 (standard deviation, 13.5) points. The main determinant of satisfaction was the model of primary care, users of non-reformed centres being less satisfied. It was followed by better knowledge of ambulatory services, age and better attitudes towards primary care, which were positively related to satisfaction. Indicators of health care accessibility and continuity, as well as the number of medical visits fulfilled, the subject's main activity and their level of health were also independent determinants of satisfaction. The explained satisfaction's variation was 38.98%. CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with family physician is a complex and multifactorial behaviour which is under constant change due to the interrelation of the individual with his social and health care environment.",Gaceta sanitaria,1999 Sep-Oct,Spain,1999,90
10564848,"[Determinants of quitting smoking in Catalonia, Spain].","OBJECTIVE: While trends in the prevalence of smoking and ex-smoking in Catalonia, Spain have been monitored, the characteristics of those smokers who quit have not been investigated. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the prevalence of cessation, or quit ratio, in Catalonia and to study its sociodemographic, life-style, and smoking correlates. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data collected in the Catalan Health Interview Survey conducted in 1994. This is a cross-sectional study based on a representative sample of the non-institutionalized population of Catalonia. We included for analysis a total of 5,424 subjects (3,649 males and 1,775 females) who declared to be current smokers (2,335 males and 1,331 females) or past smokers (1,314 males and 444 females). We computed the crude and age-standardized quit ratios (QR) or prevalence of cessation, as well as the odds ratio (OR) of quitting smoking, according to gender and the variables studied. RESULTS: The age-standardized QR was 31. 8% for males and 30.9% for females and increased with age. The QR was, both in males and females, greater among married subjects, with higher socioeconomic status, and with healthy life-styles (moderate and heavy leisure physical activity and moderate alcohol consumption). The OR of quitting smoking was higher in heavy smokers (OR = 2.9; 95% CI: 2.2-3.8; smokers of > 30 cigarettes/day vs. 1-10 cigarettes/day) in males, while it was < 1 for females of medium intensity, conforming a shaped curve rather than a linear trend (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.0-2.9, in heavy smokers). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a positive association in males and females between quitting smoking and increasing age, a higher socioeconomic level, heavy smoking, and healthy life-styles. The identification of these groups should facilitate the planning of successful interventions. Further effort is also necessary to target groups with low cessation rates, such as individuals in disadvantaged social classes and light smokers.",Gaceta sanitaria,1999 Sep-Oct,Spain,1999,90
10568246,"[Differential indicators of loneliness among elderly. The importance of type of partner relationship, partner history, health, socioeconomic status and social relations].","Using data from the 1992 NESTOR-survey 'Living arrangements and social networks of older adults' (N = 4494), the aim of the present study is to identify specific categories of older adults who are most vulnerable to loneliness. By looking at different types of partner relationships (first, second, and third marriages; consensual unions; partners who are not household members) and at partner histories (never married, ever divorced, ever widowed, remarried), this study elaborates on previous research which has tended to look only at the presence versus the absence of partner relationships. Findings indicate that different types of partner relationships provide differential protection against loneliness. There appears to be a 'shadow of the past' of a previous divorce or widowhood in second and third partnerships, which accounts for generally higher levels of loneliness. Single men tend to be more lonely than single women. Moreover, there are no differences in loneliness between men who have always been single and those previously married. Among single women, differences in partner history are relevant: never married single women tend to be least vulnerable to loneliness. The differences in loneliness between older adults with different types of partner relationships and partner histories are only partially attributable to network and social participation differences. The latter independently contribute to the explanation of loneliness. The role of non-social determinants (health and socioeconomic position) is also examined. The results underscore the socially isolating effects of sensory impairments. Older adults with functional limitations, and those with visual or auditory problems tend to be more lonely, findings which are only partially attributable to differences in the number and quality of social relationships. Socioeconomic circumstances primarily have an indirect influence on loneliness. Those with higher levels of educational attainment and higher incomes tend to have more extensive social networks and are therefore less prone to loneliness.",Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie,1999 Oct,Netherlands,1999,90
10567490,Clinical and radiological determinants of prestroke cognitive decline in a stroke cohort.,"OBJECTIVES: Stroke seems to be related to dementia more often than previously assumed and vascular factors are also related to Alzheimer's disease. The pathophysiology of poststroke dementia includes ischaemic changes in the brain, a combination of degenerative and vascular changes, and changes only related to Alzheimer's disease. Some cognitive decline recognised after a stroke may be due to pre-existing cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and radiological determinants of prestroke cognitive decline. METHODS: The study group comprised 337 of 486 consecutive patients aged 55 to 85 years who 3 months after ischaemic stroke completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery; structured medical, neurological, and mental status examination; interview of a knowledgeable informant containing structured questions on abnormality in the cognitive functions; assessment of social functions before the index stroke; and MRI. RESULTS: Frequency of prestroke cognitive decline including that of dementia was 9.2% (31/337). The patients with prestroke cognitive decline were older, more often had less than 6 years of education, and had history of previous stroke. Vascular risk factors did not differ significantly between these two groups. White matter changes (p=0.004), cortical entorhinal, hippocampal, and medial temporal atrophy (p<0.001), cortical frontal atrophy (p=0.008); and any central atrophy (p<0.01), but not the frequencies or volumes of old, silent, or all infarcts on MRI differentiated those with and without prestroke cognitive decline. The correlates of prestroke cognitive decline in logistic regression analysis were medial temporal cortical atrophy (odds ratio (OR) 7.5, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 3.2-18.2), history of previous ischaemic stroke (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.8-10.6), and education (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: History of previous stroke, but not volumes or frequencies was found to correlate with prestroke cognitive decline. Other associating factors were rather those usually associated with degenerative dementia: white matter changes and cerebral atrophy; and in multiple models medial temporal cortical atrophy and education. The possible overlap between two or more underlying diseases must be remembered in diagnosis and treatment of patients with vascular cognitive impairment.","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",1999 Dec,England,1999,90
10565506,Clinical determinants of suicidal ideation and behavior in geriatric depression.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to find clinical characteristics that can identify elderly patients with depression at risk for suicidal ideation and to determine their prognosis. METHOD: Suicidal ideation, past suicidal behavior, severity of depression, cognitive impairment, medical burden, disability, and social support were studied in 354 patients with depression aged 61 to 93 years. The patients had in-person evaluations every 6 months and telephone evaluations for a mean of 1.8 years (SD, 2.2). RESULTS: During the index episode, suicidal ideation was predicted by previous suicide attempts with serious intent (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-5.80), severity of depression (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16), and poor social support (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.18-2.65). Suicide attempts during the year prior to entry were reported by patients with a severe index episode (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00-1.11), impaired instrumental activities of daily living (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.93), and limited impairment in activities of daily living (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.10-2.14). At the initial evaluation, severity of depression, previous attempts, and seriousness of suicidal intent during previous attempts predicted the course of suicidal ideation (concordance correlation, 0.78). During follow-up, contemporaneous severity of depression was the most important determinant of suicidal ideation over time (concordance correlation, 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly individuals with severe depression, history of suicide attempts with serious intent, and poor social support are most likely to have suicidal ideation and should be targeted for appropriate interventions. Severity of depression is the strongest predictor of the course of suicidal ideation.",Archives of general psychiatry,1999 Nov,United States,1999,90
10563479,Genetic and environmental sources of QT interval variability in Israeli families: the kibbutz settlements family study.,"QT interval prolongation not attributed to long QT syndromes is reported to be associated with increased risk of sudden and nonsudden cardiac death. Genetic and environmental determinants of QTc interval were investigated in an unselected free living population sample of 80 kindreds residing in kibbutz settlements in Israel. The sample included 214 males and 227 females aged 15-97 years. There was a significant familial aggregation of adjusted QT interval levels, as indicated by inter- and intraclass correlation coefficients significantly different from zero. Complex segregation analysis applied to the sex- and age-adjusted data was not conclusive and heterogeneous etiologies for individual differences were suggested. There was evidence for a single recessive locus (q = 0.173) with a major effect in addition to polygenic effects (h2 = 0.41) that explained the mixture of distributions. In parallel, a nontransmitted environmental major factor in addition to polygenic effects that explained the adjusted variation in QTc could not be rejected. Similar results were obtained upon the adjustment for sex, age, and environmental covariables. The major factor, either genetic or environmental, and polygenic-loci accounted for about 20 and 33% of the adjusted QTc variation, respectively. Furthermore, sex, age, measured environmental covariables, the unmeasured major factor, and the unmeasured polygenes could account for 63% of the variation of QTc in these families. Our data provide evidence for a major factor, either genetic or environmental, in addition to a polygenic background, influencing QT interval levels in a population-based sample of pedigrees.",Clinical genetics,1999 Sep,Denmark,1999,90
10560326,Social cognitive theory of gender development and differentiation.,"Human differentiation on the basis of gender is a fundamental phenomenon that affects virtually every aspect of people's daily lives. This article presents the social cognitive theory of gender role development and functioning. It specifies how gender conceptions are constructed from the complex mix of experiences and how they operate in concert with motivational and self-regulatory mechanisms to guide gender-linked conduct throughout the life course. The theory integrates psychological and sociostructural determinants within a unified conceptual structure. In this theoretical perspective, gender conceptions and roles are the product of a broad network of social influences operating interdependently in a variety of societal subsystems.

People contribute to their self-development and bring about social changes that define and structure gender relationships through their agentic actions within the interrelated systems of influence.",Psychological review,1999 Oct,United States,1999,90
10558403,The law and the public's health: a study of infectious disease law in the United States.,"Law plays crucial roles in the field of public health, from defining the power and jurisdiction of health agencies, to influencing the social norms that shape individual behavior. Despite its importance, public health law has been neglected. Over a decade ago, the Institute of Medicine issued a report lamenting the state of public health administration, generally, and calling, in particular, for a revision of public health statutes. The Article examines the current state of public health law. To help create the conditions in which people can be healthy, public health law must reflect an understanding of how public health agencies work to promote health, as well as the political and social contexts in which these agencies operate. The authors first discuss three prevailing ways in which the determinants of health are conceptualized, and the political and social problems each model tends to create for public health efforts. The analysis then turns to the core functions of public health, emphasizing how law furthers public health work. The Article reports the results of a fifty-state survey of communicable disease control law, revealing that few states have systematically reformed their laws to reflect contemporary medical and legal developments. The Article concludes with specific guidelines for law reform.",Columbia law review,1999 Jan,United States,1999,90

This article proposes a model of customer expectations of service recovery in health care services. The model discusses two types of service recovery expectations: will and should. An exploratory study indicates that industry reputation and personal experiences drive customers' ""will-expectations"" of service recovery while ""should-expectations"" can be explained via norm, fairness, social contract and hospitality theories.",Quality management in health care,1999 Summer,United States,1999,90
10557202,Mental health of the Canadian population: a comprehensive analysis.,"This study examines eight measures of mental health and looks for associations with nine potential demographic and psychosocial determinants. Data from the National Population Health Survey (NPHS), analyzed by logistic regression, reveal consistently strong, graded, independent associations of current stress, social support, life events, education and childhood traumas with both positive and negative indicators of mental health status. Sex differences exist for four of eight measures. For most indicators, mental health is relatively poor among youth and improves with age. Physical and mental health problems are associated. There is no independent relation between mental health and income adequacy or province of residence. Two measures used in several previous Canadian surveys are recommended for inclusion in the NPHS to better monitor population mental health.",Chronic diseases in Canada,1999,Canada,1999,90
10542467,[Factors associated to the trial of labor in primipara women with one previous cesarean section].,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify medical and non-medical factors associated to the performance of a trial of labor during the second delivery of women with one previous cesarean section. METHODS: This was a nested case control study, with a secondary data analysis from a retrospective population based cohort study. It was primarily performed on a population of women who had had their first children in Campinas, SP, Brazil, during 1985. The study population was constituted of the 1,352 women of the cohort study who had had their first deliveries by cesarean section and also had their second deliveries no matter when. The group of cases (333 women, almost 25%) was constituted of those women who had a trial of labor during their second deliveries and the control group (1,019 women) of those who had not had it. For each possible associated factor evaluated, the Odds Ratio and its respective 95% Confidence Interval were calculated. For the ordered categorical variables, the chi2 for trend was also calculated. Finally, a non conditional multivariate regression analysis was performed, identifying the significant factors and then estimating their adjusted Odds Ratio. RESULTS: The main factors associated with the trial of labor in this situation were a low monthly family income, having public medical insurance by the national health system, a low maternal age, the occurrence of rupture of membranes during the second delivery, and having been in childbirth during the first delivery. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the main determinants for a trial of labor among primipara women with one previous cesarean section were basically social and economic factors, rather than medical ones.",Revista de saude publica,1999 Aug,Brazil,1999,90
10548637,The effect of reproductive history on future pregnancy outcomes.,"The aim of this study was to examine the separate and joint effects of previous pregnancy history, year of pregnancy outcome, maternal age, height, smoking and fertility on risk of fetal death. Data were available from a study of female radiographers. Analyses were carried out on 3053 women with a total of 6993 pregnancies. Women reporting problems with conception or previous fetal losses had an increased risk of a pregnancy ending in a fetal death. In particular, women with primary or secondary infertility had an approximately fourfold increase in risk compared with women who reported no difficulties [odds ratio (OR): 3.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): (3.02, 5.07)]. This relationship was independent of pregnancy order and pregnancy history and was more marked in older maternal ages. The effect of pregnancy history was cumulative and possibly multiplicative in effect, with a threefold increase in the risk of losing a third pregnancy following two previous losses [OR: 3.19; 95% CI: (1.60, 6.35)]. There were no consistent patterns of risk associated with year of pregnancy outcome, maternal age, height or smoking status. These results suggest that previous pregnancy outcomes and problems with conception may be the strongest determinants of fetal loss in subsequent pregnancies.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",1999 Nov,England,1999,90
10548444,Prevalence and determinants of alcohol-related problems.,"In this study, we sought to determine what factors, in addition to alcohol consumption, were the best predictors of social and physical alcohol-related problems. Variables examined as possible predictors of problems included circumstances under which people drink, feelings of alienation, and religious affiliation. Data for this study were collected continually from 1984 to 1989 using a random telephone survey of 2094 New York State residents aged 18 or older; the study sample was comprised of the 1076 who had consumed alcohol in the previous 30 days. Stepwise regression analyses examined the main effects of all possible predictors of problems while controlling for alcohol consumption. Forced-entry regressions examined interaction effects of problem predictors while controlling for basic demographics. Drinking with breakfast, smoking marijuana, and drinking in bars alone were all significant predictors of more problems. This suggests that problems are associated with an aberrant lifestyle (i.e., different from a typical lifestyle), although it makes no assumption about motivations. Further investigation of this subject area is warranted to ascertain which population subgroups are the most vulnerable to alcohol-related problems and to guide the design of prevention programs.",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,1999 Nov,England,1999,90
10548077,Primary and secondary barriers to physically active healthy lifestyles for adults with learning disabilities.,"PURPOSE: Evidence shows that those with a learning disability are typically amongst the most inactive and sedentary members of the population, yet few studies have focused on the determinants of physical activity. The aim of the present study was to establish whether a group of 24 adults with mild and moderate learning disabilities receive adequate support to be able to make choices to lead a physically active lifestyle. METHOD: A descriptive study was used based on interviews with 24 adults with learning disabilities (mean age of 34 years) triangulated by day time and residential care workers. Participants volunteered from two residential homes and one social education centre (SEC) in a city in the North of England. RESULTS: The participants face a set of primary barriers that prevent them from having a choice to adopt the Department of Health's recommendations for physical activity. Identified barriers included: unclear policy guidelines in residential and day service provision together with resourcing, transport and staffing constraints; participant income and expenditure; and limited options for physically active community leisure. CONCLUSIONS: These are barriers that are widely acknowledged and understood by day and residential staff and participants in the study, but are arguably poorly understood by policy makers, health promotion agencies, commissioners and providers of learning disability services. The current lack of resources and inadequately specified responsibilities associated with community care deny many people with learning disabilities real choices to live a physically active healthy lifestyle.",Disability and rehabilitation,1999 Sep,England,1999,90
10547144,Cognitive functioning and health as determinants of mortality in an older population.,"The authors studied whether the ability of cognitive functioning to predict mortality is pervasive or specific, and they considered the role of health in the cognition-mortality association. Data were taken from a sample of 2,380 persons aged 55-85 years who took part in the Netherlands' Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam in 1992-1993. Five cognitive measures were distinguished: general cognitive functioning, information processing speed, fluid intelligence, learning, and proportion retained. Mortality data were obtained during an average follow-up period of 1,215 days. Cox proportional hazards regression models revealed that all cognitive functions predicted mortality independent of age, sex, education, and depressive symptoms. When health (self-rated health, medication use, physical performance, functional limitations, lung function, specific chronic diseases) was also taken into account, information processing speed, fluid intelligence, and proportion retained remained independent predictors of mortality, whereas the ability of general cognitive functioning and learning to determine mortality was lost. The authors concluded that the ability of cognitive functioning to predict mortality is pervasive to all cognitive functions that were included in the study when age, sex, education, and depressive symptoms are considered and is more specific to some functions when also controlling for health.",American journal of epidemiology,1999 Nov 1,United States,1999,90
10547056,Sociocultural determinants of physical activity among children.,"BACKGROUND: This study explores underresearched sociocultural predictors of children's physical activity and fitness, with particular attention paid to the influence of ethnicity independent from potential confounders such as social class. METHODS: Utilizing a 1997/1998 cross-sectional sample of 107 children (ranging in age from 6.5 to 13 years, mean = 10 years) participating in a longitudinal study of childhood obesity in Birmingham, Alabama, predictors of television viewing, vigorous exercise, habitual physical activity, exercise in school P.E. classes, sports team participation, and maximal aerobic capacity were identified, utilizing multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: The results indicated few ethnic differences in childhood physical activity once characteristics such as social class and single vs dual parent family background were controlled for. Specific multivariate findings included higher levels of television viewing and vigorous exercise among children from single parent homes; lower habitual physical activity among girls; less P.E. exercise among African Americans and children from single parent homes; higher sports team participation among older yet physically immature children; and higher physical fitness among boys, Caucasians, physically mature children, and children from single parent homes. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the multidimensional nature of childhood physical activity and the influence of sociocultural factors on children's activity patterns.",Preventive medicine,1999 Oct,United States,1999,90

However, the level of adaptive behaviour was shown to be lower in subjects with dementia, and in those with lower levels of cognitive functioning, as measured on a rating instrument, the Test for Severe Impairment. Although the presence of aggressive behaviours is not higher in subjects with dementia and DS on cross-sectional review, it remains to be seen whether aggression will increase in individual cases with the onset or progression of dementia. The decline in adaptive behaviour shown in the present study confirms the findings of previous studies and indicates a direction for service development for persons with the dual diagnosis of dementia and DS.",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,1999 Oct,England,1999,90
10546786,Attaining higher goals in HIV treatment: the central importance of adherence.,"In recent years, advances in HIV therapeutics have changed the nature of HIV/AIDS disease, so that it has now assumed some of the characteristics of a 'chronic' disease. Several factors have, however, qualified these advances. Social, economic, and clinical variables have confounded universal therapeutic success. Access to the highly active antiretroviral therapy is limited among marginalized populations, such as the homeless, or absent in many nations that have poor resources. In addition, study populations are often not fully representative of those actually cared for in clinical practice, who may respond differently to the study medications. Moreover, physiologic differences between patients may alter drug plasma levels, resulting in varying efficacy levels in different patients. Finally, and crucial among determinants of effective therapy, is a patient's level of adherence to the antiretroviral regimen. The magnitude of 'error-prone' viral replication makes resistance to antiretroviral agents invariable. In the presence of partially suppressive therapy, viral replication will select for viral variants with resistance mutations. Therefore, potent and continuous suppressive therapy for the duration of viral replicative capability is necessary for therapy to be effective. Factors that have an impact on adherence include characteristics of the treatment regimen, of patients and clinicians, and of the clinical setting. Successful adherence to therapeutic regimens is the responsibility of clinicians as well as patients. Many patient- and clinician-focused strategies and interventions that can improve adherence exist. The simplification of current antiviral regimens, without the loss of potency, is essential to achieving the goal of complete adherence. Maximizing the long-term benefit of highly active antiretroviral therapy requires knowledge of the technical and biologic aspects of HIV therapeutics, but necessitates an understanding of the behavioral aspects of therapeutics as well.","AIDS (London, England)",1999 Sep,England,1999,90
10536390,The importance of social science research in protecting adolescents' sexual and reproductive choice.,"This paper reviews the ways in which social science research findings can influence action in the areas of reproductive health and rights. Essentially, social science research: (a) establishes the levels and patterns of behaviours, attitudes or perceptions; (b) explores factors underlying these behaviours, attitudes and perceptions; (c) explains programme and organisational impediments constraining, in practice, the exercise of informed choices or the acquisition of preventive and curative services; (d) monitors the extent to which interventions have been successful in modifying behaviours, attitudes or perceptions, and (e) facilitates an understanding of the policy, social and legal arenas that impinge on the determinants and consequences of reproductive choice. Findings highlight possible courses for legal, policy or programmatic interventions. Such research has enormous relevance for our understanding of reproductive and sexual health, and the health-seeking choices that women and men--from adolescent to adult--make in various settings, the constraints they face in making these choices, and the kinds of interventions that might enhance choices given the prevailing sociocultural context. Focusing on adolescent sexual and reproductive health and choice, the paper concludes that social science research findings are fundamental for informing efforts to protect reproductive rights.",Medicine and law,1999,United States,1999,90
10532676,Obesity is an environmental issue.,Obesity is an environmental issue. Societies that are transitioning to westernized lifestyles are experiencing substantial increases in its prevalence. The primary environmental determinants of obesity are high calorie intake and low levels of activity. Socioeconomic status and place of residence are important contributors. These factors together comprise an obesogenic or 'toxic' environment where the development of obesity is the expected course for humans leading lifestyles incompatible with their evolutionary development. Only by addressing and modifying the toxic environment will we be able to stem the obesity epidemic.,Atherosclerosis,1999 Oct,Ireland,1999,90
10532625,Neurodevelopmental processes and psychological functioning in autism.,"Autism is a developmental disorder with variable severity, occurring at all levels of cognitive ability and having a number of slightly different clinical presentations. It is associated with neuropsychological deficits that occur in other conditions also, but its pattern may be specific to autism. Genetic and environmental early insults to brain development are etiological determinants of the disorder. Brain circuitries important for social, communicative, and integrational purposes have been suggested to be dysfunctional in autism. There could be at least two different pathways to autism, one connected with primary temporofrontal dysfunction (and late prenatal-early postnatal origins) and another linked to primary brain-stem dysfunction (and early prenatal origins). Further study of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychological processes in autism will help elucidate not only the pathological mechanisms involved in the specific syndromes but also the underpinnings of normal brain development.",Development and psychopathology,1999 Summer,United States,1999,90
10530425,Public preferences regarding rabies-prevention policies in the UK.,"The current 6-month quarantine system for all cats and dogs entering the UK has kept the UK rabies-free since 1922. However, pressure is mounting for a change to a system of vaccination, microchip identification and serological testing. In response to the increasing controversy surrounding the quarantine system, the UK government recently set up an independent review panel to assess the alternatives. This paper quantifies public preferences for the current policy and three alternative rabies-prevention measures. A survey was used not only to assess the overall preferences for rabies-prevention policies but also to assess the importance of policy attributes and socio-economic characteristics in determining policy preferences. We interviewed a sample of pet-owners in North Yorkshire. The results showed that the existing system was the single most-preferred policy option. However, a large proportion of the sample preferred the vaccination-based policies. A logistic-regression model and ordered probit models were used to find that safety and animal welfare were the most-important factors determining policy preferences. The respondents' awareness of the rabies-policy review, a desire to take a pet abroad, the amount of foreign travel, occupation and previous experience of quarantine were all important factors in policy choice. Socio-economic characteristics such as income, pets owned and the number of children were not significant determinants of policy preference.",Preventive veterinary medicine,1999 Aug 23,Netherlands,1999,90
10528955,Social determinants of GHQ score by postal survey.,"BACKGROUND: To develop interventions to reduce the morbidity associated with depression and anxiety, more information is needed about the social and demographic determinants of these disorders and the relative contributions of different potential predictors. METHODS: Using stratified sampling from the Family Health Services Authority (FHSA) register, postal surveys were sent to 61,000 adults across the North Western Regional Health Authority. Psychological morbidity was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Nine potential predictors of morbidity were rated, including socio-demographic details and the presence of longstanding limiting physical illness and of a confidante. Logistic regression analyses were used to consider each of the nine potential predictors separately and in combination. RESULTS: A total of 38,014 questionnaires were returned (63 per cent). After adjustment for all other variables the strongest predictors of a high GHQ score were the absence of a confidante (odds ratio (OR) 3.64), longstanding limiting physical illness (OR 2.93), unemployment (OR 1.91), being a student (OR 1.78), being female (OR 1.64), single parenthood (OR 1.55) and living alone (OR 1.32). GHQ scores were highest in the 18-34 age range. Ethnicity exerted no significant effect after adjustment for other variables. CONCLUSION: In keeping with other research the data suggest that sociodemographic factors are strong predictors of depression and anxiety. The most vulnerable population groups are those with longstanding limiting physical illness and no-one to talk to. This should help in identifying high-risk individuals and informing preventive strategies.",Journal of public health medicine,1999 Sep,England,1999,90
10520684,Do people value their own future health differently from others' future health?,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether time preferences for own health are the same as time preferences for others' health. A random sample of the general public was sent a postal questionnaire containing six choices between ill health in the near future and ill health in the further future. They were asked to indicate the maximum duration of more distant ill health they would be willing to accept in return for a specified delay in the onset of the period of ill health. For half of the sample the questions were set in the context of their own health and for the other half in terms of others' health. The median implied discount rates were not statistically different, 0.061 for own health and 0.062 for others' health. A multilevel analysis of the determinants of these implied discount rates provided additional evidence of the similarity of time preferences for own health and others' health.",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,1999 Oct-Dec,United States,1999,90
10519460,Psychosocial predictors of delay of first sexual intercourse by adolescents.,"This investigation predicted adolescents' delay of intercourse onset from attitudes, social norms, and self-efficacy about refraining from sexual intercourse. Age, gender, ethnicity, and parental education were also examined as predictors and moderators of the relationships among the 3 psychosocial determinants and onset. The participants (N = 827), part of a cohort initially surveyed in the 9th grade, reported at baseline that they had never engaged in intercourse. The multivariable proportional hazards regression model suggested that adolescents with more positive attitudinal and normative beliefs, as well as those with a parent who graduated from college, were less likely to engage in intercourse in the follow-up period (up to approximately 2 years). Interventions that include an objective to delay onset may benefit from addressing psychosocial determinants, especially attitudes and norms about sexual intercourse.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1999 Sep,United States,1999,90
10515309,Pharmacological and environmental determinants of relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior.,"Animal models have been developed that simulate relevant features of relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior in humans. These models have provided valuable information about pharmacological and environmental factors that precipitate reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking in rats and monkeys, as well as new insights about potential pharmacotherapies for relapse prevention. Reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior in animals can be induced by cocaine priming or by cocaine-paired environmental stimuli: however, maximum reinstatement of drug-seeking appears to be induced when cocaine priming and cocaine-paired stimuli are combined. Drugs that share cocaine's indirect dopamine agonist properties or that act as direct agonists at D2-like dopamine receptors also induce reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, whereas with some exceptions (e.g., caffeine, morphine) drugs from other pharmacological classes do not. D1-like receptor agonists block rather than mimic the priming effects of cocaine, suggesting different roles for D1- and D2-like receptor mechanisms in cocaine relapse. Although considerable overlap exists, drugs that exhibit cocaine-like discriminative stimulus and/ or reinforcing effects in other situations do not invariably induce cocaine-like reinstatement of drug-seeking and vice versa, implying that these effects are not simply different behavioral expressions of a unitary neurobiological process. Finally, recent findings with D1-like receptor agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists suggest that some of these drugs may be viable candidates for development as antirelapse pharmacotherapies.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",1999 Oct,United States,1999,90
10514157,Relation between income inequality and mortality: empirical demonstration.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which observed associations at population level between income inequality and mortality are statistical artefacts. DESIGN: Indirect ""what if"" simulation by using observed risks of mortality at individual level as a function of income to construct hypothetical state level mortality specific for age and sex as if the statistical artefact argument were 100% correct. SETTING: Data from the 1990 census for the 50 US states plus Washington, DC, were used for population distributions by age, sex, state, and income range; data disaggregated by age, sex, and state from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used for mortality; and regressions from the national longitudinal mortality study were used for the individual level relation between income and risk of mortality. RESULTS: Hypothetical mortality, while correlated with inequality (as implied by the logic of the statistical artefact argument), showed a weaker association with states' levels of income inequality than the observed mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations in the United States at the state level between income inequality and mortality cannot be entirely or substantially explained as statistical artefacts of an underlying individual level relation between income and mortality. There remains an important association between income inequality and mortality at state level over and above anything that could be accounted for by any statistical artefact. This result reinforces the need to consider a broad range of factors, including the social milieu, as fundamental determinants of health.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1999 Oct 9,England,1999,90
10512426,Fibrinogen and factor VII levels are related to adiposity but not to fetal growth or social class in children aged 10-11 years.,"Factors operating in fetal life or during childhood may be important in determining fibrinogen and factor VII concentrations in adult life, and particularly in explaining social gradients in cardiovascular disease risk. In 1994, the authors measured fibrinogen and factor VIIc levels in 641 children aged 10-11 years (61% response rate) from schools in five towns in England and Wales. Birth weight was obtained by maternal recall, and other data on measures of fetal growth were obtained from birth records. Fibrinogen levels were higher in girls (258.8 mg/dl) than in boys (245.4 mg/dl) (95% confidence interval (CI) for difference: 5.5, 21.5). Fibrinogen and factor VIIc levels were linearly related to adiposity, rising by 37.1 mg/dl (95% CI: 24.7, 49.5) and 13.0% of standard (95% CI: 6.3, 19.7), respectively, between the bottom and top quintiles of ponderal index (weight (kg)/height (m)3). Fibrinogen was independently related to heart rate (p < 0.001) and was negatively but nonsignificantly related to measures of physical activity. Factor VIIc was positively correlated with total cholesterol (p < 0.001). No relations were found with measures of fetal growth or social class. These data do not support the concept that fibrinogen or factor VII levels are determined in utero or by social factors in childhood. Adiposity and physical training appear to be the important determinants of fibrinogen and factor VII levels in childhood.",American journal of epidemiology,1999 Oct 1,United States,1999,90

Those who survive are robbed of a healthy body, a sound intellect, and the hope for healthful living. Despite its global toll malnutrition is given limited attention by the world community; hence, it is generally viewed as a silent emergency by advocacy organizations.

22478325,Statistical inference in behavior analysis: Environmental determinants?,"Use of inferential statistics should be based on the experimental question, the nature of the design, and the nature of the data. A hallmark of single-subject designs is that such statistics should not be required to determine whether the data answer the experimental question. Yet inferential statistics are being included more often in papers that purport to present data relevant to the behavior of individual organisms. The reasons for this too often seem to be extrinsic to the experimental analysis of behavior. They include lapses in experimental design and social pressure from colleagues who are unfamiliar with single-subject research. Regardless of whether inferential statistics are used, behavior analysts need to be sophisticated about experimental design and inferential statistics. Such sophistication not only will enhance design and analysis of behavioral experiments, but also will make behavior analysts more persuasive in presenting rationales for the use or nonuse of inferential statistics to the larger scientific community.",The Behavior analyst,1999 Fall,Switzerland,1999,90

METHOD: Data on 1,379 individuals undergoing psychiatric evaluation in eight emergency rooms in a region of central Italy were collected. A logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the likelihood of psychiatric admission considering the independent effects of demographic, social, and clinical factors and of the history of psychiatric treatment. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for psychiatric admission significantly increased with the following variables: severity of symptoms; presence of paranoid states and schizophrenic psychoses, affective psychoses and acute psychotic conditions (with neurotic disorders used as reference); a history of outpatient treatment; the presence of a staff member of a community mental health facility upon presentation at the emergency room; and the availability of beds in the psychiatric ward. CONCLUSION: The independent effect played by the presence of a staff member of a community mental health facility is of particular interest, suggesting the existence of a collaborative relationship between inpatient and outpatient services.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1999 Aug,Germany,1999,90
10499138,Physical exercise and quality of life following cancer diagnosis: a literature review.,"With almost 8 million Americans alive today who have been through the cancer experience, it is important to develop interventions to maintain quality of life (QOL) following cancer diagnosis. Physical exercise is an intervention that may address the broad range of QOL issues following cancer diagnosis including physical, functional, psychological, emotional, and social well-being. The purpose of the present article was to provide a comprehensive and critical review of the topic and to offer suggestions for future research. The review located 24 empirical studies published between 1980 and 1997. Eighteen of the studies were interventions (i.e. quasi-experimental or experimental) but most of these were preliminary efficacy studies that suffered from the common limitations of such designs. Overall, however, the studies have consistently demonstrated that physical exercise has a positive effect on QOL following cancer diagnosis, including physical and functional well-being (e.g. functional capacity, muscular strength, body composition, nausea, fatigue) and psychological and emotional well-being (e.g. personality functioning, mood states, self-esteem, and QOL). Besides overcoming the limitations of past research, recommendations for future research included: (a) extending the research beyond breast and early-stage cancers; (b) comparing and integrating physical exercise with other QOL interventions; (c) examining resistance exercises, the timing of the intervention, and contextual factors; (d) expanding the breadth of the QOL indicators examined; and (e) investigating the rates and determinants of recruitment and adherence to an exercise program following cancer diagnosis.",Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,1999 Spring,England,1999,90

However, economic factors are not the only determinants of a safe work environment. Worker's perception of health and safety also influence compliance with safety guidelines. This study was conducted to determine the attitude and practice of laboratory workers with regard to safety. A structured questionnaire was administered to laboratory workers in 10 clinical laboratories. The questionnaire inquired about the use of protective equipment, safe work practices and immunization status of workers. Another questionnaire sought information on safety codes, accident records and first aid facilities in each laboratory. Questionnaires were coded and analysed. Ninety out of 106 laboratory workers (85%) responded to the inquiry. Unsafe work practices such as eating or drinking in laboratories and mouth pipetting of biological samples were practised by 41% and 10% of workers, respectively. Ninety percent of workers used white coats while 64% used gloves when handling biological samples. None of these workers used goggles or face shields in the course of their work. Fifty-one percent had received immunisation against tuberculosis, 73% against tetanus and 16% against hepatitis B. Thirty-seven percent of senior staff and 72% of junior staff did not receive any formal safety training. Accident records and first aid facilities were absent in most laboratories. The commonest health problem reported by workers was low back pain. The poor coverage of hepatitis B immunization among health care workers in an endemic area is currently a cause for concern among medical and paramedical staff. There is a need for education programmes to increase awareness on safety. Occupational health workers in this setting face the challenge of promoting safe work practices among workers in the face of the lack of funding and apathy among poorly paid junior workers.",African journal of medicine and medical sciences,1998 Sep-Dec,Nigeria,1998,90
10495577,Determinants of frail elders' lengths of stay in meals on wheels.,"Home-delivered meal programs such as Meals on Wheels are low-cost long-term care services that have potential for contributing to the delay of costly institutionalization and to the maintenance of self-sufficiency and quality of life among community-dwelling frail elders. In this study, reasons for elders' termination from a Meals on Wheels program and determinants of their lengths of stay in the program are analyzed. The findings show that the reasons for elders' termination are largely associated with their deteriorating health. But it was also found that a significantly higher proportion of African American elders than White elders discontinued their participation due to their dissatisfaction with the meals offered or their poor appetite. The Cox proportional hazard regression analysis also confirmed that elders' health status, race, and appetite are significantly associated with the hazard of elders' termination. Strategies to improve the acceptability of the services are discussed.",The Gerontologist,1999 Aug,United States,1999,90
10492734,Determinants of self assessed health among Spanish older people living at home.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To identify the main determinants of self assessed health among community dwelling elderly. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A representative sample of 677 people aged 65 and over of the city of Madrid, Spain. DESIGN: Cross sectional study. Information was collected through personal interviews at the homes of the selected subjects. The five category dependent variable was grouped into two categories: good and poor self assessed health. Age, sex, social class, use of physician services, number of chronic conditions, and functional capacity, were included as main explanatory factors. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated through multiple logistic regression models. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 49.5% of subjects rated their health as good or very good. Those aged 85 and over rated their health higher than those aged 65-74 (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.37; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.18, 0.77). The adjusted OR for an increase of three chronic conditions was 3.48 (95% CI: 2.49, 4.85). Functional capacity also showed a strong independent effect (OR: 3.64; 95% CI: 1.89, 7.02). Social class was one of the main determinants for the youngest group, with those in the upper class reporting a better health perception (OR: 3.28 95% CI: 1.70, 6.35), but showed no effect in the oldest old (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.57, 1.96). CONCLUSIONS: Age, chronic conditions, and functional status were the main determinants of perceived health among Spanish elderly. The effect of social class on perceived health markedly decreases with age. This study may contribute to a better utilisation and interpretation of self ratings in research and in general practice.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1999 Jul,England,1999,90
10490776,Anthropometric and psychosocial determinants of visceral obesity in healthy postmenopausal women.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the best predictor among waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), weight and body mass index (BMI) of visceral obesity across 8.5-10.8 y. We also examined whether changes in waist across the study period co-occur with changes in psychosocial distress or quality of life, and tested whether action levels of waist (level 1 < 80 cm, level 1-2: 80-87.9 cm, level 2 > or = 88 cm) differentiate between women with varying levels of psychosocial distress and quality of life. SUBJECTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was determined by computerized-tomography at the L4-L5 disc space, and waist circumference, WHR, weight and BMI by anthropometric techniques in a population-based sample of postmenopausal Healthy Women Study participants. Psychosocial distress and quality of life were assessed by standardized tests of personality and behavior. The n varied from 120-345, depending on the research question. RESULTS: Waist circumference was superior over the other anthropometric measures in predicting VAT accounting for 40.1-63.5% of the variance in VAT over the study period (P < 0.001). Associations between symptoms of depression, anxiety or distress, low levels of social support or impaired quality of life with waist circumference were cross-sectional (P < 0.04), with lower levels of distress and less impaired daily functioning being characteristic to women at the action level 1 relative to levels 1-2 or 2. Increasing anger over time was associated longitudinally with increasing waist circumference (P < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Identification of healthy women with large waist circumferences is important for prevention and intervention of poor quality of life and chronic disease.",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,1999 Aug,England,1999,90
10482073,Teaching social inequalities in health: barriers and opportunities.,"This article examines some of the main threats and new opportunities encountered by teachers of social inequalities in health in contemporary academia. Focusing mostly on the recent US and European experiences, I suggest that lay world views legitimating social inequalities are often in conflict with explanations arising from social epidemiology and medical sociology. The dominance of medicine in public health, through its often implicit assumptions about the biological determinants of human behaviour, is also identified as a barrier to teaching social inequalities in health. Educational elitism, which restricts higher education to members of the upper middle class, is identified as another barrier to teaching social inequalities in health. On the other hand, teachers in this field can benefit from a recent growth of empirical studies during the last decade aimed at understanding the social determinants of health inequalities. Finally, I suggest that familiarity with current critical scholarship within public health, as well as the use of techniques developed by sociologists to teach social stratification, can be valuable resources for teaching social inequalities in health.",Scandinavian journal of public health,1999 Sep,Sweden,1999,90
10480698,Low birthweight and prematurity in relation to paternal factors: a study of recurrence.,"BACKGROUND: The importance of paternal determinants in the occurrence of low birthweight and prematurity is not well known. We investigated these outcomes in siblings and paternal half siblings as a function of changes in putative external determinants between two births in fathers who had experienced the birth of a premature and/or low birthweight (PTB/LBW) infant. METHODS: All fathers who, between 1980 and 1992, had an infant born before 37 completed weeks' gestation or weighing <2500 g and a following child were studied. We identified 14 147 pairs of siblings from Danish national registers. The recurrence risk was studied in three sub-cohorts defined by the outcome in the index child (PTB only, PTB/LBW, LBW only). We estimated the recurrence risk in the younger sibling according to changes of female partner, municipality type, occupation, and father's social status. RESULTS: The overall recurrence risk was 16.7% for preterm delivery and 16.8% for LBW. Changing female partner was, as expected, associated with a reduction in the recurrence risk for both outcomes (RR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.27-0.60 for preterm delivery and RR = 0.38; 95% CI : 0.26-0.56 for LBW). None of the other studied factors was associated with changes in the recurrence risk. Fathers who changed partner had offspring with similar birthweight and gestational length between the three sub-cohorts, while a difference was evident in offspring to fathers whose female partner was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify any paternal factor of importance in the occurrence of LBW and preterm delivery.",International journal of epidemiology,1999 Aug,England,1999,90
10477860,[Length of work disability and associated factors].,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the mean length of temporary work disability (TD) and to assess some of its possible determinants. METHODS: During 1995, we registered 12,570 cases of TD among people from the Inspection Area of Alcala of Henares. We obtained a random sample of 600 cases. In addition to TD length, we obtained information about patients' sociodemographic characteristics, social security group, diagnosis, and type of primary care. Analysis of variance was used to compare means and Cox regression models were used to estimate risk ratios for factors influencing return to work. RESULTS: The mean and the median of the TD were 44.5 and 11 days respectively. The TD length was less than one month in 72.9% of the cases. The TD length was similar in both sexes and showed a positive association with age (p=0.0002). The General group had higher TD length than the Insalud group and lower than the Autonomous and Housework groups. The Insalud personnel showed an adjusted relative effect (and 95% confidence intervals) in the probability of returning to work of 2 (1.07-3.73) compared to the General group. The adjusted relative risk was 0.89 (0.88-0.90) for an increase of 5 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The most important factors in the TD length were age and social security group. The improvement in the health system accessibility is one of the factors that may positively affect the probability of returning to work.",Gaceta sanitaria,1999 May-Jun,Spain,1999,90
10475862,Effect of immobilization on vitamin D status and bone mass in chronically hospitalized disabled stroke patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of immobilization upon vitamin D status and bone mass in chronically hospitalized, disabled, elderly patients following stroke. DESIGN: cross-sectional study. SETTING: Department of geriatric neurology in a Japanese hospital. SUBJECTS: 129 chronically hospitalized, disabled, elderly stroke patients and 28 age-matched controls. RESULTS: We observed a deficiency of both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-[OH]2D; 24.3 pg/ml) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (25-OHD; 11.7 ng/ml) in stroke patients compared with controls. A high serum ionized calcium (mean; 2.648 mEq/l) was an independent determinant of the Barthel index (66) and 1,25-[OH]2D. When the patients were categorized into three groups by 25-OHD level (deficient, insufficient and sufficient), there was no difference in the mean 1,25-[OH]2D levels. Parathyroid hormone levels were normal or low and did not correlate with 25-OHD. Serum bone turnover variables and bone mineral density (BMD) of the second metacarpal in patients were significantly decreased compared to control subjects. Independent determinants of BMD included Barthel index, 25-OHD and 1,25-[OH]2D. CONCLUSIONS: 1,25-[OH]2D deficiency in immobilized stroke patients is not caused by substrate (25-OHD) deficiency but by hypercalcaemia. Immobilization-induced hypercalcaemia may inhibit parathyroid hormone secretion and thus 1,25-[OH]2D production, resulting in decreased BMD. Immobilization itself also may be responsible for decreased BMD. Exogenous 1,25-[OH]2D (calcitriol) rather than dietary vitamin D supplementation may be required in disabled elderly stroke patients who have a deficiency of 1,25-[OH]2D in order to prevent hip fractures, which frequently occur in this population.",Age and ageing,1999 May,England,1999,90
10472279,Trends in teenage pregnancy in England and Wales: how can we explain them?,"Teenage pregnancy is associated with adverse social and physical outcomes for both mother and child. We drew on various sources--birth and abortion statistics from the Office for National Statistics, data from the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, and routinely collected data from family planning clinics--to identify trends in England and Wales and their possible determinants. The rate of teenage sexual activity has increased steadily and consistently over the past four decades, whilst the rate of teenage fertility has shown greater variation. When the teenage fertility rate is calculated against the denominator of sexually active women, rather than the total sample of teenage women, the underlying trend in teenage fertility over the past four decades has been downwards, though not consistently so. Fluctuations in the teenage fertility rate seem to track intervention-related factors such as access to, and use of, contraceptive services and the general climate surrounding the sexual health of young people.",Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,1999 Jun,England,1999,90
10467761,"A biopsychosocial model of glycemic control in diabetes: stress, coping and regimen adherence.","This study examines stress, coping, and regimen adherence as determinants of chronic and transient metabolic control in diabetes. We also examine the interaction of biologic vulnerability and psychosocial risk factors to see if Type 1 (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus) or Type 2 (noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus) diabetes had greater responsiveness to psychosocial risk factors. Analyses of data from insulin-treated adults with Type 1 (N = 57) and Type 2 (N = 61) diabetes supported the biopsychosocial model. For Type 1 diabetes, self-controlling persons had better glycemic control and emotional persons had worse (because of differences in stress). All of these associations were mediated by regimen compliance. For Type 2 diabetes, self-controlling persons had better glycemic control for reasons other than regimen compliance. There was an interaction between biologic and psychosocial factors, with psychosocial factors accounting for more variance in glycemic control within Type 1 patients. Stable psychosocial resources (i.e., education, being married, and positive coping styles) were associated with better chronic glycemic control, while stress and regimen nonadherence were associated with worse transient glycemic control.",Journal of health and social behavior,1999 Jun,United States,1999,90
10468392,Do measures of self-reported morbidity bias the estimation of the determinants of health care utilisation?,"Most national surveys of health care utilisation capture only self-reported measures of morbidity. If self-reported morbidity is measured with error, then the results of applied work may be misleading. In this paper we propose a model of the relationship between morbidity and health service utilisation which allows for reporting errors and simultaneity. Errors in self-reported morbidity are expressed as a function of person-specific reporting thresholds and recent contact with health services, arising because of better self-evaluation of current health status or a desire to justify consumption of a publicly-provided good. We demonstrate the bias in ignoring the potential problems of reporting errors and simultaneity for a variety of special cases, but in the general case the biases are of ambiguous sign. The empirical nature of these biases is investigated using limiting long-standing illness (LLI) and recent contact with a General Practitioner (GP) in two waves of The UK Health and Lifestyle Survey. Biomedical measures of functioning are used as objective indicators of health status. We find evidence of substantial and significant differences between individuals in reporting thresholds and some evidence that the reporting of LLI may depend on recent visits to a GP. Adjustments for these biases significantly increase the estimated effect of morbidity on utilisation.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Oct,England,1999,90
10465816,Prevalence and determinants of smoking in three regions of Saudi Arabia.,"OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence and determinants of cigarette smoking among Saudi nationals in three regions of Saudi Arabia. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 8310 individuals aged 15 years and above from both sexes, randomly selected from the three regions, using a stratified cluster sampling technique. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, household, community-based survey. Using a predesigned and tested questionnaire, the participants were interviewed by primary care physicians. The interview covered personal, social, and educational characteristics of the respondents, and also included questions about their smoking status, duration of smoking, and daily cigarette consumption. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association between current smoking and sociodemographic variables, in univariate and multivariate analysis. Degree of interaction between the different determinants of cigarette smoking. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of current smoking was 21.1% for males and 0.9% for females. Most smokers (78%) were young to middle-aged (21-50 years old). Smoking prevalence was higher among married people, among uneducated people, and among those in certain occupations: manual workers, businessmen, army officers, and office workers. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is an important public health problem in Saudi Arabia. A more intense and comprehensive tobacco control effort is needed.",Tobacco control,1999 Spring,England,1999,90
10459890,The effect on morbidity of variability in deprivation and population stability in England and Wales: an investigation at small-area level.,"We seek to determine whether variability in deprivation at small area level, and population stability, influence standardised morbidity ratios in England and Wales. A regression analysis was conducted with data from the 1991 British Census, in order to explain variation in morbidity. Both an area deprivation score (for electoral wards) and the within-area variability of deprivation scores were examined as possible determinants of morbidity (self-reported, limiting, long-term illness). Particular attention was focused on a spatially-sensitive measure of the variability of deprivation scores within a wider 'locality'. There was a significant, positive relationship between age-standardised limiting, long-term illness and deprivation. The variation in area deprivation scores within the small areas themselves was also significant and positive. However, the variation in deprivation scores calculated for both an electoral ward and its contiguous neighbours (the locality) was slightly more significant. Areas with higher relative levels of in-migration also had significantly lower standardised morbidity ratios. Multivariate models showed that the deprivation score, the variation in deprivation scores for the broader locality, and the measure of migration, were all significant in combination. Residual analysis showed that many areas in London had lower levels of morbidity than expected, while electoral wards in the coal mining valleys of South Wales had higher levels than expected. We conclude that, for small areas (wards) in England and Wales, morbidity is related to deprivation, variation in deprivation within and surrounding each area, and the proportion of the population that are migrants. Variations in deprivation influence standardised morbidity rates, and policies which widen inequalities will influence health outcomes. Resource allocation based simply on measures of deprivation, which ignore population change within the area and variations in deprivation in the locality, may be inefficient.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Sep,England,1999,90
10459889,Physical activity social support and middle- and older-aged minority women: results from a US survey.,"BACKGROUND: Many American adults remain sedentary despite many known health benefits. Research on the determinants of physical activity have indicated that social support is one of the strongest correlates, but little is known about this relation in important subgroups of middle and older-aged women. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the association of physical activity-related social support on several measures of physical activity in a national sample of minority women. A unique aspect of these measures is the inclusion of vigorous household tasks and occupational physical activities. METHODS: The US Women's Determinants Study was conducted in 1996-1997. The survey was a modified-random sample, telephone survey of 2912 Black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and White women age 40 and older. A composite score of physical activity social support (PASS) was analyzed as the independent variable in logistic regression analyses. Four measures of physical activity levels served as the dependent variables. A separate analysis was done to distinguish PASS from friends versus PASS from relatives. The potential confounding effect of race/ethnicity, marital status, age, income and education were evaluated and adjusted in the models. RESULTS: Hispanic women were more likely to have high PASS scores than the other racial/ethnic groups. Odds ratios indicate that subjects with high levels of PASS were significantly less likely to be sedentary than those with low support, even after adjusting for race/ethnicity. While there were significant associations among levels of social support and physical activity, this was not true for the measure of ""regular exercise."" There was no significant difference between the contribution of ""friend"" support versus ""family"" support on all four measures on physical activity. DISCUSSION: Based on our results, enhancing social support may be an important aspect of interventions aimed at increasing physical activity in a population of sedentary women of various racial/ethnic backgrounds. Also, ""regular exercisers"" in this population appear to be less reliant social support to maintain their behavior.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Sep,England,1999,90
10453246,Area variations in use of modern contraception in rural Bangladesh: a multilevel analysis.,"This study in Bangladesh found that inter-cluster variation in the use of modern reversible methods of contraception was significantly attributable to the educational levels of the female family planning workers working in the clusters. Women belonging to clusters served by educated workers had a higher probability of being contraceptive users than those whose workers had only completed primary education. At the household level, important determinants of use were socioeconomic status and religion. At the individual level, the woman being the wife of the household head and having some education were positively related to her being a user. The model also found that inter-household variation was significantly greater than inter-cluster variation. Finally, the study concludes that after controlling for various covariates at all three levels, the clusters do not have significantly different levels of use of modern reversible methods of contraception. There are, however, some special areas where contraceptive use is dramatically low, and these contribute significantly to the observed inter-cluster variation.",Journal of biosocial science,1999 Jul,England,1999,90
10453105,Blood pressure change in Africa: case study from Nigeria.,"Studies of migrants and comparisons of rural versus urban communities are potentially informative study designs because they allow examination of genetically similar population subgroups exposed to diverse environmental conditions. These designs have been underused in Africa, where recent urbanization has created many situations in which nearby communities of common ethnicity and culture live under different social and economic circumstances. The International Study of Hypertension in Blacks (ICSHIB) conducted several overlapping surveys in Nigeria starting in 1993. These surveys were based primarily in the rural village of Idere and the urban community of Idikan, both inhabited by people defined ethnically as Oyo Yoruba and sharing a common language and culture. Survey teams collected standardized blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, and some study participants provided 24-hr urine samples and questionnaire data on psychosocial stress and social integration. Rural and urban groups differed substantially in blood pressure and related characteristics. Age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension (blood pressure > or = 140/90 mm Hg) for participants aged 25 years and older was 7-8% in Idere and 24-27% in Idikan. The distributions of overweight, sodium/potassium ratio, perceived stress, and social integration scores all contributed to lower hypertension risk in Idere. The effects and interactions of these identified risk factors remain poorly understood, even among people who share a common genetic background, similar diet, and many other lifestyle features. Nonetheless, the rural-urban distinction is sufficiently salient to engender a nearly threefold difference in hypertension prevalence. This disparity in disease prevalence demonstrates the sensitivity of human beings to the environmental determinants of disease and provides a sobering example of the difficulty in identifying subtle genetic effects, which can be easily overwhelmed by small differences in environmental exposures.",Human biology,1999 Aug,United States,1999,90
10452207,Psychosocial determinants of well-being in gynecologic cancer patients.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the well-being of women with endometrial versus cervical cancer before treatment, and its determinants at 12 to 15 months follow-up. The subjects were interviewed before treatment, then 6 and 12 to 15 months after initiation of treatment. Simultaneously, they completed questionnaires on psychological symptoms and social support. It appeared that well-being at baseline and at the follow-ups were highly correlated. Furthermore, cervical cancer patients reported significantly more symptoms on all occasions. After discriminant function analysis, the following three variables remained in the analysis: (a) well-being before treatment, (b) diagnosis, and (c) children at home. This allowed 81% of the patients to be classified as having a favorable versus an unfavorable outcome. The results of this study highlight the importance of well-being before treatment as a predictor of well-being after treatment. The necessity of individualized intervention measures is warranted.",Cancer nursing,1999 Aug,United States,1999,90

10451600,Evaluation of doctor-worker encounters in occupational health: an explanatory study.,"In this paper workers' evaluations of various types of doctor-worker encounters in occupational health (the open consultation hour, required visits after absence from work and visits for periodic medical examination) are described and explored. The aim was a better understanding of the consultation processes and its determinants in the field of occupational health. Semistructured interviews were conducted in a sample of 313 employees. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were carried out in order to explain the variations in the outcome parameters. The quantitative analysis showed that workers' evaluation of their encounter with the occupational physician was rather indeterminate and only correlated positively with the variable 'meeting workers' expectations'. The qualitative analysis generated a classification of the variety of workers' expectations. In the Role Differentiation Model this classification of workers' expectations is related to three specific role aspects: the expert-, the counsellor- and the mediator-role aspect. The model assumes that the occupational physician should be able perform the behavioural requirements of these role aspects, in order to meet the expectations of the workers in various situations. The Role Differentiation Model is a hypothetical model, partly based on the outcome of the study, which explains the variation in workers' evaluations and could also be used to develop practice guidelines.","Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)",1999 Apr,England,1999,90
10451078,Determinants of pain severity in knee osteoarthritis: effect of demographic and psychosocial variables using 3 pain measures.,"OBJECTIVES: Why some patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) report greater pain severity than others is unclear. We examined the demographic variables, psychosocial variables, and physical findings that predict severity of pain in patients with symptomatic knee OA comparing 3 different pain scales. METHODS: Pain severity was measured in 68 outpatients with knee OA using the WOMAC OA Index, the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), and a 0-100 visual analog scale (VAS). Depression, anxiety, fatigue, helplessness, self-efficacy, and quality of life were measured using standard instruments. Pain threshold was measured by dolorimetry and a standard knee examination performed. Radiographs were viewed when available. RESULTS: Significant correlations (r = 0.39-0.61) were found between pain measures. In unadjusted analysis, BMI and helplessness correlated with all 3 scales; race, education, female sex, and osteophyte score also correlated with at least one instrument. Depression, anxiety, and fatigue correlated only with the MPQ. Age, duration, and quality of life were not related to pain severity. After adjusted analysis the following variables remained: education, helplessness, and osteophyte score (WOMAC); BMI and helplessness (MPQ); duration, education, helplessness, and osteophyte score (VAS). ""Sitting pain"" and ""night pain"" had different associations from pain on walking, standing, or using stairs. CONCLUSION: Different pain scales measure different facets of the pain experience in knee OA and cannot be used interchangeably. The WOMAC pain scale has advantages over other instruments. Helplessness, education, and BMI appear to be important, potentially treatable, factors in determining self-reported pain severity in knee OA: other associations vary with both the pain scale used and the situation in which pain occurs, supporting the hypothesis that pain in knee OA is heterogeneous.",The Journal of rheumatology,1999 Aug,Canada,1999,90
10450858,Psychological and social determinants of women's decisions to undergo genetic counseling and testing for breast cancer.,"This study examined the demand for breast cancer genetic testing and counseling among Canadian women diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50, together with some of the factors predicting both their intentions to be tested and the degree to which they act on their intentions. Participants were 110 women under the age of 50 and comprised of two groups: 1) women diagnosed with breast cancer (BC, n = 60): and 2) an index group of unaffected women from the general population (GP, n = 50). All participants completed a survey that addressed family history of breast and other cancers, demographic variables, knowledge and attitudes about breast cancer, and genetic testing. Members of the BC group were offered genetic counseling and testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 free of charge. Overall, 60% of participants indicated they would like the test, and 40% either did not want it or were uncertain. Seventy-two percent of women in the BC group wanted to be tested. Of these, only 49% had actually contacted the genetic counselor about testing at follow-up 3-15 months later. Intention to be tested was associated with presence of breast cancer, greater perceived benefits of testing, fewer perceived 'costs' of testing, and higher levels of concern about the risk of relatives developing breast cancer. Actual arranging to meet with the genetic counselor among women in the BC group was associated with fewer perceived costs of having the test. Results suggest a moderate level of interest in gene testing, though intention to be tested may not translate into actual uptake. Women who do choose to have the test may believe the potential 'costs' of using this new genetic technology to be relatively few. This has implications for genetic counselors in terms of providing balanced and complete information to women considering genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility.",Clinical genetics,1999 Jun,Denmark,1999,90
10444876,Health inequalities and social group differences: what should we measure?,"Both health inequalities and social group health differences are important aspects of measuring population health. Despite widespread recognition of their magnitude in many high- and low-income countries, there is considerable debate about the meaning and measurement of health inequalities, social group health differences and inequities. The lack of standard definitions, measurement strategies and indicators has and will continue to limit comparisons--between and within countries, and over time--of health inequalities, and perhaps more importantly comparative analyses of their determinants. Such comparative work, however, will be essential to find effective policies for governments to reduce health inequalities. This article addresses the question of whether we should be measuring health inequalities or social group health differences. To help clarify the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches, we review some of the major arguments for and against each of them.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,1999,Switzerland,1999,90
10440685,Determinants of caregiving experiences and mental health of partners of cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: Research regarding informal caregiving showed considerable individual variation in responses to cancer caregiving. The current longitudinal study examined determinants of caregiver outcomes in terms of caregiver experiences at 3 months and caregiver's mental health at 6 months after hospital discharge. It included both negative and positive dimensions of caregiving outcomes. METHODS: One hundred forty-eight patients with newly diagnosed colorectal carcinoma and their partners were included. Caregiver experiences were assessed by the Caregiver Reaction Assessment Scale, which contains four negative subscales (disrupted schedule, financial problems, lack of family support, and loss of physical strength) and one positive subscale (self-esteem). The mental health of the caregiver was assessed in terms of depression and quality of life. Possible determinants of the caregiver's experiences and mental health were categorized according to characteristics of the caregiver, the patient, and the care situation. Caregiving experiences were studied as a fourth additional category of possible determinants of the caregiver's mental health. RESULTS: Each domain of the caregiving experience was explained by different factors, with total explained variances ranging between 11-46%. Negative caregiver experiences were associated with a low income, living with only the patient, a distressed relationship, a high level of patient dependency, and a high involvement in caregiving tasks. Caregivers with a low level of education and caregivers of patients with a stoma were able to derive more self-esteem from caregiving. Although caregiving may lead to depression, especially in those experiencing loss of physical strength, caregivers may sustain their quality of life by deriving self-esteem from caregiving. CONCLUSIONS: It is important that professionals involved in the ongoing care of cancer patients and their families be aware of the increasing demands made on caregivers and the specific problems and uplifts they perceive in caregiving. Professional caregivers are urged to involve informal caregivers with care explicitly and continuously. However, specific attention to those caregivers who live only with the patient, those with a low income, those with a distressed relationship, and those with a high level of patient dependency and care involvement is warranted.",Cancer,1999 Aug 15,United States,1999,90
10440046,Changing pregnancy outcomes of Samoan women in Hawaii.,"In the state of Hawaii, Samoan mothers are known for the large average birthweight and low percentage of low birthweight (< 2500 g) of their infants, in spite of the relatively low socio-economic status of the population. This paper reports the findings of a temporal trend analysis of birth outcomes of Samoan women and identifies worrying changes. Data were obtained from Hawaii birth certificates. Single live births to Hawaii-resident Samoan and Caucasian women from 1979 to 1994 were included in the study. Infants of Samoan women experienced a 75 g decline in mean birthweight and an increase in the percentage of low (< 2500 g) and very low (< 1500 g) birthweight from 2.6 and 0.4 to 3.8 and 0.8 respectively. During the same time, infants of Caucasian mothers experienced an increase in mean birthweight and a decline in low birthweight, while very low birthweight did not change. Maternal socio-demographic characteristics explained only part of the findings and use of prenatal care did not appear to be associated with any birth outcome indicators. Multiple regression analyses identified an adjusted loss of 50.8 g in birthweight and a 1.48 increase in the odds ratio of small-for-gestational-age associated with birth at the end (1991-4) compared with the beginning (1979-82) of the study period. Further studies focusing on maternal health status and psycho-social variables, including the effect of acculturation-related stress, are warranted to identify at least some of the determinants of the changes identified by this analysis.",Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,1999 Jul,England,1999,90
10436495,[The course of behavior disorders and their psychosocial treatment in patients with dementia].,"Behavioural symptoms are not crucial for a valid diagnosis of dementia. However, these symptoms are important determinants of the burden of caregivers and strongly predict premature nursing home placement. Agitation, apathy, and depression are most prevalent, whereas aggressive behaviour, delusions and hallucinations are less frequent. Among the behavioural symptoms of dementia agitation is the most persistent problem. Psychosocial treatment basically requests a constant and empathetic relationship between therapist and patient or caregiver. Recent studies have demonstrated that specific treatment interventions are effective in reducing behavioural symptoms, such as agitation, apathy, and depression. Psychoeducative strategies in the support of caregivers may be effective in reducing behavioural symptoms of the demented patients in daily living.",Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie und Geriatrie,1999 Jun,Germany,1999,90
10434847,Healthy dietary habits in relation to social determinants and lifestyle factors.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the importance of social status and lifestyle for dietary habits, since these factors may influence life expectancy. We studied the association of four indicators for healthy dietary habits (fruits and vegetables, fibre, fat and Hegsted score) with sex, age, socio-economic status, education, physical leisure exercise, smoking and personal attention paid to keeping a healthy diet. Data were gathered with a self-administered quantitative food-frequency questionnaire distributed to a representative sample of Norwegian men and women aged 16-79 years in a national dietary survey, of whom 3144 subjects (63%) responded. Age and female sex were positively associated with indicators for healthy dietary habits. By separate evaluation length of education, regular physical leisure exercise and degree of attention paid to keeping a healthy diet were positively associated with all four indicators for healthy dietary habits in both sexes. Socio-economic status, location of residence and smoking habits were associated with from one to three indicators for healthy dietary habits. In a multiple regression model, age, education and location of residence together explained from 1 to 9% of the variation (R2) in the four dietary indicators. Length of education was significantly associated with three of four dietary indicators both among men and women. By including the variable 'attention paid to keeping a healthy diet' in the model, R2 increased to between 4 and 15% for the four dietary indicators. Length of education remained correlated to three dietary indicators among women, and one indicator among men, after adjusting for attention to healthy diet, age and location of residence. Residence in cities remained correlated to two indicators among men, but none among women, after adjusting for age, education and attention to healthy diet. In conclusion, education was associated with indicators of a healthy diet. Attention to healthy diet showed the strongest and most consistent association with all four indicators for healthy dietary habits in both sexes. This suggests that personal preferences may be just as important for having a healthy diet as social status determinants.",The British journal of nutrition,1999 Mar,England,1999,90
10433412,The extended version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire as a guide to child psychiatric caseness and consequent burden.,"The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioural screening questionnaire that asks about children's and teenagers' symptoms and positive attributes; the extended version also includes an impact supplement that asks if the respondent thinks the young person has a problem, and if so, enquires further about chronicity, distress, social impairment, and burden for others. Closely similar versions are completed by parents, teachers, and young people aged 11 or more. The validation study involved two groups of 5-15-year-olds: a community sample (N = 467) and a psychiatric clinic sample (N = 232). The two groups had markedly different distributions on the measures of perceived difficulties, impact (distress plus social impairment), and burden. Impact scores were better than symptom scores at discriminating between the community and clinic samples; discrimination based on the single ""Is there a problem?"" item was almost as good. The SDQ burden rating correlated well (r = .74) with a standardised interview rating of burden. For clinicians and researchers with an interest in psychiatric caseness and the determinants of service use, the impact supplement of the extended SDQ appears to provide useful additional information without taking up much more of respondents' time.","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",1999 Jul,England,1999,90
10432901,Individual causal models and population system models in epidemiology.,"A group of individuals behaves as a population system when patterns of connections among individuals influence population health outcomes. Epidemiology usually treats populations as collections of independent individuals rather than as systems of interacting individuals. An appropriate theoretical structure, which includes the determinants of connections among individuals, is needed to develop a ""population system epidemiology."" Infection transmission models and sufficient-component cause models provide contrasting templates for the needed theoretical structure. Sufficient-component cause models focus on joint effects of multiple exposures in individuals. They handle time and interactions between individuals in the definition of variables and assume that populations are the sum of their individuals. Transmission models, in contrast, model interactions among individuals over time. Their nonlinear structure means that population risks are not simply the sum of individual risks. The theoretical base for ""population system epidemiology"" should integrate both approaches. It should model joint effects of multiple exposures in individuals as time related processes while incorporating the determinants and effects of interactions among individuals. Recent advances in G-estimation and discrete individual transmission model formulation provide opportunities for such integration.",American journal of public health,1999 Aug,United States,1999,90
10431943,Correlates of physical activity in a national sample of girls and boys in grades 4 through 12.,"Psychological, biological, social, and physical environmental variables were examined for their association with physical activity of young people. A national sample of 1,504 parents and children in Grades 4-12 were interviewed by telephone. Twenty-two potential determinants were assessed along with an 11-item child physical activity index (alpha = .76). Hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted separately for 6 age-sex subgroups. Percentage of variance explained ranged from 18% for boys in Grades 4-6 to 59% for girls in Grades 10-12. Three variables had strong and consistent associations with the child physical activity index that generalized across subgroups: use of afternoon time for sports and physical activity, enjoyment of physical education, and family support for physical activity. These 3 variables should be targeted for change to promote physical activity in all groups of young people.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1999 Jul,United States,1999,90
10431489,The impact of socio-cultural and clinical factors on health-related quality of life reports among Hispanic and African-American cancer patients.,"A hierarchical multiple linear regression approach (N = 761) was used to identify pertinent factors which influence health-related quality of life (HRQL) reports among Hispanic and African-American cancer patients. The independent variables include: performance status, disease site, disease stage, mode of administration, socio-economic status (SES), gender, age, living arrangement, race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, insurance status, and spiritual beliefs. The outcome measures, five subscales of HRQL (physical well-being, social well-being, satisfaction with treatment, emotional well-being, functional well-being) and overall HRQL (sum of the five subscales), were estimated using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Scales. This study identified performance status and spiritual beliefs as consistent predictors of overall HRQL. This study also found no significant effects of SES, mode of administration, gender age, living arrangement and insurance status on the reporting of overall HRQL. Spiritual beliefs and performance status are important determinants of HRQL across a diverse group of cancer patients.",Journal of outcome measurement,1999,United States,1999,90

Women at risk, such as multiparous and climacteric women, were selected from the community (n = 200) and health-care centers (n = 200) and interviewed about inappropriate urine loss in the past 12 months, using a structured and pretested questionnaire. Of these, 81 (20.3%) admitted UI; only 25 of these (30.9%) had sought medical advice. The reasons were embarrassment (38.2%), choice of self-treatment because of low expectations from medical care (38.2%), and preferring to discuss the matter with friends, assuming that UI is normal (23.3%). Sufferers were troubled by their inability to pray (90%) and to have sexual intercourse (33.3%). Perceived causes of UI were paralysis (45%), childbirth (35.4%) and old age or menopause (33.7%). UI is common yet underreported by UAE women because of cultural attitudes and inadequate public knowledge.",International urogynecology journal and pelvic floor dysfunction,1999,England,1999,90
10429746,Gender differences in chronic disease risk behaviors through the transition out of high school.,"BACKGROUND: Major life transitions (e.g., graduation from high school) are times when many changes occur in a person's social and physical environment. Men and women likely experience aspects of these changes differently. As a result, health-related behaviors likely change at these times with possible differences in these changes by gender. METHODS: Gender differences in the performance of chronic disease risk-related behaviors (fruit, juice, and vegetable intake; physical activity; tobacco and alcohol use; and sexual practices) through the transition out of high school (HS) were assessed in a secondary analysis of a nationally representative sample from the 1992 National Health Interview Survey-Youth Risk Behavior Survey. The survey was completed by 5881 young people aged 14 to 21 years. Regression discontinuity analysis with piecewise regression was performed. RESULTS: Statistically significant gender by transition effects were obtained for exercise/physical activity (decreases at the transition point for males), snuff use (decrease for females in HS), binge drinking and number of days drinking alcohol (increases for males at the transition point), and use of alcohol or drugs before sexual intercourse (decrease for females post HS). Fruit intake decreased for males and females and daily and heavy cigarette smoking increased during the HS years. Effect sizes were small but promising, given that the data set was not designed to test this hypothesis. CONCLUSION: These data offer evidence of differences by gender in chronic disease risk behaviors through the HS transition. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess the true nature of these differences, the tracking of these risk behaviors and their personal, social, and environmental determinants, including gender-specific determinants, that may explain these changes and inform future intervention development.",American journal of preventive medicine,1999 Jul,Netherlands,1999,90
10428192,Social and psychological characteristics of elderly visually handicapped patients with the Charles Bonnet Syndrome.,"The Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is characterized by the presence of complex visual hallucinations in psychologically normal people. The syndrome occurs predominantly in the visually handicapped elderly. Little is known about its etiology and pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to examine the associations of CBS with psychological and social determinants. All subjects were patients older than 64 years from a low-vision unit. Using a case-control approach, 50 patients with CBS and 80 patients without visual hallucinations were interviewed about their educational level, social circumstances, number of social contacts, and ability to cope with visual handicap. Loneliness was measured with the De Jong-Gierveld-Kamphuis loneliness scale, and personality traits were examined with the Dutch-language short version of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ([MMPI] Nederlandse Verkorte MMPI [NVM]). Compared with the control group, significantly more CBS patients were lonely. Mean scores on the NVM shyness scale and extraversion scale were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in CBS patients. In multiple logistic regression analysis for the three determinants simultaneously, loneliness and low extraversion were significant predictors for CBS, but shyness was not. It is concluded that loneliness, low extraversion, and shyness are risk indicators for CBS in elderly visually handicapped people. The findings suggest that CBS is associated with a low quality of social contacts.",Comprehensive psychiatry,1999 Jul-Aug,United States,1999,90

10421088,Blood pressure and hypertension in rural and urban Sierra Leoneans.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and awareness of hypertension and determinants of blood pressure in rural and urban Sierra Leoneans. METHOD: 598 subjects from Freetown and 606 subjects from three villages in the northern province of Sierra Leone were selected for this study using multi-stage sampling. All were adults aged 15 years and over. Single blood pressure measurements were made after a minimum rest period of 10 minutes using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Korotkoffs phases I and V were used for systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively. Standard anthropometric measurements were made and a questionnaire used to collect information on demographic, dietary, and social factors, including consumption of tobacco products, alcohol, salt, palm oil, and kola nuts. Hypertension was diagnosed if systolic blood pressure(SBP) was equal or greater than 160 mm Hg and/or if diastolic blood pressure(DBP) was equal or greater than 95 mm Hg and/or there was a history of hypertensive therapy. RESULTS: The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension in the Freetown and Port Loko subjects was 23.4% and 14.7%, respectively (P=0.006). Females had a higher prevalence in both populations. The most significant determinants of blood pressure were age, body mass index (BMI) and a low level of education. When adjusted for BMI and age, no significant difference in prevalence was observed between the two populations. The level of awareness was low, particularly in the rural areas. CONCLUSION: This survey confirms a high prevalence, and low level of awareness, of hypertension in rural and urban Sierra Leoneans.",Ethnicity & disease,1999 Spring-Summer,United States,1999,90
10419794,Counseling youth in tobacco-use prevention: determinants of clinician compliance.,"OBJECTIVE: The rate and determinants of tobacco prevention and cessation counseling to youth were examined for orthodontists participating in a controlled trial to decrease the incidence of tobacco use among adolescents. METHODS: A cross-sectional interview design in private practice offices throughout Southern California was used. The survey was completed with 126 (82%) orthodontists. Clinicians randomly assigned to the experimental group (N = 77) received a 1.5 h workshop, anti-tobacco materials, reimbursement for provision of anti-tobacco prescriptions, and quarterly checkup visits. Control group clinicians (N = 77) did not receive training, materials, or visits. RESULTS: Experimental group clinicians talked to more adolescent nonsmokers about never beginning tobacco use than did control group clinicians (P < 0.05). Experimental group clinicians talked to more adolescent tobacco users than did control group clinicians; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Content and determinants of counseling were affected by participation in the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Though training and support increased prevention and cessation counseling, absolute rates remained less than optimal. Social learning factors were associated with prevention and cessation counseling.",Preventive medicine,1999 Jul,United States,1999,90
10414809,Determinants of socioeconomic differences in change in physical and mental functioning.,"Continuous decline in functioning is not an inevitable consequence of ageing, as some individuals maintain high levels of functioning to old age. The origins of functional problems in old age are not only related to current circumstances, but may be traced back to earlier life-experiences. Previous analyses show that change in functioning is related to socioeconomic status, but it is uncertain to what extent these differences can be accounted for by the same health behaviours and material and psychosocial factors that are related to socioeconomic differences in morbidity and mortality. This paper investigates socioeconomic differences in change in mental and physical functioning in a relatively young and healthy population over a three year follow-up period. The data come from the Whitehall II Study of London based civil servants aged 39-63 in 1991-93. We measured functioning with the Short Form 36 (SF-36) General Health Survey and socioeconomic status by civil service employment grade. Among lower employment grade men the odds ratio of being in the quartile of rapid decline in mental and physical functioning was 1.79 and 1.56 respectively. For women the odds ratio for physical functioning was 1.34, but employment grade differences in mental functioning were inconsistent. Among men health behaviours were the most important determinants of employment grade differences in physical functioning change. In addition, material problems and job decision latitude accounted for employment grade differences in physical as well as mental functioning change. However, among women employment grade differences in change in physical functioning can not be accounted for with these risk factors. Analyses of change in determinants may provide further insight into the underlying pathways. Early detection of functional decline and intervention may be a key to better functioning in ageing populations.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Aug,England,1999,90
10412999,Cognitive strategies and self-esteem as predictors of brace-wear noncompliance in patients with idiopathic scoliosis and kyphosis.,"Psychological determinants of brace-wear compliance were analyzed among 113 patients who used a brace because of an adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (92%), kyphosis (5%), or both (3%). The results showed that noncompliant girls did not expect to succeed in dealing with scoliosis and that they were anxious about the possibility of failure. They also had low self-esteem and did not seek social support from other people. Noncompliant boys, in contrast, had high self-esteem and high achievement success expectation. Among patients with a short time of brace use, low compliance was best predicted by low amount of reflective thinking and a good body-image. In turn, among patients who had used the brace for >6 months, low compliance was best predicted by high amount of reflective thinking, poor body-image, low social success expectation, and low master orientation in social behavior. Only sleeping problems predicted compliance across gender and the time of brace use: the more the patients experienced sleeping problems, the less they used the brace.",Journal of pediatric orthopedics,1999 Jul-Aug,United States,1999,90
10409795,[Public health and behavior modification: a contemporary issue].,"Most cardiovascular disease risk factors can be modified through life-style changes. Choices of habits and behavior are in fact heavily influenced by concepts of normality and social values. However, social influences fail to fully explain these choices, insofar as health-related habits are also shaped by personal experience. The main limitations of public health practice can probably be found at this subjective level. This article emphasizes the need to consider determinants of human behavior at different levels, increasingly important for strategies to promote health and prevent disease, or at least delay its onset. The primary focus is to influence rules and laws aimed at protecting life. The article also discusses possible strategies for translating scientific knowledge into public health action, avoiding the restriction to the ""healthy life"" regulatory role. Finally, participation by public health professionals is suggested in places where population groups share life experiences, such as workplaces, schools, and churches, developing approaches which include those experiences as well as fears and hopes related to health. Scientific facts might thus be transformed into more familiar elements of everyday life.",Cadernos de saude publica,1999 Apr-Jun,Brazil,1999,90

Data were collected using a cross-sectional survey of 1046 households (5546 individuals) sampled from locations in two counties situated in the study area. The survey included anthropometric measurements, a 24-hour dietary recall, stool tests, and childhood mortality data. Children of private farmers and ""wealthy peasants"" displayed better nutritional status, higher quality diet, lower prevalence of intestinal parasites, and a lower risk of dying than those whose parents were communal farmers, from ejidos, or ""poor peasants"". The results suggest that using volume of maize production as a classification method proved more valuable than land tenure to identify agricultural groups with different health status. It appears that the main determinants of health differentials are structural inequities in resource distribution. Thus, the impact of medical interventions on inequalities will be limited unless they are accompanied by redistribution of resources.",Cadernos de saude publica,1999 Apr-Jun,Brazil,1999,90

Desired social distance from gay men and lesbians, the intervening variable in these relations, significantly mediated the indirect effect of fraternity-sorority affiliation, classification, and gender on the victim-blaming tendency. Gender and desired social distance were found to be significant direct determinants of the victim-blaming tendency toward people with AIDS.

METHODS: Retrospective data were obtained from 1116 individuals age 15 to 64 participating in a large population health survey in the province of Ontario, Canada RESULTS: Approximately 50% of the sample recovered from their illness. Survival analysis revealed a median length of illness of 25 years with peak periods of risk of recovery occurring between 30 and 45 years duration. Using discrete time multivariate hazard regression analysis, statistically significant predictors of recovery from social phobia included: childhood social contextual factors (one or no childhood siblings, a small town childhood place of residence), characteristics of the disorder (onset past the age of 7, less than three disorder symptoms), an absence of co-morbid health-related conditions and psychiatric disorders (chronic health problems and major depression), and the occurrence of co-morbid chronic health problems and major depression prior to the onset of the disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that social phobia in the general population is a chronic and unremittent disorder. Determinants of recovery are rooted in distal childhood circumstances, disorder attributes, and the physical and mental health status of individuals over the life course.",Psychological medicine,1999 May,England,1999,90
10401873,Association of serum uric acid with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality and incident myocardial infarction in the MONICA Augsburg cohort. World Health Organization Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases.,"Because previous findings have been inconsistent, we explored the association of serum concentrations of uric acid with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality and myocardial infarction prospectively. We used data from 1,044 men who are members of the World Health Organization Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases (MONICA) Augsburg cohort. The men, 45-64 years of age in 1984-1985, were followed through 1992. There were 90 deaths, 44 of which were related to cardiovascular disease; 60 men developed incident nonfatal or fatal myocardial infarction. We estimated hazard rate ratios from Cox proportional hazard models. Uric acid levels > or =373 micromol/liter (fourth quartile) vs < or =319 micromol/liter (first and second quartile) independently predicted all-cause mortality [hazard rate ratio = 2.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6-5.0] after adjustment for alcohol, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, hypertension, use of diuretic drugs, smoking, body mass index, and education. The adjusted risk of cardiovascular disease mortality was 2.2 (95% CI = 1.0-4.8), and that of myocardial infarction was 1.7 (95% CI = 0.8-3.3). Although residual confounding cannot be excluded, our results are among the few, in men, demonstrating a strong positive association of elevated serum uric acid with all-cause mortality. Future investigations may be able to evaluate whether uric acid contributes independently to the development of cardiovascular disease or is simply a component of the atherogenic metabolic condition known as the insulin resistance syndrome.","Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",1999 Jul,United States,1999,90
10400554,Prevalence and determinants of prone sleeping position in infants: results from two cross-sectional studies on risk factors for SIDS in Germany.,"The authors investigated whether there was a decline in infants sleeping prone and other modifiable risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in Germany, where, as in some other countries, no nationwide intervention campaign against the prone sleeping position had been initiated. Data were obtained from parents by mailed questionnaires in two cross-sectional studies in 1991 (n = 3,330) and 1995 (n = 3,124). Prevalence of prone sleeping decreased from 37.6% to 8.7% (p < 0.05) in the German population and from 44.1% to 32.0% (p < 0.05) in the Turkish immigrant population. Parents who laid their infants prone in 1995 were less likely to follow advice from physicians, public media, and other parents (relative risks < 0.5, p < 0.05) and were more likely to have a low educational level, to be <20 years old, to be single parents, to have two or more children, to be raised in West Germany, or to be of Turkish ethnicity. Although the information on prone sleeping being a risk factor for SIDS became known among the population, these data suggest that subgroup-specific public intervention campaigns may be needed to reduce the prevalence of prone sleeping even further in those countries where no nationwide campaign has been initiated.",American journal of epidemiology,1999 Jul 1,United States,1999,90
10400276,The role of social networks and media receptivity in predicting age of smoking initiation: a proportional hazards model of risk and protective factors.,"The increasing prevalence of adolescent smoking demonstrates the need to identify factors associated with early smoking initiation. Previous studies have shown that smoking by social network members and receptivity to pro-tobacco marketing are associated with smoking among adolescents. It is not clear, however, whether these variables also are associated with the age of smoking initiation. Using data from 10,030 California adolescents, this study identified significant correlates of age of smoking initiation using bivariate methods and a multivariate proportional hazards model. Age of smoking initiation was earlier among those adolescents whose friends, siblings, or parents were smokers, and among those adolescents who had a favorite tobacco advertisement, had received tobacco promotional items, or would be willing to use tobacco promotional items. Results suggest that the smoking behavior of social network members and pro-tobacco media influences are important determinants of age of smoking initiation. Because early smoking initiation is associated with higher levels of addiction in adulthood, tobacco control programs should attempt to counter these influences.",Addictive behaviors,1999 May-Jun,England,1999,90

Accompanying this growth, we can expect that challenges associated with a large bilingual and non-English speaking older population may become more pronounced. The purpose of this research was to examine the level and determinants of English proficiency among older Hispanics in the United States. Data from the 1990 Census indicate that a third of the older Hispanic population in the United States speaks English poorly or not at all. This group includes a sizable number who are ""linguistically isolated"" in that they either live alone or with other nonproficient speakers of English.

10394499,The breast or the bottle? Determinants of infant feeding behaviors.,"Although various trends have placed breastfeeding in and out of vogue, in the twentieth century the greater availability of human milk substitutes mandates that a woman choose her infant's feeding method. It appears that intrapsychic factors or life experiences, as well as certain social conditions, influence that choice. For example, the economic state of society historically has had significant impact on the role of women and the value placed on woman's unique biologic contributions. Likewise, personality and attitudinal factors also may act as potential mediators of observed differences between lactating and nonlactating mothers in their mother-infant interactions. Finally, once the decision to breastfeed or bottle-feed has been made and carried through, additional physiologic mechanisms may mediate conscious behavioral intentions. The phenomenon of human lactation, then, is sensitive to a variety of interrelated factors that can be grouped as follows: (1) individual personality, (2) social forces, and (3) psychophysiologic mechanisms. An in-depth understanding of the specific factors that affect a woman's decision to breastfeed will have far-reaching implications for future educational and interventional programs.",Clinics in perinatology,1999 Jun,United States,1999,90
10390046,The social ecology of syphilis.,"Factors affecting the transmission of syphilis can be categorized into those acting at the level of individuals (e.g., number of sex partners) and others at the level of the sociophysical environment (e.g., availability of treatment services for curable infections). In a prior study, we identified several sociophysical factors correlated with the ten-year mean syphilis rate in a regression analysis of United States counties. In the present study we used qualitative methods to investigate additional aspects of some factors in the regression, as well as to identify entirely new factors. Twelve counties with populations less than 100,000 and ten-year mean syphilis rates that were greater or less than expected by the regression model were selected for a three to five day visit. The case study protocol included observations, unstructured interviews with care providers and county residents, and a standardized questionnaire completed by state and local sexually transmitted disease control personnel pertaining to characteristics and practices of the local health department. Comparisons of the field notes and questionnaires revealed patterns of factors of the sociophysical environment that potentially affect county syphilis rates. These included access to the health department STD clinic, race relations, employment opportunities for minorities, interagency coordination, STD outreach activities, the social acceptability of discussing STDs, and intercommunity dynamics. In addition we noted the disproportionate influence of particular individuals on these factors. Some of the factors identified are readily quantifiable and could enhance the predictive power of multivariable models of county syphilis rates. The hypotheses generated by this study may also lead to a better measurement and understanding of potentially important environmental determinants of community syphilis rates, and the development of new or enhanced prevention strategies.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Apr,England,1999,90

Out results showed that the demographic, socio-economic and behavioural characteristics of patients seeking treatment at alternative places and those attending the referral hospital in the first instance were comparable. Inhibition, time and distance were important considerations for selecting a health facility. Private clinics were the most preferred (72.4%) source of treatment.

10387404,International comparisons of health care expenditures: what we know and what we do not know.,"International comparisons of health care expenditures and their determinants have attracted considerable attention since the early 1960s and have since been used widely to compare countries. The impetus for this has been two-fold: firstly, to assess the macroeconomic efficiency of health systems by determining whether different methods of financing and delivering health care have contributed to the control of overall spending levels; and, secondly, to investigate the determinants of the level of health care expenditure. Empirical research has suggested that there is a causal and statistically significant relationship between growth in health spending and growth in gross domestic product (GDP), and that an increase in the latter brings about a proportionately larger increase in the former. This relationship holds even when other potential determinants, such as urbanisation and age structure of the population, are included in the analysis, leading to the conclusion that health care is a luxury good. This paper examines the extent to which this finding is valid from a methodological perspective and how far it assists policy analysis. We argue that there are significant problems in the measurement of health spending and GDP, discuss the methodological problems in the analysis and suggest that the observed relationship between GDP and health spending is unhelpful and almost certainly misleading for health policy development.",Journal of health services research & policy,1999 Apr,England,1999,90
10382474,"Quality of care in reproductive health programmes: concepts, assessments, barriers and improvements--an overview.","At the end of the first decade of the Safe Motherhood Initiative there are still, at a minimum, 1600 women dying every day from complications of pregnancy and childbirth: this is an intolerable human tragedy. The fact that there are almost 100,000 more maternal deaths annually now compared to 10 years ago, 585,000, must present a challenge to every citizen in society. Policy makers, health professionals, social workers, religious leaders, human-rights advocates and the media all have a responsibility to ask themselves: 'What can I do?' All have a role in affecting quality reproductive-health services, which are essential for the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity, and are an intrinsic human right. The midwife is the obvious catalyst and linch-pin for this effort in the fabric of society. Three papers will address the issues of quality of care in reproductive-health programmes with particular emphasis on safe motherhood. This, the first, article describes the concepts of quality of care in reproductive-health programmes, the determinants of quality improvement, assessment tools for service quality, barriers to quality of care and quality improvement together with examples from relevant countries. The second article will address education issues relative to quality of care, and the third will describe the monitoring and evaluation of quality of care with relevant indicators and project results.",Midwifery,1998 Jun,Scotland,1998,90
10379455,"Embodying inequality: a review of concepts, measures, and methods for studying health consequences of discrimination.","Investigating effects of discrimination upon health requires clear concepts, methods, and measures. At issue are both economic consequences of discrimination and accumulated insults arising from everyday and at times violent experiences of being treated as a second-class citizen, at each and every economic level. Guidelines for epidemiologic investigations and other public health research on ways people embody racism, sexism, and other forms of social inequality, however, are not well defined, as research in this area is in its infancy. Employing an ecosocial framework, this article accordingly reviews definitions and patterns of discrimination within the United States; evaluates analytic strategies and instruments researchers have developed to study health effects of different kinds of discrimination; and delineates diverse pathways by which discrimination can harm health, both outright and by distorting production of epidemiologic knowledge about determinants of population health. Three methods of studying health consequences of discrimination are examined (indirect; direct, at the individual level, in relation to personal experiences of discrimination; at the population level, such as via segregation), and recommendations are provided for developing research instruments to measure acute and cumulative exposure to different aspects of discrimination.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1999,United States,1999,90
10377661,[A study of experience and consequences of diabetes. Increased psychosocial support in the care of diabetes is needed].,"Having diabetes affects life in many ways. The achievement of well-functioning self-care is highly dependent on the patient's ability to come to terms with the disease as an integral part of life, an integration which in turn is crucially dependent on the patient's emotional experience of the disease and trustful relationships with the health care professionals involved. Thus, the caregiver's professional expertise must include knowledge of the medical, psychological and social aspects of the disease. The article consists in a review of the results and conclusions of a population study designed to examine insulin-dependent diabetics' experience of living with their disease, their use of, and attitudes to, diabetes care, and the social and psychosocial impact of the disease on their lifestyle. The principal determinants of the patients' relationship both to the disease itself and to diabetes care appeared to be gender and the presence or absence of chronic complications. Another finding was the need of increased psychosocial support expressed by many patients, which suggests medical social workers to be important members of the diabetes care team.",Lakartidningen,1999 May 5,Sweden,1999,90

10369495,Determinants of salt use in cooked meals in The Netherlands: attitudes and practices of food preparers.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess current habits of using salt and other seasonings in food preparation, and to investigate the psychosocial determinants of salt use. In addition we examined differences in salt consumption and psychosocial determinants with respect to stages of change and socio-economic classes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 400 adults were interviewed to determine: 1) use of salt and other seasonings in food preparation; 2) added table salt; 3) consumption of foods with high salt content; and 4) psychosocial determinants of salt consumption. Subjects were divided into 5 stages of change for salt content of the cooked meal: precontemplation, contemplation, decision, action and maintenance. RESULTS: Salt appeared to be the type of seasoning mostly added in food preparation. Frequently used seasonings containing no added salt were pepper, onion, nutmeg, garlic, curry, sweet pepper powder, parsley, and bay-leaf. Spearman correlation coefficients between added cooking salt and taste attitude, health attitude, social influence and self-efficacy were 0.51, 0.14, 0.36, and 0.32 respectively. Correlations between consumption of foods with high salt content and convenience attitude, taste attitude, health attitude and self-efficacy were 0.41, 0.27, 0.18 and 0.21 respectively. Subjects in maintenance of low salt consumption, used less salt than subjects in precontemplation. Socio-economic status only showed an effect on the use of foods with high salt content. CONCLUSION AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Health aspects did not play a major role in salt intake, whereas taste attitude was an important predictor of added cooking salt. Attempts to reduce cooking salt should be directed at satisfying taste. Nutrition education tailored to stages of change may be very helpful in decreasing salt consumption.",European journal of clinical nutrition,1999 May,England,1999,90
10369442,Demograghic and socio-economic determinants of community and hospital services costs for people with HIV/AIDS in London.,"We examined the influence of demographic, social and economic background of people with HIV/AIDS in London on total community and hospital services costs. This was a retrospective study of community and hospital service use, needs and costs based on structured questionnaires administered by trained interviewers and costing information obtained from the service purchasers and providers, based on two Genito-urinary Medicine clinics in London: the Jefferiss Wing at St. Mary's Hospital and Patric Clements at the Central Middlesex Hospital, London, England. The subjects were 225 HIV infected patients (105 asymptomatic, 59 symptomatic non-AIDS and 61 AIDS). We found that over and above well established determinants of health care costs for HIV infected people such as disease stage and transmission category, social and economic factors such as employment and support of a living-in partner significantly reduced community services costs. Private health insurance had a similar effect, though only a small proportion of HIV people had such cover. The cost of community services for HIV infected non-European Union nationals, mainly of African origin, was one quarter that for the European Union nationals. Community services costs were highest for heterosexually infected women and lowest for heterosexually infected men after adjusting for other factors. Hospital services costs were significantly higher for HIV infected people lacking educational qualifications and employment. We conclude that access to community care for HIV infected non-EU nationals appears to be very poor as the cost of their community services was one quarter that for the EU nationals after adjusting for the effects of transmission category, disease stage, living with a partner, employment and having a private health insurance. Additional incentives for informal care for HIV infected people could be a cost-effective way to improve their community health service provisions.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 May,England,1999,90
10365626,Whom to ask for help in case of a mental disorder? Preferences of the lay public.,"BACKGROUND: Although socio-cultural factors have been recognised as an important predictor in shaping help-seeking behaviour, few attempts have been made in this regard to specify the nature and impact of socio-cultural factors such as attitudes and belief systems prevalent in society. METHODS: We investigated the lay public's attitudes toward help-seeking regarding psychiatric disorders, and their determinants, in a cross-sectional national survey in Germany (n = 1564), using structured interviews with vignettes depicting a person either suffering from depression or from schizophrenia. Two distinct methodological approaches (rating vs ranking) were applied. RESULTS: Public opinion considers mental health professionals helpful in treating schizophrenia but not in the treatment of depression. For depression, public opinion clearly favours the lay support system and believes in involving the family physician if the former resource is exhausted. Determinants of help-seeking recommendations were problem definition, perception of the cause of distress and anticipated prognosis, as well as resentment against mental health professionals. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that attitudes and belief systems prevalent in society have a major impact on help-seeking behaviour, both through transmission to the person suffering from mental distress via his/her social network and through the person's own attitudes formed in the process of socialization. Implications are pointed out for the daily work of mental health care providers, health care planning and public discussion of mental health issues.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1999 Apr,Germany,1999,90
10363349,Parent-child mediated learning interactions as determinants of cognitive modifiability: recent research and future directions.,"The main objectives of this article are to describe the effects of mediated learning experience (MLE) strategies in mother-child interactions on the child's cognitive modifiability, the effects of distal factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, mother's intelligence, child's personality) on MLE interactions, and the effects of situational variables on MLE processes. Methodological aspects of measurement of MLE interactions and of cognitive modifiability, using a dynamic assessment approach, are discussed. Studies with infants showed that the quality of mother-infant MLE interactions predict later cognitive functioning and that MLE patterns and children's cognitive performance change as a result of intervention programs. Studies with preschool and school-aged children showed that MLE interactions predict cognitive modifiability and that distal factors predict MLE interactions but not the child's cognitive modifiability. The child's cognitive modifiability was predicted by MLE interactions in a structured but not in a free-play situation. Mediation for transcendence (e.g., teaching rules and generalizations) appeared to be the strongest predictor of children's cognitive modifiability. Discussion of future research includes the consideration of a holistic transactional approach, which refers to MLE processes, personality, and motivational-affective factors, the cultural context of mediation, perception of the whole family as a mediational unit, and the ""mediational normative scripts.""","Genetic, social, and general psychology monographs",1999 May,United States,1999,90
10360019,Discrimination in Minority Health Care.,"Racial/ethnic minority adolescents are reported to have lower general health status, including higher prevalence of many infectious diseases, than white, non-Hispanic youth. Factors such as lower socioeconomic position, neighborhoods they live in, different cultural views on health, and different role of the family in health care providing are all thought to contribute to this situation. This chapter comprehensively reviews the existing data on the health status of minority adolescents, social, demographic, educational and cultural determinants of racial/ethnic minority populations and how they might interfere with health care delivery to the adolescents, and discusses the need for initiatives to improve the existing conditions.","Adolescent medicine (Philadelphia, Pa.)",1997 Oct,United States,1997,90
10359227,Gambling and risk-taking behavior among university students.,"The present study examines the relationships between risk taking, sensation seeking, and level of gambling involvement. The intent of this research was to investigate whether risk taking and/or sensation seeking are determinants in distinguishing pathological gamblers from problem gamblers and whether risk taking and gambling behavior for a university population are positively correlated for both males and females. Results indicated that the Risk-Taking Questionnaire (RTQ), the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking (AISS), and the Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS) distinguished between probable/pathological gamblers and nonproblem gamblers with probable/pathological gamblers scoring the highest on each measure. However, the RTQ was the only measure able to distinguish probable/pathological gamblers from gamblers experiencing some problems relating to their gambling behavior. Females encountering some problems resulting from their gambling behavior consistently reported higher risk-taking and sensation seeking scores than males with no gambling problems. Results indicate that excessive gamblers are significantly greater risk takers than social gamblers, a finding which could prove useful in advising treatment regimens.",Substance use & misuse,1999 Jun,England,1999,90

DESIGN: Random sample survey of American Academy of Pediatrics fellows. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1620 pediatricians were surveyed with a return rate of 72%. The 556 pediatricians who had finished training and who currently performed child health supervision were included. METHODS: Pediatricians were asked about their goals in 6 areas of health supervision: biomedical issues, development, behavior, family functioning, safety education, and supportive interpersonal interaction. They were also asked about the prevalence of counseling, importance of specific topics, their self-efficacy, outcome expectation in these areas, and their concerns about time and reimbursement for preventive counseling. RESULTS: Assurance of physical health and normal development were the most important goals of child health supervision among the pediatricians surveyed. Goals involving behavioral, family, and safety issues were less important and less likely to be addressed in practice. Most did not regularly discuss family stress, substance abuse, gun safety, and television. In these areas, physicians had less confidence they could provide guidance and lower expectation that they could prevent problems. Only 17% felt that they receive adequate reimbursement for preventive counseling. Most have adequate time (53%) and receive adequate respect (57%) for their preventive efforts. Physicians who were more concerned about time for preventive counseling reported less overall counseling (r = -0.28, P<.001). Concern about reimbursement was not associated with reported counseling. Multiple regression analysis found that the primary predictors of physician counseling were an issue's importance, a physician's perceived self-efficacy, and perceived effectiveness of counseling, while concerns about time and reimbursement were secondary. CONCLUSIONS: Physician goals in child health supervision were primarily biomedical, with psychosocial and safety issues of lesser importance. Concern about time for preventive counseling was associated with less reported counseling. Physician attitudes regarding the importance of a health issue and their confidence and effectiveness in counseling were more predictive of physician practice than their attitudes about time and reimbursement for preventive care.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,1999 Jun,United States,1999,90
10355303,Effects of environmental factors on child survival in Bangladesh: a case control study.,"The need for further studies on relationships between deaths and environmental variables has been reported in the literature. This case-control study was, therefore, carried out to find out the associations between several social and environmental variables and deaths of children due to infectious diseases such as those leading to diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection, measles and other diseases. Six hundred and twenty-five deaths (cases) and an equal number of matched living children (controls) aged 1-59 months, were studied in rural Matlab. An analysis of crude and adjusted odds ratio showed differential associations. Sources of drinking water, amount of stored water, conditions of latrines, number of persons sleeping with the child and the type of cooking site were statistically significantly associated with deaths due to infectious diseases after controlling for breast feeding, immunization, and the family size. Significant associations were also observed between: (i) the sources of drinking water and deaths due to ARI, and (ii) conditions of latrines and deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases, after controlling for the confounding variables. Several other environmental factors also showed associations with these various death groups, but they were not statistically significant. The size of the samples in death groups (small) and the prevalence of more or less homogeneous environmental health conditions probably diminished the magnitude of the effects. The results of the study reconfirm the importance of environmental health intervention in child survival, irrespective of breast-feeding, immunization, and selected social variables.",Public health,1999 Mar,Netherlands,1999,90
10354230,"Specific determinants of intrinsic work motivation, burnout and turnover intentions: a study among nurses.","This study of 156 Dutch general hospital nurses tested a theoretically derived model of specific relationships between work stressors and stress reactions. The model proposes four central domains of the work situation, namely work content, working conditions, social and labour relations, and conditions of employment. In addition, the model proposes three important stress reactions, namely a diminished intrinsic work motivation, occupational burnout and an inclination to leave the job. More specifically, it was hypothesized that (i) intrinsic work motivation is primarily determined by work content variables, (ii) burnout is primarily determined by both work load and limited social support, and (iii) propensity to leave is primarily determined by conditions of employment. All these relationships were simultaneously tested using a structural equations modelling technique. The results of a series of LISREL analyses indicate that the postulated model fits well to the data. The present study used conceptually integrated measures that cover the area of work stress and stress reactions, and provides directions for interventions aimed at preventing or reducing specific negative outcomes of work-related stress in general hospitals.",Journal of advanced nursing,1999 Jun,England,1999,90
10353287,The impact of residency training on physicians' AIDS-related treatment practices: a longitudinal panel study.,"PURPOSE: To determine the effects of aspects of residency training on AIDS-related treatment practices. METHOD: The authors conducted a nationwide longitudinal panel study of 394 physicians who graduated in 1989 from six medical schools in New York State. Data were collected during the participants' fourth year of medical school, their third year of residency training, and six years after they had graduated from medical school. Questionnaires sought information about AIDS-related practice behaviors, including avoiding invasive procedures, minimizing contact, emphasizing AIDS prevention and education, and volume of people with AIDS treated. RESULTS: Aspects of residency training had a sustained impact on how the physicians cared for patients with AIDS but not on the numbers of patients they treated. Determinants of treatment practices included aspects of the residency environment (e.g., emphasis on problem solving, student orientation; p < .01), characteristics of the faculty (e.g., commitment to teaching, tolerance of varied viewpoints), cynicism about patient care (p < .001), social biases (homophobia and aversion to intravenous drug users; p < .001), and AIDS-related attitudes (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Fundamental changes to residency training, all of which are associated with learner-centered education, can improve physicians' treatment of their patients with HIV and AIDS.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,1999 May,United States,1999,90
10352846,Personal reflections on occupational health in the twentieth century: spiraling to the future.,"The history of occupational health in the United States during the twentieth century demonstrates pendular swings, with periods of rapid progress followed by periods of reversal. Happily, the last three decades have witnessed the most impressive gains, with establishment of a near-universal system for regulating conditions in the workplace, legitimization and growth of the occupational health professions, a marked increase in scientific research, most notably epidemiology, and the transfer of knowledge about occupational health to affected workers and the larger US population. Not surprisingly, rates of injury and illness have fallen. However, analysis of these cyclical historic changes suggests that extrinsic factors--broad social currents, changes in health care financing, and societal perceptions of health and disease--have dominated over enhanced scientific knowledge, technologic changes or professional achievements, usually the determinants of medical or public health advances. Practitioners of occupational health are not, and have never been, in a particularly advantageous position to fashion future events in their own field, and the current situation, however encouraging, is likely no exception.",Annual review of public health,1999,United States,1999,90
10351850,Psychosocial and demographic correlates of television viewing.,"PURPOSE: The present study was grounded in the notion that previously identified physical activity determinants were associated in reverse with television viewing. Identifying demographic and psychosocial correlates and other potential determinants of television viewing may allow for the development and conceptualization of models and interventions to reduce sedentary behavior. DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from self-report measures were analyzed using multiple hierarchical regression. SETTING: Data were collected from 1995 to 1996 on seniors attending a large public university in southern California. SAMPLE: Subjects were 321 female and 255 male university seniors attending a public university in southern California. The sample's ethnic distribution was 53.8% European-American, 16.3% Latino, 16.6% Asian/Pacific Islander, 16.1% African-American, and 4.3% other. MEASURES: Typical television viewing practices on weekdays and weekends were assessed using self-report items. Physical activity determinants were assessed using self-report measures derived from social cognitive theory and the transtheoretical model of behavior change. RESULTS: The variables explaining a significant amount of variance after controlling for ethnicity and employment status in females were barriers to physical activity (p < .05), body image dissatisfaction (p < .01), and processes of change (p < .02). The entire model for females captured 16% of the variance, with the psychosocial variables accounting for 8% of the variance. The significant variables in the male model were quality of life (p < .01) and grade point average (p < .03). The full model accounted for 15% of the variance, with nondemographic variables accounting for 5% of the variance in television viewing. CONCLUSIONS: Relationships between television viewing and potential determinants were found. However, additional variables that may influence the amount of television viewing need to be conceptualized and investigated.",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,1999 Mar-Apr,United States,1999,90

In this paper, we discuss the impact of the recent economic crisis on the health sector in Indonesia, and analyze the potential for implementing effective reform following the managed care model. The health sector is discussed, highlighting pre-existing problems in the health care supply environment. The determinants of the economic crisis are summarized, and the broad impacts of the crisis to date on the health sector are assessed. Next the prospects for success of current managed-care reform proposals are examined in some detail: viability of expanded managed care reform measures are assessed in light of the continuing crisis and its likely impacts on the consumers and suppliers of health care. Analysis of the potential impact of the continuing crisis focuses on key participants in health care reform: households, the government, and private health care providers. In conclusion the potential viability of managed care appears poor, given the current economic, political, and institutional conditions and likely future impacts, and suggest some alternative reform measures.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",1999 Mar,Ireland,1999,90
10351466,"The effect of delivery mechanisms on the uptake of bed net re-impregnation in Kilifi District, Kenya.","The results of recently completed trials in Africa of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITBN) offer new possibilities for malaria control. These experimental trials aimed for high ITBN coverage combined with high re-treatment rates. Whilst necessary to understand protective efficacy, the approaches used to deliver the intervention provide few indications of what coverage of net re-treatment would be under operational conditions. Varied delivery and financing strategies have been proposed for the sustainable delivery of ITBNs and re-treatment programmes. Following the completion of a randomized, controlled trial on the Kenyan coast, a series of suitable delivery strategies were used to continue net re-treatment in the area. The trial adopted a bi-annual, house-to-house re-treatment schedule free of charge using research project staff and resulted in over 95% coverage of nets issued to children. During the year following the trial, sentinel dipping stations were situated throughout the community and household members informed of their position and opening times. This free re-treatment service achieved between 61-67% coverage of nets used by children for three years. In 1997 a social marketing approach, that introduced cost-retrieval, was used to deliver the net re-treatment services. The immediate result of this transition was that significantly fewer of the mothers who had used the previous re-treatment services adopted this revised approach and coverage declined to 7%. The future of new delivery services and their financing are discussed in the context of their likely impact upon previously defined protective efficacy and cost-effectiveness estimates.",Health policy and planning,1999 Mar,England,1999,90

Logistic regression was used to estimate models of risk behaviour using the following variables: sex, mastery, self-esteem, sense of coherence, chronic stress, psychological distress, social support, income adequacy, education, and main activity (working, looking for work, attending school, other). Results of the analysis indicate that the most consistent predictors were chronic stress and main activity. Thus, social context appears to be an important influence on risk-related behaviour, and should be taken into account in approaches designed to promote health behaviours.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1999 Mar-Apr,Switzerland,1999,90
10348393,Psychological correlates of outcome following rehabilitation from stroke.,"OBJECTIVES: To confirm, in a new sample, the value of our previously described procedure for identifying abnormal illness behaviour (AIB) in stroke rehabilitation patients, and to examine the relative effects of AIB, depression, family functioning, knowledge of stroke, and expectations of rehabilitation on long-term rehabilitation outcome. DESIGN: A longitudinal design, with assessments on admission to and discharge from rehabilitation, and six and twelve months after discharge. SETTING: The study was undertaken in the rehabilitation unit at Repatriation General Hospital, in Adelaide, South Australia. SUBJECTS: Sixty twelve-month stroke survivors, residing in a family environment, who had undergone an inpatient rehabilitation programme. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AIB was assessed using the Illness Behaviour Questionnaire, depression with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, family functioning with the McMaster Family Assessment Device, stroke knowledge with the Stroke Care Information Test, and expectations of rehabilitation with an open-ended question. Functional outcome was assessed with the competence and performance assessments of the Australian ADL Index, and lifestyle activities with the Frenchay Activities Index. RESULTS: Using our previously derived AIB classification rule, AIB cases scored poorly on functional, social and psychological indicators. Further, cluster analysis of discharge data replicated the rule for identifying patients with AIB. AIB was a strong predictor of functional competence and performance at rehabilitation discharge and both six and twelve months later, while depression was associated with an inactive lifestyle at both six and twelve months. Greater stroke knowledge and clearer expectations of rehabilitation were associated with better functional outcome at discharge. Family functioning was strongly associated with lifestyle activities and ADL performance at both six and twelve months. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure for identifying AIB in this rehabilitation environment appears to be robust. AIB was a key determinant of long-term functional disability, while depression was associated with poorer social functioning. Family functioning was an important determinant of social activities, and of the activities the patient actually does, rather than those the patient is capable of carrying out. Good stroke knowledge and clear expectations of rehabilitation were important determinants of rehabilitation success, and should be fostered to ensure a good rehabilitation outcome. Psychological factors are crucial in determining long-term outcomes after rehabilitation from stroke.",Clinical rehabilitation,1999 Apr,England,1999,90

Traditional self-ratings of poor health are tested against more objectively measured instruments. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we find that health problems influence retirement plans more strongly than do economic variables. Specifically, men in poor overall health expected to retire one to two years earlier, an effect that persists after correcting for potential endogeneity of self-rated health problems. The effects of detailed health problems are also examined in depth.",Journal of health economics,1999 Apr,Netherlands,1999,90
10346032,Ecological and geographic characteristics predict nutritional status of communities: rapid assessment for poor villages.,"The quality of poverty alleviation programmes relies heavily on appropriate targeting and priority setting. Major problems in assessing poverty include identification of the indicators of poverty and the methods used for its assessment. Nutritional status, expressed by anthropometric indices, has been proposed as a poverty indicator because of its validity, objectivity, reliability and feasibility. This study was conducted to explore the application of remote sensing to poverty mapping based on nutritional status at the community level. Relationships between the nutritional status within a community and the ecological characteristics of the community were investigated. Multiple linear regression tests were executed, and the resultant equations were tested for their validity in predicting communities with poor nutritional status. Among geographical and ecological indicators used, distance to the nearest market, main soil type, rice field area, and perennial cultivation area were found to be most useful predictors for the ranking of the communities by nutritional status. Among non-ecological determinants, food consumption, health service status and living conditions were also found as predictors. The highest correlation was found if total population was also taken into account in the regression model (R2 = 0.69; p < 0.0001). In the assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of the eight models studied, 'undernutrition' was defined as a condition where a community belongs in the first quartile for nutritional status (highest prevalence of undernutrition), and the baseline nutritional survey was considered as a standard method for final diagnosis. Most models which included only ecological factors in the equations had lower sensitivity and specificity than models which included all determinant factors in the equations. All models which took into account the total population had higher sensitivity and specificity than those that did not take total population into account. The best model of those that took into account only the geographical and ecological characteristics of the community's living environment had similar sensitivity and specificity (80% and 94.1%, respectively) as the models that considered non-geographical and non-ecological variables in addition to geographical and ecological variables. In the case of West Sumatra, only four ecological and geographic characteristics were sufficient to predict poverty in village. Since these characteristics could be surveyed by remote sensing, it may well be possible to use remote sensing for a rapid method for poverty mapping.",Health policy and planning,1998 Dec,England,1998,90
10345539,Ensuring quality and accountability in managed care.,"The rapid growth of new forms of managed care in the United States in recent decades has brought with it increasing concerns regarding the quality of care delivered by practitioners in these plans. This article examines the various regulatory demands that are being placed on Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). The authors look at the major determinants that are likely to bring about significant changes in the health care sector for both patients and providers and predict how these shifts will affect the quality of health care services in the near future. They discuss how the quality of health care, rather than the cost of those services, can become and remain the primary factor in the delivery of health care services. Ultimately, they conclude that increased participation by the federal government is required to protect the rights of patients and ensure better quality and accountability for health care services delivered by MCOs.",Journal of health and human services administration,1998 Summer,United States,1998,90

In the analysis, SSI application is conceptualized as an outcome of a complex interaction among financial, sociodemographic, health, and informational factors as well as those indicative of elderly persons' subjective perception of need. The findings indeed confirmed that objective financial need does not automatically lead to SSI application. Sociodemographic and health-related factors mediating the objective financial need are identified, although the subjective perception of need and informational barriers requires further evaluation. Policy implications include continued dissemination of information about SSI and relaxation of the resource test to qualify more low-income elderly.",Journal of aging & social policy,1998,England,1998,90
10344890,Quality of life measurement in mental health. Introduction and overview of workshop findings.,"The Quality of Life Measurement Workshop was designed to address a number of specific questions relating to measurement and use of quality of life indicators among persons with chronic and severe mental illnesses. The issues surrounding measurement of quality of life among severely and persistently mentally ill people proved to be considerably more complex than originally imagined. Workshop discussions concentrated on the clear elaboration of the scope and nature of these complexities rather than on their complete resolution. Important themes that emerged were: the importance of quality of life for consumers/survivors and their family members, and as a basis for evaluating program effectiveness and the progress of mental health reform; the fact that persons with mental illness experience lower life satisfaction than the population as a whole; the importance for consumers/survivors of having a sense of control, companionship, feelings of optimism, and a purposeful and meaningful life; the subjective and personal nature of quality of life perspective and the need for flexible measurement instruments that permit differential weighting of factors to take account of these different views; the lack of attention to social stigma and family or caregiver burden in current conceptualizations and measurement approaches and the importance of these factors to consumers/survivors and family members; the overt focus on psychiatric symptomatology and the relative neglect of key quality of life considerations that are important to consumers/survivors and their families; the need for more operational measures, such as those in the health-related quality of life field, to be used as a basis for evaluating the worth of new and alternate models of service delivery; the potential for competing interests with respect to program accountability to consumers/survivors and their families, on the one hand, and funders on the other, and the importance of striking a balance; the importance of including quality of life measurements within the context of controlled clinical trials; the need for multiple measurement approaches, ensuring that scales are appropriately matched to study goals and objectives, recognizing that scales differ in their sensitivity to treatment change; commonly used measures such as rates of hospital recidivism or psychiatric symptomatology are ultimately too narrow and, when used alone, are un-satisfactory measures of quality of program outcomes; the importance of minimizing data collection burden by ensuring that routine data collection systems have clinical utility within the context of the consumer/provider encounter; the need for extreme caution when directly linking quality of life outcomes to program funding within the context of outcomes-management systems; the need to gain a greater understanding of determinants of quality of life such as gender, age, diagnosis, comorbidities, stage of illness, or cognitive and emotional impairments; the importance of normative data and the need to develop statistical benchmarks; the importance of distinguishing quality of life outcomes on which specific interventions can have an impact (proximal outcomes) from the broader socioeconomic determinants of quality of life over which programs and interventions have little direct control (distal outcomes); the added cost of collecting quality of life outcome data on a routine basis and the general lack of technical resources available to most intervention programs; the potential for quality of life outcomes to be misused within the context of accountability frameworks given their embryonic stage of development, a lack of understanding of what constitutes appropriate clinical or statistical benchmarks, and the risk of data degradation when outcomes are tied to program funding; and the need for client-based research which incorporates consumers/survivors and their family members into all facets of the research process from study design to interpretati",Canadian journal of community mental health = Revue canadienne de sante mentale communautaire,1998 Winter,Canada,1998,90

At the same time, their relatives with the stroke were assessed on mood and ability measures. Results showed that whereas stroke disability/aphasia did not account for carer distress, carer factors accounted for a significant amount of the distress.",International journal of language & communication disorders,1998,United States,1998,90
10343295,Poverty and Health: Debt Relief Could Help Achieve Human Rights Objectives.,"Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights clearly emphasizes health as a human right. Poverty and social exclusion are the most important drivers of ill-health. The causes of increasing poverty are complex but one significant factor is international debt. This affects mainly sub-Saharan Africa but, with the global economic crisis in South East Asia, may spread. Structural adjustment policies which cut social spending compound the health effects of debt and poverty. Privatization of health care and user charges particularly affect women, children, the disabled, and other marginalized communities. To improve health, governments and international institutions have a duty to examine the determinants of health, including human rights and economic policy.",Health and human rights,1998,United States,1998,90
10342798,Neighborhood social environment and risk of death: multilevel evidence from the Alameda County Study.,"Recent reports suggest the importance of associations between residential area characteristics and health status, but most research uses only census data to measure these characteristics. The current research examined the effect of overall neighborhood social environment on 11-year risk of death. On the basis of data, the authors developed a three-component neighborhood social environment scale: 1) commercial stores; 2) population socioeconomic status; and 3) environment/housing. Data from the 1983 wave of the Alameda County Study (n = 1,129) and deaths over 11 years were analyzed with two-level logistic regression models. Age- and sex-adjusted risk of death was higher for residents in low social environment neighborhoods (odds ratio = 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.15-2.18). Mortality risks were significantly higher in neighborhoods with a low social environment, even after account was taken of individual income level, education, race/ethnicity, perceived health status, smoking status, body mass index, and alcohol consumption. When each component of the neighborhood social environment characteristics score was examined separately, each was found to be associated with higher risk for mortality, independent of individual risk factors. These findings demonstrate the role of area characteristics as a health risk factor and point to the need for more focused attention to the meaning and measurement of neighborhood quality.",American journal of epidemiology,1999 May 15,United States,1999,90
10342797,Prisoners of the proximate: loosening the constraints on epidemiology in an age of change.,"""Modern epidemiology"" has a primary orientation to the study of multiple risk factors for chronic noncommunicable diseases. If epidemiologists are to understand the determinants of population health in terms that extend beyond proximate, individual-level risk factors (and their biological mediators), they must learn to apply a social-ecologic systems perspective. The mind-set and methods of modern epidemiology entail the following four main constraints that limit engagement in issues of wider context: 1) a preoccupation with proximate risk factors; 2) a focus on individual-level versus population-level influences on health; 3) a typically modular (time-windowed) view of how individuals undergo changes in risk status (i.e., a life-stage vs. a life-course model of risk acquisition); and 4) the, as yet, unfamiliar challenge of scenario-based forecasting of health consequences of future, large-scale social and environmental changes. The evolution of the content and methods of epidemiology continues. Epidemiologists are gaining insights into the complex social and environmental systems that are the context for health and disease; thinking about population health in increasingly ecologic terms; developing dynamic, interactive, life-course models of disease risk acquisition; and extending their spatial-temporal frame of reference as they perceive the health risks posed by escalating human pressures on the wider environment. The constraints of ""the proximate"" upon epidemiology are thus loosening as the end of the century approaches.",American journal of epidemiology,1999 May 15,United States,1999,90
10342546,"Social determinants of birthweight, ponderal index and gestational age in Sweden in the 1920s and the 1980s.","This study compared the effect of social class and marital status on birth outcomes in Sweden, using (i) data on all births at the Akademiska Hospital in Uppsala from 1920 to 1924 with socioeconomic information from records at birth; and (ii) a linkage of the Medical Births Registry for all births in Sweden in November/December 1985 to the 1985 Census. Preterm births (<37 weeks) have become less common during the 20th century. Between 1920-24 and 1985, mean and median birthweight increased, as did mean ponderal index, indicating a shift to the right of the birthweight and ponderal index distributions. In 1920-24, birthweight and ponderal index were associated with the social class of the household and with the marital status of the mother. Babies of single mothers were lighter and thinner, and had a much greater probability of being born preterm. In contrast, in 1985, maternal marital status (and cohabitation status) had a weaker effect on birthweight and ponderal index. The importance of household social class for ponderal index and preterm birth changed similarly, but its importance for birthweight remained. The mediating mechanism may have changed. Mothers from farming households now gave birth to the heaviest babies (nearly 200 g heavier than those of unskilled workers). Adjustment for a number of factors, including smoking, had a limited effect on these social class differences. In conclusion, biological processes during the foetal period are systematically linked to the social circumstances of the mother, but in a different way in the 1920s and in 1985.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1999 Apr,Norway,1999,90
10340810,Determinants of geographical variations in body mass index (BMI) and obesity in Spain.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with geographic variations in Body Mass Index (BMI) and obesity in Spain. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, ecological analysis using data on illiteracy rate (per 1000 population), energy intake (kcal/person/d), sedentary population (%), smoking population (%), alcohol consumption (g/person/d), and percentage of population aged 65 y or over, for Spain's 50 provinces. SUBJECTS: Non-institutionalized population aged 16y or over. MEASUREMENTS: Median BMI and percentage of population with obesity, defined as BMI > 30 kg/m2. RESULTS: There was a clear geographical pattern, with some areas in the south and north-west of the country registering the highest BMI and prevalence of obesity and a north-south pattern on illiteracy per 1000 population. Multivariate regression analysis showed that illiteracy, sedentary lifestyle and energy intake explain 35% and 14% of the variation in BMI and obesity, respectively. Illiteracy proved to be the variable most associated with both BMI (regression coefficient (beta = 0.01; P = 0.005) and obesity (beta = 0.05; P = 0.013). Sedentary lifestyle showed a statistically significant relationship with BMI (beta = 0.01; P = 0.03), but not with obesity (beta = 0.03; P = 0.581). Energy intake exhibited a relationship with BMI (beta < 0.01 P = 0.03) that lost statistical significance when adjusted for age. CONCLUSION: Geographical variations in BMI in Spain are partly explained by illiteracy, sedentary lifestyle and, to a lesser extent, energy intake, whereas regional variations in obesity are related only to the educational level of the population.",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,1999 Apr,England,1999,90

The constant frequency of monozygotic (MZ) pregnancies over time and in different geographical areas suggests that the determination of MZ twins is largely unchanged over time, and that a genetic mechanism may have a role. In contrast, temporal and geographical trends observed in dizygotic (DZ) pregnancies suggest that environmental factors play a role in determining this condition. At present, maternal age and hereditary components are the best-defined determinants for spontaneous multiple births.",Human reproduction update,1999 Mar-Apr,England,1999,90
10333907,Social environment and year of birth influence type 1 diabetes risk for African-American and Latino children.,"OBJECTIVE: Credible epidemiological data, primarily from European-origin populations, indicate that environmental factors play an important role in the incidence of type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A population-based registry of incident cases of type 1 diabetes among African-American and Latino children in Chicago was used to explore the influence of individual and neighborhood characteristics on diabetes risk. New cases of insulin-treated diabetes in African-American and Latino Chicagoans aged 0-17 years for 1985-1990 (n = 400) were assigned to one of 77 community areas based on street address. Census tables provided denominators, median household income, percentage of adults > or = 25 years old who had completed high school and college, and a crowding variable for each community area individual-level data were birth cohort, sex, and ethnicity. Outcomes in Poisson regression were sex-, ethnic-, and birth cohort-specific incidence rates. RESULTS: Significant univariate associations between diabetes risk and ethnicity, birth cohort, crowding, and the percentage of adults in each community area who had completed high school and college were observed. African-Americans had a relative risk (RR) of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.14-1.76) compared with Latinos. Risk varied significantly by birth cohort in both ethnic groups. For every 10% increase in the proportion of adults who completed college, the RR for diabetes increased by 25% (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.09-1.44]). Social class variables were significant determinants of risk for African Americans, but not for Latinos. CONCLUSIONS: The strong birth cohort and social class associations observed in this study implicate an infectious exposure linked with age.",Diabetes care,1999 Jan,United States,1999,90
10330741,Determinants of infant feeding practices in a low socio-economic area: identifying environmental barriers to breastfeeding.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify environmental barriers to breastfeeding. METHOD: Focus groups were conducted with young women, parents-to-be, mothers, fathers and grandmothers in 1996 in northern Adelaide, South Australia (a low socio-economic area). RESULTS: Seven focus groups (4-8 participants per group) were conducted. Breastfeeding was seen as being embarrassing to do in public, and not possible to combine with paid employment. While fathers were not supportive of their partners breastfeeding in public, health professionals were seen as strong advocates of breastfeeding. Bottle feeding was perceived to be more convenient for the mother, more acceptable in public but not as good as breastfeeding for the baby. CONCLUSION: An environmental that enables women to breastfeed is far from being achieved in this low socio-economic area, particularly in relation to breastfeeding in public. IMPLICATIONS: Breastfeeding promotion should have a public health focus, concentrating on creating a supportive breastfeeding environment through a multi strategy approach aimed not just at mothers but also at the community.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,1999 Apr,Australia,1999,90
10326697,"Concomitant chemoradiotherapy for patients with nonmetastatic breast carcinoma: side effects, quality of life, and organization.","BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate the personal experience of patients with nonmetastatic breast carcinoma who were treated with the concurrent administration of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in terms of side effects and quality of life (QL). METHODS: One hundred nine patients with nonmetastatic breast carcinoma, recruited between May 1995 and February 1997, were included in a protocol combining chemotherapy with mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide, administered intravenously in 4 cycles of 21 days, and concomitant radiotherapy. Side effects of treatment and its impact on patients' daily lives were measured using ad hoc questionnaires; QL was measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 QL questionnaire, and pain was measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: All patients agreed to participate. The mean number of chemotherapy and radiotherapy symptoms per cycle were: 7.2+/-2.5 and 2.4+/-1.8, respectively. Chemotherapy symptoms generally were more frequent and distressing than those of radiotherapy. The average pain score reported on the VAS by patients during treatment was 3.0+/-2.0. Multidimensional QL assessment showed that treatment mainly affects physical functioning and global QL. Multivariate analysis showed that the main determinants of QL at the end of treatment were fatigue, pain, and loss of appetite experienced during treatment. Moreover, 62.8% of patients required specific help for transportation to the hospital and/or home upkeep. CONCLUSIONS: The concurrent administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy deteriorates patients' QL but in a proportion similar to sequential administration while presenting the advantage of a shorter duration of treatment. However, increased fatigue, pain, and loss of appetite as well as difficulties in patients' daily lives have to be taken into account in therapeutic decision-making analysis.",Cancer,1999 May 15,United States,1999,90
10326055,Neighbourhood differences in diet: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether neighbourhood characteristics are related to dietary patterns independently of individual level variables. DESIGN: A cross sectional analysis of the relation between neighbourhood median household income and food and nutrient intakes, before and after adjustment for individual level variables. SETTING: Four United States communities (Washington Co, MD; Suburban Minneapolis, MN; Forsyth Co, NC, and Jackson, MS). PARTICIPANTS: 13,095 adults aged 45 to 64 years participating in the baseline examination of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, a prospective study of atherosclerosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Information on diet and individual level income was obtained from the baseline examination of the ARIC Study. Diet was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Information on neighbourhood (census defined block groups) median household income was obtained from the 1990 US Census. Multilevel models were used to account for the multilevel structure of the data. Living in lower income neighbourhoods was generally associated with decreased energy adjusted intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, and increased intake of meat. Patterns generally persisted after adjustment for individual level income, but were often not statistically significant. Inconsistent associations were recorded for the intake of saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and cholesterol. Overall, individual level income was a more consistent predictor of diet than neighbourhood income. CONCLUSION: Despite limitations in the definition and characterisation of neighbourhoods, this study found consistent (albeit small) differences across neighbourhoods in food intake, suggesting that more in depth research into potential neighbourhood level determinants of diet is warranted.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1999 Jan,England,1999,90

DESIGN: A cross sectional study of cognitive function was conducted within the Caerphilly Prospective Study of Heart Disease and stroke. SETTING: The Caerphilly Study was originally set up in 1979-83 when the men were 45-59 years of age. Extensive data are available on a wide range of lifestyle and other factors of possible relevance to cognitive decline. Associations between some of these and cognitive function are reported. PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of 1870 men aged 55-69 years. MAIN RESULTS: Age, social class, medication, and mood were found to be powerful determinants of performance. Self report data on the involvement of the men in leisure pursuits were examined by factor analysis. This indicated that the more intellectual leisure pursuits are the most strongly linked with performance. A measure of social contact showed a weak positive association with the test scores. Current cigarette smokers gave lower test cognitive function scores than either men who had never smoked, or ex-smokers. There was however no evidence of any gradient in function with the total lifetime consumption of tobacco. The disparity between these two data sets suggests that there had been prior selection of men who had originally started to smoke, but more particularly selection of those who later quit smoking. There was no significant association between alcohol consumption and cognitive function, though ex-drinkers had markedly lower test scores than either current drinkers or men who had never drunk alcohol. This seemed probably to be a consequence of an high prevalence of illness among the ex-drinkers. CONCLUSIONS: Age and social class show strong associations with cognitive function. Leisure persuits and social contact are also both positively associated. Neither tobacco smoking nor the drinking of alcohol seem to be associated with cognitive function, though there is evidence suggestive of self selection of both men who had never smoked and ex-smokers.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1999 Jan,England,1999,90
9933553,Individual recognition and memory in lobster dominance.,"American lobsters, Homarus americanus, form stable dominance relationships in captivity. Size, sex and stage in the moult cycle are important determinants for dominance. Other factors, such as recent agonistic experience play a role. This paper investigates how lobsters maintain their stable dominance relationships: they may recognize individuals or alternatively, recognize overall dominance status. We paired lobsters in two consecutive 'boxing matches'. Results indicate that lobsters remember familiar opponents when kept either in isolation or in communal tanks for 24 h between their first and second fights. Subordinates immediately backed away from familiar dominants, avoiding a second fight. In some animals, this memory lasted between 1-2 weeks if pairs were kept separate between the first and second fights. When paired for the second fight against unfamiliar dominant lobsters, subordinate lobsters from first fights actively fought and won the encounter. These results suggest that lobsters are capable of 'individual recognition'. In nature, the observed social organization of lobsters may be maintained by individual recognition of a small number of residents inhabiting separate, nearby shelters.

10320510,"A framework for the study of coping, illness behaviour and outcomes.","This paper presents a theoretical framework for the study of coping, illness attribution, health behaviour and outcomes. It is based upon models developed within health psychology and aims to provide a theoretical basis for nurse researchers to utilize psychosocial variables. It is an interactionist model which views outcomes as dependent upon both situation and person variables. The situation is viewed as the health threat or illness symptoms as well as the psychosocial context within which the person is operating. This context includes socio-economic factors, social support, social norms, and external factors such as the mass media. The experience of health threat is dependent upon individual appraisal, and the framework incorporates Folkman and Lazarus' transactional model of stress, as well as Leventhal's illness representation model. Behaviour and the perception of threat are also dependent upon outcome expectancies and the appraisal of one's own coping resources, and so the concepts of locus of control and self-efficacy are also incorporated. This framework allows one to identify determinants of behaviour and outcome, and will aid nurses in identifying areas for psycho-social intervention.",Journal of advanced nursing,1999 May,England,1999,90
10320501,A socio-ecological approach to understanding barriers to prenatal care for women of low income.,"This paper critically examines the notion of barriers as conceptualized in the literature and suggests an expanded orientation to more fully appreciate its complexity. This alternative approach not only takes into account factors and processes relevant to the individual that create constraints to utilization, but also acknowledges influences on the design and delivery of health care. These latter considerations determine the availability and characteristics of programmes and services that may or may not encourage or enable participation by persons of low income. A socio-ecological model is proposed that compels health care practitioners and researchers to acknowledge the many influences on utilization behaviour. The literature on barriers to prenatal care is subsequently reviewed and evaluated, with consideration given to the range of behavioural determinants suggested by the model. Finally, a case is made for qualitative methods for inquiry to further enhance knowledge about factors and processes influencing use of the health care system, including prenatal care. It is argued that these approaches lead to enhanced appreciation of behaviour as a social product and are consistent with the ideology of health promotion.",Journal of advanced nursing,1999 May,England,1999,90

Since fecundity is best measured by studying time to pregnancy, valid and well-recognized instruments are needed for data collection. A standardized questionnaire on fecundity not only has to obtain information on waiting time, but also information on the importance of evaluation results. The use of contraceptive methods, the understanding of family planning, and behavioral changes driven by past reproductive experience are issues of importance for designing and interpreting results, as are other sources of bias also.","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",1999,Finland,1999,90

The education and the working position showed different correlation with incidence rates of different types of viral hepatitis A, B, non-A non-B. The hepatitis A risk is proportional to education and the probability of hepatitis B and non-A non-B is higher in low social classes. This situation is only apparently a balanced risk: the clinical seriousness and the strong probability of complications of hepatitis B and non-A non-B make the risks deeply unequal.",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,1998,Italy,1998,90
10234422,Perceptions of spouse dominance predict blood pressure reactivity during marital interactions.,"Cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) has been identified as a potential mechanism linking a variety of psychosocial processes to the development of cardiovascular disease. Although the effects of hostile and supportive social stimuli on CVR have been studied extensively, less is known about the effects of a second major dimension of social relations--dominance versus submissiveness. In the present study, 45 married couples participated in an interaction task involving the assertion of differing opinions. Subjects also provided ratings of their typical level of dominance versus submissiveness in relation to their spouse. Consistent with predictions derived from related conceptual models of psychological determinants of CVR, blood pressure reactivity was positively associated with perceptions of the spouse as dominant. At the highest level of perceived spouse dominance, CVR was attenuated, again consistent with prediction. Results are discussed in terms of the usefulness of conceptual models of interpersonal relations and motivation as guides in studying the social determinants of CVR, as well as the value of marital interactions as a context for understanding CVR.",Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,1998 Fall,England,1998,90
10224513,Psychological stress and neuroendocrine function in humans: the last two decades of research.,"This paper reviews experimental contributions published in the last two decades and exploring the effect of emotional stress on neuroendocrine function in healthy humans. Laboratory studies allow standardization of the stressor and better control for known confounding factors. Commonly used stressors are mental arithmetics, speech tasks, the Stroop test, videogame playing, films or videotapes and interviews. Little is known about the generalizability of laboratory results, with some studies suggesting great caution in extrapolating data to real-life stress conditions. Another strategy is studying the psychoendocrine reaction to real-life stressors, such as bereavement or anticipated loss, academic examinations, everyday work and parachute jumping. The effects of different stressors on neuroendocrine axes are reviewed, as well as the influence of gender, age, personality, coping style, social support, biological and nonbiological interventions. The subjective perception of the situation is probably a main determinant of the psychoendocrine response pattern. In fact, marked variability in individual responses to a variety of stressors has frequently been observed. Evidently, the 'objective' characteristics of a given event are not the only determinants of reaction to the event itself. According to a constructivistic perspective, every given stressor has a strictly personal and idiosyncratic meaning and loses its 'objective' characteristics. Of course, biological factors may also play a part. In any case, it is mandatory to overcome a rigid dichotomy between psychological and biological processes. Dualistic conceptions which imply a determination of the physical by the psychological or vice versa should give place to a systemic conception, which implies mutual, circular interactions.",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,1999,Switzerland,1999,90
10224633,Trait diagnosticity versus behavioral consistency as determinants of impression change in adulthood.,"Age differences in the types of processing associated with impression change were examined. Young, middle-aged, and older adults formed an impression of a target based on a short vignette that described either positive or negative characteristics in 1 of 2 domains (ability vs. morality). Impression change was examined after presentation of additional behavioral information that was inconsistent with the original vignette. Replicating previous findings, younger adults changed their impressions in response to the consistency of the new information with the initial target description. In contrast, impression change in the 2 older groups was based on the trait diagnosticity of the original and new information, suggesting greater use of inferential, knowledge-based processing with age. The results indicate that qualitative difference exist in impression change processes, with different-aged individuals considering different types of information when constructing and updating social representations.",Psychology and aging,1999 Mar,United States,1999,90
10220021,Gender differences in structural and behavioral determinants of health: an analysis of the social production of health.,"This paper explores aspects of the social production of health by focussing on the ways in which levels of health are shaped by structures of social inequality and behaviors or 'lifestyles'. We address two questions: What is the relative importance of the social, structural and behavioral determinants of health? And, are there gender differences in the determinants of health? These questions are explored using multiple regression analyses of data from the 1994 Canadian National Population Health Survey. Two measures of health are used: subjective health status and the Health Utilities Index (a measure of functional health status). By structural determinants we refer to age, family structure, main activity, education, occupation, income and social support. Behavioral determinants include lifestyle factors related to smoking, drinking, weight and physical activity. Findings indicate that the structures of social inequality are the most important determinants of health acting both independently and through their influence on the behavioral determinants of health. There are very real differences in the factors that predict women's and men's health. For women, social structural factors appear to play a more important role in determining health. Being in the highest income category, working full-time and caring for a family and having social support are more important predictors of good health for women than men. Smoking and alcohol consumption are more important determinants of health status for men than women, while body weight and being physically inactive are more important for women than men. Our findings suggest the value of models which include a wide range of structural and behavioral variables and affirm the importance of looking more closely at gender differences in the determinants of health.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 May,England,1999,90
10215116,Factors associated with condom use in the male population of Mexico City.,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are an important public health problem, due to their medical, social and economic repercussions. Therefore, more knowledge is needed about the sexual behaviour that promotes their spread, in order to improve control and prevention strategies. Our aim was to determine the frequency of male condom use associated with sexual behaviour factors, a history of and knowledge about STDs in a sample of the male population in Mexico City. During 1994 a cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out, using multi-stage sampling with conglomerates, in 1377 men from 15 to 49 years old. The mean age was 34.5 years (SD 7.5 years). Mean age at first sexual relations was 17.7 years (SD 2.8 years). The global proportion of condom use during the last sexual relation was 24.6%; use according to type of female sex partner in the last year was 18.8% with regular partners and 62.5% with occasional partners. The principal predictors of male condom use, identified through statistical modelling, were: younger age (<25 years), middle and high education level (>9 years), middle and high socioeconomic level and type of sexual partners (occasional and regular). This population has risk factors for acquiring and transmitting some STDs, such as occasional sexual partners and a history of STDs. Characteristics which are important in relation to male condom use were identified, such as age (younger than 35), education (complete junior high school or more) and type of sexual partners (occasional and regular).",International journal of STD & AIDS,1999 Feb,England,1999,90
10214500,Prepubertal boys' sexual behavior and behavior problems.,"The increasingly early initiation of penetrative sexual practices and the implication for prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases requires the study of childhood sexual behavior and its determinants. In adolescence, early sexual initiation is associated with other ""problem behaviors"" (Jessor & Jessor, 1977). To explore an analogous association for the middle childhood years, we studied 126 boys aged 5 to 11 years at increased risk for the development of conduct-disorder-related behavior with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/4-18 (Achenbach, 1991) and reevaluated 112 of them 15 months later. At both time points, the boys scored higher on the Sex Problems scale as well as on the nonsexual CBCL scales than Achenbach's nonclinical norm sample. Within the at-risk sample, the Sex Problems scale was significantly related to externalizing problem behaviors, but also to the other CBCL scales of behavioral/emotional problems. These data point to childhood precursors of the association observed by Jessor and Jessor (1977) in adolescence.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,1999 Apr,United States,1999,90
10214232,Empirical testing of a longitudinal model derived from the Roy adaptation model.,"This article presents the steps and results of the empirical testing of a theoretical longitudinal model, derived from Roy's nursing conceptual model, of the psychosocial determinants of adaptation in different target groups. The model was elaborated and empirically verified based on the integrated results of four longitudinal studies involving groups vulnerable to mental health problems. By means of structural equation analyses, the cross-sectional model was verified at two points in time. The results showed that the model was relatively stable over time. The model was also tested using longitudinal data. Results showed little consistency in the patterns of relationships across studies. The significant links that emerged from the analyses shed some light on the complexity of the process of adaptation to different types of stressors. They underscore the importance for nursing practice to develop interventions aimed at certain variables: perceived stress, conflicts in the exchange of support, and passive and avoidance coping strategies. The results also highlight the importance of the relationship between perceived stress, passive/avoidance coping strategies and psychological distress.",Nursing science quarterly,1998 Winter,United States,1998,90
10212524,HIV stress in primary school teachers in Zambia.,"A study was made of stress factors experienced by primary school teachers in Zambia after they had attended a course on stress management and counselling skills. Their pupils were significantly affected by poverty, death and illness of parents, fellow-pupils and teachers, teenage sex and pregnancy, violence in the home and, among girls, low self-esteem. The HIV epidemic had a major bearing on these factors, and there were wide-ranging effects on the teachers' own lives. Despite the training they had been given, many teachers felt that they could not adequately counsel their pupils on these matters. The teachers were in need of continuing support and training to enable them to cope with this aspect of their work.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,1999,Switzerland,1999,90
10207719,Inheritance of LDL peak particle diameter: results from a segregation analysis in Israeli families.,"Genetic and environmental determinants of LDL peak particle diameter (LDL-PPD) were investigated in a sample of 80 kindreds residing in kibbutz settlements in Israel. The sample included 182 males and 191 females ages 15-93 years. LDL-PPD levels were first adjusted for variability in sex and age. Commingling analysis demonstrated that a mixture of two normal distributions fit the adjusted LDL-PPD levels better than did a single normal distribution. Complex segregation analysis was first applied to these sex and age adjusted data but was not conclusive. However, when the regression model for sex and age allowed coefficients to be ousiotype (class) specific, the mixed environmental model was rejected while a major Mendelian model was not. These results suggest that the particular genotypes determined by the major gene, which are associated with different phenotypic variances, are likely to be more realistic, and that this analytic approach can contribute to improving our understanding of the genetics of LDL particle size.",Genetic epidemiology,1999,United States,1999,90
10203445,[Restructuring of production and occupational accidents in Brazil: structure and trends].,"During the last two decades, incidence rates of occupational accidents have been decreasing in Brazil. Mortality has also decreased, but not as sharply as incidence. Changes in reporting of occupational accidents have been the main argument used to explain such trends. This time-series study covering occupational accidents from 1970 to 1995 clearly shows the link between occupational accidents and social and economical determinants. Comparing 14 Brazilian States, a positive linear regression (r=0.80) was detected between proportion of workers in industrial production and accidents. In the 1980s, Brazil's economic recession led to an increase in unemployment. The decline in industrial jobs - those with a higher risk of accidents ( was accented by the restructuring of production and increased use of computer and robotics technologies in various manufacturing sectors. The result was a heavy shift of the work force from industry to commerce and services - jobs entailing lower risk of accidents. These factors influenced trends in occupational accidents in Brazil during this 25-year period.",Cadernos de saude publica,1999 Jan-Mar,Brazil,1999,90
10202805,Coping efforts in daily life: role of big five traits and problem appraisals.,"The role of problem appraisal and Big Five traits in coping with bothersome daily events was investigated. Community-residing men completed diaries regarding stressful events and coping for eight consecutive days. Results of multi-level analyses indicated that lower perceived control over events was associated with greater reliance on distraction, catharsis, acceptance, seeking emotional social support, but less use of direct action. Stressor severity was positively associated with catharsis and religion, but negatively associated with acceptance. Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to experience, and Conscientiousness predicted coping strategy use. In addition, broad personality dimensions moderated relations between appraisals (perceived uncontrolability and severity) and coping strategy use. Although previous research implicated perceived control in coping, the present study suggests that both appraisals of stressor severity and individual differences in personality are also important determinants of coping strategy use at the daily level.",Journal of personality,1999 Apr,United States,1999,90
10198662,Predictors of change in children's physical activity over 20 months. Variations by gender and level of adiposity.,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity declines during childhood and determinants of this decline are poorly understood. The purpose of this prospective study was to examine modifiable psychological and social correlates of physical activity change over 20 months. SUBJECTS: 370 girls and 362 boys in public schools, studied through the 4th and 5th grades. MEASURES: A physical activity index was computed from child reports, parent reports, and objective activity monitoring. Predictor variables were assessed by child and parent surveys. RESULTS: In multiple regressions, after adjustments for demographic variables, psychological variables explained 4% of the variance in boys' physical activity change, parent variables explained 8%, and interactions with skinfolds explained 3%, for a total of 15% (unadjusted). Regarding change in girls' physical activity, psychological variables explained 3%, parent variables explained 1.5%, and interactions with skinfold explained 1.5%, for a total of 6% explained variance (unadjusted). There were differences in predictors among children with high and low levels of body fat. CONCLUSIONS: Children's preferences for physical activity and frequency of parents transporting children to activity locations explained significant proportions of variance for girls and boys. The results support a dynamic model of the determinants of children's physical activity, but most of the variance was left unexplained.",American journal of preventive medicine,1999 Apr,Netherlands,1999,90
10197574,Socioeconomic differences in weight gain and determinants and consequences of coronary risk factors.,"BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity is a major public health concern in many developed countries. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe socioeconomic differences in change in body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) from age 25 y, assess possible factors behind these differences, and study whether socioeconomic differences in a variety of coronary risk factors can be accounted for by change in BMI. DESIGN: The data come from a cohort study of London-based civil servants (Whitehall II), who participated in the first (1985-1988) and third (1991-1993) phases of the study and were 35-55-y old at phase 1: altogether there were 5507 men and 2466 women. Both study phases included a questionnaire and a screening examination. RESULTS: In men and women, employment grade--the measure of socioeconomic status used in this cohort--was strongly related to BMI gain from age 25 y to phase 3 (25 y apart on average). The lower the grade the larger the gain in BMI. Adjustment for health behaviors reduced the grade differences in BMI gain by approximately 20%. A substantial part of the grade differences in diastolic and systolic blood pressure and plasma triacylglycerol concentrations could be accounted for by BMI change from age 25 y. CONCLUSIONS: Grade differences in BMI change are evident, but many of the determinants of these differences remain unknown. If lower-status persons continue to gain weight more rapidly than higher-status persons, overweight is likely to be of growing importance as a pathway to social inequalities in ill health.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1999 Apr,United States,1999,90
10193855,Sociodemographic and nutritional determinants of obesity in Belgium.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between sociodemographic, dietary factors and physical activity and the prevalence of obesity in the Belgian general population. DESIGN: Base-line data from the Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health (BIRNH) study (1979-1984). SUBJECTS: A total of 5837 men and 5243 women aged 25-74y were included in the analysis. The sample was considered representative of the Belgian population. MEASUREMENTS: Using the body mass index (BMI) as the criterion, obesity was defined as a BMI> or =30 kg/m2. Nutritional data were assessed by a 24 h food record. Physical activity level (PAL) was calculated by dividing total caloric intake by an estimation of basal metabolic rate (BMR, predicted from gender, weight and age). Age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) of the prevalence of obesity were estimated by multilogistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Prevalence of obesity was 12.1% in men and 18.4% in women. In both sexes, prevalence of obesity increased gradually in each 10-year age category (P<0.0001) and steeply decreased with level of education. Comparing lowest (Q1) to highest quartile (Q4), after adjustment for age, prevalence of obesity decreased with total carbohydrate intake, as well as total sugar intake in both sexes, and increased with total fat intake only in men. Obesity increased with a high fat to sugar ratio (men: OR(Q4/Q1) = 1.56; confidence interval (CI): 1.25-1.93; women: OR(Q4/Q1) = 1.45; CI: 1.17-1.80). PAL was inversely and very strongly associated with obesity (men: OR(Q4/Q1) = 0.20; CI: 0.15-0.26; women: OR(Q4/Q1) = 0.18; CI: 0.14-0.23). The same associations were observed with the mean BMI. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that prevalence of obesity is particularly high in Belgium. Low level of education and reduced physical activity, increased fat intake and especially elevated fat to sugar ratio appear to be powerful determinants of obesity in this Belgian population.",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,1999 Feb,England,1999,90
10190343,Differences between school classes in preschoolers' psychosocial adjustment: evidence for the importance of children's interpersonal relations.,"We examined differences between school classes with respect to three aspects of psychosocial adjustment at school, namely the extent that children in the class liked to play with each other, the number of teacher-reported behaviour problems, and children's feelings of wellbeing at school. The sample consisted of 1282 4- to 5-year-olds from 94 school classes and 51 schools, but due to nonresponse actual sample sizes were somewhat smaller for most analyses. Multilevel analyses showed that on average 87% of the variance was at the child level, 11% at the class level, and 3% at the school level. This indicated that a non-negligible amount of variance could not be accounted for by factors at the child level. Furthermore, this variance was mainly associated with differences between classes instead of differences between schools. A set of variables that pertained to sociodemographic characteristics of schools, school facilities, organisational aspects of classrooms, and the teacher did not provide an adequate explanation for the differences in adjustment levels. In contrast to these traditional variables, social network indices yielded substantial correlations, showed consistent trends across the different adjustment measures, and fulfilled the necessary requirement that to explain differences between school classes the predictor variables themselves should differ for classes within the same school. These results suggested that aspects of the interpersonal relations of children in the classroom such as proximity, integration, and the amount of contact could be determinants of differences between school classes in psychosocial adjustment.","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",1999 Mar,England,1999,90

A confidential questionnaire was voluntarily completed by Caucasians (n = 102) and African-Americans (n = 81) at a medium-sized regional university. The data analysis revealed a significant gender effect on alcohol consumption, with men consuming more alcohol than women. There was no significant main effect of race on alcohol consumption. In addition, Caucasian binge drinkers had significantly higher interpersonal problem behavior scores than did binge-drinking African-Americans, and binge-drinking African-Americans had higher intrapersonal problem behavior scores than did binge-drinking Caucasians.",Addictive behaviors,1999 Jan-Feb,England,1999,90
10178583,Willingness to pay for rural health insurance through community participation in India.,"The main objective of this article is to examine the willingness to pay for a viable rural health insurance scheme through community participation in India, and the policy concerns it engenders. The willingness to pay for a rural health insurance scheme through community participation is estimated through a contingent valuation approach (logit model), by using the rural household survey on health from Karnataka State in India. The results show that insurance/saving schemes are popular in rural areas. In fact, people have relatively good knowledge of insurance schemes (especially life insurance) rather than saving schemes. Most of the people stated they are willing to join and pay for the proposed rural health insurance scheme. However, the probability of willingness to join was found to be greater than the probability of willingness to pay. Indeed, socio-economic factors and physical accessibility to quality health services appeared to be significant determinants of willingness to join and pay for such a scheme. The main justification for the willingness to pay for a proposed rural health insurance scheme are attributed from household survey results: (a) the existing government health care provider's services is not quality oriented; (b) is not easily accessible; and, (c) is not cost effective. The discussion suggests that policy makers in India should take serious note of the growing influence of the private sector and people's willingness to pay for organizing a rural health insurance scheme to provide quality and efficient health care in India. Policy interventions in health should not ignore private sector existence and people's willingness to pay for such a scheme and these two factors should be explicitly involved in the health management process. It is also argued that regulatory and supportive policy interventions are inevitable to promote this sector's viable and appropriate development in organizing a health insurance scheme.",The International journal of health planning and management,1998 Jan-Mar,England,1998,90
22151109,Intrathecal therapy for cancer and nonmalignant pain: patient selection and patient management.,"Intrathecal drug delivery improves pain relief, reduces suffering, and enhances quality of life in the small proportion of patients who do not respond well to oral analgesics, including oral morphine. Although morphine is the ""gold standard,"" and the only drug approved for intrathecal pain therapy in the United States, off-label use of alternative agents appears promising, particularly in patients with neuropathic pain. Careful patient selection and management are significant determinants of successful treatment outcomes. Patient selection criteria for cancer and nonmalignant pain are similar; however, a more comprehensive psychological and social assessment is required for patients with nonmalignant pain. In addition, all patients (those with cancer or nonmalignant pain) must exhibit a positive response to an epidural or intrathecal screening test. A multidisciplinary team approach, involving psychologists, nurses, physical therapists, social workers, and spiritual leaders should be used to manage patients. Current practices for patient selection and management, screening tests, and dosing guidelines for intrathecal drug delivery systems are discussed.",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,1999 Apr,United States,1999,90
10095220,Determinants of dentists' decisions to initiate dental implant treatment: a judgment analysis.,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Do psychosocial patient characteristics influence the decision of a dentist in recommending implant treatment? PURPOSE: This study assessed the importance that dental general practitioners attach to psychosocial patient characteristics when judging the suitability of these patients for dental implant treatment. METHOD AND MATERIAL: The judgment strategy of 30 Dutch dental practitioners was studied by using 2 tasks. Dentists first judged a series of written scenarios representing fictitious patients, each patient being characterized by 4 psychosocial aspects to determine the patients' suitability for implant treatment. The second task involved rank ordering 14 patient characteristics according to their importance in implant treatment decisions. RESULTS: Dentists judged the personal appearance of the patient and, to a lesser degree, the patient's socioeconomic status to influence decisions to treat. However, these characteristics are ranked as quite unimportant in decision making, whereas motivation, oral hygiene, and level of neuroticism were the most important patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The results on the 2 tasks were clearly not in agreement. There was a substantial disagreement between what dentists say to be important characteristics (rank order task) and the characteristics they actually use to judge the suitability for implant treatment (scenario task). Moreover, it appeared that agreement among the dentists is quite low, especially for the scenario task.",The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,1999 Apr,United States,1999,90
10094291,Levels of dichloro-dyphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) metabolites in maternal milk and their determinant factors.,"To document the levels and the determinants of dichloro-dyphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) metabolites in maternal milk, we conducted a cohort study of 50 adult females who lived in Mexico City. We measured social and dietary characteristics via interview. Levels of DDT metabolites were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The mean values (lipid milk basis) were 0.162 ppm p,p'-DDT; 0.138 ppm o,p'-DDT; and 0.594 ppm 2,2(bis)p-chlorophyenyl-1-1-dichloroethylene (DDE). The main determinants of DDT metabolites were maternal age, lifetime lactation, history of living in an agricultural area, and consumption of salted meat and fish. We estimated that 6.0% of the breast-fed babies had daily intakes of DDT above the level of 0.005 mg/kg d recommended by the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (WHO/FAO).

10093353,Social and cultural factors as determinants of self-rated health in Greenland.,"In 1993-94, a countrywide health interview survey was performed in 38 towns and villages throughout Greenland. Information was collected on self-rated health and self-reported disease, social and cultural factors, lifestyle, and living conditions. A total of 1,580 adult Greenlanders and 148 Danes was interviewed (57% of the sample). Respondents were classified according to ethnic self-identification and job category, but these customary classifications were not satisfactory. An alternative classification according to exposure to traditional Greenlandic hunting culture and Danish culture during childhood was tested. The population fell into three subgroups, each with its own socioeconomic, ethnic, and occupational pattern, and with different health and health behavior. The new classification has distinct advantages as a supplement to the usual classification according to ethnicity and job category. The aim of the present paper is to present a comprehensive health interview survey from Greenland and to discuss some considerations regarding sociocultural classification of the population.",International journal of circumpolar health,1998,United States,1998,90
10091752,The quality of swallowing for patients with operable esophageal carcinoma: a randomized trial comparing surgery with radiotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Surgery is considered the standard treatment for operable esophageal carcinoma, although there is no compelling evidence that surgery can achieve better results than radiotherapy. There has previously been no direct randomized comparison of these two modalities with survival or disease specific outcome end points. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with operable squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were randomly allocated to surgery or radiotherapy after stratification for tumor length (< or = or >5 cm). Those randomized to surgery underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with limited lymphadenectomy, whereas those in the radiotherapy arm received 50 gray in 28 fractions followed by a 15-gray boost to the primary tumor. Disease specific outcome was assessed for 4 subgroups: 1) disease specific symptoms, 2) physical symptoms, 3) ability to work, and 4) social/family interaction and global perception of disease specific outcome. The questionnaire was given prior to treatment and posttreatment at 3-month intervals for 1 year. Death was a secondary end point. RESULTS: There was an overall improvement in the quality of swallowing in both treatment arms after treatment and with the passage of time. The swallowing status was better in the surgery arm than in the radiotherapy arm at 6 months after treatment (P = 0.03, Fisher's exact test). Logistic regression analysis showed randomization arm (P = 0.035), time since treatment (P = 0.003), and pretreatment swallowing status to be significant determinants of posttreatment swallowing status. Surgery was twice as likely to result in improvement in swallowing than radiotherapy after correction for time and pretreatment swallowing status. Overall survival was better in the surgery arm than in the radiotherapy arm (P = 0.002, log rank test) (OR = 2.74 with 95% confidence intervals 1.51-4.98; P < 0.009, Cox proportional hazards model). CONCLUSIONS: Both surgery and radiotherapy can improve the quality of swallowing significantly for patients with operable esophageal carcinoma. Surgery is marginally superior to radiotherapy in improving the quality of swallowing. In this trial, survival in the surgery arm was significantly better than in the radiotherapy arm, although the small number of patients is a limitation.",Cancer,1999 Feb 15,United States,1999,90

10081241,Ethnicity and contraceptive use in sub-Saharan Africa: the case of Ghana.,"Using a sub-sample of ever-married women from the 1993 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS), this study examines differentials in contraceptive use in six cultural groups: Ga-Adangbe, Twi, Fante/other Akans, Ewe, Guan/others and Mole-Dagbani. Multivariate analysis is used to explore whether reported ethnic differentials in contraceptive use can be attributed to ethnicity or to other characteristics that distinguish the ethnic groups. Overall, the findings are generally more consistent with the 'characteristics' hypothesis, because contraceptive use differentials by ethnic group is accounted for by differences in socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of these women. However, for the Fante/other Akans, even after the necessary controls, ethnicity continued to emerge as a significant determinant of contraceptive use. Programmatic implications of these results are discussed.",Journal of biosocial science,1999 Jan,England,1999,90
10081240,Marriage structure and contraception in Niger.,"Analysis of the 1992 Niger Demographic and Health Survey showed that although roughly two-thirds of both polygamous and monogamous women approve of birth control, polygamous wives are less likely than monogamous wives to discuss family size or birth control with their husband or to plan on using birth control. The study suggests that characteristics of polygamous couples have caused polygamous women to be more resistant to birth control use than monogamous women. The polygamous women tended to be married to older men who had not gone to primary school and who desired more children than monogamous husbands. The influence of marital structure is not significantly associated with intention to use birth control when the husband's age and the wife's ideal number of children were controlled for in the multivariate logistic regression model suggesting that background social factors may be more influential. In fact, educational level and age at first marriage were significantly associated with attitudes towards birth control and also with marital structure.",Journal of biosocial science,1999 Jan,England,1999,90
10081237,Effects of the status of women on the first-birth interval in Indian urban society.,"The status of women, which is relative and multidimensional, has an important bearing on any long-term reduction in fertility. In Indian society, where cohabitation and childbearing are socially sanctioned only after marriage, the length of the first-birth interval affects the completed family size by influencing the spacing and childbearing pattern of a family. This study examines the influence of certain aspects of the status of married women--education, employment, role in family decision making, and age at marriage--along with three socioeconomic variables--per capita income of the family, social position of the household, and the caste system--on the duration of the first-birth interval in an urban Hindu society of the north-east Indian state of Assam. The data were analysed by applying life table and hazard regression techniques. The results indicate that a female's age at marriage, education, current age, role in decision making, and the per capita income of the household are the main covariates that strongly influence the length of the first-birth interval of Hindu females of urban Assam. Of all the covariates studied, a female's education appears to be a key mediating factor, through its influence on her probability of employment outside the home and thereby an earned income and on her role in family decision making. Unlike other Indian communities, the effect of the caste system does not have a significant effect on first-birth timing in this urban Hindu society.",Journal of biosocial science,1999 Jan,England,1999,90
10081236,Dopamine receptor genes are associated with age at first sexual intercourse.,"The dopaminergic system in the brain seems to play an important role in the regulation of sexual behaviour. The relationship between genes for the D1, D2 and D4 dopamine receptors and age at first sexual intercourse (AFSI) was examined in a sample of 414 non-Hispanic, European-American men and women. A significant association was observed between a DRD2 allele and AFSI and an even stronger association when the DRD2 allele was interacted with a DRD1 allele. A constrained regression model was constructed predicting AFSI using sex and a group of nine psychosocial variables as predictors. Adding the DRD2 and the DRD2-by-DRD1 predictors to this model increased the explained variance by 23 and 55%, respectively. Although these findings suggest a stronger association among males than among females, further research will be necessary to clarify this question, as well as to establish whether the observed association holds in other racial/ethnic groups.",Journal of biosocial science,1999 Jan,England,1999,90
10080364,Hierarchies and cliques in the social networks of health care professionals: implications for the design of dissemination strategies.,"Interest in how best to influence the behaviour of clinicians in the interests of both clinical and cost effectiveness has rekindled concern with the social networks of health care professionals. Ever since the seminal work of Coleman et al. [Coleman, J.S., Katz, E., Menzel, H., 1966. Medical Innovation: A Diffusion Study. Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis.], networks have been seen as important in the process by which clinicians adopt (or fail to adopt) new innovations in clinical practice. Yet very little is actually known about the social networks of clinicians in modern health care settings. This paper describes the professional social networks of two groups of health care professionals, clinical directors of medicine and directors of nursing, in hospitals in England. We focus on network density, centrality and centralisation because these characteristics have been linked to access to information, social influence and social control processes. The results show that directors of nursing are more central to their networks than clinical directors of medicine and that their networks are more hierarchical. Clinical directors of medicine tend to be embedded in much more densely connected networks which we describe as cliques. The hypotheses that the networks of directors of nursing are better adapted to gathering and disseminating information than clinical directors of medicine, but that the latter could be more potent instruments for changing, or resisting changes, in clinical behaviour, follow from a number of sociological theories. We conclude that professional socialisation and structural location are important determinants of social networks and that these factors could usefully be considered in the design of strategies to inform and influence clinicians.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Mar,England,1999,90
10079398,"Income inequality, social cohesion, and class relations: a critique of Wilkinson's neo-Durkheimian research program.","Wilkinson's ""income inequality and social cohesion"" model has emerged as a leading research program in social epidemiology. Public health scholars and activists working toward the elimination of social inequalities in health can find several appealing features in Wilkinson's research. In particular, it provides a sociological alternative to former models that emphasize poverty, health behaviors, or the cultural aspects of social relations as determinants of population health. Wilkinson's model calls for social explanations, avoids the subjectivist legacy of U.S. functionalist sociology that is evident in ""status"" approaches to understanding social inequalities in health, and calls for broad policies of income redistribution. Nevertheless, Wilkinson's research program has characteristics that limit its explanatory power and its ability to inform social policies directed toward reducing social inequalities in health. The model ignores class relations, an approach that might help explain how income inequalities are generated and account for both relative and absolute deprivation. Furthermore, Wilkinson's model implies that social cohesion rather than political change is the major determinant of population health. Historical evidence suggests that class formation could determine both reductions in social inequalities and increases in social cohesion. Drawing on recent examples, the authors argue that an emphasis on social cohesion can be used to render communities responsible for their mortality and morbidity rates: a community-level version of ""blaming the victim."" Such use of social cohesion is related to current policy initiatives in the United States and Britain under the New Democrat and New Labor governments.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1999,United States,1999,90
10076582,Life-course events and experiences: association with fruit and vegetable consumption in 3 ethnic groups.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine how life-course experiences and events are associated with current fruit and vegetable consumption in 3 ethnic groups. DESIGN: A theoretic model developed from previous qualitative research guided the development of a telephone survey. Data were collected on fruit and vegetable consumption, sociodemographic characteristics, ethnic identity, and life-course events and experiences, including food upbringing, social roles, food skills, dietary changes for health, and practice of food traditions. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Low- to moderate-income adults living in a northeastern US city were selected randomly from 3 ethnic groups: black (n = 201), Hispanic (n = 191), and white (n = 200). STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Bivariate and multiple linear regression analysis of associations between life-course variables and fruit and vegetable consumption. RESULTS: Black, Hispanic, and white respondents differed significantly in life-course experiences, family roles, socio-demographic characteristics, and place of birth. Explanatory models for fruit and vegetable consumption differed among ethnic groups and between fruits and vegetables. Among black respondents, a college education was positively associated with fruit consumption; education and family roles contributed most to differences in fruit (R2 = .16) and vegetable (R2 = .09) consumption. Among Hispanic respondents, life-course experiences such as liking fruits and vegetables in youth, making dietary changes for health, and food skills were positively associated with fruit (R2 = .25) and vegetable (R2 = .35) consumption. Among white respondents, socio-demographic characteristics, such as being married with a young child or single with no child and having a garden as an adult, were positively associated with fruit (R2 = .20) and vegetable (R2 = .22) consumption. APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: An understanding of the determinants of food choice in different subcultural groups can be used to design effective nutrition interventions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption. Experiences such as eating fresh-picked fruits and vegetables while growing up or vegetable gardening as an adult may enhance fruit and vegetable consumption among members of some ethnic groups.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1999 Mar,United States,1999,90
10077278,"Birth intervals, breastfeeding and determinants of childhood mortality in Malawi.","Childhood mortality in Malawi is analyzed by employing proportional hazards models. The analysis uses highly reliable data collected from the 1992 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of Malawi. The results show that the substantial birth interval and maternal age effects are largely limited to the infant period. The influence of social and economic variables on the mortality risk and on the relationship between biodemographic variables and mortality risk is much enhanced with increasing age of the child. It has also been found that consideration of breastfeeding status of the child does not significantly alter interpretation of effects of preceding birth interval length on mortality risk, but does partially diminish the succeeding birth interval effect. The results are discussed and then summarized in the context of policy implications for Malawi. The paper addresses a very important issue in Malawi and it adds valuable insights to the base of knowledge in childhood mortality in sub-Sahara Africa.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Feb,England,1999,90
10076286,"Mental illness and Irish people: stereotypes, determinants and changing perspectives.","The causes of psychological illness in Irish people have been identified with colonial rule and the catastrophic conditions deriving from famine in the nineteenth century. In particular, the scourge of unremitting emigration, resulting from famine, has formed a background against which speculative theories of inferiority, alienation and mental illness have been constructed. In particular, the long standing idea that Irish people exhibit higher rates of schizophrenia, both in Ireland and abroad, is discussed. Contemporary studies which suggest that these elevated rates do not correspond to international diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia are introduced. Rather, these enhanced rates may reflect a malaise which resembles schizophrenia but which is really a product of historical dispossession. The importance of these factors is underscored by the previous neglect of Irish people, considered as an ethnic minority, as well as the particular distaste which many Irish people display towards such a notion.",Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,1998 Dec,England,1998,90
10073947,Socioeconomic status and determinants of hemostatic function in healthy women.,"Hemostatic factors are reported to be associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). Socioeconomic status (SES) is 1 of the determinants of the hemostatic profile, but the factors underlying this association are not well known. Our aim was to examine determinants of the socioeconomic differences in hemostatic profile. Between 1991 and 1994, we studied 300 healthy women, aged 30 to 65 years, who were representative of women living in the greater Stockholm area. Fibrinogen, factor VII mass concentration (FVII:Ag), activated factor VII (FVIIa), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured. Educational attainment was used as a measure of SES. Low educational level and an unfavorable hemostatic profile were both associated with older age, unhealthful life style, psychosocial stress, atherogenic biochemical factors, and hypertension. Levels of hemostatic factors increased with lower educational attainment. Independently of age, the differences between the lowest (mandatory) and highest (college/university) education in FVII:Ag levels were 41 microg/L (95% confidence interval [CI], 15 to 66 microg/L, P=0.001), 0.26 g/L (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.42 g/L, P=0.001) in fibrinogen levels, and 0.11 U/mL (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.12 U/mL, P=0.03) in levels of vWF. The corresponding differences in FVIIa and PAI-1 were not statistically significant. With further adjustment for menopausal status, family history of CHD, marital status, psychosocial stress, lifestyle patterns, biochemical factors, and hypertension, statistically significant differences between mandatory and college/university education were observed in FVII:Ag (difference=34 microg/L; 95% CI, 2 to 65 microg/L, P=0.05) but not in fibrinogen (difference=0.03 g/L; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.19 g/L, P=0.92) or in vWF (difference=0.06 U/mL; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.22 U/mL, P=0.45). An educational gradient was most consistent and statistically significant for FVII:Ag, fibrinogen, and vWF. Age, psychosocial stress, unhealthful life style, atherogenic biochemical factors, and hypertension mediated the association of low educational level with elevated levels of fibrinogen and vWF. Psychosocial stress and unhealthful life style were the most important contributing factors. There was an independent association between education and FVII:Ag, which could not be explained by any of these factors.","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",1999 Mar,United States,1999,90
10073194,Hypertension in community-dwelling elders from a statewide study: implications for nonpharmacologic therapy.,"This study used multivariate analysis to determine the sociodemographic variables that predict whether hypertensive elders who are aware of their disease deliberately make lifestyle modifications aimed at controlling their hypertension. The data are from the 1990 Panel Study of Older South Carolinians (n = 6,473). The researchers performed five separate logistic regressions, each to predict the odds that the elders made specific lifestyle changes to reduce their hypertension. The dependent variable in the first regression was 1 = quite smoking to reduce hypertension and 0 = did not quite smoking to reduce hypertension. Changing diet, exercising, taking medication, and using stress management techniques were the dependent variables in the second, third, fourth, and fifth regressions, respectively. Significant determinants included age, gender, marital status, socioeconomic status, previous medical history, and social participation. This paper discussed implications for prevention programs.",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,1998 Feb,United States,1998,90
10073193,Exploratory analysis of factors associated with teens' repeated childbearing.,"This study was designed to explore the factors regarding unique determinants of repeat childbearing among teens. The influence that key people have on subsequent teen childbearing is examined. Data for this research were gathered in focus groups with teen mothers and parents of teen mothers who access the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in Georgia. Based on the results, repeated childbearing appears to occur within the context of poor parent-child relations, conflicting support for the roles teen mothers are expected to assume, limited social pressures for effective fathering, and limited access to social services for all family members. Pregnancy prevention efforts by agencies for teen mothers should coordinate services for the teen mother, her parent, and her partner.",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,1998 Feb,United States,1998,90
10071940,Adaptation during early childhood among mothers of children with disabilities.,"This study documents the extent to which child-related and parenting stress vary during the early childhood period among mothers of children with developmental disabilities. The degree to which specific aspects of the family environment predict stress levels measured at age 3 years and 5 years, after controlling for child characteristics and family income, is also investigated. The Parenting Stress Index was completed by 79 mothers of children with developmental disabilities at three time points: (1) within 1 month of the child's entry into an early intervention program (T1); (2) within 1 month of the child's third birthday (T3); and (3) within 1 month of the child's fifth birthday (T5). Data on child characteristics and family income as well as measures of the family environment (i.e., negative life events, cohesion, and family support) were gathered at both T1 and T3. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess whether there was significant change in the child-related and parenting stress scores across the three time points. Two sets of hierarchical regression equations were also analyzed. The first examined which child, family, and family environment characteristics assessed at T1 predicted stress at T3. The second identified the predictors of T5 stress based on independent variables measured at T3. Child-related stress increased significantly across the three time points, whereas parenting stress remained fairly stable. By age 5 years, one-third of the mothers had child-related stress scores above the clinical cutoff point. Regression analyses revealed the importance of the family environment in predicting both stress outcomes. The only statistically significant predictor of child-related stress at T3 was family cohesion, whereas parenting stress at T3 was predicted by income, cohesion, and family support. The predictors of both child-related and parenting stress at T5 were the same. Greater family cohesion and fewer negative life events predicted lower stress scores at T5. The significant increase in child-related stress during the early childhood period warrants attention by pediatricians, educators, and other professionals who must evaluate the needs of families of children with disabilities for supportive services. Aspects of the family environment were shown to be critical and consistent determinants of both child-related and parenting stress throughout the early childhood period. This finding suggests that pediatricians, in particular, must assess more than simply the diagnosis or the cognitive impairment of the child with a disability to make informed decisions about the frequency with which they should see particular families and whether referral to other services is necessary.",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,1999 Feb,United States,1999,90
10067904,Low-weight neonatal survival paradox in the Czech Republic.,"Analysis of vital statistics for the Czech Republic between 1986 and 1993, including 3,254 infant deaths from 350,978 first births to married and single women who conceived at ages 18-29 years, revealed a neonatal survival advantage for low-weight infants born to disadvantaged (single, less educated) women, particularly for deaths from congenital anomalies. This advantage largely disappeared after the neonatal period. The same patterns have been observed for low-weight infants born to black women in the United States. Since the Czech Republic had an ethnically homogenous population, virtually universal prenatal care, and uniform institutional conditions for delivery, Czech results must be attributed to social rather than to biologic or medical circumstances. This strengthens the contention that in the United States, the black neonatal survival paradox may be due as much to race-related social stigmatization and consequent disadvantage as to any hypothesized hereditary influences on birth-weight-specific survival.",American journal of epidemiology,1999 Mar 1,United States,1999,90
10065007,[Determinants for choice of medical management in the Bas-Rhin].,"UNLABELLED: It has already been established that the social origin and the demographic factors have an influence, among other things, on medical practice. What about it in the Bas-Rhin? Our survey's objective consists of emphasising on what motivates the choice of the type of medicine. METHOD: Phone survey on a representative sample of 1010 persons aged between 25 and over 64, residing in the Bas-Rhin. RESULTS: Participation has been of 66.3%. Among participants, there are 49.1% of men and 50.9% of women. 9 among 10 participants state that they have a family doctor. More women claim they are more likely to see a homeopathic doctor and/or a professional of alternative medicine. 8 among 10 persons have their blood pressure checked. 50.9% of participants have a blood analysis made in order to determine their cholesterol level. Building on these medical practices, several groups have been created. 54.1% of participants belong to the same group, having in common the facts of having a family doctor, having their blood pressure checked, and never seeing a professional of alternative medicine. The female participants are properly followed up on the gynecological point of view. Only 29 among 500 women have never had a cervical smear done. The carrying out of a mammography raises with age. When fearing a potential cancer, the first step taken by 56.2% of participants consists of seeing a generalist doctor, whereas 65.9% would prefer going to the hospital to perform further tests. As far as treatment is concerned, 76.8% of them would rather go to a specialised department, even if it is located far from their home. Special attention is to be paid to the fidelity of the population of the Bas-Rhin toward their family doctor. He represents the main link of information between the patient and the prevention policies that have been implemented over the last years.","Sante publique (Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France)",1998 Dec,France,1998,90
10064934,[Psychosocial factors are limiting the possibility of dying at home].,"All 151 patients registered at a palliative home care facility in Sollentuna from its inception in 1995 to the end of 1997 were studied to identify factors contributing to the patients' possibility of dying at home. Of those registered, 117 had died by the end 1997, 69 at home, 40 at a hospice, seven at emergency facilities, and one abroad. Comparison of those who died at a hospice and those who died at home showed no significant differences to exist between the two subgroups in age, gender, diagnosis, stage of disease, degree of symptom control, or treatment given. Psychosocial factors were the most important determinants of whether the patients died at home. The availability of psychological support for family members, and access to a hospital bed when they needed to relax, were also important factors, as were patient and family consent to home care.",Lakartidningen,1999 Feb 3,Sweden,1999,90
10051792,Nonlinearity in the epidemiology of complex health and disease processes.,"The challenges posed by chronic illness have pointed out to epidemiologists the multifactorial complex nature of disease causality. This notion has been referred to as a web of causality. This web extends theoretically beyond risk markers. It includes determinants of emergence/non-emergence of disease. This web of determinants is a form of complex system. Due to its complexity, the determinants within such system are not linked to each others in a linear, predictable manner only. Predictability is possible only on a short-term basis, and unpredictability sets in over the long run. Understanding such a system of determinants calls for articulation and testing of complex models which synthesize our knowledge of multiple determinants at many scales, both biological and otherwise. Given the complexity of this web and existing knowledge about the nonlinearity of such systems, the following question is posed: Can the challenge of studying causality be adequately addressed if emphasis continues to be placed on using tools and methods that are geared towards looking at such system from a linear paradigm? Or is it time to add to the epidemiologic research agenda the notion of nonlinearity and its relevant form of analytical approaches that are being tested in other disciplines? Furthermore, the question posed here applies as well to the study of determinants of health. Addressing determinants of heath adds further complexity to our task.",Theoretical medicine and bioethics,1998 Dec,Netherlands,1998,90
10048834,"Gender differences in illhealth in Finland: patterns, magnitude and change.","The common wisdom about gender differences in illhealth has been encapsulated in the phrase ""women are sicker, but men die quicker"". Recently this wisdom has been increasingly questioned. The purpose of this study is first to analyse the patterns and magnitude of gender differences across various indicators of illhealth; second to examine changes over time in these differences and third to assess whether sociodemographic and socioeconomic, family status and social network determinants have any bearing on the differences. The data derive from nationally representative 1986 and 1994 Surveys on Living Conditions in Finland. Women showed poorer health for five out of eight indicators analysed; that is somatic symptoms, mental symptoms, disability among those 50 years or older, long-standing illness and limiting long-standing illness were more prevalent among women than men. Male excess was found for perceived health below good and extremely limiting long-standing illness among those 50 years or older. However, the male excess was statistically significant only for poor perceived health among those 50 years or older. Adjusting for a number of suggested determinants of health had a negligible effect on gender differences. Further analyses showed that gender differences in illhealth remained largely stable over the eight year study period which saw a steep increase of unemployment for both genders. Only in the case of mental and somatic symptoms have gender differences declined, with a simultaneous increase in the prevalence of such symptoms. Otherwise gender differences in illhealth turned out to be resistant to the deep labour market crisis over this relatively short period of time. Although women had poorer health than men for a number of health indicators, we also find gender equality and even male excess for some indicators. Furthermore, the results suggest that a male excess in illhealth is likely to be found with more severe domains of illhealth among elderly people.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Jan,England,1999,90
10048726,Genetic and life-style determinants of peptic ulcer. A study of 3387 men aged 54 to 74 years: The Copenhagen Male Study.,"BACKGROUND: In the Copenhagen Male Study men with the Lewis blood group phenotype Le(a+b-), non-secretors of ABH antigen, and men with the O or the A phenotype in the ABO blood group have been found to have a significantly higher lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer than others. We investigated the importance of the association of these genetic markers, life-style factors, and social class with lifetime risk of peptic ulcer, testing specifically the hypothesis that the strength of the association of risk factors with peptic ulcer depends on genetic susceptibility. METHODS: Three thousand three hundred and forty-six white men 55-74 years old were included for study. From a questionnaire validated during an interview information was obtained about life-style factors and peptic ulcer history (gastric or duodenal). Potential non-genetic risk factors examined were smoking history, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, consumption of tea and coffee, and use of sugar in tea or coffee. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-four men (11.5%) had a history of peptic ulcer; 120 (3.6%) had had an operation due to peptic ulcer. Non-genetic peptic ulcer risk factors identified were ever having been a smoker, use of sugar in tea or coffee, abstention from tea consumption, and low social class. On the basis of these and the genetic factors, it was possible to identify a low-risk group (n = 142) with a lifetime prevalence of 4.2%, several intermediate-risk groups, and a high-risk group (n = 55) with a prevalence of 29%; the odds ratio with 95% confidence limits (OR) was 9.3 (3.4-25.3). Corresponding values with regard to operation were 1.4% and 20.0%; OR = 17.5 (3.7-82.0). Several significant interactions were found; for example, the use of sugar was associated with peptic ulcer risk only when interacting with genetic risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the role of Helicobacter pylori, it is interesting that the factors identified in this study were able to identify groups with extremely different lifetime risks. This finding and also the finding of strong interactions between genetic and life-style factors and between genetic factors and social class for the risk of peptic ulcer may have both public-health and clinical implications.",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,1999 Jan,England,1999,90
10036557,Impact of gait problems and falls on functioning in independent living persons of 55 years and over: a community survey.,"In a cross-sectional, population-based study among community-dwelling persons of 55 years and over the incidence of falls, risk indicators for falls, specifically age, and the impact of gait problems, falls and other risk factors on functioning was determined. A randomly age-stratified sample (n = 655) was taken from all independent living persons of 55 years and over (n = 2269) and registered in a primary health care centre. They received a mail questionnaire concerning demographic data, history of falls and injuries due to falls, physical and mental health status, gait problems, functional status, including social activities. The response rate was 62% (n = 405). Of the subjects aged 55 years and of those aged 65 years and over, 25% and 31% respectively fell at least once in the previous year. Half of the people reporting falls fell more than once. Serious injury occurred in 9% of the fallers, with 4% fractures. There is a significant association between falling and age and, even more clearly, between gait problems and age. The main risk factors of single and recurrent falls were female gender, physical health status and gait problems. Logistic regression analysis reveals that the main determinants of falling in general are gait problems and female gender and, of recurrent falling female gender, physical complaints and gait problems. Falls have some negative effect on functioning, i.e. mobility range and social activities, but this is overshadowed by mental status indicators and gait problems.",Patient education and counseling,1999 Jan,Ireland,1999,90
10037554,"Cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity in relation to serum leptin levels in a multiethnic population: The Miami Community Health Study.","PURPOSE: To examine the correlates of plasma leptin, including fasting insulin, adiposity, and several health habits and behaviors among a nondiabetic multiethnic population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 25-44 year old African-Americans (n = 126), Cuban-Americans (n = 107), and non-Hispanic whites (n = 189) randomly selected from Dade County Florida. Fasting leptin levels were correlated with fasting insulin, percent body fat, smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity within each sex. Multiple linear regression and analysis of covariance were used to estimate the independent determinants of plasma leptin concentration separately among men and women. RESULTS: Stepwise linear regression analyses revealed statistically significant associations of leptin with percent body fat, fasting insulin, cigarette smoking, and physical activity (both inversely) among men (p < 0.05 for each). Among women, percent body fat, fasting insulin (both positively), cigarette smoking, and alcohol use (inversely) were independent predictors of leptin levels explaining over 70% of the variance. Analyses of covariance revealed that women had higher adjusted mean leptin levels than men (13.1 ng/ml vs. 5.9 ng/ml; p < 0.001), whereas no separate effect of ethnicity was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Although adiposity was the strongest correlate of leptin levels, fasting insulin and several health habits and behaviors were independently associated with leptin. After adjustment for these factors, women had significantly higher mean leptin levels than men. The independent association among leptin and insulin levels is intriguing and suggests additional avenues for epidemiologic research.",Annals of epidemiology,1999 Feb,United States,1999,90
10024978,Primate socioecology: new insights from males.,"Primate males have only recently returned to the center stage of socioecological research. This review surveys new studies that examine variation in the behavior of adult males and their role in social evolution. It is shown that group size, composition, and social behavior are determined not only by resource distribution, predation risk, and other ecological factors, but that life history traits and social factors, especially those related to sexual coercion, can have equally profound consequences for social systems. This general point is illustrated by examining male behavior at three levels: the evolution of permanent associations between males and females, the causes and consequences of variation in the number of males between group-living species, and the determinants of social relationships within and between the sexes. Direct and indirect evidence reviewed in connection with all three questions indicates that the risk of infanticide has been a pervasive force in primate social evolution. Several areas are identified for future research on male life histories that should contribute to a better understanding of male reproductive strategies and corresponding female counter-strategies.",Die Naturwissenschaften,1999 Jan,Germany,1999,90
10024209,Hygiene behaviour in rural Nicaragua in relation to diarrhoea.,"BACKGROUND: Childhood diarrhoea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Nicaragua. Amongst the risk factors for its transmission are 'poor' hygiene practices. We investigated the effect of a large number of hygiene practices on diarrhoeal disease in children aged <2 years and validated the technique of direct observation of hygiene behaviour. METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was carried out in a rural zone of Nicaragua. From the database of a previously conducted case-control study on water and sanitation 172 families were recruited, half of which had experienced a higher than expected rate of diarrhoea in their children and the other half a lower rate. Hygiene behaviour was observed over two mornings and diarrhoea incidence was recorded with a calendar, filled out by the mother, and collected every week for 5 months. RESULTS: Of 46 'good' practices studied, 39 were associated with a lower risk of diarrhoea, five were unrelated and only for two a higher risk was observed. Washing of hands, domestic cleanliness (kitchen, living room, yard) and the use of a diaper/underclothes by the child had the strongest protective effect. Schooling (>3 years of primary school) and better economic position (possession of a radio) had a positive influence on general hygiene behaviour, education having a slightly stronger effect when a radio was present. Individual hygiene behaviour appeared to be highly variable in contrast with the consistent behaviour of the community as a whole. Feasible and appropriate indicators of hygiene behaviour were found to be domestic cleanliness and the use of a diaper or underclothes by the child. CONCLUSION: A consistent relationship between almost all hygiene practices and diarrhoea was detected, more schooling producing better hygiene behaviour. The high variability of hygiene behaviour at the individual level requires repeated observations (at least two) before and after the hygiene education in the event one wants to measure the impact of the campaign on the individual.",International journal of epidemiology,1998 Dec,England,1998,90
10022110,Sexual dysfunction in the United States: prevalence and predictors.,"CONTEXT: While recent pharmacological advances have generated increased public interest and demand for clinical services regarding erectile dysfunction, epidemiologic data on sexual dysfunction are relatively scant for both women and men. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction across various social groups and examine the determinants and health consequences of these disorders. DESIGN: Analysis of data from the National Health and Social Life Survey, a probability sample study of sexual behavior in a demographically representative, 1992 cohort of US adults. PARTICIPANTS: A national probability sample of 1749 women and 1410 men aged 18 to 59 years at the time of the survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction as well as negative concomitant outcomes. RESULTS: Sexual dysfunction is more prevalent for women (43%) than men (31%) and is associated with various demographic characteristics, including age and educational attainment. Women of different racial groups demonstrate different patterns of sexual dysfunction. Differences among men are not as marked but generally consistent with women. Experience of sexual dysfunction is more likely among women and men with poor physical and emotional health. Moreover, sexual dysfunction is highly associated with negative experiences in sexual relationships and overall well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that sexual dysfunction is an important public health concern, and emotional problems likely contribute to the experience of these problems.",JAMA,1999 Feb 10,United States,1999,90
9990494,Determinants of medico-social functioning after total gastrectomy.,"AIM: To describe medico-social functioning after total gastrectomy and the factors determining it. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In three medical rehabilitation centres, 173 consecutive patients (female/male = 62/111) after potentially curative total gastrectomy for gastric malignancy 206 days earlier (median, interquartile range = IQR 56-644) were evaluated for different pre- and post-operative parameters with potential influence on post-operative medico-social functioning as measured with the Edinburgh Rehabilitation Status Scale (ERSS). Parameters evaluated were: gender, age, time since operation, tumour stage, type of operation, clinical centre of admittance, haemoglobin, ferritin, albumin, presence of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, rapid oro-coecal transit, dyspepsia, early satiety, reflux, dysphagia, vomiting, a symptom based score, body mass index in health, at operation and on admission, weight loss since operation, calorie intake, bowel habits, and fat malassimilation. Independent influential factors for the ERSS were identified in a linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The median ERSS-score was 4 (IQR 2-6) on a scale from 0 (best) to 28 (worst). There was a significant difference in the ERSS-scores between the three different clinics. The ERSS-scores improved significantly with time since operation (ca. 22% per year). ERSS-scores were higher in patients with intestino-oesophageal reflux (+71%), with dyspepsia (+65%), or with dysphagia (+62%). CONCLUSION: Medico-social functioning was acceptable in this patient population. After total gastrectomy, dyspepsia, dysphagia, and intestinal reflux into the oesophagus need special attention.",Disability and rehabilitation,1999 Feb,England,1999,90
9989915,From regional ethnographies to interdisciplinary approaches-research on meals in Finland.,"The paper reviews Finnish research on meals and meal patterns since the turn of the century. The main research traditions and cases representing various methodological approaches-qualitative interview, health behaviour questionnaire and dietary survey-are discussed. In line with studies undertaken in other industrialized countries, the Finnish studies show that meal patterns are related to socio-economic structure, work schedules, lifecourse, living conditions and food availability. Meal patterns vary by individual energy needs, and the nutrient contents of meals can be different from those of snacks. It is difficult to account for all determinants and characteristics of meals in a single study. The three cases shed light on the various aspects of the meal. When planning an empirical study on meals the researcher should ask herself/himself at least four questions: (1) who defines the meal?; (2) are meal patterns assumed to vary by time and between subgroups of the study population?; (3) is information on nutrient content of various eating occasions relevant to the study?; and (4) could information on meals be obtained from existing data sources?",Appetite,1999 Feb,England,1999,90
9989914,Food-based classification of eating episodes (FBCE).,"The concept for categorization of eating episodes in dietary surveys was originally developed in studies of shift workers to compare ""meal patterns"" between night and day work shifts. The concept has been further improved through experience from applications in dietary surveys in other populations. In this paper, results from categorization of eating episodes in shift workers, elderly women and men during life transition periods, elderly female leg ulcer patients and obese men and their lean controls are shown and discussed. The categorization concept is based on seven food categories with food items of similar nutrient characteristics within each category. Each eating event is categorized as any of four types of ""meals"" or four types of ""snacks"" due to its combination of food categories. Thus, categorization is based on visible properties (food types) but at the same time reflecting invisible properties (nutrients). Criteria is also established to sub-categorize the ""meal"" types as being either ""prepared"" or ""quick-prepared"" from a behavioural perspective. Use of a defined and reliable concept for categorization is necessary to study eating episodes in dietary surveys, their determinants and also consequences on health and performance. Nocturnal eating during the circadian nadir might affect nutritional status. Since increasingly western populations appear to be moving from regular and planned meals to more episodic eating ""around the clock"", such analyses are of increasing interest in a bio-social perspective.",Appetite,1999 Feb,England,1999,90

9987786,Sociodemographic determinants of low birthweight in Greece: a population study.,"A total population sample of 10,654 singleton births from the Greek National Perinatal Survey of April 1983 was analysed to identify factors independently associated with low birthweight (LBW). The sample was divided into two groups according to the gravidity of the mothers (3368 primigravidae and 7286 multigravidae). Data examined included regional characteristics, marital status, age at and duration of marriage, parental ages at delivery, crowding in the home, insurance status, parental occupational classification and parental education levels. Logistic regression was used to define the socio-economic and demographic characteristics independently associated with the delivery of an LBW singleton baby. Significantly different LBW rates were found among the two groups: 4.3% in the primigravidae and 5.2% for multigravidae. For primigravidae significant associations were found with marital status, maternal occupation and father's education, while for multigravidae significant features were mother's education and place (region) of residence. The study showed little to assist in devising strategies of primary prevention of LBW in Greece.",Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,1999 Jan,England,1999,90
10196044,Contextual determinants of female-female mounting in laboratory rats.,"Female-female mounting is widespread among mammalian species, but little is known about the proximal function of this behaviour. While such mounting is often regarded as a 'masculine' trait, its widespread occurrence may indicate that it serves specific functions within the context of female-female social behaviour. We valuated female mounting behaviour in Long-Evans rats in standard observation chambers and in a seminatural enclosure. Under these conditions, we examined a number of potential factors that might influence mounting, including the oestrous cycle, social hierarchy, familiarity and male presence. The female's mounting was not influenced by her own oestrous cycle, but did vary with the oestrous cycle of the stimulus female. Socially dominant females mounted significantly more than subordinate females, and mounting by the dominant female was most frequent when the subordinate female was sexually receptive. Females mounted (and fought with) unfamiliar females significantly more than they did with familiar cagemates. Female-female mounting was dramatically reduced when males were present. Further testing showed that female mounting did not affect the induction of the progestational state of pregnancy, suggesting that female mounting does not function as a pseudomale behaviour that can substitute for genital stimulation provided by the male. Based on these data, female mounting does not appear to function as a sexual behaviour per se, but may serve as a form of female social behaviour related to maintenance of the female's social status within female groups. In this regard, the results of this study suggest that female mounting is part of the normal female's complex behavioural repertoire and does not necessarily reflect masculinization of some underlying neural substrate.

9933093,Endogenous and exogenous forms of the same antigen are processed from different pools to bind MHC class II molecules in endocytic compartments.,"The current studies were carried out to examine the basis for the differences in the antigenic peptides generated from exogenous and endogenous forms of hen egg white lysozyme (HEL). The role of different intracellular compartments in the generation and binding of HEL peptides derived from two endogenous forms of HEL, either secreted (sHEL) or retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER, KDELHEL), presented by MHC class II molecules was examined and compared to exogenous HEL. Initially it was found that antigen-presenting cells bearing both intracellular forms of HEL generated and presented a number of IAk-restricted HEL epitopes to T cell hybridomas, although sHEL was processed more efficiently than KDEL-HEL. There were differences, however, for some determinants between endogenous and exogenous HEL. At equivalent antigen-presenting efficiencies, endogenous HEL-bearing cells displayed a lower surface density of IAk-bound HEL-52-61-related peptides than cells pulsed with exogenous HEL, as detected by a specific monoclonal antibody. Neither endogenous HEL degradation nor peptide binding to MHC class II molecules occurred in the ER. Processing of sHEL and KDELHEL appears to take place either in a post-trans-Golgi network acidic compartment or in the cytosol, whereas peptide binding to MHC class II molecules occurs in endocytic compartments. Furthermore, the peptides generated were derived from an endogenous source rather than from secreted and re-endocytosed HEL. Thus, processing of endogenous HEL is from a different pool than exogenous HEL and occurs in different compartments.",European journal of immunology,1999 Jan,Germany,1999,90

Using a sibling pair design, girls with fraX or TS were compared with their own sisters on measures of IQ and social functioning. The 8 girls with fraX and the 9 girls with TS had lower FSIQ scores and higher ratings of social and attention problems relative to their own sisters. Girls with fraX also had higher ratings of withdrawn behaviors, relative to their own sisters. The unaffected sisters were not rated as demonstrating any difficulties in these areas, relative to controls. Correlations between problem ratings and FSIQ were not statistically significant. Although these preliminary findings do not indicate a lack of familial impact on social development in girls with either disorder, the results provide preliminary evidence that social dysfunction reported for girls with fraX or TS cannot be attributed solely, nor primarily, to global aspects of the family environment.",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,1998 Dec,United States,1998,90
9926155,"Consistent effects of high socioeconomic status and low birth order, and the modifying effect of maternal smoking on the risk of allergic disease during childhood.","Birth order, maternal age, gestational age, birth weight, maternal smoking, and social class have all been associated with allergic rhinitis, eczema and asthma in childhood, but the consistency of independent effects of these exposures in relation to all of these allergic conditions has not been investigated. We have compared and contrasted the independent effects of these putative risk factors on parent-reported hayfever, eczema and wheeze by age 16 years and in the past 12 months at age 16 using data from the 1970 British birth cohort. The 1970 British birth cohort comprised all children born in England, Scotland and Wales in one week of April 1970, and follow-up surveys at birth, 5, 10 and 16 years of age involved a cumulative total of 17,427 children. We have used data on over 6000 children with complete data at every stage. Social advantage was a risk factor common to each of wheeze at, and hayfever and eczema at and by age 16. Low birth order was an independent risk factor for eczema and hayfever at age 16, but not for wheeze. However, wheeze at age 16 was significantly increased in relation to maternal smoking, with a significant interaction such that the effect of smoking was greatest in those of high birth order and, in the absence of maternal smoking, low birth order was a risk factor for wheeze at age 16. Social advantage and low birth order appear to be the independently consistent determinants of atopic disease. Maternal smoking is an additional risk factor for wheeze, which applies primarily in low socioeconomic groups.",Respiratory medicine,1998 Oct,England,1998,90
9923956,"Hospital use by an ageing cohort: an investigation into the association between biological, behavioural and social risk markers and subsequent hospital utilization.","BACKGROUND: The aims of the study were to describe the pattern of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors) of the Paisley-Renfrew MIDSPAN cohort and assess the influence of biological, behavioural and social 'risk factors' (established at the time of screening) on subsequent hospital admissions. METHOD: A cohort analysis was carried out in Paisley and Renfrew, two post-industrial towns in West Central Scotland. This used a linked data set covering a 23 year follow-up period to combine original 'risk'-related data with subsequent routine hospital admissions data. The subjects were 8349 women and 7057 men, aged 45-64 in the early to mid-1970s, and representing approximately 80 per cent of the eligible population. The main outcome measures were patterns of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors), 'any acute hospital admission', 'a serious acute hospital admission' and 'death' (relative risks of each outcome were calculated for all risk factors). RESULTS: The following patterns of hospital utilization were found. Only 5 per cent experienced a mental health admission but mean stay was long (265 bed days per cohort member admitted). In contrast, 79 per cent experienced at least one acute hospital stay. The age-specific proportions of cohort members requiring admission increased over time but the growth in acute episodes was even higher (suggesting increasing rates of multiple admission). For non-survivors, 42 per cent of all acute episodes (55 per cent of bed days) took place during the 12 months before death. Analysis of risk factors (using Cox's proportional hazards model) of 'any admission' and 'a serious admission' showed forced expiratory volume (FEV1), age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index, cholesterol and deprivation category to be important predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the desirability of alternative settings of care for the chronically ill and dying, a high proportion of hospital bed days were required near the time of death. The absolute size of the demand for hospital services within the cohort was strikingly large and increasing over time. Strategies to address the tide of rising admissions will have to confront the increasing proportion of individuals requiring admission as well as the growth in multiple admissions. Those who were at higher risk of admission were the older members of the cohort (especially men), those with low FEV1, smokers, those who were underweight or obese, the small number with abnormal levels of blood sugar, those with high blood pressure and those who lived in the most deprived areas. Thus, programmes which affect these determinants of ill health may be useful in reducing age-specific admission rates.",Journal of public health medicine,1998 Dec,England,1998,90
9921324,Epidemiology and anthropology: an integrated approach dealing with bio-socio-cultural aspects as strategy for the control of endemic diseases.,"The control of endemic diseases has not attained the desired level of effectiveness in spite of the use of modern efficient technologies. The classic interventionist approach for the control of schistosomiasis is centered on systemic control of the snail hosts combined to large scale medical treatment and is usually carried out without social preoccupation due to the assisted communities. It is easy to understand the interest and the ethical compromise of public health research while producing studies in which the biological and social determinants as well as the cultural components should be considered and also encompass the historical dimensions and symbolic representations. In face of the recent political decision in favor of decentralizations of health administration to municipal level, we suggest, in the present paper, an integrated approach for the epidemiological diagnosis of an endemic situation at local level. Theoretical and methodological aspects from both, epidemiology and anthropology are discussed. Epidemiological methods can be used to detect the dependent variables (those related to the human infection) and the independent variables (demographic, economic, sanitary and social). Another methodological approach of anthropological/ethnographic nature can be conducted in order to make an articulation of the knowledge on the various dimensions or determinant levels of the disease. Mutual comprehension, between researchers and the people under investigation, on the dynamic transmission process would be relevant for a joint construction, at local level, of programmed actions for the control of endemic diseases. This would extend reflections on the health/disease process as a whole.",Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,1998,Brazil,1998,90
9920226,Who dies at home? Determinants of site of death for community-based long-term care patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine characteristics associated with site of death in a cohort of long-term homecare patients. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Community-based long-term care program. SUBJECTS: All patients 65 years of age or older who died within 1 year of admission during 1989 and 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Site of death. RESULTS: Of 620 subjects, site of death was hospital for 302 (49%), home for 132 (21%), nursing home for 124 (20%), and inpatient hospice for 45 (7%). Among patients living at home before death, factors associated with dying at home rather than in a hospital or inpatient hospice included female gender (relative risk (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00, 1.90); severely dependent functional status (RR 2.38, CI 1.39, 4.17) and cognitive status (RR 1.51, CI 1.10, 2.06); and dying of cancer (RR 1.68, CI 1.11, 2.55), chronic lung disease (AOR 1.75, CI 1.04, 2.95), or coronary artery disease (RR 1.93, CI 1.21, 3.09). Living with a child (RR 1.45, CI .99, 2.11) showed a trend toward association with dying at home. CONCLUSIONS: Even among a subgroup of older persons receiving community-based long-term care, the frequency of home death is low. The finding of an association between functional, social, and disease status and site of death suggests that the relationship between these factors and patients' preferences and care needs must be examined in order to understand how to optimize the site of terminal care.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,1999 Jan,United States,1999,90
9919629,Dead mothers and injured wives: the social context of maternal morbidity and mortality among the Hausa of northern Nigeria.,"Northern Nigeria has a maternal mortality ratio greater than 1,000 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Serious maternal morbidity (for example, vesico-vaginal fistula) is also common. Among the most important factors contributing to this tragic situation are: an Islamic culture that undervalues women; a perceived social need for women's reproductive capacities to be under strict male control; the practice of purdah (wife seclusion), which restricts women's access to medical care; almost universal female illiteracy; marriage at an early age and pregnancy often occurring before maternal pelvic growth is complete; a high rate of obstructed labor; directly harmful traditional medical beliefs and practices; inadequate facilities to deal with obstetric emergencies; a deteriorating economy; and a political culture marked by rampant corruption and inefficiency. The convergence of all of these factors has resulted in one of the worst records of female reproductive health existing anywhere in the world.",Studies in family planning,1998 Dec,United States,1998,90
9919377,Family and social determinants of school maladjustment in students with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders from recovery schools in Bulgaria.,"This inquiry study is part of a comprehensive investigation on the organization and the effect of the education of students with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders in special recovery schools. The aim for conducting the inquiry is to reveal the characteristics of the family and social background which may affect the school adaptation. The investigated group includes 254 students--192 with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders and 62 healthy children of the same age from the settlements where the recovery schools are based. Two types of questionnaires developed by the team are used for investigating the students' family and social status--one designed for the pupils and one--for the teachers and supervisors in the schools. The inquiry for the students contains 15 questions revealing family and school environment (family relations and problems; number of children and sequential number of the problem child; parents' education and employment; school training and curriculum; social contacts in the school; school results). The inquiry, engaging the class teachers, day and night supervisors in recovery schools, contains 19 questions. There are additional questions concerning students' specific learning difficulties as well. The results made it clear that parents' divorce is the most unfavorable family determinant for school maladjustment of students with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders. Many other factors such as the poor educational qualification and social-professional status of the parents, children number, the sequential number of the problematic child additionally impedes the relationship with the parents, thus increasing the risk of school failure and the manifestations of school maladjustment. The determined peculiarities of the family environment of students with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders suggest targeted psychocorrective work of the school psychologist individually with the student as well as with his/her family.",Central European journal of public health,1998 Nov,Czech Republic,1998,90

Transmission of the disease in this area is similar to that sometimes observed in West Africa. Geographical factors affecting transmission must be identified to determine the areas for priority action. The locations of breeding sites for black flies (the vector of the disease) and factors favorable to their dispersion, the social behavior of these population and the way that she occupy space, must be investigated to identify areas in which the flies and man are in close contact. This geographical study shows that the closest contact between men and black flies occurs in cocoa plantations, due to the proximity of the breeding sites. The areas of closest contact for women and children are unknown, but their identification is important because women and children may be bitten by the flies during their daily activities.","Sante (Montrouge, France)",1998 Nov,France,1998,90

In agreement with earlier reviews, individual differences show only some low and inconsistent concurrent covariation with shiftwork tolerance, and no predictive power for these measures has been found. It is thus not possible to predict future shiftwork tolerance from individual differences. Social conditions are also related to shiftwork tolerance, although again predictive power has not been demonstrated. An examination of the reasons for this state of the art suggested means of improving the relevance and usability of future research in this area.","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",1998,Finland,1998,90
9916298,Educational status and resources for child care as predictors of TBE vaccination coverage in schoolchildren of an endemic area in Austria.,"Since the introduction of the Austrian tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccination program in 1981 vaccination coverage of children has not been investigated sufficiently. Numerous socioeconomic and demographic factors have been identified as being associated with low vaccination coverage in childhood for most vaccinations. This study focuses on parental educational status and on resources for child care as determinants of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccination coverage of schoolchildren in an endemic TBE area of Austria. The target population were children in the first, fourth and seventh year of school education in Styria, Austria. Therefore, the sample consisting of 2470 children was divided into three age groups, children aged 7, 10 and 13 years. We performed a representative cross-sectional study. The information concerning the vaccination status of each child was recorded by means of an anonymous questionnaire given to the parents by the classroom teachers. This procedure ensured a high overall response rate of 79.8%. The prevalence of at least one TBE vaccination was 93.9% for the 7 year old, 97.8% for the 10 and 97.9% for the 13 year old. The lowest vaccination rates were found in families with four or more children (94.0%) and for those children who had unemployed parents (92.9%). The multivariate analysis indicates that TBE vaccination coverage is affected by a large number of children in the family (p = 0.0003), an urban place of residence (p = 0.0001) and by a low level of education of the mother (p = 0.013). The results suggest that, though overall high coverage in schoolchildren, vaccination programmes should be focused on large and socially deprived families.",Zentralblatt fur Hygiene und Umweltmedizin = International journal of hygiene and environmental medicine,1998 Dec,Germany,1998,90
9894175,Determinants of antepartum human immunodeficiency virus testing in a non-Medicaid obstetric population.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing rates and factors influencing testing in a private obstetric practice. METHODS: Antepartum patients were offered HIV testing after completing a self-assessment questionnaire. Perceived risks and demographics were correlated with testing rates. RESULTS: Overall, 348/600 (58%) women consented to HIV testing. In a univariate analysis, patients with ""any"" perceived risk(s) were more likely to be tested. Single women and those with an at-risk partner(s) or a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD) were more likely to desire testing. These factors remained independently associated with voluntary testing in a multivariate regression model. No patients tested positive for HIV. CONCLUSIONS: In our private obstetric practice, 26% of women perceived themselves at risk for HIV infection, and testing rates depended on the various risks identified. A history of STDs or an at-risk sexual partner were stronger predictors of voluntary testing than was marital status. Focused HIV counseling among pregnant women at relatively low risk for infection may be possible.",Infectious diseases in obstetrics and gynecology,1998,Egypt,1998,90
9894168,Swimming and self-grooming development of pups nursed by neonatally underfed rats.,"Swimming and self-grooming development were analyzed in experimental animals nursed by neonatally underfed dams by a method including the deprivation of both food and sensory cues which provoke long-term altered maternal behavior. Experimental animals obtained from these dams manifested a significant retardation in physical growth, as evidenced by a decrease in body weight and a 1-day delay in ear and eye-opening, as well as a significant delay in swimming ability, escaping from the water and an increase in self-grooming behavior. These alterations of experimental animals may be presumably related with the carelessness in maternal care and altered so-matosensory stimulation given by the neonatally underfed dams to her experimental pups. Data suggest that the poor somatosensory stimulation given by the mother to her pups, the reduced early social interaction or the motivational stage of pups may be important determinants for the development of brain mechanisms underlying reflex activity of the progeny.","Growth, development, and aging : GDA",1998 Autumn,United States,1998,90
9890367,Determinants of condom use to prevent HIV infection among youth in Ghana.,"PURPOSE: To identify the psychosocial and behavioral factors that influence condom use to reduce the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among young men in Ghana. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design in which data on a community-based sample of 601 young men, 15-24 years of age, were collected by a household survey instrument. For a conceptual framework, the study used constructs from the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Social Learning Theory (SLT) in the Ghanaian context. RESULTS: While 65% of the sexually active male respondents had used condoms at least once, only 25% had used condoms at last intercourse. Findings from multiple logistic regression analysis indicate that perceived susceptibility to HIV infection, perceived self-efficacy to use condoms, perceived barriers to condom use, and perceived social support were significant predictors of condom use. The most important finding, however, is that perceived barriers significantly interacted with perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy. Subjects who perceived a high level of susceptibility to HIV infection and a low level of barriers to condom use were almost six times as likely to have used condoms at last intercourse, compared to others. Similarly, young men who perceived a high level of self-efficacy to use condoms and a low level of barriers to condom use were nearly three times more likely to have used condoms at last intercourse when compared to others. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that HIV prevention programs for youth should emphasize personal vulnerability to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, instill in youth the self-belief that they can use condoms any time, and address how to overcome barriers to condom use.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1999 Jan,United States,1999,90

Theoretical definitions of health promotion and health education are presented. The author suggests that a variety of different approaches to health promotion can be adopted by nurses in practice, including education, persuasion, manipulation and attempts to promote an environment where healthy decisions about lifestyle can be made. Each strategy is examined and the advantages and the ethical limitations are explored. It is suggested that nurses may theoretically accept the notion of being a health promoter, but that in the reality of practice, their role may be primarily that of the health educator. The importance of recognizing that there are a variety of determinants of health, including social and environmental factors, as well as individual lifestyle, is emphasized throughout the paper.",Journal of advanced nursing,1998 Dec,England,1998,90
9885864,Predictors of length of stay for transurethral prostatectomy in Victoria.,"BACKGROUND: Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) is among the top 10 surgical conditions that account for hospital admission in Victoria. Bed utilization for TURP is an increasing concern in current times. This paper describes trends in length of stay (LOS) and identifies predictors of LOS for TURP in Victoria. METHODS: Trends in TURP were studied using ICD-9-CM coded Victorian hospital morbidity data from public hospitals from 1987/88 to 1994/95. Detailed morbidity data from the same source for the financial year 1995/96 were used to study predictors of LOS by logistic regression. RESULTS: Length of stay decreased significantly between 1987 and 1995 from 10.6 to 6.1 days. The strongest predictor of increased LOS was admission through the emergency room (odds ratio (OR) 14.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.8-18.3). Other significant predictors were older age, lower socio-economic status, presence of comorbid conditions, occurrence of procedural morbidity, and hospital type and location. CONCLUSIONS: The trend in decreasing LOS may be explained by increasingly efficient bed management in hospitals who are faced with an increasing need for cost control. Advances in surgical techniques and peri-operative care have also contributed to the decrease in LOS. Other factors that influence LOS can be divided into three categories: intrinsic patient factors, such as co-morbid conditions; procedure-specific factors such as peri-operative morbidity; and intrinsic hospital factors relating to capacity and resources. Such determinants of LOS may be of value to policy makers when considering the effective application of newer methods for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery,1998 Dec,Australia,1998,90
9884113,The developmental psychobiology of behavioural plasticity in mice: the role of social experiences in the family unit.,"Small perturbations of young animals' sensory experience or hormonal milieu have been shown to alter ontogenetic pathways and to potentially produce huge effects on CNS functioning and behaviour later in life. From a social point of view, variables such as the expression of affiliative bonding and of playful interactions among littermates, the quantity/quality of maternal care, or episodes of maternal or sibling deprivation during critical phases in development, seem to interfere as epigenetic factors with the rigidly ordered temporal sequences of events that occur during the ontogenesis of CNS. This leads to the onset of adaptive neurodevelopmental changes, which are observable within a continuum that encompasses both ""normal"" individual variability and potential behavioural disorganisation, which in turn will probably be related to profound alteration in the establishment of adult social competence. The present review summarises the more recent work in mice dealing with short-term, as well as long-term modifications, in naturally occurring species-typical social and non-social responses as a function of the early manipulation of social characteristics of the family unit (such as litter gender composition and time of weaning). These analyses were carried out on infant animals, i.e. during the ontogenetic stage of the establishment of social bonding, as well as on pre-pubertal and adult mice and on lactating adult females. Critical issues, such as the respective roles of sibling-sibling and dam-offspring interactions in the shaping of ""sibling effects"", are also addressed. Overall, these studies indicate that, within their natural range of variation, early patterns of social stimulation are powerful determinants of subsequent behaviour of developing altricial rodents, and confirm that early social life events warrant attention because they can strongly affect neurobehavioural development. Evidence of a relationship between social events occurring during early rearing (i.e. when dramatic transitions in neuroendocrine and neurochemical CNS systems occur) and individual behavioural variability in the infant and adult response to the effects of psychostimulants abused by humans is presented. A better understanding of the mechanisms that mediate such remarkable plasticity might have great psychobiological as well as clinical importance, especially when considering the issue of vulnerability to drug abuse.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,1998,United States,1998,90
9883306,Determinants of item nonresponse in a large national sex survey.,"The study aim was to describe patterns of item nonresponse in a sex survey and identify factors associated with high nonresponse. A random sample of 4548 respondents to the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles in Britain, 1990-1991 was assessed. Both respondent-wise and variable-wise patterns of incomplete response are described in terms of distinctive characteristics of nonrespondents and questions with a high nonresponse rate. Logistic regression was used to model the determinants of extreme nonresponse. For at least 90% of respondents, the item nonresponse was ignorable for most practical purposes and recall difficulties were indicated as its main cause, while the sensitivity of the questions had a large effect mainly among those in the top 5% of the overall nonresponse distribution. The latter were also distinguishable in terms of refusals to answer some face-to-face questions. Several overlapping indicators of poor educational and social background were associated with elevated overall nonresponse, particularly among the top 5% of the distribution. Thus recall accuracy rather than sensitivity of some sex survey questions was the key difficulty for a majority of the respondents whose overall nonresponse was satisfactorily low. The sensitivity of the topic had a large effect on item nonresponse only for a small group of participants.",Archives of sexual behavior,1998 Dec,United States,1998,90

9881146,Determinants of contraceptive use among women of reproductive age in Great Britain and Germany. II: Psychological factors.,"Psychological determinants of contraceptive use were investigated in Great Britain and Germany, using national data obtained in 1992. It was hypothesised that current contraceptive use among sexually active, fertile women aged 15-45 was related to their attitude towards the various contraceptive methods, social influences, perceptions of being able to use a method correctly and consistently, a correct estimation of fertility, and communication with their partner. Effects of age and country were also taken into account. The attitude of respondents towards the various contraceptive methods was ambivalent and no method was seen as ideal. On medical methods (OCs, IUDs and sterilisation) many respondents expressed doubts as to their safety for health. Social influences most frequently concerned the use of OCs. Respondents considered themselves able to use oral contraceptives correctly, but expressed general fear about intrauterine devices and sterilisation, and many women believed they were not able to use condoms and periodic abstinence consistently. Multifactorial analyses revealed that current contraceptive use was principally determined by social influences, attitude and self-efficacy with respect to medical methods. Age and country, and, for use of unreliable methods, fertility awareness also played a role. Communication with the partner was less relevant. Contraceptive choice (and the use of non-medical methods) depended greatly on encouragement to use and being in favour of medical methods. A lack of social support for use of medical methods and a negative attitude towards them was related to higher use rates of condoms, periodic abstinence, withdrawal and reliance on 'luck'. In the case of withdrawal and/or no method, underestimation of fertility played an additional role. Contraceptive choice appears to be determined more by a general like or dislike of medical methods rather than on a weighing of the merits of individual available methods.",Journal of biosocial science,1997 Oct,England,1997,90

Multivariate analysis shows that preceding birth interval length, followed by survival status of the immediately preceding child, are the most important factors associated with differential infant and child mortality risks; sex of the index child and mother's and father's education are also significant. Demographic factors are influential during infancy as well as childhood, but social factors, particularly mother's and father's education, now emerge as significant predictors of infant mortality risks. This indicates a change in the role of socioeconomic factors, since the earlier Bangladesh Fertility Survey in 1975.",Journal of biosocial science,1997 Oct,England,1997,90

It also analyzes the potential role of a series of socioeconomic factors, used as indicators of the population's living conditions. An exploratory ecological study was conducted to compare various groups. In 1991 there were a total of 1181 violent deaths in Recife. The study points to an overall mortality rate from external causes of 90.9/ 100,000 inhabitants. The two age groups 10-39 years and 60 years and over were those at highest risk of death. Males showed excess mortality in all age groups. The most important specific causes of death were homicides and traffic accidents, with 51.3% and 23.4%, respectively, of all violent deaths.

9871112,Identification of the high-virulence clone of group B streptococci in Mexican isolates by growth characteristics at 40 degrees C.,Group B streptococci (GBS) colonizing the vagina and rectum of pregnant women cause invasive disease of the offspring in a small number of cases. The immune status of the host and differences in virulence among strains appear to be the main determinants for neonatal infection. A high-virulence clone (HVC) was proposed to cause much of the morbidity and mortality when a collection of GBS isolates was examined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. HVC isolates could be further distinguished by their inability to grow at 40 degrees C. This characteristic was used in the present study to examine a collection of 57 GBS isolates from Mexico City for the HVC. Three serotype III invasive strains were classified in the HVC. The other eleven invasive strains and all carrier isolates had growth curves unaffected at 40 degrees C. These results demonstrate the presence of the HVC in Mexico. Such a low prevalence could explain in part the low rate of GBS invasive neonatal disease in Mexico.,Current microbiology,1999 Feb,United States,1999,90

The influence of gender, age, and education.","BACKGROUND: Studies of time trends in smoking prevalence provide a better understanding of the determinants of smoking. The present study analyses changes over time in the prevalence of smoking and heavy smoking in relation to sex, age, and education. METHODS: Data on smoking behaviour were collected by questionnaire in random samples of the general population in the area of Copenhagen. The database used included 71,842 measurements of smoking behaviour for 32,156 subjects aged 30 years or more, who had been examined at intervals between 1964 and 1994. In bi- and multivariate analyses the effects of sex, age, education, time period, and study group on the prevalence of smoking and of heavy smoking were assessed. RESULTS: Smoking was least prevalent in women, in the oldest age group (more than 70 years), and among those with 8 years or more of school education. During the study period (from 1964/74 to 1990/94), the prevalence of smoking decreased from 72% to 54% in men and from 52% to 46% in women. In both men and women this decrease was smallest in the least educated (less than 8 years of school education). Heavy smoking was also least prevalent in women, in the oldest age group, and among the well educated. During the study period, the unadjusted prevalence of heavy smoking decreased from 52% to 38% in men, while it increased from 17% to 21% in women. The multivariate analysis showed that the time trend for heavy smoking only depended on sex, while educational attainment and age had no impact on the trend. CONCLUSION: During the last 30 years the prevalence of smoking has decreased in Denmark. The decrease has been smallest in women, and among the least educated, and the increasing trend in the prevalence of heavy smoking in women is a cause for concern.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine,1998 Dec,Sweden,1998,90
9866093,Access to medical care under strain: new pressures in Canada and Australia.,"Health policy changes intended to achieve cost control in OECD countries run the risk of reintroducing financial barriers to health care. However, although the problems faced are similar, different countries are dealing with the situation in different ways. For example, Canada and Australia, which share many similarities, have taken quite different policy paths in the last decade: Canada has preserved universal access, whereas Australian policy is promoting a two-tier system through the provision of public subsidies for private insurance. The evidence is that country-specific factors such as institutional arrangements, attitudes, and values intersect with economic and financial factors to shape policy outcomes. Moreover, the Canadian and Australian experiences suggest that in relation to access issues, attitudes and values are the key policy determinants.","Journal of health politics, policy and law",1998 Dec,United States,1998,90
9862278,Homocysteine and ischaemic heart disease in the Caerphilly cohort.,"Elevated circulating total homocyst(e)ine concentrations are associated with a higher prevalence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). We utilized data from the Caerphilly Prospective Cohort Study to assess the predictive power of the serum total homocyst(e)ine concentration for future IHD. Serum total homocyst(e)ine concentrations were measured in 2290 men in the Caerphilly cohort, a representative population sample of men aged 50-64 years. During a 5-year follow-up period, 56 men suffered fatal IHD, 77 had a non-fatal myocardial infarction, while 21 were found to have ECG evidence of myocardial infarction (MI) when examined at follow-up. The mean serum total homocyst(e)ine concentration in the total of 154 men who experienced an incident IHD event was 12.4 micromol/l, whereas the 2136 men who experienced no such event had a mean level of 11.7 micromol/l. The difference between these means, examined by logistic regression and standardising for the effects of differences in age, social class, smoking, BMI, diabetes, HDL-cholesterol and prevalent IHD is 0.47 micromol/l (95% CI = -0.13 to 1.11 micromol/l). The mean difference for the 56 men who died, and whose death was attributed to IHD, is 0.81 micromol/l (95% CI= -0.17 to 1.88 micromol/l) after correction for confounding factors. Vitamin nutritional status and alcohol intake were significant negative determinants of serum total homocyst(e)ine concentrations; the effect of alcohol is explained by the folic acid content of beer, which is the preferred alcoholic beverage in Caerphilly. It is concluded that the serum total homocyst(e)ine concentration is weakly predictive of IHD events, though in the present data adjustments for other factors attenuated the relationship and it became not statistically significant (P > 0.05).",Atherosclerosis,1998 Oct,Ireland,1998,90
9857785,"Psychiatric impairment, social contact, and violent behavior: evidence from a study of outpatient-committed persons with severe mental disorder.","The need to better understand and manage risk of violent behavior among people with severe mental illness in community care settings is increasingly being recognized, as public-sector mental health systems face mandates to provide more cost-effective services in less restrictive environments. The potential for serious violence in a small proportion of severely mentally ill (SMI) individuals has emerged as a key factor that increases cost and limits continuity and normalization of community-based services for populations with psychiatric disabilities. A major challenge to developing better strategies for risk assessment and management in community care settings involves specifying complex interactions between psychiatric impairment and the conditions of social life--including the quality and frequency of contact with others at close quarters. This is a study of the determinants of violent behavior in a sample of 331 adults with severe mental disorders in community-based treatment. An interaction between severity of functional impairment and frequency of social contact was found to be significantly associated with risk of violence. Among respondents with Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores in the lowest 20%, more frequent contact with family and friends was linked to a higher probability of violent events. However, among better functioning respondents, frequent social contact was associated with lower risk of violence and greater satisfaction with relationships. These findings suggest that, where violence risk is concerned, the most salient feature of psychiatric impairment is the impairment of social relationships--the ways in which disorders of thought and mood not only distort one's subjective appraisal of experience and threat, but impair the ability to relate meaningfully to others, to resolve conflict and derive necessary support from family and friends. Thus, social contact may be a mixed blessing for SMI individuals. For some, it signals a positive quality of life, but for others--particularly those with extreme psychiatric impairment--frequent contact may add to conflict, stress, and increased potential and opportunity for physical violence. The impact of psychiatric impairment on violent behavior cannot be known in isolation, but must be considered in a social context. Effective community-based strategies to anticipate and prevent violence in the lives of persons with severe mental illness must take into account such interactions between social and clinical variables.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1998 Dec,Germany,1998,90
9850877,Social determinants of psychiatric morbidity and well-being in immigrant elders and whites in east London.,"OBJECTIVES: The social conditions under which migrants to the UK live may be more significant than the experience of migration itself in leading to increased risk of mental illness. We aimed to compare the prevalence of mental, physical and social health problems in elderly Somalis, Bengalis and whites living in a deprived inner London area and examine associations between environmental circumstances, social support, physical health status, mood and life satisfaction in these groups. In addition, we wanted to test the hypothesis that differences in mental health between immigrants and whites are explained by social disadvantages rather than ethnicity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey with participants drawn from age-sex registers of general practices, augmented by other sources. SETTING: East London--'first-generation' Somali and Bengali immigrants and white British. SUBJECTS: A total of 274 people aged 60+ years: 72 Somalis, 75 Bengalis and 127 whites. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Scale (SAD), Life Satisfaction Index (LSI). High SAD scores indicate more anxiety and depression symptoms; high LSI scores indicate greater life satisfaction. MAIN RESULTS: Highest SAD scores were found among Bengalis; lowest LSI scores were found among Bengalis and Somalis. The prevalences of depression (SAD score 6+) were 25% in Somalis, 77% in Bengalis and 25% in east London whites. Physical health status and SAD scores were associated in Somalis (r = +0.31, p < or = 0.01). Bengalis (r = +0.47, p < or = 0.001) and east London whites (r = +0.27, p < or = 0.01). Physical health problems also related to lower LSI scores in Somalis (r = -0.24, p < or = 0.05) and east London whites (r = -0.24, p < or = 0.01). Social factors (i.e. poor housing conditions, low family support and reported need of community services) were strongly associated with SAD scores among Somalis (r = +0.5, p < or = 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, among Bengalis (r = +0.33, p < or = 0.01). Ethnicity (i.e. being an immigrant as opposed to a non-immigrant) became a statistically non-significant risk factor for high SAD scores after adjusting for the effects of age, weekly income, physical health and social problems (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.5-1.1, p = 0.09). A residual, but much attenuated effect for ethnicity on LSI scores persisted in the estimated model after controlling for the same set of independent risk factors (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.4-1, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The marked variation in mental health between ethnic groups in east London might be a reflection of socioeconomic and health differentials acting concomitantly and adversely. Inequalities in housing, social support, income and physical health status accounted for variation in mood observed between immigrants and whites, and may partly explain differences in life satisfaction. These results seem to support a 'multiple jeopardy' theory of ageing in ethnic minorities in east London. Greater efforts are needed to recognize anxiety and depression in immigrant elders. Better social support and housing among 'minority ethnic' elders who live alone might be expected to alleviate social stress and improve mental health and psychological well-being.",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,1998 Nov,England,1998,90
9849258,Parish nursing. Addressing the significance of social support and spirituality for sustained health-promoting behaviors in the elderly.,"Literature about the significance of health promotion for the elderly and identification of various determinants of health-promoting activities contains numerous inconsistencies. From a review of nursing and health-related literature over the past decade, it is possible to draw only limited conclusions about the commitment of the elderly to health-promoting behaviors. Despite this, the importance of the roles of social support and spirituality for the empowerment of older adults to practice health-promoting activities is a consistent research finding in this population. Parish nurse programs expand home health and public health provider roles and use the faith community as a cooperative means for sociocultural implementation of successful health promotion.

The duration of social influence on the food choices of 42-day-old rats (1) increased with both increasing numbers of demonstrators and increasing numbers of demonstrations by a single demonstrator, (2) varied with the temporal distribution of demonstrations, but (3) did not vary with the age of demonstrators. The results suggest that a single episode of social learning produces short-term, but not long-term, effects on a Norway rat's food choices.

9847029,Social support and hostility as predictors of depressive symptoms in cardiac patients one month after hospitalization: a prospective study.,"OBJECTIVE: Hospitalization for cardiac disease is associated with an increased risk for depression, which itself confers a poorer prognosis. Few prospective studies have examined the determinants of depression after hospitalization in cardiac patients, and even fewer have examined depression within the weeks after hospital discharge. The present study assessed the prospective relations among perceptions of social support and trait hostility in predicting symptoms of depressive symptoms at 1 month after hospitalization for a diagnostic angiography in 506 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. METHOD: A series of structural equation models 1) estimated the predictive relations of social support, hostility, and depressive symptoms while in the hospital to symptoms of depression 1 month after hospitalization, and 2) compared these relations across gender, predicted risk classification, and age. RESULTS: Social support assessed during hospitalization was independently negatively associated with depressive symptoms 1 month after hospitalization, after controlling for baseline symptoms of depression, gender, disease severity, and age. Hostility was an indirect predictor of postdischarge depressive symptomology by way of its negative relation with social support. This pattern of relations did not differ across gender, predicted risk classification, and age. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a patient's perceived social support during hospitalization is a determinant of depressive symptoms 1 month later. The relation of social support and hostility to subsequent depressive symptoms was similar across a variety of populations.",Psychosomatic medicine,1998 Nov-Dec,United States,1998,90

The phenomenon of migration is complex and poorly understood by most people in countries who host immigrants. People migrate for numerous reasons related to social, economic, political, cultural, and physical environmental conditions formed by historical antecedents. Migrating people, especially vulnerable women and children, are exposed to numerous health hazards, a situation calling for a response from nursing. To respond effectively nursing needs knowledge development of global migration and health that includes the precursors to migration in addition to the postmigration experience where nurses encounter immigrants.

9842499,The consequences of universalizing health services: children's use of health services in Catalonia.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the role of needs and social factors in the use of health services among children under age 15 in Catalonia, Spain, where health care reform was explicitly designed to facilitate universal access to primary care according to health needs. Data from the Catalan Health Interview Survey of 1994, a multistage probability sample (2,433 children under 15 years old), were analyzed. Multiple regression examined the relationship between health needs and number of visits in the last year, controlling for the effect of sociodemographic characteristics. Two logistic regression equations were selected to predict heavy (more than seven visits per year) and light (less than two visits) utilization of services. The multiple regression model explained 14.3 percent of the variance in number of visits, with health status perception, disability, reported chronic condition, restriction of activities, and having had a recent accident by far the most important determinants. No familial socioeconomic characteristics, including social class, education, or family size, influenced the extent of use. In contrast to health systems not designed to achieve either universal access according to need or strong primary care, universal access to health services in Catalonia appears to enhance the use of services among children with health needs, regardless of socioeconomic characteristics.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1998,United States,1998,90

9825421,"Psychosocial, behavioural, and health determinants of successful smoking cessation: a longitudinal study of Danish adults.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors that determine whether or not smokers become long-term quitters, and to study whether determinants of successful cessation differ with levels of motivation to stop. DESIGN: In a cohort of men and women, aged 30-60 years at first examination in 1982/1984, smoking behaviour was evaluated from questionnaires at baseline and at follow up 10 years later. SETTING: County of Copenhagen, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 2554 subjects from the original sample of 4581 were successfully followed. This study deals with the 1365 subjects who were smokers at the first examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Smoking status (abstinent for one year or more) at follow up. RESULTS: At follow up 15% of the baseline smokers had been abstinent for one year or more. In multivariate analysis, successful smoking cessation was associated with older age, high social status, low prior tobacco consumption, baseline motivation to stop smoking, and having a non-smoking spouse/cohabitant. The same result was obtained when the analyses were repeated separately for smokers with and without motivation to stop. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers motivated to stop are more likely to quit and remain abstinent than smokers with no such motivation. Age, social status, spouse/cohabitant's smoking behaviour, and the daily consumption of tobacco predict success in smoking cessation, irrespective of smokers' former motivation to stop.",Tobacco control,1998 Autumn,England,1998,90
9823829,"Folate, vitamin B12, and serum total homocysteine levels in confirmed Alzheimer disease.","BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that vascular disease may contribute to the cause of Alzheimer disease (AD). Since elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) level is a risk factor for vascular disease, it may also be relevant to AD. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of AD with blood levels of tHcy, and its biological determinants folate and vitamin B12. DESIGN: Case-control study of 164 patients, aged 55 years or older, with a clinical diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT), including 76 patients with histologically confirmed AD and 108 control subjects. SETTING: Referral population to a hospital clinic between July 1988 and April 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum tHcy, folate, and vitamin B12 levels in patients and controls at entry; the odds ratio of DAT or confirmed AD with elevated tHcy or low vitamin levels; and the rate of disease progression in relation to tHcy levels at entry. RESULTS: Serum tHcy levels were significantly higher and serum folate and vitamin B12 levels were lower in patients with DAT and patients with histologically confirmed AD than in controls. The odds ratio of confirmed AD associated with a tHcy level in the top third (> or = 14 micromol/L) compared with the bottom third (< or = 11 micromol/L) of the control distribution was 4.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.2-9.2), after adjustment for age, sex, social class, cigarette smoking, and apolipoprotein E epsilon4. The corresponding odds ratio for the lower third compared with the upper third of serum folate distribution was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.8-6.3) and of vitamin B12 distribution was 4.3 (95% confidence interval, 2.1-8.8). The mean tHcy levels were unaltered by duration of symptoms before enrollment and were stable for several years afterward. In a 3-year follow-up of patients with DAT, radiological evidence of disease progression was greater among those with higher tHcy levels at entry. CONCLUSIONS: Low blood levels of folate and vitamin B12, and elevated tHcy levels were associated with AD. The stability of tHcy levels over time and lack of relationship with duration of symptoms argue against these findings being a consequence of disease and warrant further studies to assess the clinical relevance of these associations for AD.",Archives of neurology,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90
9823996,The impact of comorbidity on mortality following in-hospital diagnosis of tuberculosis.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Despite the availability of curative chemotherapy, mortality remains high among patients hospitalized for tuberculosis. Although the elevated mortality rate is often attributed to the presence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) or concomitant infection with the HIV, other factors must be contributory, especially among the HIV-negative population. Therefore, we performed a study to define the factors associated with mortality following the in-hospital diagnosis of tuberculosis in a region with low levels of MDRTB and coinfection with HIV. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The eight hospitals in the Barnes-Jewish-Christian (BJC) Health System, which is a network of community and tertiary-care level facilities serving the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area. PATIENTS: All 203 patients hospitalized with culture-positive tuberculosis at one of the BJC system hospitals between 1988 and 1996. INTERVENTIONS: Follow-up information was obtained by telephone interview and review of medical and public health records. Death was verified through a search of the death certificate registry of Missouri and the records of the Social Security Administration. Mortality was defined as death from any cause during the 14 months following the initial date of hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The cumulative all-cause mortality rate for this cohort was 28.1%. The incidence of HIV positivity was 7.9% and of MDRTB was 1.5%. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.0 to 7.0; p < 0.001) and the presence of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (AOR = 7.0; 95% CI = 3.7 to 13.3; p = 0.002) were the largest contributors to mortality. Other variables independently associated with mortality included the presence of malnutrition (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI = 2.1 to 4.9; p = 0.007), age > 60 years (AOR = 3.5; 95% CI = 2.4 to 5.2; p < 0.001), drug-induced immunosuppression (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.6 to 5.2; p = 0.018), and dyspnea at the time of hospital presentation (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.4 to 3.1; p = 0.048). Overall, 45.3% of the patients had a > 7-day delay in the suspicion of the diagnosis of tuberculosis and the institution of antituberculosis therapy following hospital admission. There was no association between the presence of these delays and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the 14-month mortality rate is high among patients diagnosed as having tuberculosis during hospitalization, despite low incidences of HIV infection and multidrug resistant disease. The factors that appear to contribute to this elevated mortality rate are markers of disease chronicity and severity of not only the tuberculosis, but also of the patient's underlying health status. Thus, while HIV positivity and multidrug resistance can be important determinants of mortality in some populations, other demographic factors and comorbid conditions may play a role as well. These data also suggest that tuberculosis is often superimposed on chronic illnesses that are important determinants of patient outcomes.",Chest,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90

9822490,Is adverse pregnancy outcome predictable after blunt abdominal trauma?,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the following: (1) pregnancy outcome after blunt abdominal trauma and (2) factors that may predict preterm birth and adverse peripartum outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: All women who had noncatastrophic abdominal trauma and came to the labor and delivery suite July 1994-August 1997 were prospectively evaluated and admitted for continuous uterine and fetal monitoring. A complete blood cell count, coagulation profile, and Kleihauer-Betke stain were performed. Ultrasonographic examination was performed to rule out hematoma. Tocolytic agents were administrated in cases with persistent contractions. Pregnancy outcomes and risk factors were compared between those with preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation and those who were delivered after 37 weeks' gestation. RESULTS: Delivery information was available for 85 women with blunt abdominal trauma from motor vehicle accident (28), falls (27), and direct assault (30, which included 17 cases of domestic abuse). Four women, 3 of whom were exposed to domestic abuse, were hospitalized twice. Thirteen patients had preterm birth and 72 patients were delivered at term. In all cases the results of Kleihauer-Betke stains, maternal vital signs, blood cell count, coagulation profile, and placental ultrasonographic examinations were normal. The differences between the 2 groups with respect to gestational age at the time of trauma, length of hospital stay, subjective reports of abdominal pain, objective findings of abdominal tenderness, patterns of uterine contractions, interval between trauma and delivery, and Apgar scores were not statistically significant. However, the preterm birth group received magnesium sulfate tocolysis more frequently (31% vs 7%) and had a significantly greater rate of peripartum complications, such as rupture of membranes and abruptio placentae, than the group of patients who delivered at term (46.2% vs 12.5%, P <.05). Women with domestic abuse had increased uterine contractions at the time of abdominal trauma (52.9% vs 19.1%, P =.01) but did not require increased use of tocolysis. Women with domestic abuse had more peripartum complications (41.8% vs 11.8%, P <.01). CONCLUSIONS: Women with noncatastrophic blunt abdominal trauma in pregnancy tend to have favorable neonatal outcomes. Findings or reports of abdominal tenderness and uterine contractions are not predictive of preterm birth. Preterm birth was associated with increased peripartum complications. However, domestic abuse was associated with repeated trauma in the index pregnancy and increased peripartum complications.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90
9819707,Variables influencing parental perception of inherited metabolic diseases before and after genetic counselling.,"The present study was undertaken to characterize the variables that influence parental perception of metabolic disorders and their genetic origin before and after genetic counselling, the effect of counselling on parental attitudes towards prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination, and the factors affecting parental coping with burden. Parents of children with metabolic diseases from 32 Arab-Muslim families were interviewed, answering a pre-structured questionnaire. These interviews indicate the following. (1) Traditional belief and religious commitment are more important determinants than education in parental perception of inherited metabolic diseases. (2) The number of affected children has a greater impact on parental evaluation of the burden than the number of healthy children. The social component, i.e. the way families are viewed by society, is the most significant factor of the burden. (3) Parents use different techniques to divide responsibility regarding reproduction. Having a healthy child and the availability of prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination were the two most important factors in parental reproductive decision making. In the absence of a healthy child and when the burden was perceived as too heavy, parents tended 'not to decide'. (4) Parental attitude to pregnancy termination was dependent on two factors: religious commitment (leading to objection) and severity of disease (leading to flexibility and approval). (5) In almost all families, genetic counselling altered parental perception of the disease and its hereditary origin. We conclude that genetic counselling and population education may be helpful in the prevention of consanguineous marriages and in family planning, even in a society that values traditional beliefs very highly.",Journal of inherited metabolic disease,1998 Oct,United States,1998,90
9814393,Family and personal characteristics of aggressive Nigerian boys: differences from and similarities with Western findings.,"PURPOSE: To identify the family and child determinants of aggressive behaviour in Nigerian elementary school boys and to compare the findings with previous ones from Western studies. METHODS: Forty-seven aggressive boys from four elementary schools in Lagos, Nigeria were compared with 47 matched pro-social boys. Teacher rating and peer nomination were combined to select subjects. The subjects and their parents were given structured questionnaires to obtain information on possible risk factors for aggression. RESULTS: Compared with pro-social boys, it was found that significantly more aggressive boys came from polygamous families and crowded homes, had more siblings, received less parental affection, were more physically punished, less supervised at home, witnessed more domestic conflicts, did poorly at school, had poorer verbal intelligence and attributed malice more readily than pro-social boys. Logistic regression indicated that the independent family predictors of aggression were crowding, little paternal affection, and corporal punishment. The independent child predictors were biased attribution and poor school achievement. Corporal punishment at school was also an independent predictor of aggression. CONCLUSIONS: The family and child determinants of aggressive behaviour in Nigeria are similar to those found in Western studies except for the small contribution of family instability and overwhelming influence of corporal punishment in our sample. Models of intervention developed in the West may therefore be cautiously applied to Nigerian children.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90
9813812,"Prosthodontic profiles relating to economic status, social network, and social support in an elderly population living independently in Canada.","STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Previous evaluations of life satisfaction and health have not completely explained the impact of social network, social support, and economics on the oral health-related behavior of elderly patients, particularly in relation to missing teeth. PURPOSE: This study measured the strength of associations between social network/support/class and the use of complete and removable partial dentures in elderly patients living independently. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multiple stepwise logistic regression was used to contrast data from previous studies relating to the subject and to explore the influence of these social variables. RESULTS: The results substantiated the links observed in a previous study between some social features and oral fitness. More frequent use of complete dentures was identified among participants who reported higher incomes and among those who thought their incomes were sufficient for their needs. Unreplaced missing anterior teeth were associated more commonly with subjects less willing or able to leave their homes. CONCLUSIONS: Some salient features of prosthodontic care and oral health status were common to 2, comparable social environments. A minority within the elderly population may not see a need to make use of clinical dental services, regardless of how accessible these services are to them. Social network and social support issues may be important determinants in this perceived need to use clinical services.",The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90
9810070,"Is religiousness a correlate of absorption? Implications for psychophysiology, coping, and morbidity.","CONTEXT: Evidence synthesized from social epidemiology, psychophysiology, and behavioral medicine suggests that religiousness may represent a significant correlate of absorption, a construct for which few if any psychosocial determinants have been identified. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between absorption and intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness. PARTICIPANTS: 83 respondents of a self-administered survey of adult survivors of cancer or other life-threatening diseases, recruited from participants in a pilot study of psychosocial factors related to recovery from illness. MAIN MEASURES: Tellegen Absorption Scale and Religious Orientation Scale. RESULTS: Absorption, as assessed by the Tellegen Absorption Scale, was positively and significantly associated with intrinsic religiousness, as measured by the Religious Orientation Scale. Predominantly intrinsic subjects had absorption scores at least 20% higher than did predominantly extrinsic, proreligious, or nonreligious subjects. DISCUSSION: Prior research has found that absorption and hypnotizability have psychophysiological correlates, and that religiousness shows protective effects against morbidity and mortality. In light of this work, the present findings suggest that certain religious cognitions, emotions, or experiences may generate an internally focused state that enhances health and attenuates disease through self-soothing psychophysiological mechanisms.",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90
9809712,Economic evaluation in schistosomiasis: valuation of health states preferences. A research note.,"Poor countries can ill-afford ineffective health care. An effective disease intervention is one which produces a net improvement in beneficiaries' quality of life and/or increases life expectancy. Unlike developed countries, very little research has been done in developing countries on the measures of the ultimate output of health care. The objectives of this study were to: (i) apply the existing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) methods in eliciting health state valuations from farmers, teachers and health professionals living and working in the schistosomiasis endemic Mwea Irrigation Scheme in Kenya; (ii) determine whether there is significant difference between average health states valuations from the three main groups of people at risk of schistosomiasis infection; and (iii) assess the relative effect of different respondent characteristics and health states prognosis on valuations. The instrument consists of seven health state descriptions-each defined along six functional dimensions: self-care, mobility, livelihood activities, energy, social participation and pain. Cardinal health state values were measured using a visual-analogue-scale (VAS). Values were elicited from three random samples of farming general public, medical professionals and teachers. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test showed that there is significant difference in the average health state values (for mild, moderate, severe, very severe and comatose states) obtained from the three samples. Generally, except for the valuation of the immediately following state, the other explanatory variables are not statistically significant determinants of valuations for the mild, moderate, severe and very severe states. The results suggest that VAS valuations are primarily affected by prognosis. There is urgent need for more representative and systematic HRQoL studies to test the relevance of the Western-based generic instruments in African countries contexts, with a view to developing more appropriate tool(s) if necessary.",Health economics,1998 Sep,England,1998,90

METHODS: Data on smoking behavior, attitudes, social influences, self-efficacy expectations, and motivational phases were collected from a sample of 532 cardiac inpatients. A revised typology of the Transtheoretical Model was used for measuring motivational phases and resulted in four groups: smokers in precontemplation, smokers in contemplation, externally motivated actors, and internally motivated actors. Analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test was used to study differences in psycho-social determinants between these four groups. RESULTS: As hypothesized, externally motivated actors differed from internally motivated actors in having less positive attitudes, less social support, and lower self-efficacy expectations. Attitudes and social support were most positive among smokers in contemplation and internally motivated actors. Self-efficacy expectations were lowest among subjects in precontemplation and contemplation. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects in different motivational phases differed in their psycho-social determinants. Therefore, it is recommended that stage-tailored education be developed. Finally, externally motivated actors have to be approached in a different way than internally motivated actors.",Preventive medicine,1998 Sep-Oct,United States,1998,90
9808799,"Differential beliefs, perceived social influences, and self-efficacy expectations among smokers in various motivational phases.","BACKGROUND: The ASE model, an integration of social psychological models, states that motivational phases and the transition from one phase to another can be predicted by behavioral determinants. The goal of the present study was to replicate the so-called O pattern that was found in earlier Dutch studies. METHODS: In four cross-sectional studies (N = 918, N = 354, N = 225, N = 317), smokers filled in a questionnaire based on the ASE model, while the motivational phase question was based on the stage definitions from the Transtheoretical model. RESULTS: Precontemplating smokers perceived fewer advantages of quitting than contemplators. Precontemplators encountered less support for quitting than contemplators. Contemplators reported lower self-efficacy expectations than those in preparation, while this group had lower self-efficacy expectations than respondents in action. Ex-smokers in maintenance reported fewer disadvantages of quitting than those in action. CONCLUSIONS: Since changes in cognitive determinants are thought to mediate transitions in motivational phases, the results can be used to tailor health education messages to the needs of smokers in the various motivational phases. The results suggest that smokers in precontemplation would benefit most from information about the pros of quitting and from obtaining support for quitting. Smokers in contemplation and preparation may benefit most from self-efficacy-enhancing information.",Preventive medicine,1998 Sep-Oct,United States,1998,90
9807774,Predicting grief symptomatology among the suddenly bereaved.,"Social scientists have long been interested in the study of grief and bereavement, but only recently has research focused on the aftereffects of sudden loss. Theory and research alike suggest that grief is multidimensional and that specific grief reactions have a unique set of predictors. The purpose of this study is to examine the relative contribution of risk factors in explaining variations in specific grief reactions following a sudden death. Data for this study come from medical examiners' reports and mail-back surveys of survivors of sudden loss from suicide or accident. The results indicate that several characteristics of the survivor, mode of death, and social support are important determinants of grief symptomatology. This research concludes by directing future theoretical and empirical endeavors to examine more fully the role of relational factors in influencing grief experiences following bereavement.",Suicide & life-threatening behavior,1998 Fall,England,1998,90
9807368,"Mental illness and Irish people: stereotypes, determinants and changing perspectives.","The causes of psychological illness in Irish people have been identified with colonial rule and the catastrophic conditions deriving from famine in the nineteenth century. In particular, the scourge of unremitting emigration, resulting from famine, has formed a background against which speculative theories of inferiority, alienation and mental illness have been constructed. In particular, the long standing idea that Irish people exhibit higher rates of schizophrenia, both in Ireland and abroad, is discussed. Contemporary studies which suggest that these elevated rates do not correspond to international diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia are introduced. Rather, these enhanced rates may reflect a malaise which resembles schizophrenia but which is really a product of historical dispossession. The importance of these factors is underscored by the previous neglect of Irish people, considered as an ethnic minority, as well as the particular distaste which many Irish people display towards such a notion.",Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,1998 Aug,England,1998,90
9806314,"Trends in the prevalence of obesity among Belgian men at work, 1977-1992.","OBJECTIVE: To assess trends in average body mass index (BMI) and the prevalence of obesity between 1977 and 1992, in middle-aged Belgian men at work. SUBJECTS: A subsample of men at work, aged 40-54 y extracted from the base-line data from four independent prospective studies, each representing a period (Physical Fitness Study (1977-1978), Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health (BIRNH) (1979-1984), Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases (MONICA) (1986-1991) and ORCA (1992-1993)). DESIGN: Linear regression of the average body mass index (kg/m2) and logistic regression of the prevalence of obesity (BMI > or = 30kg/m2). Independent variables taken into account in multivariate analysis were: age, educational level, marital status and region. RESULTS: In this subsample of Belgian men at work, aged 40-54 y, prevalence of obesity increased from 9.2% in 1977-1978 to 14.5% in 1992-1993. This rise was present in each five-year age group, in both regions and in all educational groups, but strongest in the lowest educated. After adjustment for sociodemographic covariables, it was estimated that with regard to 1977-1978, the proportion of men with a BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 doubled over the 15-year period (odds ratio OR (95% confidence intervals, 95% CI)): 1.98 (1.40; 2.80). CONCLUSION: Keeping in mind that the trends have been calculated from data from four different studies, presenting some shortcomings, prevalence of obesity has increased between 1977-1992 in men aged 40-54 y at work. This rise is particularly pronounced in the lower educated groups.",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,1998 Oct,England,1998,90
9806086,Psychiatry and the burden of mental illness.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the morbidity produced by mental disorders, to project changes in morbidity likely to be produced by demographic and economic change, and to review the possible role of psychiatry in the health care system. METHODS: Using prevalence data for psychiatric disorders and population projections, this paper presents the likely changes in morbidity over the next 20 years. A review of social and economic information indicates changes in social attitudes and their effects on mental health. This paper examines the determinants of health and how they are likely to change and explores some possible directions for changes in health care delivery. RESULTS: Psychiatric disorders have been greatly underestimated as a cause of disability but account for 5 of the 10 leading causes of disability and 47.2% of all years lived with a disability (YLD) in developed countries. By 2016, there will be significant changes in the distribution and type of psychiatric disorders seen in the population, with cases of dementia almost doubling. Most of the population growth will be in the older age-groups, who will be well informed and will demand high standards of service. The gap between rich and poor will increase, and the results of childhood poverty and abuse will become more apparent. The disadvantaged, including many mentally ill, will suffer deprivation as disability payments decline, but youth unemployment will improve, possibly reducing crime rates. Forced early retirements will decline. Alternative medicine will make inroads into health care. A crisis in subsidized accommodation for the elderly can be anticipated, which perhaps will lead to reopening institutions that are currently being closed or to developing new forms of care. As the baby boomers pass 50 years of age and begin consuming health care services, governments will revise plans and eligibility for services; users will pay for services more directly. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatry is very vulnerable to minor changes in health care schemes and will increasingly be called on to show economic arguments to justify its services. Pressure to support a primary care model by changing practice styles, developing new skills, and training practitioners will probably occur. The major growth area likely will be geriatric psychiatry.",Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie,1998 Oct,United States,1998,90
9802736,Determinants of the quality of life of patients with diabetes under intensified insulin therapy.,"OBJECTIVE: The concept of quality of life (QOL) is understood as a multidimensional construct made up of physiological, psychological, and social aspects, but their particular weightings for the global QOL are rarely investigated. We examined 1) the general QOL of patients with diabetes, 2) the significance of the individual QOL aspects for the overall assessment of QOL, and 3) the modulating function of coping mechanism and particular personality traits. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 116 diabetes patients under intensified insulin therapy were studied, as were 107 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 66 patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 229 students who served as control subjects. The examination was based on eight standardized QOL and personality questionnaires (354 items) and assessed by means of linear structural regression models (AMOS 3.6). RESULTS: The QOL of diabetes patients appears to be higher than the QOL of other chronically ill patients. Social, psychological, and physical aspects contribute to the overall QOL, although physical complaints receive a comparatively low weighting. Coping behavior and particular personality traits covary with all QOL aspects, giving these variables greater significance for the QOL than the existence of secondary illnesses. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that the various factors involved in the multidimensional construct QOL receive different weightings was confirmed, making a simple summary score for the general QOL appear unjustifiable. In addition, all aspects that are commonly understood as parameters of QOL are influenced by external factors, such as coping behavior, based on individual personality characteristics.",Diabetes care,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90
9801018,"Prevalence of hearing loss in older adults in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. The Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study.","There are no recent population-based data on the prevalence of hearing loss in older adults using standard audiometric testing. The population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study was designed to measure the prevalence of hearing loss in adults aged 48-92 years, residing in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. Hearing thresholds were measured with standardized protocols using pure-tone air- and bone-conduction audiometry in sound-treated booths. The examination also included an otoscopic evaluation, screening tympanogram, and a questionnaire on hearing-related medical history, noise exposure, other potential risk factors, and self-perceived hearing handicap. Of the 4,541 eligible people, 3,753 (82.6%) participated in the hearing study (1993-1995). The average age of participants was 65.8 years, and 57.7% were women. The prevalence of hearing loss was 45.9%. The odds of hearing loss increased with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.88 for 5 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80-1.97) and were greater for men than women (OR = 4.42, 95% CI 3.73-5.24). The male excess of hearing loss remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, education, noise exposure, and occupation (OR = 3.65). These results demonstrate that hearing loss is a very common problem affecting older adults. Epidemiologic studies are needed to understand the genetic, environmental, and sex-related determinants of age-related hearing loss and to identify potential intervention strategies.",American journal of epidemiology,1998 Nov 1,United States,1998,90
9798834,Functional status of cortical and subcortical nonhemorrhagic stroke survivors and the effect of lesion laterality.,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of cortical and subcortical infarcts and lesion laterality on the functional status of stroke survivors. Medical records of 72 stroke survivors admitted to an acute inpatient rehabilitation facility with a single nonhemorrhagic lesion were retrospectively reviewed. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to assess the effects of lesion level and hemisphere on admission and discharge Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and FIM gain. Admission FIM-Total and its subdimensions exhibited significant overall level (Wilk's lambda = 2.5; P = 0.03) and hemisphere-specific (Wilk's lambda = 2.3; P = 0.04) effects. Significant interaction between factors was noted only for the communication subdimension. Significant level and hemisphere-specific main effects were noted for admission FIM-Total (P < 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). There were significant level-specific main effects for self-care (P = 0.01) and mobility (P = 0.03) and hemisphere and level-specific main effects for communication (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively) and social cognition (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively). Discharge FIM-Total and its subdimensions exhibited significant overall level (Wilk's lambda = 2.5; P = 0.03) and hemisphere-specific (Wilk's lambda = 3.4; P = 0.01) effects. Discharge FIM subdimensions did not exhibit significant interaction between factors. Discharge FIM-Total was significant with respect to lesion level (P = 0.01) but not with respect to hemisphere (P = 0.08). There was a significant level-specific main effect for self-care (P = 0.01) and level and hemisphere-specific main effects for communication (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively) and social cognition (P = 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively). FIM gain scores did not exhibit significant level (Wilk's lambda = 1.1; P = 0.36) or hemisphere-specific (Wilk's lambda = 1.4; P = 0.24) effects. The data suggest that the lesion level and hemisphere are important determinants of the function of nonhemorrhagic stroke survivors during inpatient rehabilitation.",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,1998 Sep-Oct,United States,1998,90
9798425,Older women's beliefs about physical activity.,"Physical activity may contribute to important health and well-being outcomes among older adults. Efforts to understand determinants of physical activity are necessary to plan effective interventions. The theory of planned behavior has been successfully applied to a variety of health behaviors. Previous research using the theory of planned behavior has not addressed beliefs about overall physical activity among community-dwelling older women. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 30 older women to identify behavioral beliefs, perceived control beliefs, and normative beliefs, which influence physical activity decisions. Content analyses of responses revealed three major themes: social influences on physical activity, psychosocial benefits of activity, and joint problems and fatigue as factors that interfere with activity. These findings about physical activity were compared with published findings about episodic exercise among 30 similar women who took part in an episodic exercise study. The result was the discovery that the women in this study talked about physical activity as embedded in their social lives while the women in the episodic exercise study viewed exercise as separate from their daily lives. These findings of beliefs about overall physical activity suggest a social model may be useful in planning public health interventions to increase activity among older women.","Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)",1998 Oct,United States,1998,90

What isn't wrong with the system, that is, the lies promulgated in the United States press about long waiting lines for care and Canadians pouring across the border for care unavailable in Canada, is included. The second issue is what's wrong, and has always been wrong, with the Canadian system: it's a private-practice, fee-for-service medical (some would say ""sickness"") care system in which the social determinants of health and primary prevention have never been appropriately funded.

The sample consisted of 128 rural African-American and white adolescent women. Forty-four percent of the variance in health-promoting behavior of this sample was explained by five variables: self-image, problem solving, mother's education, employment status, and family structure.

9793892,Characteristics of responders and non-responders in an infant feeding study.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have fully investigated and described the characteristics of non-responders in infant breast feeding studies. Examination of the characteristics of non-responders enhances this understanding and provides information on the representativeness of the sample actually investigated. METHODS: As part of a larger local longitudinal study, couples whose babies were due to be born during the three months of the study in the autumn of 1995, at two local maternity hospitals, were approached by midwives to participate in the study of infant feeding patterns and determinants, including interviews, questionnaires and postal survey. From the 648 eligible mothers, 91 (14 per cent) were not approached, 233 (35.9 per cent) consented but were not interviewed, 256 (39.5 per cent) consented and were interviewed and 68 (10.5 per cent) refused to participate (non-responders) in the longitudinal study. To make a comparison between the 'responders' (i.e. the 233 who consented but were not interviewed and the 256 who consented and were interviewed) and non-responders (the 68 who refused to consent), appropriate data were collected on their socio-demographic characteristics, their feeding intentions and their feeding behaviour. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed a number of significant differences between responders and non-responders. However, log-linear analysis of these differences indicated that the main factors that differentiated between responders and non-responders were social class, smoking habit and actual feeding behaviour. When comparing the feeding intention at the time of 'booking', the non-responders compared with the responders were less likely to intend to breastfeed and more likely to be uncertain about their feeding intentions. Following delivery non-responders compared with responders were more likely to bottle feed their babies. By the time of discharge, of the non-responders, 83.6 per cent were bottle feeding in comparison with 47.3 per cent of responders who were also bottle feeding. CONCLUSIONS: In this study non-responders were found to be more similar to bottle-feeding responders than to breastfeeding responders. Furthermore, non-responders were more likely to be smokers, from lower social class and to bottle feed. This study also showed that the non-responders were more undecided about their feeding intention at the time of the booking visit. Invariably a higher percentage of mothers who were undecided at the booking visit chose to bottle feed their babies at discharge. These results highlight the impact of failing to include information from non-responders when conducting research which examines patterns of infant breastfeeding and attitudes towards it.",Journal of public health medicine,1998 Sep,England,1998,90
9792369,"Targeted intervention research studies on sexually transmitted diseases (STD): methodology, selected findings and implications for STD service delivery and communications.","OBJECTIVE: To report the findings of qualitative studies designed for use in improving sexually transmitted disease (STD) programs. The studies explore illness conceptions and treatment behaviors for STD in five African countries. These targeted intervention research (TIR) studies were performed on clinic-based and community-based samples in representative communities and utilized a variety of qualitative research methods (e.g. in-depth and key informant interviews, focus group discussions). FINDINGS: Study findings revealed that community members' explanations of symptoms, classification of illnesses, and perceptions of whether symptoms are pathological or serious influence individual health-care-seeking behaviors. Data also showed that local terms for STD are often disparaging and do not fit into biomedical designations. STD patient care-seeking frequently reflects an ordered, albeit loosely constructed, process of elimination in pursuit of symptom relief, wherein alternative treatments are tried and proven effective or abandoned. CONCLUSIONS: The TIR studies highlight the importance of community-specific strategies aimed at increasing prompt care seeking at qualified biomedical facilities. Information from study data should lead programs to sensitize health professionals to community understanding about STD and to design services and communication programs that are meaningful and appropriate to local contexts.","AIDS (London, England)",1998,England,1998,90
9788211,Pupil-class determinants of aggressive and victim behaviour in pupils.,"BACKGROUND: Aggressive behaviour in pupils is expressed in, e.g., bullying, sexual harassment, and violence. Different kinds of variables could be relevant in explaining a pupil's aggressive or victim behaviour. AIMS: To develop a multilevel theoretical and empirical explanation for different kinds of aggressive and victim behaviour displayed by pupils in a classroom and school environment. SAMPLES: A national survey was carried out to identify different kinds of aggressive and victim behaviour displayed by pupils and to assess other variables related to pupils, classes, and schools. A total of 1998 pupils from 100 third and fourth year classes attending 71 different secondary schools took part in the research. METHODS: Data were analysed by a series of secondary multilevel analyses using the MLA-program. RESULTS: Being a boy, being more extravert, being more disagreeable, coming across fewer teachers with positive teaching behaviour, and attending a lower type of secondary school, help explain why someone is a perpetrator as such. Being a boy, being more disagreeable, being more emotionally unstable, being open to new ideas, and seeing more teachers as being strict, function as explanatory pupil variables for victim behaviour. Other pupil level variables determine more specific aggressive and victim behaviour aspects. Various other class level and school level variables are relevant, too. CONCLUSIONS: Personal and environmental pupil variables are more important than class variables but class variables are in turn more important than school variables in explaining a pupil's aggressive and victim behaviour.",The British journal of educational psychology,1998 Sep,England,1998,90
9785712,Understanding developmental psychopathology: how useful are evolutionary accounts?,"OBJECTIVE: To consider the power of principles derived from evolutionary biology to explain the causes and determinants of some forms of child and adolescent mental disorders. METHOD: The authors reviewed the scientific literature for evolutionary mechanisms proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of early-onset disorders. RESULTS: A diverse set of evolutionary mechanisms has been proposed. With the exception of certain genetically determined conditions, many of the proposed mechanisms have little empirical data to support them. One mechanism focuses on the vulnerabilities associated with conserved behavior patterns, such as separation anxiety and other alarm responses. These behavioral patterns are adaptive if they appear in some situations, but not in others. Other attractive theories include a co-optation of underlying neurobiology systems (substance abuse), environmental shifts (transformation of present day environments away from primeval environments), and evolutionary arms races as may occur in putative autoimmune disorders with neuropsychiatric sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Evolutionary biology provides a potentially powerful framework for understanding disease pathogenesis in child psychiatry and should permit the integration of new knowledge from a broad range of scientific disciplines. Evolutionary explanations are typically population-based and fail to account for why a particular individual is disciplines. Evolutionary explanations are typically population-based and fail to account for why a particular individual is affected. Consequently, any adequate account of disease pathogenesis requires that environmental events that impinge on CNS development be considered. Finally, the empirical testing of specific theories may prove to be difficult if not impossible.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1998 Oct,United States,1998,90
9785696,Sexual risk behavior among youth: modeling the influence of prosocial activities and socioeconomic factors.,"Sexual activity among high-school-aged youths has steadily increased since the 1970s, emerging as a significant public health concern. Yet, patterns of youth sexual risk behavior are shaped by social class, race, and gender. Based on sociological theories of financial deprivation and collective socialization, we develop and test a model of the relationships among neighborhood poverty; family structure and social class position; parental involvement; prosocial activities; race; and gender as they predict youth sexual risk behavior. We employ structural equation modeling to test this model on a cross-sectional sample of 370 sexually active high-school students from a midwestern city; 57 percent (n = 209) are males and 86 percent are African American. We find that family structure indirectly predicts sexual risk behavior through neighborhood poverty, parental involvement, and prosocial activities. In addition, family class position indirectly predicts sexual risk behavior through neighborhood poverty and prosocial activities. We address implications for theory and health promotion.",Journal of health and social behavior,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90
9785693,Trust me: technical and institutional determinants of health maintenance organizations shifting risk to physicians.,"This paper examines the factors that influence a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) to shift risk to doctors through an incentive arrangement called capitation, where physicians are paid a fixed amount per patient for a period of time for any and all medical services required by the patient. Multispecialty-medical-group (Group) HMOs are more likely to shift risk than Independent Physician Associations (IPA) HMOs. Within IPA HMOs, larger enrollment per physician is positively associated with more risk shifting. We find that institutional factors signaling legitimacy play an important role in determining risk shifting. For-profit HMOs are less likely to shift risk, which we interpret as reflecting consumer distrust of for-profit HMOs. However, for-profit HMOs that are federally qualified, which we interpret as a signal of legitimacy, are more likely to shift risk.",Journal of health and social behavior,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90

It looks at some of the ethical consequences of the biological deterministic paradigm, particularly the popular confusion of ""genes"" with ""race"" and how this paradigm served to exclude consideration of social determinants of disease in epidemiological thinking. Some alternative hypotheses to the thrifty gene theory are explored, together with the consequences of acceptance of these other theories in terms of public health action.

9780811,"Postnatal depression and social supports in Vietnamese, Arabic and Anglo-Celtic mothers.","The significance of a western woman's social supports to postnatal depression is well documented. We examine which deficits in components of their social support network are associated with postnatal depression in women from a non-English-speaking background. The social support network and postnatal mood of 105 Anglo-Celtic, 113 Vietnamese and 98 Arabic women were assessed at 6 weeks postpartum. The role of social supports in determining scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was analysed using multiple regressions. For Anglo-Celtic women, low postnatal mood was associated with perceived need for more emotional support from partners and mothers. For Vietnamese women, low postnatal mood was associated with poor quality of relationship with the partner and a perceived need for more practical help from him. For Arabic women, low postnatal mood was associated with perceived need for more emotional support from partners. We conclude that cultural factors mediate the relation between social supports and postnatal depression more likely to become clinically depressed (Lovestone and Kumar 1993) and infants may have adverse cognitive, behavioural and emotional outcomes, which can be linked to the postnatal depression (Murray and Cooper 1996).",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1998 Oct,Germany,1998,90

From the situation of the Cote d'Ivoire as observed from the period 1987-1997].,"WHO is commissioned to create the World AIDS Program and to elaborate the strategy for the fight against the AIDS pandemic. The standardised strategy for African countries developed in Geneva in 1987 favours the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV without communicating the methods for such. The external and exclusive nature of the technical intervention of WHO and the lack of its adaptation to the dynamics of the epidemic in the 90s, (increase in seroprevalence among pregnant women, increase in the number of sick and HIV infected children, and economical and social consequences of the disease) explain in part the fact that the objectives haven't been reached on the continent a decade later. It seems important to us that the national authorities take responsibility concerning the development of an integrated strategy for AIDS prevention-care that takes into account the determinants of the propagation of the virus in Africa, advocates widespread access to testing-counselling for the general population and pregnant women, provides training for all health personnel concerning care for infected people, and promotes the implementation of social mechanisms for the future and financing for care, including symptomatic treatment for opportunistic infections.","Sante publique (Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France)",1998 Jun,France,1998,90
9773761,Is educational attainment associated with shared determinants of health in the elderly? Findings from the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of educational attainment with an array of risk factors for poor health among high-functioning older men and women. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of psychosocial, behavioral, and biological factors and educational attainment were conducted using data from a population-based cohort study of older men and women. Participants consisted of 70- to 79-year-old residents of communities of East Boston, MA; New Haven, CT; and Durham County, NC (N = 1192) participating in the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly programs, a three-site longitudinal study of community-dwelling men and women. Participants were selected on the basis of high physical and cognitive function, representing approximately the top third of their peers in terms of functional ability in 1988. In-home interviews were conducted. Associations among education and behavioral (e.g., cigarette smoking and physical activity), biological (e.g., pulmonary function, serum cholesterol), psychological (e.g., self-efficacy, anxiety), and social (e.g., networks and support) factors were examined. RESULTS: Low levels of education were associated with poorer psychological function (less mastery, efficacy, happiness), less optimal health behaviors (increased tobacco consumption and decreased levels of physical activity), poorer biological conditions (decreased pulmonary function, increased body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio), and larger social networks (increased number of contacts, decreased negative support). Several factors (alcohol consumption, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were nonlinearly related to educational attainment. CONCLUSIONS: Educational attainment is associated with a broad array of psychosocial and biological conditions among the elderly. That an education gradient functions over an array of factors that structure daily life, even in later life in a healthy population, may suggest how socioeconomic status influences health.",Psychosomatic medicine,1998 Sep-Oct,United States,1998,90
9769664,[A theoretical approach to health and its measurement].,"INTRODUCTION: For a long period of time analyses of health status have been based on mortality data, while in this century indicators of morbidity have been introduced as well. However, these two indicators also have limitations because health of the total population was estimated on the basis of data referring to the diseased or deceased during a certain period of time. The definition of health by the World Health Organization was a progress, because the medical model of health was extended to the sociological model with emphasis on well-being, achievement of goals, functioning in the society and social rules. Subjective interpretation of health also has a significant place in assessment of health status of an individual or population groups. CONCEPTION OF HEALTH: Health has a subjective and an objective dimension. It can be analyzed as a global quality, but also as a sum of specific qualities--physical, social and psychological. Health analyses include the following parameters: mental well-being (affective status, mental functioning), physical health (ability to proceed with activities, body integrity, general physical capacity), general well-being and functioning (perceiving general health and expectations in regard to health in the future). Health is a prerequisite of social and economic status, and that is why emphasis is on social adaptation, but social support as well. HEALTH MEASUREMENT: Health measurement can be functional with diagnostic, prognostic or evaluation purpose. Health indicators can also be descriptive, focused on a certain organ, diagnostic methods, but complex as well measuring syndromes, global health and quality of life. Development of health promotion and programs of disease prevention, follow-up of their application, progress and results require various categories of measurement. Some of them identify or quantify the problem, others describe the determinants. There exists a need to measure the contents and processes of intervention and evaluation. Numerous scales of health measurement, that is different aspects of health and quality of life, have been developed, but many of them have limitations, particularly concerning validity and reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Most of existing indicators reflect the model of disease, while contemporary approach to health deals primarily with health itself. This model is oriented towards everyday life and relationships between individuals or groups of people and their physical and social environment as well as towards the way they influence health and well-being. The model also emphasizes well-being, achievement of goals, functioning in the society and social roles. Subjective assessment of health is significant in evaluation of health status, that is quality of life in regard to health, which is being done by different scales. The development of such scales is slow due to different opinions concerning the definition of health and health measurement. Efforts to develop scales which would satisfy the basic characteristics of measurement have largely focused on validity, reliability, accuracy, sensibility, specificity and feasibility.",Medicinski pregled,1998 Jul-Aug,Serbia,1998,90
9768445,Use of a historical register in social epidemiology: child mortality in Stockholm at the turn of the 19th century.,"This study describes the age- and cause-specific levels and social determinants of high child mortality in Stockholm around the turn of the century. The study is based on computerized individual level sociodemographic information and the death certificates of children aged 0-15 years residing in Maria parish in Stockholm during the years 1885, 1891 and 1910 (n = 36,718) from a historical register (the Roteman archives). The usefulness of such data for further studies in social epidemiology is discussed. Age-specific rates and major causes of death compared well with other studies. Low social class and being born out of wedlock increased the overall risk of death in early childhood. Data appear valid and may be useful in social epidemiology. Further analyses of data from the Roteman archives may contribute to the understanding of causes behind high levels of cause- specific child mortality and trends in mortality in relation to societal change.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine,1998 Sep,Sweden,1998,90
9759686,National patterns and predictors of beta-blocker use in patients with coronary artery disease.,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies suggest underuse of beta-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease, but these studies have been based on selected populations of recently hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe national patterns and determinants of beta-blocker use in the ambulatory setting. METHODS: We analyzed 11745 visits by patients with coronary artery disease to randomly selected, office-based physicians in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys for 1980, 1981, 1985, and 1989 through 1996. We used multiple logistic regression to determine the independent effect of sociodemographic and clinical factors on beta-blocker use. OUTCOME MEASURE: Beta-blocker use at patient visits. RESULTS: Beta-blocker use was reported in only 20.9% of office visits by patients with coronary artery disease and no strong contraindications between 1993 and 1996. In multivariate analyses, age younger than 75 years, residence in the Northeast, and visits to cardiologists and internists compared with family and general practitioners predicted greater use of beta-blocker therapy. White race and private insurance also were significant predictors of beta-blocker use between 1980 and 1996. Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant decline in beta-blocker use from 1980 to 1990, followed by a gradual increase in recent years. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-blockers appear to be underused in ambulatory patients with coronary artery disease. Our data suggest that nonclinical factors may influence rates of use, indicating the need for closer scrutiny of variations in physician prescribing practices.",Archives of internal medicine,1998 Sep 28,United States,1998,90
9755368,Competence in discourse as a measure of social integration and quality of life in persons with traumatic brain injury.,"Persisting difficulties in communication are a serious handicap faced by many after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a major barrier to community reintegration. Conventional approaches to the study of communication problems after TBI have focused on the form of language production and expression, usually in terms of phonological, semantic, and syntactical features. Most TBI patients, however, perform overall within normal ranges on these conventional indicators. More recently, attention has focused on language in its naturally-occurring form, that is, discourse, which is heavily influenced by linguistic, cognitive and social skills. Because most TBI patients are left with residual deficits in these areas, study of discourse abilities seem to be particularly suited to understanding their problems in communication and facilitating eventual reintegration into the community. This study was designed to determine if and how the conversational discourse of TBI patients differs from a matched non-TBI group and whether any identified variables are related to measures of outcome as measured by community integration and quality of life. Additionally, the study was designed to explore the relationship between TBI and features of discourse across conversational, narrative, procedural genres. TBI patients (n = 30) from an out-patient brain injury programme were compared to matched controls (n = 10) in the three discourse genres. Bivariate and multivariate analyses evaluated 23 measures of discourse efficiency, complexity, topic management, information and pragmatic behaviours in each genre as well as measures of psychosocial adjustment, particularly social integration and quality of life. Results indicated that TBIs were significantly different from controls on several measures of discourse and psychosocial adjustment. A number of other features of discourse were found to correlate significantly with social integration and quality of life. Interestingly, discourse variables appeared to correlate with social integration more strongly than age, gender, education, and other conventional psychosocial factors. Contrary to prediction, features of conversational discourse did not correlate more strongly than other types of discourse with social integration and quality of life. Discussion centred on the apparent comorbidity of features in everyday discourse and psychosocial determinants that were associated with quality of life and social integration.",Brain injury,1998 Sep,England,1998,90
9752284,[Influence of knowledge relative to cancer on prevention behavior in the population of Bas-Rhin].,"The tendency today is to make the population more aware of health in order to encourage their use of prevention activities. The aim of our telephone survey which was performed on a representative sample of the population (1,010) in the Bas-Rhin department in France, was to study the relationship between the level of knowledge of cancer and the use of screening techniques to prevent it. Eighty-two percent of the males and 78% of the females surveyed, show a profound understanding of cancer in general, the associated risk factors and its prevention. The level of awareness of males did not influence a specific behaviour (p = 0.68) towards cancer prevention. It was shown that in smokers, the more they smoke, the more they underestimate the chances of cure from all categories of cancer (p = 0.01). They both overestimate the number of cigarettes needed daily before smoking becomes toxic (p < 0.01) and are less active physically than nonsmokers (p < 0.007). Heavy smokers live in larger communities (p < 0.02) and smokers are younger than non-smokers (p < 0.0001). In the female population, the level of awareness did indeed influence their behaviour towards cancer prevention (p < 0.04). The level of knowledge was higher in both those who consciously attend cancer screening clinics (cervical Papanicolaou smears and faecal tests) and those who are opposed to faecal tests. Younger females are significantly less aware than those who are older (p = 0.0001) and more than two-thirds of these would not consider a cervical Papanicolaou smear as a preventative diagnostic tool. Females who conscientiously attend cancer screening clinics and who are very much aware of cancer, are generally older in age (p < 0.05). The occurrence of mammography as a preventative measure is both high and dependent on age. In conclusion, the level of knowledge of cancer cannot explain alone human behaviour towards the prevention of this disease. Other determinants responsible for influencing human behaviour towards cancer prevention will be better understood once the social sciences, epidemiology and anthropology units work together and combine resources to achieve a common goal.",Bulletin du cancer,1998 Jun,France,1998,90
9748791,[Use of methadone in the treatment of narcotic addiction].,"In spite of the 30-year experience in the use of methadone in heroin addicts, there is no consensus about the value of that method. In view of the opinion that resistance to methadone treatment is partly caused by ignorance, the aim of this paper is to improve the knowledge about the method. The paper offers explanation of: (1) metabolic basis of heroin addiction, (2) methadone pharmacology, (3) psychosocial aspects of the addiction, (4) methadone treatment procedure, (5) aims and (6) results of the treatment. A demand for designing the treatment program on the basis of expert knowledge rather than on political and moral judgments is stressed. Topics in program organization are described: indications, daily dosage and its administration, treatment duration, professional job-sharing and control of the treatment. A review of medical goals--individual-oriented and social-oriented goals of the treatment is made. ""Therapeutic milieu"", as well as treatment dose and treatment duration have been recognized as the main determinants of the outcome. Evaluation criteria and treatment have been elaborated as potential basis for further research.",Lijecnicki vjesnik,1998 May,Croatia,1998,90
9745425,Are autoimmune thyroid dysfunction and depression related?,"The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease and depression in perimenopausal women. Thyroid function [TSH, free T4, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab)] and depression (using the Edinburgh Depression Scale) were assessed cross-sectionally together with other determinants of depression. The subjects were 583 randomly selected perimenopausal women (aged 47-54 yr) from a community cohort of 6846 women. The main outcome measures were the occurrence of thyroid dysfunction (abnormal free T4 and/or TSH or elevated levels of TPO-Ab) and the concomitant presence of depression according to the Edinburgh Depression Scale. Neither biochemical thyroid dysfunction nor menopausal status was related to depression. Apart from several psycho-social determinants (the occurrence of a major life event, a previous episode of depression, or financial problems), an elevated level of TPO-Ab (> or = 100 U/mL) was significantly associated with depression (odds ratio, 3.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.8). We conclude that women with elevated TPO-Ab levels are especially vulnerable to depression, whereas postmenopausal status does not increase the risk of depression.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90
9743893,Prevalence and determinants of current contraceptive method use in a palm oil company in Cameroon.,"The principal reasons given by African women for not using contraception include their lack of economic power and control over their choice of partner. An epidemiologic descriptive survey of a cross-section of the female personnel of a Cameroonian palm oil company (SOCAPALM) was carried out in August 1995, to evaluate the various determinants and level of use of various family planning methods in a well defined population of women in employment. An exhaustive list of all the households in the five villages of SOCAPALM was compiled and all women between 15 and 49 years of age who had lived on the palm oil plantation for at least a year were interviewed. The adjusted odds ratios showed that use of modern contraceptive methods was significantly associated with the woman having received secondary education, having more than three children, being the head of the household and, in cases where there was a man regularly present in the household, his approval of family planning. Recently receiving information (during the last month) about family planning was not identified by multivariate analysis as a significant factor affecting the decision to use modern or traditional contraception. The same factors were found to be associated with the use of traditional methods of contraception, but having had an illegal abortion was also associated with the use of such methods. Thus, the level of knowledge about family planning and the prevalence of contraceptive use was significantly higher for women living in industrial environments (such as SOCAPALM), than in the overall population of women in Cameroon. The economic power of the woman, the presence of a strong social reproductive health network, and the positive attitude of men and community leaders were the most important factors affecting the family planning decision of the women.",Contraception,1998 Jul,United States,1998,90
9743736,Changes in patterns of risk.,"Against the background of debate about the nature of risk in relation to HIV transmission, and resultant changes in risk discourse from risk group to risk behaviour to risk situation, declines in the velocity of HIV spread are being documented in countries with high levels of political commitment and multi-sectoral approaches. Biological markers of sexual activity such as sexually transmitted disease incidence and HIV prevalence corroborate reports that young adults in Uganda and Thailand are increasingly adopting preventive behaviours. Risk perception, perceived social and community norms and self-efficacy influence behavioural change, but structural and contextual factors, including resource constraints affecting HIV prevention programmes and the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and social marginalization and stigmatization affecting access of vulnerable populations to the means of prevention play determinant roles. Both patterns of risk for HIV infection and our understanding of them are evolving. More research is required to gain knowledge and understanding of factors such as partner concurrency as well as cultural and socio-economic determinants and contextual underpinnings of sexual and drug injecting networks. This is an essential first step to mobilizing communities to take action at the individual, partnership and community levels to reduce risk.",AIDS care,1998 Jun,England,1998,90
9741501,Role of different determinants of psychological distress in acute coronary syndromes.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of psychological distress and of its major determinants in acute coronary patients and in a control group. BACKGROUND: The prevalence and major determinants of psychological distress in acute coronary patients are not clear. METHODS: One hundred and thirty cardiac patients (110 men, age 56+/-9; 85 with acute myocardial infarction and 45 with unstable angina) and 102 controls hospitalized for acute trauma (70 men, age 55+/-9 years) were studied and the level of psychological distress estimated by a Modified Maastricht Questionnaire, self-ratings and ratings by a close relative. Major determinants of psychological distress were assessed by the Life Events Assessment, the Social Support Questionnaire and the Ways of Coping Checklist. RESULTS: The average level of psychological distress was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in coronary patients than in controls in all tests (self-evaluation=7.1+/-2.3 vs 4.3+/-2.4; relative-evaluation = 7.4+/-2.4 vs 4.2+/- 2.5; Modified Maastricht Questionnaire=91+/-32 vs 59+/-30). Cardiac patients reported significantly higher (p < 0.05) levels of social isolation (28.9+/-11.1 vs 23.4+/-8.8), self-blame (7.2+/-1.9 vs 5.8+/- 1.6) and avoidance (21.1+/-3.5 vs 18.9+/-3) and more painful life events (3.9+/-3.8 vs 2.6+/-2.2), than controls. However, not all patients had evidence of distress; indeed, cluster analysis identified a subgroup that comprised 75% of controls and 25% of cardiac patients with no determinants eliciting distress, while the other four subgroups, with one or more determinants of distress, comprised about 75% of patients and only 25% of controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a high level of psychological distress is detectable in about 75% of patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina and is related to one or more major determinants.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90
9740341,Classical risk factors and their impact on incident non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality in southern Germany. Results from the MONICA Augsburg cohort study 1984-1992. Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases.,"BACKGROUND: The MONICA (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases) project in Augsburg provides the first population-based cohort study in Germany to quantify the associations of the risk factors hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking with incident non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality, and to assess their impact at the population level. METHODS: The cohort comprises 1074 men and 1013 women aged 45-64 years; they were followed over 8 years from 1984-1992. In the men, there were 61 non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarctions and 92 all-cause mortality events over this period; in the women the number of deaths from all causes was 45. Incidence rates, hazard rate ratios, population attributable fractions and rate advancement periods were calculated. RESULTS: Adjusting for confounders, the myocardial infarction hazard rate ratios for men with hypertension, or a total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio > or =5.5, or smoking > or =20 cigarettes/day, were 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-3.5), 2.9 (95%, CI 1.7-5.0), and 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1 4-5.0), respectively. The risk factor combination total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio > or = 5.5 and cigarette smoking was particularly hazardous. The three risk factors contributed 65% of the burden of myocardial infarction in the population. The rate advancement period for myocardial infarction associated with hypertension, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio > or =5.5 or smoking > or =20 cigarettes/day was 8.3, 12.4 and 11.5 years, respectively. In women, these risk factors were similarly predictive of all-cause mortality. Comparing the cohort data from Augsburg with those of two occupational cohorts from Germany reveals higher absolute myocardial infarction risks in the Augsburg population; however, the relative risk estimates in the Augsburg and the two occupational cohorts were very similar. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the important contribution of the classical risk factors to the risk of myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality in Germany. The results pertaining to the concept of rate advancement periods particularly demonstrate the great potential for prevention.",European heart journal,1998 Aug,England,1998,90
9738167,Separate but lethal: the effects of economic segregation on mortality in metropolitan America.,"The increase in income inequality in the United States over the past 20 years has been accompanied by a pronounced increase in economic segregation in urban areas. No research to date has analyzed the potential effects of such spatial segregation on mortality. To investigate these effects, the mortality experience of respondents aged 30 years and older on the 1986-94 National Health Interview Surveys residing in any one of 30 large metropolitan areas in the United States was analyzed. Concentrated poverty was associated with significantly elevated risk of mortality, even after controlling for individual household income. Concentrated affluence showed a consistent, protective effect only among the elderly. The effects were most pronounced among the poor, but were not confined to them. Urban planning should take into account the effects associated with economic residential segregation.",The Milbank quarterly,1998,United States,1998,90
9738161,Ten-year trends of heart disease risk factors in the Halifax County MONICA population. MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate trends in heart disease risk factors (RFs) in the general population of Halifax County, Nova Scotia during a 10-year period. DESIGN: Two independent random samples of the population of Halifax County were surveyed in 1985 and 1995; age ranges were 25-64 years and 25-74 years. Blood pressure, cholesterol and body weight were measured. Smoking and health history were obtained by questionnaire. MAIN RESULTS: Participation rate was 66.3% in 1985 and 1995. All RFs were negatively correlated with education attainment. RF changes from 1985 to 1995 were related to education level. Among survey participants, mean body mass index increased from 26.7 kg/m2 to 27.6 kg/m2 (P + 0.005) for men, and from 25.5 kg/m2 to 27.3 kg/m2 (P < 0.00001) for women. Average smoking rate increased from 32.0% to 34.6% (not significant) in men and from 27.7% to 29.1% (not significant) in women. Age-specific smoking rate increased by 13% (P = 0.14) in younger women and decreased by 10% in older women. (P = 0.00). Mean levels of blood cholesterol decreased by 0.2 mmol/L (P = 0.002) in men and 0.1 mmol/L (P = 0.20) in women. Systolic blood pressure increased by 6.3 mmHg (P < 0.0001) in men and by 7.9 mmHg (P < 0.0001) in women, being steepest in the lower education group. Mortality predicted from RFs declined between the survey years, but less than the observed mortality. This discrepancy may result from the effect of medical care or the delayed effect of RF changes. CONCLUSIONS: Some risk factors show a disturbing trend, indicating that an increased effort or a change in strategy is needed to combat the risk of ischemic heart disease.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,1998 Aug,England,1998,90
9735512,The Ontario ban on smoking on school property: perceived impact on smoking.,"We evaluated the impact of the November 1994 ban on smoking on school property in Ontario. Telephone interviews were conducted at the end of the 1995-96 school year with 213 high school administrators. Almost all high schools (96%) prohibit smoking on school property. Although some smoking still occurs on school property, the location of smoking by students has changed, giving rise to perceptions of both benefits and risks, as well as varying complaints from parents, students, neighbours, and nearby businesses. Most of the problems arising from the ban are viewed as minor. Local conditions, particularly the geographic environment of the school, appear to be important determinants of complaints and problems. While sizeable minorities of school administrators felt the ban had favourable effects, the majority perceived little effect on either smoking behaviour or attitudes towards smoking.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1998 Jul-Aug,Switzerland,1998,90
9735069,Social conditions and self-management are more powerful determinants of health than access to care.,"Professional organizations advocate universal access to medical care as a primary approach to improving health in the population. Access to medical services is critical to outcomes of acute processes managed in an inpatient hospital, the setting of most medical education, research, and training, but seems to be limited in its capacity to affect outcomes of outpatient care, the setting of most medical activities. Persistent and widening disparities in health according to socioeconomic status provide evidence of limitations of access to care. First, job classification, a measure of socioeconomic status, was a better predictor of cardiovascular death than cholesterol level, blood pressure, and smoking combined in employed London civil servants with universal access to the National Health Service. Second, disparities in health according to socioeconomic status widened between 1970 and 1980 in the United Kingdom despite universal access (similar trends were seen in the United States). Third, in the United States, noncompletion of high school is a greater risk factor than biological factors for development of many diseases, an association that is explained only in part by age, ethnicity, sex, or smoking status. Fourth, level of formal education predicted cardiovascular mortality better than random assignment to active drug or placebo over 3 years in a clinical trial that provides optimal access to care. Increased recognition of limitations of universal access by physicians and their professional societies may enhance efforts to improve the health of the population.",Annals of internal medicine,1998 Sep 1,United States,1998,90
9732071,Determinants of sexual risk-taking among young HIV-negative gay and bisexual men.,"Data from a cohort of young HIV-negative gay and bisexual men were analyzed to identify determinants of sexual risk-taking at baseline. Gay/bisexual men aged between 18 and 30 completed a self-administered questionnaire including demographics, depression, social support, substance use, and consensual versus nonconsensual sex. Risk-takers were defined as those who had unprotected anal sex with casual male sex partners in the previous year; non-risk-takers were defined as those who reported consistent condom use during anal sex with all male partners in the previous year. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of sexual risk-taking. Of 439 men studied, risk-takers had less education, a higher depression score, less social support, and were more likely to report nonconsensual sex and recreational drug use relative to non-risk-takers. Independent predictors of sexual risk-taking were low education, nitrite use, low social support (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.65; 95% CI, 1.04-2.59), and nonconsensual sex experienced as a youth or adult (AOR=1.85; 95% CI, 1.15-2.96). Young gay/bisexual men reporting nonconsensual sex, low social support, or nitrite use were significantly more likely to have recently had unprotected anal sex with casual partners. HIV prevention programs aimed at young gay/bisexual men should include sexual abuse counselling and foster community norms supporting safer sex practices.",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,1998 Sep 1,United States,1998,90

This definition of women's health provides the conceptual framework for a relevant and effective approach to patient education, health promotion and disease prevention activities in women. Such activities must focus not only on diseases that are more common, more prevalent or more serious in women, but also on priority health issues identified by women themselves, the diversity of women, the determinants of health and above all, the impact of gender on health. These programs must also be based on knowledge resulting from gender sensitive, bias-free health research. The traditional oppression and disempowerment of women must also be addressed at both personal and societal levels, thus broadening our approach so that we become social as well as health activists.",Patient education and counseling,1998 Mar,Ireland,1998,90
9730360,Ethnic differences in correlates of adolescent cigarette smoking.,"PURPOSE: To examine the correlates of cigarette smoking among African-American, Hispanic, and white adolescents in a cross-sectional national sample. METHODS: A total of 1795 mother-child dyads from the 1992 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were selected for analyses. Measures of adolescents cigarette smoking and family, individual, peer, and sociodemographic risk factors were analyzed. RESULTS: White youths reported the highest rates of lifetime, current, and persistent smoking, and initiated smoking at a significantly earlier age than African-Americans and Hispanics. Except for maternal cigarette smoking and substance use, African-Americans and Hispanics experienced a disproportionately larger number of purported risk factors than whites. Multivariate analyses revealed common and ethnic-specific correlates of adolescent lifetime and current smoking, with many more significant associations among whites than minorities. Common correlates included youth's age across all three ethnic groups, problem behaviors and delinquency among whites and African-Americans, and perceived peer pressure to smoke among whites and Hispanics. Ethnic-specific correlates included maternal smoking, maternal cocaine use, low maternal religiosity, and negative scholastic attitudes, which increased smoking for whites; and positive parenting, which reduced smoking for African-Americans. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of effects of maternal smoking and perceived peer pressure to smoke on African-American adolescents compared with whites suggests that role modeling and interpersonal influence may be more important determinants of smoking for white than African-American adolescents. The differential impact of family and peer factors on the smoking of adolescents of different ethnicity warrants further investigation.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90
9725113,Hyperbolic temporal discounting in social drinkers and problem drinkers.,"Two studies compared participants, distinguished by their typical alcohol consumption, on the degree to which they discounted the value of delayed, hypothetical amounts of money. Heavy social drinkers in Study 1 and problem drinkers in Study 2 both showed greater temporal discounting than light social drinkers; this difference was stronger in Study 2. Both studies found that a hyperbolic function described temporal discounting more accurately than an exponential function. These results are consistent with extending behavioral theories of intertemporal choice to characterize the determinants of alcohol consumption. The discounting differences also are consistent with more general behavioral economic and economic theories of addiction, although the hyperbolic functional form is inconsistent with the exponential discounting function in economic theory. The drinker groups also differed on impulsiveness and time orientation questionnaires, with light drinkers being less impulsive and more future oriented; however, these measures were not strongly correlated with the measure of temporal discounting.",Experimental and clinical psychopharmacology,1998 Aug,United States,1998,90

SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lund University, University Hospital Malmo, Sweden. SUBJECTS: A series of 854 participants at 12-month postabortion follow-up, representing 66.5% of the 1285 women undergoing induced abortion at Malmo, 1989. METHODS: Analysis of data elicited at a semistructured interview 1 year after induced abortion, risk factors for emotional distress being determined in a ""case"" subgroup (n = 139) of women satisfying all the inclusion criteria (i.e., postabortion emotional distress, doubts about abortion decision, would not consider abortion again), as compared with a control group (n = 114) satisfying none of the inclusion criteria. The study design is a retrospective study. RESULTS: In the subgroup with emotional distress (duration ranging from 1 month to still present at 12-month follow-up), the following risk factors were identified: living alone, poor emotional support from family and friends, adverse postabortion change in relations with partner, underlying ambivalence or adverse attitude to abortion, and being actively religious. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, 50-60% of women undergoing induced abortion experienced some measure of emotional distress, classified as severe in 30% of cases. The risk factors identified suggest that it may be possible to ameliorate or even prevent such distress.","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",1998 Aug,Ireland,1998,90
9720645,"Socioeconomic factors, perceived control and self-reported health in Russia. A cross-sectional survey.","Russia has the lowest life expectancy among industrialised countries, but little is known about other health outcomes and determinants of health in the Russian population. Here we report a cross-sectional study in a national sample of the Russian population of social and psychosocial determinants of two self-reported health indicators: self-rated health (shown to predict mortality in prospective studies) and physical functioning (validated against more objective health measures). A multi-stage sample of the Russian population aged 18 years and more was interviewed (n=1599, response rate 66%). The questionnaire included political attitudes, social and economic circumstances, psychosocial factors, smoking, alcohol consumption, self-rated health and physical functioning (from the SF36 instrument). Scores of perceived control over life and over one's health were calculated from 6 and 3 questions, respectively. Data were analysed in logistic regression for two dichotomised outcomes: poor self-rated health (worse than average) and low physical functioning (less than 60% of maximum). Overall, 25% of subjects rated their health as worse than average; this is substantially more than in western countries. Perceived control over life was strongly related to both outcomes; age- and sex-adjusted OR for 1 standard deviation increase in control were 0.60 (95% CI 0.52-0.69) for poor self-rated health and 0.67 (0.57-0.81) for low physical functioning. Adjustment for a battery of other factors reduced these estimates only slightly. Associations between control over one's health and both outcomes were also significant, but weaker and attenuated in multivariate models. Material deprivation was also strongly related to both outcomes. Education was inversely related to self-rated health, and unmarried men reported poor physical functioning substantially more often. Subjects not approving the economic changes reported poorer health but this association was removed by adjustment for socioeconomic factors and control. Subjects who could not rely on informal social structures when in problems reported worse health; this effect largely persisted in multivariate analyses. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that poor health status in Russia is related to dysfunction of social structures, socioeconomic deprivation, and lack of perceived control. The absence of informal social networks, vital for maintaining general welfare, seems to affect adversely self-rated health. Deprivation and low perceived control may be important mediators between the broad social environment and health in populations undergoing transition and can provide a useful framework for many biological and behavioural factors. Prospective studies are needed to address the issue of temporality and reporting bias, the major problems in interpreting these findings.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Jul,England,1998,90

A cross cultural background comparison of general practitioner attitudes towards contraceptive service provision for young adolescent females in Scotland.",No previous studies have examined the influences of cultural background on the provision of contraceptive services to females under 16 years of age. A research project was undertaken to investigate any differences between general practitioners trained in the United Kingdom and those trained in the Indian sub-continent in relation to contraceptive service provision to females under 16 years of age. A self-completion postal questionnaire survey was distributed to 230 unrestricted principal general practitioners across Scotland. Subjects were identified from the Medical Register. Half of the sample consisted of all those working in Scotland who had been trained in the Indian sub-continent. The other half were a comparable group that had been trained in the United Kingdom and were selected by quasi-random quota sampling. The response rate was 57 per cent (131/230). General practitioners in the study who had trained in the Indian sub-continent were found to be significantly less likely to provide contraceptive services to a female under 16 years of age than those who had trained in the United Kingdom. Cultural background may be influential in general practitioner provision of contraceptive services to females below the legal age of consent for sexual intercourse. In order to obtain more conclusive evidence a larger study is necessary.

Despite considerable research and public health efforts, models to inform decision-making about timing of supplementation in policy and practice remain unsatisfactory. In the present review, new models are derived through analysis of the weanling's dilemma. After approximately 6 months, breast milk alone cannot meet the infant's nutritional requirements for growth, but nutritional supplementation raises risks of illness and malnutrition. Timing of supplementation is conditioned by complex short- and long-term trade-offs among infant and maternal needs and constraints. No formulaic solution can be prescribed for this dilemma, but optimal timing of supplementation can be ascertained from infant-, maternal-, and locale-specific conditions. Models for these determinants and trade-offs are presented and applied to data from longitudinal studies of breastfeeding, infant development, and interbirth interval.",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,1998 Aug,United States,1998,90
9713919,Social and behavioral correlates of pelvic inflammatory disease.,"OBJECTIVES: To review the social and behavioral correlates of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in the light of the renewed interest in the transmission dynamics of communicable diseases, the new emphasis on health care seeking and health service provision, and increased attention to contextual and population level factors affecting morbidity. METHODS: Social and behavioral correlates of PID are reviewed using a conceptual scheme that matrixes the differences among risk factors for exposure, acquisition, and development of sequelae with the differences between individual-level risk factors and population-level determinants. RESULTS: Two major factors contribute to the development of PID: recurrent (or persistent) chlamydial infection of the cervix, which are geographically concentrated and associated with contextual variables, and critical delays in detection and treatment of cervical infection, which are amenable to interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread screening for cervical infection followed by timely and appropriate treatment is key for prevention of PID. Health care seeking, provider training, and availability of detection technologies and drugs need to be improved.",Sexually transmitted diseases,1998 Aug,United States,1998,90
9713124,"[Prevention for speech-hearing therapists from the University of Valle in Cali, Colombia].","INTRODUCTION: Preventive activities in communication disorders treated by speech-hearing therapists of the Universidad del Valle in Cali Colombia, between January and April, 1995, are described. METHODOLOGY: Forty-five professionals to whom a self administered questionnaire with 13 questions was applied, were included in the study. RESULTS: For 67% the program of graduation is basic as source of their preventive knowledge. 47% used only one of nine strategic options and 29% report the use of only two of these preventive interventions. For all communication areas, on average nearly 60% of speech-hearing therapists never use preventive actions. CONCLUSION: The alumni of the Universidad del Valle do not exercise the practice of prevention in a systematic way it has been claimed by the curriculum of the school. Some determinants of social context and demand of professional services are suspected to induce a great reduction in the proportion and frequency of preventive practice in the professional role.",Revista de saude publica,1998 Apr,Brazil,1998,90
9711481,AIDS control and the workplace: the role of occupational health services in South Africa.,"AIDS interventions typically fail to address the disjuncture between private behaviors and the social determinants of HIV infection. Data from a telephone survey of manufacturing companies and a postal survey of occupational health nurses in the Western Cape, South Africa, were used to explore the possible role of occupational health services in prevention and control of AIDS. The author found limited evidence of worker involvement in AIDS programs, particularly in companies with occupational health professionals. The management of sexually transmitted diseases was incomplete. Mandatory pre-employment testing of workers for HIV was not widespread. Respondents' opinions on priorities for AIDS prevention and control reflected a preoccupation with knowledge transfer. To ensure their effectiveness, workplace AIDS programs must improve worker participation and integrate AIDS prevention in general workplace health and safety programs. In addition, education programs must develop objectives within a critical theoretical understanding of the behavioral issues relevant to AIDS prevention, and must emphasize the empowerment of women in the workplace. In the context of the present restructuring of health services in South Africa, occupational health services, using the strategies outlined, can make a major contribution to national AIDS prevention and control.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1998,United States,1998,90
9708598,Use of health services by Chinese elderly in Beijing.,"OBJECTIVES: This article provides an inquiry into use of health services by the elderly. METHODS: The authors operationalize models of use with a survey of 350 elderly Chinese. Because the survey involves native Chinese, the empirical test can isolate functional social support as well as ""structural"" social supports (marriage, living with children). RESULTS: The principal findings comport with prior work: the strongest determinants of the use of health services by the elderly are those that relate to need. In addition, structural social support impacts use but demonstrates complex patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of family support increases physician visits while diminishing the probability of a hospital stay. Increased Western physician use ties to increased use of Chinese physicians and increased hospitalization. Functional social support plays a role as well. Finally, income effects did not play a large role in determining the use of health services among this population.",Medical care,1998 Aug,United States,1998,90

9708025,The ABC Schizophrenia Study: a preliminary overview of the results.,"The ABC Schizophrenia Study, a large-scale epidemiological and neurobiological research project commenced in 1987, initially pursued two aims: (1) to elucidate the possible causes of the sex difference in age at first admission for schizophrenia and (2) to analyse the early course of the disorder from onset until first contact and its implications for further course and outcome. First, transnational case-register data (for Denmark and Germany) were compared, second, a population-based sample of first-episode cases of schizophrenia (n = 232) were selected and third, the results obtained were compared with data from the WHO Determinants of Outcome Study by using a systematic methodology. A consistent result was a 3-4 years higher age of onset for women by any definition of onset, which was not explainable by social variables, such as differences in the male-female societal roles. A sensitivity-reducing effect of oestrogen on central D2 receptors was identified as the underlying neurobiological mechanism in animal experiments. Applicability to humans with schizophrenia was established in a controlled clinical study. A comparison of familial and sporadic cases showed that in cases with a high genetic load, the sex difference in age of onset disappeared due to a clearly reduced age of onset in women, whereas in sporadic cases it increased. To analyse early course retrospectively, a semistructured interview, IRAOS, was developed. The early stages of the disorder were reconstructed in comparison with age- and sex-matched controls from the same population of origin. The initial signs consisted mainly of negative and affective symptoms, which accumulated exponentially until the first episode, as did the later emerging positive symptoms. Social disability appeared 2-4 years before first admission on average. In early-onset cases, social course and outcome, studied prospectively over 5 years, was determined by the level of social development at onset through social stagnation. In late-onset cases, decline from initially high social statuses occurred. Socially negative illness behaviour contributed to the poor social outcome of young men. Symptomatology and other proxy variables of the disorder showed stable courses and no sex differences. Further aspects tested were the sequence of onset and the influence of substance abuse on the course of schizophrenia, primary and secondary negative symptoms, structural models and symptom clusters from onset until 5 years after first admission.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1998 Aug,Germany,1998,90
9707954,Situational factors as determinants of community pharmacists' clinical decision making behavior.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relative contribution of two work-related pressures, workload and perceived normative beliefs of significant others, to community pharmacists' clinical decision making behavior. DESIGN: Systematic random sample design. SETTING: A large southeastern city. PARTICIPANTS: 450 independent and chain community pharmacists identified from the state board of pharmacy list of licensed community pharmacists. INTERVENTIONS: A mailed questionnaire asking about community pharmacists' workload pressures and the perceived beliefs of their patients and employers (significant others) approving or disapproving of them providing pharmaceutical care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical decision making behavior, as measured using a subset of the Behavioral Pharmaceutical Care Scale. RESULTS: Response rate was 31.8%. Workload was not significantly related to clinical decision making. After controlling for social desirability and workload, perceived normative beliefs of significant others was highly significant; it accounted for 7.6% of the variance associated with clinical decision making behavior. CONCLUSION: Workload pressures did not appear to influence the provision of pharmaceutical care. Community pharmacists' perceived normative beliefs about their patients' and employer's approval or disapproval of the provision of pharmaceutical care should be further examined within the larger context of the pharmacy organization's climate.","Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association (Washington,D.C. : 1996)",1998 Jul-Aug,United States,1998,90
9707406,Environmental stimulation of 129/SvJ mice causes increased cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus.,"New neurons are continuously born in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse hippocampus, and regulation of adult neurogenesis is influenced by both genetic and environmental determinants. Mice of the 129/SvJ strain have significantly less hippocampal neurogenesis than other inbred mouse strains [1] and do not perform well in learning tasks. Here, the impact of environmental stimuli on brain plasticity during adulthood of 129/SvJ mice was studied using 'enriched environments' where mice receive complex inanimate and social stimulation [2,3]. In contrast to our earlier reports on mice of the C57BL/6 strain - which are competent in learning tasks and in which environmental stimulation did not influence cell proliferation [4,5] - environmentally stimulated 129/SvJ mice were found to have twice as many proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus compared with mice in standard housing. Environmental stimulation fostered the survival of newborn cells in 129/SvJ mice; this effect had also been seen in C57BL/6 mice. Phenotypic analysis of the surviving cells revealed that environmental stimulation resulted in 67% more new neurons. In combination with our earlier results, these data indicate a differential impact of inheritable traits on the environmental regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In addition, we observed behavioral changes in environmentally stimulated 129/SvJ mice.",Current biology : CB,1998 Jul 30-Aug 13,England,1998,90
9702829,[Family status and social integration as predictors of mortality: a 5-year follow-up study of 55- to 74-year-old men and women in the Augsburg area].,"The relation between marital status, social integration and the mortality from all causes was examined in a population based cohort study. The 5-year-cohort consisted of 1,030 men and 957 women, aged 55-74 years who participated in the second MONICA Survey Augsburg, F.R.G., 1989/90 (MONICA = Monitoring of trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease). They were followed for mortality until 1995. Altogether 120 men and 45 women had died. Social integration was measured by an index of social ties. The index of social ties examined in these analyses includes (a) presence of a spouse, (b) number of close friends and relatives, (c) reported contact with close friends and relatives. Age standardized mortality rates (per 10,000 person years) were computed for men and women. Sex-specific Cox-proportional hazard models were used and hazard rate ratios (HRR) were calculated adjusting for age, hypertension, cigarette smoking, cholesterol, drinking alcohol, number of chronic diseases and self-reported health. Mortality rates were higher for men who were living alone (437.3) than for married men (235.3). Respectively in women the rates were 121.6 compared to 80.7. After controlling for age and self-reported health a HRR of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0-2.4) was observed for single, divorced or widowed men and a HRR of 1.6 (95% CI: 0.8-3.0) for women living alone. Low mortality rates were observed in people with many social ties (men: 180.1, women: 29.9). Mortality rates of people who gave no informations about social ties (men: 349.5, women: 124.9) were similar to those who had only few social ties (men: 321.1, women: 132.5). The findings showed that people with few social ties were more likely to die in the follow-up period than those with more extensive contacts. After adjusting for age and self-reported health the HRR for those with few ties compared to those with many social ties were 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.5) for men and 2.7 (95% CI: 1.1-6.6) for women. Similar results were found for people who gave no informations about their social ties (men: HRR = 1.4, 95% CI: 0.9-2.3; women: HRR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.0-6.9). Social relationships were shown to be important predictors of mortality in elderly women and men. These findings confirm the need for further research, which enables to take steps against high mortality of the social isolated elderly.",Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie und Geriatrie,1998 Jun,Germany,1998,90
9701538,The effectiveness of warning signs in hazardous work places: cognitive and social determinants.,"Recommendations have been made that good warning signs should have a number of components: an alerting word such as danger, then statements of the hazard, of its seriousness, of the probable consequences and of how to avoid the hazard. Responses from 40 blue-collar workers and 44 students were measured to five industrial warning signs to determine the extent to which these components determine estimated sign effectiveness and behavioural intentions of compliance. Each sign was presented in five versions; the original (which in each case omitted one or more of the components), a 'full' version in which missing components were generated and inserted, and versions omitting, in turn, the hazard, consequences, and instructions statements. Previous findings concerning the importance of the signal word were supported. When signs were seen singly there was no tendency for versions with components missing to be rated as poorer. Only when all versions were seen together was the 'full' version ranked as being better, a result which is taken as reflecting the demand characteristics of the method. The results argue against strict adherence to a formula requiring specified components in a sign. Data also supported the third person effect, indicating that respondents considered others to be more vulnerable to the hazard and less likely to comply with the sign than they themselves. The finding that social factors are of considerable importance in sign compliance is discussed.",Applied ergonomics,1998 Aug,England,1998,90
9698985,High-risk alcohol and drug use situations among seriously mentally ill inpatients: a preliminary investigation.,"Situational factors are important determinants of alcohol and drug use in general samples of substance abusers, with alcohol users and drug users reporting different trigger situations. This study represents an initial attempt to investigate high-risk alcohol and drug use situations in a sample of dually diagnosed individuals. Thirty men and women with both a serious mental illness and an alcohol use or drug use disorder were recruited from an inpatient psychiatric unit and completed questionnaires assessing high-risk alcohol and drug use situations psychiatric symptomatology, and psychological symptoms that trigger substance use. Although the alcohol and drug groups did not differ significantly in the frequency of self-reported high-risk situations for substance use, effect size analyses suggest that six of eight comparisons would demonstrate statistically significant differences with a larger sample size. Both groups reported using substances most frequently when feeling anxiety or depressive symptoms rather than psychotic symptoms. Although preliminary, these results have relevance for the treatment of dually diagnosed persons, particularly for behavioral treatment interventions such as coping skills training and stimulus control techniques.",Addictive behaviors,1998 Jul-Aug,England,1998,90
9698119,Relationship between socioeconomic status and ischaemic heart disease in cohort and case-control studies: 1960-1993.,"BACKGROUND: Much of the information on the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) comes from ecological, cross-sectional and longitudinal mortality studies. Such studies may present methodological problems which affect cohort studies and case-control studies to a lesser degree. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted into the relationship between SES and IHD, as reported by cohort and case-control studies in which SES had been measured by education or occupation. A bibliographic search, covering the period 1960-1993, was carried out using Index Medicus, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts, Social Scisearch and the references cited in papers identified in such databases. Finally, 34 studies were selected, with data being extracted separately by two reviewers working independently. Where differences of opinion arose, these were resolved by discussion between the two. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify determinants of inter-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Risk of IHD was inversely related to educational level in the period 1982-1993. There was a lower risk of IHD among manual workers versus non-manual workers until approximately 1970; thereafter the relationship became inverted. The odds ratio for IHD in manual workers rose progressively over the period 1960-1993, something that could not be explained by study design, study size, study country or control for confounding factors. Education- and occupation-related differences in risk of IHD affected all SES levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings agree with those yielded by ecological, cross-sectional and longitudinal mortality studies, although they cannot be extrapolated to women, non-white ethnic groups, or developing countries. The inversion of the relationship between SES and IHD, and the increase in socioeconomic differences in IHD in recent years suggest that the problem is potentially controllable and that the necessary policies should be implemented as a matter of urgency.",International journal of epidemiology,1998 Jun,England,1998,90
9698018,Secular trends in social patterning of cardiovascular risk factor levels in Sweden. The Northern Sweden MONICA Study 1986-1994. Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease.,"OBJECTIVES: In the Northern Sweden MONICA Study, levels of cardiovascular risk factors were determined in 1986, 1990 and 1994. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in cardiovascular risk factors, and to analyse the relationship between levels of risk factors and level of education. DESIGN: Cardiovascular risk factors were determined in cross-sectional population studies of randomly selected 25-64 year old men and women in 1986, 1990 and 1994 (a total of 4742 individuals). RESULTS: Throughout the years 1986 to 1994, cardiovascular risk factor levels showed a marked social pattern, generally being more favourable among people with a university education. Serum cholesterol levels declined in all educational groups, but blood pressure declined significantly only in women with a university education. Body mass index increased, most markedly in men with university and in women with a secondary school education. Prevalence of cigarette smoking decreased significantly in young men. It increased markedly in low-educated women so that the social gaps in smoking widened substantially over time. The improved level of education in the population at large was calculated to explain only a little of the risk factor changes between 1986 and 1994. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in risk factor levels in different educational groups have been more diverging for women than for men. The most marked change in risk factor levels has been the decline in total serum cholesterol for both men and women in all educational groups.",Journal of internal medicine,1998 Jul,England,1998,90
9697250,"Breast-feeding in Geneva: prevalence, duration and determinants.","A telephone survey was carried out with the objective of measuring the prevalence, duration and determinants of breast-feeding in the canton of Geneva, between August and December 1993. The participants were 278 out of 320 families with a telephone number in Geneva, from a random sample of families in which a child had been born in Geneva in the preceding 15 months. Prevalence of breast-feeding at 1 day of life was 93.3%, at 3 months 62.5%, at 4 months 51.1%, at 6 months 28.1%; median duration was 4.2 months. For complete (exclusive or predominant) breast-feeding, results were: 1 day 87.3%, 3 months 37.5%, 4 months 19.4%, 6 months 3.8%; median duration 2.4 months. Initial prevalence of breast-feeding was significantly higher in girls (97.2%) than in boys (89.4%, p < 0.01). Duration of breast-feeding was shorter in children of women who smoked (p < 0.001). Relative risks for no breast-feeding at 4 months were 1.53 (95% confidence limits 1.20-1.96) for less than 15 cigarettes per day during pregnancy, and 3.65 (2.19-6.09) for 15 cigarettes or more. Duration of breast-feeding was shorter if the mother worked as an employee. Prevalence and duration were higher if the mother was originally from Africa, Asia, Middle-East or Latin American countries. Although the initial prevalence of breast-feeding was relatively high, only half of children were breast-fed at 4 months. Promotive efforts are needed to increase the duration of breast-feeding, in particular by legislation on maternal protection.

9696119,"Lay theories of etiology and ""cure"" for four types of paraphilia: fetishism; pedophilia; sexual sadism; and voyeurism.","The current study set out to investigate the structure, determinants, and relationship between lay theories of the etiology and efficacy of ""cures"" for four types of paraphilia: fetishism, pedophilia, sexual sadism, and voyeurism. One hundred and five participants completed a four-part questionnaire, which was divided into (a) demographic details, (b) perceptions of the etiology, (c) ratings of cure for each paraphilia, and (d) the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Previous studies of lay theories have demonstrated a clear and interpretable factor structure similar to that of explicit academic theories, as well as a clear and logical relationship between perceived etiology and cure. A similar structure was expected to emerge in this study, together with positive correlations between the various factors and personality type. A factor analysis revealed a clear and logical factor structure for etiology and cure items. Further, etiology and cure factors correlated strongly with each other but only moderately with demographic details and personality differences. These findings are discussed in relation to growing literature in the field.",Journal of clinical psychology,1998 Aug,United States,1998,90

All the 1012 55-year-old citizens of Oulu (a medium-sized Finnish town) were invited to participate in this study. 780 of them did so. Information about frequency of toothbrushing, use of extra cleaning methods, use of sugar in coffee or tea, and time of the last dental visit, lifestyle, occupational status and gender was gathered from the 533 dentate subjects. Lifestyle was measured by means of questions about physical activity, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and dietary habits. Females and people with a healthy lifestyle brushed their teeth more often. Extra cleaning methods were used more often by people with a healthy lifestyle, whereas gender and occupational status had a weaker association. Males and people with a lower occupational status used sugar in coffee or tea more often. The time from the last dental visit was longer among workers and men; lifestyle had no significant association. At the population level oral cleaning habits are a matter of a health-oriented lifestyle and gender-related behavior.

In order to effectively engage in physical activity counseling, the determinants of physical activity must be understood and integrated into effective interventions for youths. This review of research literature includes a critique of intervention studies aimed at helping children and adolescents adopt active lifestyles that will be sustained throughout life. Social cognitive theory provided the theoretical basis for most of the studies reviewed but specification of how theory concepts were operationalized in the interventions was often unclear. Suggestions for increasing the rigor of theoretically based intervention studies aimed at promoting physical activity are proposed. Models and variables are identified that need further testing to determine their relevance to the promotion of physical activity during childhood and adolescence.",Annual review of nursing research,1998,United States,1998,90
9693925,Psychological profiles of patients with laryngeal contact granulomas.,"The association between laryngeal contact granuloma and demographic/psychological variables was examined by using a psychosomatic approach to health research. A stepwise procedure of logistic regression analyses was utilized to get a final multivariate model of variables associated with the clinical finding of a laryngeal contact granuloma. The subjects consisted of 47 patients with contact granulomas and 110 patients with voice disorders due to other causes. Our analysis of 22 variables uncovered the following statistically significant factors for developing a contact granuloma: male gender (P = 0.0001), low achievement orientation (P = 0.0007), fear of physical lesions (P = 0.0038), impulsiveness (P = 0.0016), age > 60 years (P = 0.0012), low extraversion (P = 0.004), high achievement orientation (P = 0.0079), fear of appearing in public (P = 0.0216) and strain (P = 0.03). These results show that a variety of variables are important for predicting the development of a laryngeal contact granuloma. The usefulness of this set of risk variables for predicting a contact granuloma remains to be proved in a prospective study. It is possible that not only the nature but the number of risk factors are the prime determinants of outcome.",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,1998,Germany,1998,90
10187592,Private health care provision in developing countries: a preliminary analysis of levels and composition.,"While the importance of the private sector in providing health services in developing countries is now widely acknowledged, the paucity of data on numbers and types of providers has prevented systematic cross-country comparisons. Using available published and unpublished sources, we have assembled data on the number of public and private health care providers for approximately 40 countries. This paper presents some results of the analysis of this database, looking particularly at the determinants of the size and structure of the private health sector. We consider two different types of dependent variable: the absolute number of private providers (measured here as physicians and hospital beds), and the public-private composition of provision. We examine the relationship between these variables and income and other socioeconomic characteristics, at the national level. We find that while income level is related to the absolute size of the private sector, the public-private mix does not seem to be related to income. After controlling for income, certain socioeconomic characteristics, such as education, population density, and health status are associated with the size of the private sector, though no causal relationship is posited. Further analysis will require more complete data about the size of the private sector, including the extent of dual practice by government-employed physicians. A richer story of the determinants of private sector growth would incorporate more information about the institutional structure of health systems, including provider payment mechanisms, the level and quality of public services, the regulatory structure, and labour and capital market characteristics. Finally, a normative analysis of the size and growth of the private sector will require a better understanding of its impact on key social welfare outcomes.",Health policy and planning,1998 Sep,England,1998,90
10186447,Towards a psycho-social theoretical framework for sexual health promotion.,"Numerous interventions have been designed to promote safer sexual behaviour amongst young people. However, relatively few have proved effective, which is, at least partially, due to the lack of development of theoretically based programmes. An understanding of the origins and control of sexual behaviour can be derived from basic social science research. Unless this is applied to the design of behaviour-change programmes they are unlikely to target the most important determinants of young people's sexual behaviour and are, therefore, unlikely to be effective. This paper outlines some of the key theoretical insights which have been drawn upon in the development of a new sex education programme currently being tested in Scottish schools. The theoretical basis is intentionally eclectic, combining social psychological cognitive models with sociological interpretations, since we are not concerned to advance any particular theory but to find which are most useful in promoting sexual health. First, the social influences on sexual behaviour are considered, and then the way in which these translate into individual perceptions and beliefs. Finally, the paper attempts to develop a theoretical understanding of sexual interaction and the social contexts of sexual behaviour.",Health education research,1998 Sep,England,1998,90
9690841,Well-being of haemophilia patients: a model for direct and indirect effects of medical parameters on the physical and psychosocial functioning.,"This study outlines the development and evaluation of a structural equation model for establishing the consequences of haemophilia. The hereditary disorder is characterized by a high tendency to haemorrhages, with recurrent bleeding into the joints causing irreversible joint damage. The model is, in general, an attempt to answer the following questions: what is the effect of haemophilia on the well-being (i.e. satisfaction, health, somatic complaints and self-esteem) of patients and what is the additional or mediating role of other individual characteristics in this pathway? Disease severity, joint impairment and disability are defined as antecedents of well-being and the mediating roles of appraisal (i.e. the personal evaluation of the disease), health beliefs (i.e. locus of control), psychological characteristics (i.e. anxiety, anger, depression and optimism) and social support are investigated. Psychological variables turned out to be the strongest determinants of well-being and partly mediated the detrimental effect of disability on well-being. The role of appraisal remained somewhat unclear, as no significant relationship was established between this personal evaluation of haemophilia and well-being. Nevertheless, appraisal very well reflected the level of disability. An internal locus of control and favourable psychological characteristics appeared to reduce the perceived seriousness of haemophilia. No evidence was found for social support to act as a mediator between disability and well-being. The perception of support did show moderately strong associations with psychological characteristics (i.e. anxiety and depression) and satisfaction ratings. The study merits further research on quantifying the relationships between clinical parameters and psychosocial outcomes in patients with a chronic disease.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Sep,England,1998,90
9690821,A conceptual model of independence and dependence for adults with chronic physical illness and disability.,"This paper presents a conceptual model of physical independence and dependence as it relates to adult onset, chronic physical illness and disability. Physical independence and dependence are presented as two separate, continuous, and multiply determined constructs, and illustrations are provided of situations where people can be independent, dependent, not independent, or experience imposed dependence. The paper also discusses potential determinants of physical independence and dependence, including different domains of disability, the role of subjective perceptions, demographics, the physical and social/political environments, personal resources, attitudes and coping resources, illness and efficacy appraisals, and the nature of the assistive relationship. The paper extends work on physical independence and dependence by synthesizing the findings from previous studies and incorporating the findings from other relevant areas of research into the area. It also expands on the concepts of physical independence and dependence, as well as their determinants, and relates independence and dependence to other outcomes of interest such as service delivery.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Sep,England,1998,90
9690365,"Seasonal rainfall variability, the incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, and prediction of the disease in low-lying areas of China.","To investigate determinants of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in low-lying areas of China, the authors studied Chuigang and Wanggang communities in Anhui Province. These adjacent farming communities have a population of about 100,000. Data were collected from the two communities in 1961-1977 and from Yingshang County in 1983-1995; information covered the incidence of HFRS, amount of precipitation, differences in the water level of the Huai River, density of Apodemus agrarius, autumn crop production, and areas of inundated farmland. Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were used to estimate the relation between seasonal rainfall, density of mice, occupational factors, and occurrence of the disease. Associations were observed between the incidence of HFRS and the amount of precipitation, the water level of the Huai River, and the areas of inundated farmland in Chuigang community. The smaller the water-level difference, the less farmland was inundated and the higher the incidence of HFRS. In Wanggang community, the density of A. agrarius (r1=0.63, p=0.02), the water-level difference in the Huai River (r2=-0.81, p=0.007), and crop production (r3=0.96, p=0.005) were correlated with the incidence of HFRS. The regression analyses based on Wanggang community suggested that these indexes could be used as predictive variables, and the results from the model were well calibrated with the actual incidence of HFRS in that community (R2=0.88, p < 0.01) and Yingshang County (R2=0.91, p < 0.01).",American journal of epidemiology,1998 Aug 1,United States,1998,90
9690286,[Risk behaviors of intravenous drug users: are females taking more risks of HIV and HCV transmission?].,"BACKGROUND: This work was aimed at identifying differences in HIV and HCV risk behaviors among intravenous drug users (IDUs) according to the gender and their determinants. METHODS: IDUs over 18 years, having had sexual intercourse and able to answer the questionnaire were interviewed in 10 drug abuse treatment centers or social institutions using a questionnaire adapted from the one used in the survey of sexual lifestyle in France. RESULTS: Over 612 eligible IDUs, 595 completed the questionnaire (women: 29%);37% had multiple partners with no difference according to the gender; 14% of the women and 7% of the men reported trading sex. More women reported inconsistent condom use (46% vs. 55%) and inconsistent clean equipment use (65% vs. 73%). A younger age, independently associated to sharing equipment (men: OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.90-0.99; women: OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.85-0.99) and inconsistent HIV serology testing, independently associated to inconsistent condom use (men: OR = 3.36; 95% CI = 2.02-5.60; women: OR = 10.72; 95% CI = 3.18-36.18), were the only risk markers common to both genders. For women, being HIV negative increased the risk of inconsistent condom use. Low educational level increased the risk of inconsistent clean equipment use. No risk marker among those analyzed was associated to having had multiple partners. For men, low socioeconomic status markers, a steady sexual partner or not living in couple and educational level were associated with sexual risk behaviors (inconsistent condom use and having multiple partners); low socioeconomic status markers were associated with injecting risk behaviors (inconsistent clean equipment use and sharing). CONCLUSIONS: Women were more likely to have both sexual and injecting risk behaviors; their significant risk markers are less numerous thus harm reduction could be more difficult than for men.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1998 Jun,France,1998,90
9684427,"A comparison of risk factors for malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma in the UK.","Cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) exhibit markedly different natural histories, but few studies have compared risk factors in individuals from a single population. Using logistic regression analysis in case and control groups, we assessed, the association of individual characteristics with MM (n = 240) and SCC (n = 184). We also compared differences in risk factors (eye/hair colour, skin type, smoking history, occupation, social class, tumour site) between MM/BCC and SCC/BCC. MM patients were more likely to have red/blonde hair and blue/green eyes than controls, and those with SCC more likely to have red/blonde hair, blue/green eyes, outdoor occupation, skin type 1 and to have smoked more. There were few differences in individual characteristics between the skin cancer groups, illustrating their non-specific nature. Tumour site, however, showed marked differences: MM patients were more likely to have a tumour on the trunk or limbs than BCC patients, while patients with SCC were more likely to have a tumour on the limbs. Reasons for this variation are unclear. The relatively weak effect of individual factors supports the view of a multifactorial disease and suggests that interactions between UV exposure and genetic predisposition may be more significant determinants of risk.",International journal of clinical practice,1998 Apr-May,England,1998,90
9683377,Socioeconomic and environmental covariates of premature mortality in Ontario.,"This paper contributes to debates on the broad determinants of health and on the policy shift from curative to preventive and protective interventions. It addresses empirically the relative importance of influences on health with a multiple regression analysis of ecologic data from the 49 counties of Ontario. One model achieved high predictive power (that is, Adj R2 > 75%, p < 0.0001). Educational levels were a strong predictor of population health, showing a consistent inverse relationship with premature mortality ratios for both sexes and it was the strongest predictor for females. A low income variable supplied the strongest prediction for male mortality. This variable displayed a positive association with male mortality. Municipal expenditures on environmental protection exerted a negative effect on male mortality. These findings raise questions about the current directions of health policy in Ontario where the provincial government has reduced funding to social and environmental programs, while promising to maintain health care funding.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Jul,England,1998,90
9674763,Dementia caregiver burden: a review of the literature and guidelines for assessment and intervention.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are common degenerative disorders in the elderly. Most AD patients are cared for at home by family members, usually elderly spouses. Although caregiving is associated with significant psychological and physical morbidity, there are wide individual differences among caregivers in how well they adapt to caregiving demands. In addition, recent data suggest that caregiver variables can be important determinants of AD patient institutionalization and that AD patients living with highly distressed caregivers may exhibit higher frequencies of behavioral problems and agitation than those living with less distressed caregivers. Predictors of caregiver outcome, predictors of institutionalization, and the effect of the caregiver on the course and symptomatology of dementia are described. A model of assessment and intervention for the physician, referral processes, and resources for the caregiver are presented.",Neurology,1998 Jul,United States,1998,90
9672392,"Gender, socioeconomic status and family status as determinants of food behaviour.","This study examines social structural and family status factors as determinants of food behaviour. The data were derived from the FINMONICA Risk Factor Survey, collected in Finland in spring 1992. A multidimensional framework of the determinants of food behaviour was used, including social structural position, family status and gender. The associations between the determinants of food behaviour were estimated by multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age and regional differences. Food behaviour was measured by an index including six food items which were chosen based on Finnish dietary guidelines. In general, women's food behaviour was more in accordance with the dietary guidelines than that of men. The pattern of association between educational level and food behaviour was similar for both genders, but slightly stronger for men than women. Employment status was associated only with women's food behaviour, but the tendency was the same for men. Marital status was associated with men's as well as women's food behaviour. The food behaviour of married men and women was more in line with the dietary guidelines than the food behaviour of those who had been previously married. Parental status, however, was only associated with women's food behaviour, that is, the food behaviour of women with young children was more closely in line with the dietary guidelines than that of the rest of the women.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Jun,England,1998,90
9670496,"Homicide followed by suicide: Paris and its suburbs, 1991-1996.","Homicide-suicides (HS) are relatively infrequent events. Yet, they are of great concern because they often result in the death of family members, young children, and cause additional morbidity, family disruption and childhood psychological trauma. The aims of our study were (a) to examine the sociodemographic, clinical, and autopsy characteristics of HS in Paris and its suburbs from 1991 through 1996, and (b) to analyze the psychodynamic determinants leading up to the onset of HS. Our findings are compared with those obtained in other international studies. For the purpose of the present study. HS was defined as a violent event in which an individual committed homicide and subsequently committed suicide within a few hours. The main results are as follows. During the six-year study period, 56 HS involving 133 victims were investigated at the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Paris. Seventeen events occurred in Paris and 39 in its suburbs. Paris has a population of approximately 2,200,000 while its suburbs are home to another 8,5000,000. Of the 56 offenders, 48 (85%) were males. The mean age of offenders was 51 years in males (range, 24 to 83) and 40.5 years in females (range, 33 to 56). In 45 events (80%), the offenders used a gun for both the homicide and suicide. A knife was used in only 4 murders, strangulation in 4 other cases, with poisoning, arson, or beating occurring in one case each. In 9 cases, the offender used a different weapon for homicide and suicide. Among firearms, handguns were more likely to be used (26 cases) than shotguns (6 cases) or rifles (13 cases). In 40 cases the offender killed one victim, in 11 cases 2 victims, and in 5 cases 3 victims. The homicide victims consisted of 34 children (21 boys), mean age 8 years (range, 1 to 16), 29 spouses (26 females), 2 girlfriends, 10 strangers, and 2 relatives. Five pets were killed. HS were most likely to be committed in the home. A suicide note was found near the victims in 29 cases (50% of events). In 42 cases the offender was found to be severely depressed. Familial HS were the most frequent events followed by suicidal pacts. When male sexual proprietariness and amorous jealousy were involved, the HS perpetrators acted often impulsively in carrying out the HS. There had been a chronically chaotic relationship and frequent physical violence and verbal threats. The triggering event was often the female withdrawal or estrangement. Only in a few cases, other motivations such as occupational or money problems were involved. Chronic alcoholism was found in 16 cases. In conclusion, the offender was more likely to be a male, severely depressed, violent and jealous who killed his spouse, and often his children, with impulsiveness, but after numerous threats. Our findings suggest that HS differ from both homicide and suicide and thus occupy a distinct epidemiological domain requiring specific prevention programs.",Journal of forensic sciences,1998 Jul,United States,1998,90
9665580,Home birth or short-stay hospital birth in a low risk population in The Netherlands.,"In The Netherlands women with low risk pregnancies can choose whether they want to give birth at home or in hospital, under the care of their own primary caregiver. The majority of these women prefer to give birth at home, but over the last few decades an increasing number of low risk women have chosen a hospital birth, leaving hospital with their baby shortly after delivery. As both this trend and its effects have not been extensively investigated, a study was designed to examine the determinants of the choice for home or hospital birth. It was hypothesized that the choice would be determined by a combination of personal and social factors. Structural equation modelling indicated that social factors, especially the confidence of significant others in home birth and the expectations of hospital care during childbirth, were by far the strongest predictors of choice. Personal factors, measured as perceived health status before and during pregnancy, the existence of minor symptoms and fear of pain or complications during birth, were found to play an indirect role. Demographic variables such as age, education and urbanization showed no effect. These findings indicate that emphasizing the good results and excellent quality of Dutch maternity care at home is likely to support and strengthen the general acceptance of home birth.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Jun,England,1998,90
9665571,"Gender, work roles and psychosocial work characteristics as determinants of health.","This paper aims to identify gender similarities and differences in psychosocial work characteristics for those in and out of paid employment, to inform research on possible health-related effects. Specifically five questions are addressed: do women report poorer work characteristics than men; are gender differences related to specific characteristics; do work characteristics differ between full- and part-time women workers and between those in paid and unpaid work; are socio-economic gradients in work characteristics similar for men and women; and, if there are gradients, do they differ between women in paid and unpaid work? Analyses are based on the 33 year follow-up of the 1958 British birth cohort. Four psychosocial work characteristics were examined: learning opportunities, monotony, pace of work, and flexibility of breaks. Women reported more negative work characteristics than men, primarily because of differences in learning opportunities (26% lacked opportunity compared with 13% of men) and monotonous work (47 and 31% respectively). Women in full-time employment reported fewer negative characteristics (27%) than part-time (39%) or home-workers (36%). Home-workers had fewer opportunities for learning (36%) and greater monotony (49%) than paid workers (21 and 22% respectively), however fewer home-workers reported inability to control the work pace (11% compared to 23%) and inflexibility of breaks (21% compared to 47%). Socio-economic gradients in work characteristics were similar among men and women, except for flexibility of break times. A socio-economic gradient in work characteristics was found for full- and part-time workers, but not among home-workers. Differences in self reported health were also examined: a social gradient was found for all employment status groups, being strongest for home-workers despite the absence of a gradient in negative work characteristics. In conclusion, these marked gender differences in psychosocial work characteristics need to be considered in future research on work and health.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Jun,England,1998,90
9664629,Sexual activity and contraceptive use: the components of the decisionmaking process.,"In light of the social consequences of early childbearing, unplanned pregnancy, and the transmission of AIDS, a great need exists to understand how adolescents make sexual and reproductive decisions. Drawing primarily on literature from sub-Saharan Africa, this article focuses on three behavioral outcomes: nonmarital sexual activity, contraceptive use, and condom use. It explores adolescent's perceptions of the costs and benefits of engaging in these behaviors, their assessment of their susceptibility to the potential consequences of their actions, and the role of family, peer, and dyadic factors in shaping their reproductive decisions. The literature reveals that cultural values regarding sexuality and gender roles, the power dimensions of adolescents' lives, and economic disadvantage exert powerful influences on the decisionmaking process. Decisions to engage in unprotected sex may also be based on insufficient knowledge and distorted judgements of the risks of becoming pregnant and acquiring sexually transmitted infections. Nondecisionmaking is found to be fairly common in some contexts.",Studies in family planning,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90
9663916,Distribution and determinants of cardiovascular events during 20 years of successful antihypertensive treatment.,"OBJECTIVE: To define the distribution and determinants of cardiovascular disease events among participants undergoing long-term antihypertensive therapy, and to stratify them into risk groups on the basis of pretreatment clinical profiles. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of participants in a worksite-based antihypertensive treatment program in New York city (1973-1994). PATIENTS: We studied 8690 systematically treated patients who had at least 6 months of follow-up (average of 5.7 years) and, at entry, had had a systolic blood pressure of > or = 160 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of > or = 95 mmHg (after 1992 > or = 140/90 mmHg), or had been being administered antihypertensive medication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure and incidence of morbid and mortal cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Blood pressure control (to 140 +/- 3/87 +/- 7 mmHg) was achieved by the first year and maintained through 18 years of therapy. In nearly 50,000 person-years of follow-up, there were 468 cardiovascular disease events [myocardial infarction including revascularization (282), strokes (93), congestive heart failure (30) and other cardiovascular deaths (63)]. Deaths from cardiovascular disease events accounted for 68% of all deaths. Myocardial infarction was most common throughout, but congestive heart failure incidence surpassed stroke incidence after 10 years. A scheme for risk stratification was constructed after analysis of the independent association of baseline factors and incident cardiovascular events. Upon the basis of ease of ascertainment and their demonstrated associations with occurrence of cardiovascular disease during treatment, we selected five pretreatment factors (history of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, age > or = 55 years and pulse pressure > or = 60 mmHg) to stratify patients into four groups. Those with no risk factor had a low risk (n=2999), those with one had a moderate risk (3042), those with two had a high risk (2237), and those with three or more had a very high risk (412). Overall, the unadjusted rates of incidence of cardiovascular disease events per 1000 person-years for patients in very high and low risk groups differed by factors of six and 14 for men and women, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that long-term control of blood pressure can be achieved in a general population. Nevertheless, cardiovascular disease events still accounted for most morbidity and mortality among these 'recovered' hypertensive patients. At entry, on the basis of readily identifiable characteristics, it was possible to stratify patients according to likelihood of subsequent events occurring despite control of blood pressure. This scheme could provide the basis for targeting more aggressive therapy where the potential for further cardioprotection is greatest.",Journal of hypertension,1998 Jun,England,1998,90
9656267,Competing personal goals and exercise behaviour.,"Research on the determinants of exercise behaviour has not assessed the role of personal goals which may be in conflict with exercising. A cross-sectional study showed that 312 nonexercisers, 466 people who exercised once or twice a week, and 202 people who exercised at the norm of at least three times a week differed significantly with respect to the number of important personal goals expected to be hampered by exercising at the norm. To be specific, the number of competing activities in the home was higher for the sedentary group than for those who exercised. Further, those who exercised at the norm reported fewer competing social activities than all other subjects and fewer competing self-developmental activities than the non-exercisers. Scores on the scale for activities outside the home did not differ significantly among the three groups. It is argued that any theoretical model of exercise behaviour should take into account the influence of competing personal goals on the initiation and continuation of exercise during leisure time.",Perceptual and motor skills,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90
9654981,[Course and prognosis of anorexia nervosa: catamnesis of 41 patients].,"The purpose of the following study was a multidimensional assessment of the course of anorexia nervosa. In our follow-up-study we were able to examine 41 out of 51 patients meeting DMS-111 R criteria for anorexia nervosa in our department at a mean follow-up of 5.3 years. At the first evaluation the patients were characterized by an early age of onset (mean 14.2 years), no or very little previous psychiatric treatment, and restrictive eating habits (72.5%); the mean age was 15.2 years. At the time of follow-up, the physical outcome was unfavourable for 50% of the patients; one patient had died. The psychosocial outcome was less favourable for 60%. Against the background of a neurotic structure, social and sexual disturbances were found although the patient's weight was often normal. Depressive symptoms and a ""slimness ideal"" were found among a large number of patients, just as much as the fear of gaining weight--which prove to be a reliable indicator for the continuation of an eating disorder. A multidimensional evaluation facilitates an assessment of the determinants of prognosis. Previous psychiatric treatment and low body weight were associated with an unfavourable, mention of problems/disturbances in the family environment with a good somatic outcome. Outpatient treatment indicates a favourable psychosocial outcome.",Praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie,1998 May-Jun,Germany,1998,90
9653610,"Factors associated with glycemic control. A cross-sectional nationwide study in 2,579 French children with type 1 diabetes. The French Pediatric Diabetes Group.","OBJECTIVE: To determine on a large scale the multiple medical and nonmedical factors that influence glycemic control in the general population of children with diabetes, we performed a nationwide French cross-sectional study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 2,579 patients aged 1-19 years with type 1 diabetes of > 1 year's duration. The study was center based: 270 centers were identified, 206 agreed to participate, and 147 included at least 90% of their patients. Questionnaires were completed by physicians interviewing patients and family, and HbA1c measurements were centralized. To identify explanatory variables for HbA1c level and frequency of severe hypoglycemia, we performed multiple regression analysis using all the quantitative variables collected and stepwise logistic regression for the qualitative variables. RESULTS: Mean HbA1c value for the whole population was 8.97 +/- 1.98% (normal 4.7 +/- 0.7% [SD]). Only 19 children (0.7%) had ketoacidosis during the 6 months before the study, whereas 593 severe hypoglycemia events occurred in 338 children (13.8%). Control was better in university-affiliated hospitals and centers following > 50 patients, reflecting the importance of access to experienced diabetologists. Children had a mean of 2.3 injections, allegedly performed 2.8 glucose measurements per day, and were seen an average of 4.6 times per year at the center. In the multiple regression analysis, 94% of the variance of HbA1c was explained by our pool of selected variables, with the highest regression coefficient between HbA1c and age (Rc = 0.43, P < 0.0001), then with daily insulin dosage per kilogram (Rc = 0.28, P < 0.0001), mother's age (Rc = 0.26, P < 0.0001), frequency of glucose measurements (Rc = 0.21, P < 0.0001), and diabetes duration (Rc = 0.14, P < 0.0001). Logistic regression identified quality of family support and dietary compliance, two related qualitative and possibly subjective variables, as additional explanatory determinants of HbA1c. The frequency of severe hypoglycemia was 45 per 100 patient-years and correlated with diabetes duration, but not with HbA1c levels or other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall results remain unsatisfactory, 33% of studied French children with type 1 diabetes had HbA1c < 8%, the value obtained in Diabetes Control and Complications Trial adolescents treated intensively. Diabetes management in specialized centers should be encouraged.",Diabetes care,1998 Jul,United States,1998,90
10186460,Quality of life following a change in therapy for diabetes mellitus.,"OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to evaluate and compare quality-of-life (QOL) parameters between patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus who changed therapy from an oral hypoglycaemic agent (OHA) to insulin and those who remained on an OHA. DESIGN: The World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL) was used to assess quality of life among 2 groups of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline and after a 2-month follow-up period. SETTING: The study was conducted in the outpatient department of the Vuk Vrhovac Clinic, a referral centre for registration, treatment and follow-up of patients with diabetes mellitus in Zagreb, Croatia. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: 32 consecutively recruited patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were switched from an OHA to insulin therapy (group 1) were compared with 28 patients who remained on OHA (group 2) with respect to QOL issues. The patient groups were comparable in terms of gender, age, duration of disease, education and family status. However, patients in group 1 had glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values greater than 9.5% on average during a period of approximately 6 months, which was the criterion used for switching to insulin therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: At baseline, various QOL ratings were higher among patients in group 2 than group 1, indicating better quality of life with respect to overall quality of life (t = -2.31, p = 0.03), physical health (t = -2.36, p = 0.02), psychological state (t = -2.01, p = 0.05) and level of independence (t = -2.75, p = 0.001), while no differences were found between groups with respect to the social domain, personal beliefs and environmental QOL aspects. After the follow-up period, the groups were comparable in all QOL aspects other than overall quality of life (t = -2.18, p = 0.03) and level of independence (t = -3.49, p = 0.001), both of which remained higher for patients in group 2. No changes in QOL parameters were detected within group 2 from baseline to the end of the 2-month follow-up period, whereas patients in group 1 showed significant improvement in psychological QOL determinants (t = -2.14, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Results of the study indicate that introducing insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and sustained elevated HbA1c levels might positively affect their quality of life.",PharmacoEconomics,1998 Aug,New Zealand,1998,90
10186225,Diffusion of laparoscopic technologies in Denmark.,"It has been predicted that minimally invasive therapy will have dramatic consequences for the specialty of general surgery, as demonstrated by the diffusion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To investigate the determinants of the diffusion in Denmark of five laparoscopic technologies (cholecystectomy, appendicectomy, surgery for colon cancer, surgery for inguinal hernia and fundoplication), questionnaires on seventeen factors' influence on the adoption (stimulating or impeding) were sent to fifty-nine hospitals. Fifty hospitals (85%) responded. Overall, 98% adopted laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Denmark between 1991 and 1995, whereas the remainder of the technologies were adopted by 7-65% of hospitals performing these operations. Large and specialized hospitals were the earliest adopters. The factors, nature of technology (minimally invasive versus conventional), training (appropriate training courses), competition (between specialties and between hospitals) and media attention have stimulated the diffusion, whereas three budget factors (budget for investment, budget for operation and public regulation) usually had an impeding effect. Stimulating factors prevail for all laparoscopic technologies indicating that some guidance of the adoption and use of new health technologies might be necessary. In Denmark, one of the suggested health policies to secure timely guidance is the establishment of an early warning system.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",1998 Aug,Ireland,1998,90
9649962,Predictors of cessation of marijuana use: an event history analysis.,"Event history analysis was applied to monthly life and drug histories of a representative community sample of 706 marijuana users, followed from ages 15-16 to 34-35, to investigate factors associated with cessation of marijuana use from adolescence to adulthood. In addition to age and gender, the most important determinants of cessation are the phenomenology of marijuana use, social role participation, depressive symptoms and deviance. Frequent users, those who started using early and those who use illicit drugs other than marijuana are more likely to continue their marijuana use. Using marijuana for social reasons accelerates cessation, using to change one's mood reduces cessation. Becoming pregnant and a parent is the most important social role leading to marijuana cessation for women. There is also a very important experimental effect of the interview itself on the reported timing of a cessation. The effect of a social context favorable to marijuana use appears to reflect selection rather than social influence.",Drug and alcohol dependence,1998 Apr 1,Ireland,1998,90

Thirty-six children interviewed with McMartin techniques made 58% accusations, compared with 17% for 30 children interviewed with suggestive questions. Social influence and reinforcement appeared to be more powerful determinants of children's answers than simple suggestive questions. The SIRR model is proposed to explain how false statements may be elicited from children or adults. Categories identified in the SIRR model are suggestive questions, social influence, reinforcement, and removal from direct experience.",The Journal of applied psychology,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90
9648039,Psychosocial determinants of alcohol use among minority youth living in public housing developments.,"Youth residing in low income, inner city, public housing developments might be extremely vulnerable to psychosocial risk factors associated with alcohol use. In this study, we developed and tested a model of alcohol etiology with 624 African-American and Hispanic 7th graders residing in public housing developments. The students completed questionnaires concerning their alcohol use, social influences on their drinking, their drinking attitudes and knowledge, their psychosocial skills, and demographic and behavioral control information. Logistic regression analyses indicated that social influences from adults, friends, and family members predicted alcohol use. Individual psychosocial characteristics, e.g., drinking refusal, lowered the odds of drinking. These findings imply that effective prevention approaches targeting minority urban youths residing in public housing developments should provide them with an awareness of social influences to drink, correct misperceptions concerning the prevalence of drinking, and train them in relevant psychosocial skills.",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90

As compared to the poor prognosis group, the good prognosis group had lower social dysfunctions, lower ratings on psychopathotogy fewer indicators of neurodysfunction in form of neurological soft signs (NSS) and tardive dyskinesia (TD). The poor prognosis group was characterized by: (i) older age at onset; (ii) more manic than depressive episodes (5:1) and (HI) lower levels of serum dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity (DBH). The association between poor prognosis bipolar disorder having neuroleptic intolerance (TD and NSS) with low serum DBH, suggests that it is genetically governed.

A survey of 663 children, 4-10 yr old, living in southeastern Madagascar revealed prevalences of 93% for A. lumbricoides, 55% for Trichuris trichiura, and 27% for hookworm. Worm expulsions were conducted on 428 of these children; the data revealed an overdispersed distribution of A. lumbricoides, with an arithmetic mean of 19.2 worms per child. A concurrent socioeconomic household survey was conducted by visitation and interview. Exposure to infection was assessed by environmental, demographic, behavioral, and socioeconomic indicators. Ascaris lumbricoides aggregations were associated with gender, housing style, ethnicity, and agricultural factors. The results suggest that exposure and infection are ubiquitous in this child population, and that A. lumbricoides intensity is influenced by gender-related behavioral and environmental factors that contribute to exposure.",The Journal of parasitology,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90
9642904,Sources and determinants of social support for caregivers of persons with AIDS.,"This study examines the determinants of social support among a sample of 642 caregivers of persons with AIDS living in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Respondents include both traditional family caregivers (mothers, spouses, other relatives) and non-traditional caregivers (friends, homosexual partners). Multiple regression analyses are conducted to assess the independent effects of six sets of variables on emotional and instrumental support: social-structural factors (age, education, employment status), caregiver's relationship to the person with AIDS, situational variables (caregiver's HIV status, patient's functional disability, interpersonal conflict), social network factors (contact with family, contact with friends, community integration), personal resources (mastery, caregiving competence), and use of formal community services (patient-directed services, caregiver-directed services). A number of factors and conditions appear to be relevant for caregiver support. For example, results indicate that network factors, including frequency of contact, conflict, and community integration, are importantly related to caregivers' perceptions of emotional support. There is also a trend suggesting lower emotional support among traditional family caregivers, relative to nonfamily caregivers, within gender categories. With respect to instrumental assistance with caregiving, factors that place greater demands and time constraints on caregivers, such as being employed and caring for an AIDS patient with greater functional limitations, appear to increase the level of informal instrumental support the caregiver receives.

9642740,[Strategies to control cataracts].,"Cataracts, often associated with aging (80%), are a major cause of blindness (more than 50% of cases of blindness in Africa), and for this reason, up to 80% of cases could be predicted or prevented. The socio-economic costs (care and loss of productivity) are increased by morbidity (blindness, impaired vision, congenital, complicated or infected cataracts). The biological determinants of cataracts account for the difficulties in developing and implementing effective preventive action. These epidemiological determinants (prevalence, incidence, increase in life expectancy) account for the size of the public health problem. The surgical removal of cataracts in Africa currently only deals with about 1% of the prevalence rate or 10% of the incidence. Cataracts are, however, easy to cure, resulting in great benefits to public health. The waiting list for cataract operations is very short because of social and cultural barriers which limit the acceptability and accessibility of treatment. Rather than formalizing the dogmatic choices of surgical techniques and structures (fixed, mobile, advanced?), we should promote all phases of treatment from active screening and the selection of cases for surgery to the follow-up of interventions and their impact. We should also increase public awareness, develop a system for the transfer of information that is effective and improve the cost-effectiveness and capacity of the region to provide high quality services on a large scale. We must promote patient satisfaction at all stages of treatment: its quality, its delivery and its low cost.","Sante (Montrouge, France)",1998 Mar-Apr,France,1998,90
9639205,"Condom use among Aboriginal people in Ontario, Canada.","A survey of 658 Aboriginal men and women living in 11 reserve communities in Ontario, Canada, was utilized to collect data on patterns of condom use. Individuals who had sexual intercourse in the previous 12 months were included in the analysis (n=400). Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression were used to analyse condom use in the previous 12 months. Eight per cent always, 31% sometimes, and 61% never used condoms. Rates of condom use differed with the number of sex partners in the last year, age, gender, having a steady sex partner, and marital status. Multiple logistic regression revealed that people most likely to use condoms were under the age of 30, male, did not have a long-term steady sex partner, had more than one sex partner, worried about pregnancy, were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS, and were not embarrassed to obtain condoms. Condom users who were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS and who knew someone with HIV/AIDS were more likely to always use condoms. The most common reason for not using a condom was 'I was with my steady sex partner'. These results have implications for STD prevention efforts and for future research of sexual and STD preventive behaviour among Aboriginal people.",International journal of STD & AIDS,1998 May,England,1998,90
9635219,Social context in developmental psychopathology: recommendations for future research from the MacArthur Network on Psychopathology and Development. The MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Psychopathology and Development.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that social contexts in early life have important and complex effects on childhood psychopathology. Spurred by the lack of an explicit operational definition that could guide the study of such effects, we define a social context operationally as ""a set of interpersonal conditions, relevant to a particular behavior or disorder and external to, but shaped and interpreted by, the individual child."" Building on this definition, we offer a series of recommendations for future research, based on five theoretically derived propositions: (a) Contexts are nested and multidimensional; (b) contexts broaden, differentiate, and deepen with age, becoming more specific in their effects; (c) contexts and children are mutually determining; (d) a context's meaning to the child determines its effects on the child and arises from the context's ability to provide for fundamental needs; and (e) contexts should be selected for assessment in light of specific questions or outcomes. As reflected in an increasingly rich legacy of literature on child development and psychopathology, social contexts appear to influence emerging mental disorders through dynamic, bidirectional interactions with individual children. Future research will benefit from examining not only statistical interactions between child- and context-specific factors, but also the actual transactions between children and contexts and the transduction of contextual influences into pathways of biological mediation. Because adverse contexts exert powerful effects on the mental health of children, it is important for the field to generate new, more theoretically grounded research addressing the contextual determinants of psychological well-being and disorder.",Development and psychopathology,1998 Spring,United States,1998,90
9634135,Determinants of harsh parenting in Mexico.,"This paper presents a structural model of the determinants of harsh parenting among Mexican mothers. One hundred five mothers (46 from the community; 59 referred to agencies for child maltreatment) were recruited from Sonora (Northern) Mexico and interviewed. In this model the use of physical punishment was explained by (1) authoritarian parenting style (mothers' beliefs concerning the effective use of physical punishment and mothers' lack of disciplinary skills) and (2) family dysfunction (a latent variable constructed from reports of interspousal violence and the parents' use of alcohol and drugs). In addition, the indirect effects of demographic and historical variables on harsh parenting was included. The findings show that the most important factor influencing the use of physical punishment in these families was authoritarian parenting style, exerting a significant direct effect on the mothers' reports of their use of harsh punishment. Family dysfunction had an indirect effect through parenting style. Some sociodemographic variables also indirectly influenced the use of beliefs maternal punishment It is concluded that cultural beliefs play a major role in parenting within the framework of Mexican family relations.",Journal of abnormal child psychology,1998 Apr,United States,1998,90

9629105,"Mercury levels in the Cree population of James Bay, Quebec, from 1988 to 1993/94.","BACKGROUND: High levels of mercury in the Cree population of James Bay, Que., have been a cause of concern for several years. This study examines changes in mercury levels within the Cree population between 1988 and 1993/94 and identifies potential determinants of high mercury levels. METHODS: Data on mercury levels among the Cree were obtained through a surveillance program undertaken by the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay. In 1988 and again in 1993/94 surveys were carried out in all 9 Cree communities of northern Quebec. Hair samples were obtained and analysed for mercury content. Analyses were carried out to determine the proportion of people who had mercury levels in excess of established norms. Changes in mercury levels between 1988 and 1993/94 and determinants of high levels were estimated by means of regression methods. RESULTS: The proportion of the Cree population with mercury levels in excess of 15.0 mg/kg declined from 14.2% in 1988 to 2.7% in 1993/94. Wide variations in mercury levels were observed between communities: 0.6% and 8.3% of the Eastmain and Whapmagoostui communities respectively had mercury levels of 15.0 mg/kg or greater in 1993/94. Logistic regression analyses showed that significantly higher levels of mercury were independently associated with male sex, increasing age and trapper status. There was a correlation between the mercury level of the head of the household and that of the spouse. INTERPRETATION: Mercury levels in the Cree of James Bay have decreased in the recent past. Nevertheless, this decrease in mercury levels may not be permanent and does not necessarily imply that the issue is definitively resolved.",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,1998 Jun 2,Canada,1998,90
9624723,Alcohol consumption and mortality. III. Studies of female populations.,"AIMS: This is the third of a set of three papers evaluating drinking status and mortality risk. Analysis of three general population surveys of women evaluated all-cause mortality rates by drinking pattern. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Raw data from three studies of adult women were evaluated. Logistic regression models controlled for confounding characteristics. Meta-analysis combined study results. MEASUREMENTS: Drinking pattern was alternatively defined by quantity, frequency and volume of drinking. Final models included drinking pattern (including long-term abstainers and former drinkers) as well as age and other confounding variables. Models also evaluated interactions of age and, respectively, long-term abstinence and former drinking. FINDINGS: In models in which age was controlled, odds of death for long-term abstainers and former drinkers (defined by volume or quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers; odds of death for moderate and heavy drinkers (defined by quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers. When other psychosocial attributes were controlled, odds of death were similar for abstainers and light drinkers. When other psychosocial attributes were controlled, odds of death for heavy drinkers (defined by volume and quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers. When interactions of age and the two forms of abstinence were introduced, one study showed a significant effect of age and former drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Results were consistent with the hypothesis that characteristics of abstainers other than their non-use of alcohol may account for their higher mortality risk. With the exception of former drinkers compared to light drinkers, when interactions were introduced into models (for measures of quantity and frequency) findings were homogeneous across studies, lending generalizability to results.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1998 Feb,England,1998,90
9624722,Alcohol consumption and mortality. II. Studies of male populations.,"AIMS: This is the second of a set of three papers evaluating drinking status and mortality risk. Analysis of eight general population surveys of men evaluated all-cause mortality rates by drinking pattern. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Raw data from three studies of youth and five studies of adults were evaluated. Logistic regression models controlled for confounding characteristics. Meta-analysis combined study results. MEASUREMENTS: Drinking pattern was alternatively defined by quantity, frequency and volume of drinking. Final models included drinking pattern (as well as abstinence in the youth models and long-term abstainers and former drinkers in adult models), age and other confounding variables. Models also evaluated interactions of age and, respectively, long-term abstinence and former drinking. FINDINGS: No evidence was found for the hypothesis that abstinence is associated with greater mortality risk than light drinking. In the youth samples, abstainers had a lower risk of dying than those drinking less than 15 times per month. One study of the adult samples showed a significant age by former drinker interaction; this did not alter the lack of association of former drinking with mortality risk or the homogeneity of results across studies for this finding. The most consistent finding was the association of heavy drinking with mortality among youth. Among adults, drinking 43 or more drinks per month and drinking 21 or more times per month were associated with increased mortality risk. Quantity per occasion was not significantly associated with mortality risk among adults. CONCLUSIONS: That frequent drinking was related to mortality risk, whereas heavier quantity was unrelated, is inconsistent with the belief that daily consumption of a few glasses of wine has salutary effects. Empirically, however, this pattern tends to be unusual. Findings were homogeneous across studies lending generalizability to results.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1998 Feb,England,1998,90
9624721,Alcohol consumption and mortality. I. Characteristics of drinking groups.,"AIMS: This is the first of a set of three papers evaluating drinking status and mortality risk. Analyses of multiple studies describe associations of drinking patterns with characteristics hypothesized to confound the relationships between drinking status and mortality. Characteristics which both significantly differentiate drinking groups and are consistent across studies would suggest that mortality studies not controlling for them may be compromised. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Associations are evaluated from the raw data of 10 general population studies which contained mortality data. Long-term abstainers are compared to former drinkers, long-term abstainers and former drinkers are compared to light drinkers (by quantity, frequency and volume in separate analyses) and moderate to heavy drinkers are compared to light drinkers. Tetrachoric correlation coefficients assess statistical significance; meta-analysis determines if associations are homogeneous across studies. MEASUREMENTS: Measures of alcohol consumption are quantity, frequency and volume; long-term abstainers are differentiated from former drinkers. Multiple measures of health, social position, social integration and mental health characteristics are evaluated. FINDINGS: Across studies, adult male former drinkers are consistently more likely to be heavier smokers, depressed, unemployed, lower SES and to have used marijuana than long-term abstainers. Adult female former drinkers are consistently more likely to be heavier smokers, in poorer health, not religious, and unmarried than long-term abstainers. Both types of abstainers tend to be of lower SES than light drinkers and report poorer health (not consistent). Female abstainers are more likely to be of normal or overweight than light drinkers. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics of two groups of abstainers, other than their non-use of alcohol, may confound the associations found between drinking and mortality risk.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1998 Feb,England,1998,90
9623686,Asthma and allergies among children in West and East Germany: a comparison between Munster and Greifswald using the ISAAC phase I protocol. International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood.,"The study aim was to compare the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis and eczema in children living in Munster, western Germany, and Greifswald, eastern Germany, and to investigate associations of several characteristics and exposures with atopic disease symptoms. In 1994 and 1995, questionnaire information was gathered on 5-8 yr old children (n=3,741 in Munster and n=2,857 in Greifswald) and 12-15 yr olds (n=4,003 and n= 3,153, respectively) using the phase I protocol of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). The 12 month period prevalences of reported atopic disease symptoms in 5-8 yr olds were generally higher in Munster than in Greifswald, whereas only a few prevalence differences were observed in 12-15 yr olds. In both age groups the reported lifetime prevalences of asthma, hay fever and eczema were lower in Greifswald. Indoor exposures such as wood or coal heating and feather bedding were negatively associated with symptoms, whereas exposures such as truck traffic in a residential street or active smoking were positively associated with symptoms. Wood or coal heating could partly explain the prevalence difference of allergic rhinitis symptoms among 5-8 yr olds between Munster and Greifswald. The findings provide additional evidence for a role of several characteristics and exposures as potential determinants of asthma and allergies in children.",The European respiratory journal,1998 Apr,England,1998,90
9621377,Adoption and fostering of babies with Down syndrome: a cohort of 593 cases.,"Recently, professionals in France have noticed an increase in newborns with Down syndrome (DS) being placed for adoption. The aim of this study was to investigate DS babies given up at birth for adoption and to consider the possible determinants of this in order to assess social acceptance of DS. A retrospective cohort of all living DS babies was collected from two birth-defect registries (Paris: 1981-1990; Marseilles area: 1984-1990). Follow-up data were collected: characteristics of the baby, biological parents and maternity units, age when given up for adoption, and type of foster care. The results showed that 19.4 per cent of infants with DS (115/593) were rejected by their parents. Multiple regression analysis indicated that foreign origin of the mother, area of residence, no associated major malformation, maternal age (15-24 years), and birth rank (> 2) variables were significantly associated with a lower placement rate. Among the 115 abandoned infants with DS, 88 came from unknown parentage (76.5 per cent). For half of them, adoptive placement (88/115) occurred before the age of 6 months. Socio-cultural attitudes play a great part in these family decisions. Equally important is the manner in which professionals propose adoption as an alternative to these parents of DS babies. They should be encouraged to consider all options before making a decision, so that the best solution can be found for the interest of all.",Prenatal diagnosis,1998 May,England,1998,90
9618614,"Explaining recent increases in students' marijuana use: impacts of perceived risks and disapproval, 1976 through 1996.","OBJECTIVES: Marijuana use among high school seniors increased during most of the 1970s, decreased throughout the 1980s, and has been increasing again during the 1990s. Earlier analyses of the classes of 1976 through 1986 attributed the historic trends during that period to specific changes in views about marijuana. This study examined whether recent increases in marijuana use among seniors and among students in earlier grades reflect similar processes. METHODS: Multivariate regression analyses were conducted on data from large annual nationwide surveys of high school seniors from 1976 through 1996 (approximate n = 61,000) and 8th and 10th graders from 1991 through 1996 (n's = 87,911 and 82,475, respectively). RESULTS: Individual lifestyle factors (grades, truancy, religious commitment, evenings out for recreation) correlated substantially with marijuana use but did not explain the historic changes in marijuana use. Rather, decreases in perceived risk of harmfulness and in disapproval can account for the recent increases in all 3 grades and for earlier decreases among seniors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that perceived risks and disapproval are important determinants of marijuana use. Accordingly, prevention efforts should include realistic information about risks and consequences of marijuana use.",American journal of public health,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90
9616419,Education and occupational social class: which is the more important indicator of mortality risk?,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: In the UK, studies of socioeconomic differentials in mortality have generally relied upon occupational social class as the index of socioeconomic position, while in the US, measures based upon education have been widely used. These two measures have different characteristics; for example, social class can change throughout adult life, while education is unlikely to alter after early adulthood. Therefore different interpretations can be given to the mortality differentials that are seen. The objective of this analysis is to demonstrate the profile of mortality differentials, and the factors underlying these differentials, which are associated with the two socioeconomic measures. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: 27 work places in the west of Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 5749 men aged 35-64 who completed questionnaires and were examined between 1970 and 1973. FINDINGS: At baseline, similar gradients between socioeconomic position and blood pressure, height, lung function, and smoking behaviour were seen, regardless of whether the education or social class measure was used. Manual social class and early termination of full time education were associated with higher blood pressure, shorter height, poorer lung function, and a higher prevalence of smoking. Within education strata, the graded association between smoking and social class remains strong, whereas within social class groups the relation between education and smoking is attenuated. Over 21 years of follow up, 1639 of the men died. Mortality from all causes and from three broad cause of death groups (cardiovascular disease, malignant disease, and other causes) showed similar associations with social class and education. For all cause of death groups, men in manual social classes and men who terminated full time education at an early age had higher death rates. Cardiovascular disease was the cause of death group most strongly associated with education, while the non-cardiovascular non-cancer category was the cause of death group most strongly associated with adulthood social class. The graded association between social class and all cause mortality remains strong and significant within education strata, whereas within social class strata the relation between education and mortality is less clear. CONCLUSIONS: As a single indicator of socioeconomic position occupational social class in adulthood is a better discriminator of socioeconomic differentials in mortality and smoking behaviour than is education. This argues against interpretations that see cultural--rather than material--resources as being the key determinants of socioeconomic differentials in health. The stronger association of education with death from cardiovascular causes than with other causes of death may reflect the function of education as an index of socioeconomic circumstances in early life, which appear to have a particular influence on the risk of cardiovascular disease.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1998 Mar,England,1998,90
9616410,Blood thiamin status and determinants in the population of Seychelles (Indian Ocean).,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Micronutrient deficiencies have become rare in industrialised countries as availability of fresh food, supplementation, and fortification have improved but a less favourable situation may still prevail in many developing countries. Blood thiamin status and determinants were therefore investigated in the Seychelles in view of the high incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy and as the staple diet is polished rice that is deficient in thiamin. DESIGN: This was a cross sectional population study using an age and sex stratified random sample. SETTING: Seychelles Islands (Indian Ocean). PARTICIPANTS: A subsample of 206 subjects aged 25-64 years from the population of Seychelles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of total thiamin concentration in whole blood using high performance liquid chromatography. Dietary variables measured using a face to face semi-quantitative food questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean (SD) whole blood thiamin concentration was 77.9 (22.4) nmol/l and low concentration (< 70 nmol/l) was found in 37% of the subjects (95% CI: 31%, 44%). Blood thiamin was significantly related to education and diet but not to age, sex, smoking, and body mass index. Blood thiamin was associated positively with meat, vegetable, salad, and tea intake and negatively with alcohol and fish intake. However, no combination of the examined variables could explain more than 15% of the observed variance in blood thiamin values. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the distribution of blood thiamin in the sampled population is shifted to lower values compared with that generally accepted as normal in European populations. Further research should establish the significance of such lower values in this specific population to facilitate clinical and public health action as necessary.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1998 Apr,England,1998,90
9612838,Determinants of exercise among children. II. A longitudinal analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated that physical activity serves an important preventive function against the development of cardiovascular disease. The recognition that U.S. children are often sedentary, coupled with the observation that physical activity habits tend to persist into adulthood, has prompted the investigation of exercise determinants consistent with social learning theory. The purposes of the present study were to identify social learning variables relevant to children's exercise and to explore the longitudinal predictive value of the determinants. METHODS: Data were collected from 111 families (N = 54 girls, N = 57 boys) who were interviewed in both Phase 1 (fifth and sixth grades) and Phase 2 (eight and ninth grades) of this study. Data from mothers (N = 111) were collected during both phases; data from 80 fathers were collected at Phase 2 only. RESULTS: The results of simultaneous stepwise regression analyses indicated that child's enjoyment of physical activity was the only consistent predictor of physical activity during Phase 1. At Phase 2, child's exercise knowledge, mother's physical activity, and child's and mother's friend modeling/support emerged as predictors for girls. For boys, child's self-efficacy for physical activity, exercise knowledge, parental modeling, and interest in sports media were important. Longitudinally, mother's self-efficacy, barriers to exercise, enjoyment of physical activity, and child's self-efficacy for physical activity were important for girls. Only child's exercise knowledge predicted boys' physical activity. The addition of information from fathers nearly doubled the explanatory power of the predictors for both genders. CONCLUSIONS: Socialization in the family unit exerts a tremendous influence on health-related behaviors such as exercise. The relative importance of determinants seems to differ for girls and boys and the pattern of these determinants appears to change over time.",Preventive medicine,1998 May-Jun,United States,1998,90

The costs of hip fracture are comprised of direct costs from health care and the social welfare system. Data were collected for 1,080 postmenopausal women admitted from private residence for primary hip fracture surgery during the year of 1992 in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. It was found that the cost of hip fracture is significantly related to age, mortality the year after a fracture, type of fracture, costs 1 year before a fracture, and hospital admission. The savings in direct costs for an average woman surviving the year after a fracture amount to SEK 210,000.",International journal of technology assessment in health care,1998 Spring,England,1998,90

In contrast, studies on killer whales and Baird's beaked whale reveal novel social solutions to aquatic living. The combination of convergent and novel features in odontocete social systems promise a more general understanding of the ecological determinants of social systems in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats, as well as the relationship between relative brain size and social evolution.",Trends in ecology & evolution,1998 Jun 1,England,1998,90
9500802,Gender and living alone as determinants of fruit and vegetable consumption among the elderly living at home in urban Nottingham.,"Consumption of fruits and vegetables by a sample of 369 elderly people living in Nottingham, England, was analysed in relation to whether or not they were eating five portions a day. Living status was only of significance to men who, if single, consumed 2.66 portions of fruits and vegetables per day compared with an overall mean of 4.1. The salient question is therefore not ""Are you living alone?"" but "" s there a woman in the household?"". Those respondents who were older and less educated ate less vegetables and those respondents who had a lower income or social grade ate less fruit. Men were less likely to be able to cook a range of meals, to have had a job that involved cooking or to watch cookery programmes on television. Single men were more likely than single women to say that eating food that was easy to cook and prepare was an important influence on their food choice. Single women on the other hand were more influenced by body image. Finding foods that were the right portion size and easy to open, prepare and cook was more important to single men than married men, as was the amount of money left after paying the bills.",Appetite,1998 Feb,England,1998,90
9603277,Desire for help among drug-using Mexican-American arrestees.,"In a sample of 88 drug-using Mexican-American arrestees, we examined demographic factors, drug-problem severity indicators, and personal and social resources as correlates of self-reported desire for help with problems related to drug use. Ethnicity-related attitudes, perceptions, and experiences were among the factors tested. Among 35 potential correlates in this dataset, recognition of drug-related interpersonal problems was the sole significant correlate of desire for help in a multivariate regression analysis. This finding was interpreted in comparison to previously identified correlates of Mexican-American drug users' desire for help specifically in the form of drug user treatment. We derive implications regarding drug-use-associated problem recognition and other potential determinants of help-seeking and success in drug user treatment among Mexican-American drug users.",Substance use & misuse,1998 May,England,1998,90
9602405,"Length and ponderal index at birth: associations with mortality, hospitalizations, development and post-natal growth in Brazilian infants.","BACKGROUND: Low birthweight infants suffer greater mortality and neonatal morbidity, grow less well in infancy and show poorer psycho-motor development. However, this simple categorization may obscure important differences in aetiology and prognosis between infants born stunted, thin, or both. METHODS: In 1993, all births in Pelotas, Brazil, were enrolled into a prospective study of health and development in infancy. Of 5249 live births, 5160 had length and weight measures at birth, and were classified into tertiles of length and ponderal index. All deaths and hospitalizations were monitored, and suspected developmental delay and attained growth at 12 months were assessed on a subsample of 1364 infants. Logistic regression was used to control for gestational age and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: There was no association between birth length and ponderal index tertiles. After adjusting for gestational age, infants in the lower tertiles of both length and ponderal index presented a 3.8-times higher risk of mortality from day 8 to day 365, and a 2.5-times higher risk of hospitalization compared to infants with greater birth lengths and/or ponderal indices. Suspected developmental delay was associated with length and, less strongly, with ponderal index, but there was no synergism between the two. Infants in the middle and upper tertiles of ponderal index at birth became thinner. CONCLUSIONS: Birth length was strongly associated with development at 12 months, but only infants born both short and thin were at increased risk of mortality and hospitalizations. The combination of the two measures provides a useful classification of the anthropometric status of the newborn.",International journal of epidemiology,1998 Apr,England,1998,90
9600005,[Determinants of high risk illness behavior in patients with bronchial asthma].,"The aim of this study was to identify factors influencing high-risk illness behaviour in patients with bronchial asthma. High-risk illness behaviour was defined as 1. non-compliance with antiasthmatic medication and 2. delaying or avoiding medical help when facing airways deterioration or severe attacks. 150 patients with bronchial asthma were investigated; 60 of them had participated in the structured Asthma Treatment and Teaching Programme (ATTP), 90 had not taken part in such a programme by then. Using structural equation models, lack of emotional support by a key figure, poor doctor-patient relationship, and a negative cortisone image were identified as predictors of high-risk illness behaviour in patients who had attended ATTP, while in patients without participation in a treatment and teaching programme, only a negative cortisone image was predictive of this criterion.","Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie",1998 Mar-Apr,Germany,1998,90
9599943,Variability of birth-weight distributions by sex and ethnicity: analysis using mixture models.,"Birth weight is the most important proximate determinant of the level of infant mortality. However, the association between birth weight and infant mortality is not constant among populations. For example, the mortality of African American infants is lower at low birth weight but higher at high birth weight compared with European American infants. One possible explanation is that birth cohorts are heterogeneous even after controlling for birth weight, ethnicity, sex, and multiple births. The analyses presented here use Gaussian mixture models to explore the interpopulation variation in the shape of the birth-weight distribution for evidence of intrapopulation heterogeneity. The results suggest that a two-component mixture model provides an excellent description of human birth-weight distributions. Further statistical analyses of sex and ethnic differences indicate (1) that the birth-weight distributions and heterogeneity within the distribution vary between the sexes and among ethnic groups and (2) that one specific component is more closely associated with the overall level of infant mortality. The results support the hypothesis that birth cohorts can consist of two or more subpopulations at differential risk of mortality. Differences in the subpopulation composition of birth cohorts (i.e., differences in the level of heterogeneity among the various ethnic groups) might partially explain the interethnic variation in birth-weight-specific mortality. Further development of these mixture models should provide important additional information concerning the biological, environmental, and social determinants of birth weight and infant mortality.",Human biology,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90
9595342,"Whose epidemiology, whose health?","Simplistic claims about the objectivity of science have been challenged from a variety of perspectives. Evaluation of the external context of production of knowledge and the methodological approaches to posing questions and assembling evidence shows that there is no pure ""science""; rather, all scientific knowledge is shaped by the social history of its production. Examples are given of how quantitative concepts in modern epidemiology influence the recognition of the causes of disease. The author uses the phenomenon of intensive swine production by vertically integrated agribusiness to illustrate how broad problems such as environmental racism, agricultural determinants of nutrition, loss of natural resources, and conditions conducive to emergence of new diseases are hidden by epidemiological approaches that fit into corporate policy perspectives. It is critically important to ask who produces epidemiological knowledge, and whose health is promoted by that knowledge.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1998,United States,1998,90

The median age was: SCI persons 33 years (range 19 to 79 years), TBI persons 40 years (range 20 to 70 years), and controls 31 years (range 19 to 79 years). Age at injury ranged among SCI persons from 14 to 76 years (Md 28 years), and among TBI persons from 16 to 56 years (Md 32 years). Half of the SCI group (51%), 58% of the TBI group and 59% of the controls had a stable partner relationship at the time of the investigation. Many of these SCI and TBI relationships (38% and 55% respectively) were established after injury. Both SCI and TBI persons showed significantly more depressive feelings compared with the controls. Perceived quality of life (global QL rating) was significantly lower in the SCI group compared with the controls, whereas the ratings of TBI persons and controls did not differ significantly. SCI and TBI persons did not differ significantly in level of education, perceived quality of life or distress. In all three groups, global quality-of-life ratings were significantly lower among single persons compared to those with a partner relationship. It was concluded that both SCI and TBI appear to affect overall quality of life and mental well-being negatively. The number of partner relationships contracted after injury among both SCI and TBI persons indicates, however, that the injury is not a major barrier to establishing close partner relationships. Being in good spirits, that is, lack of depressive feelings has a profound impact on the perception of a high quality of life in all three groups. For the SCI and TBI persons, a high level of physical and social independence were further positive determinants of a perceived high quality of life.",Spinal cord,1998 Apr,England,1998,90
9584581,Socioeconomic status and use of family planning among Ghanaian government workers.,"The low utilization of family planning methods in Ghana, and by inference in much of Africa, is explained by reference to traditional sociocultural values held by males. A LISREL model is tested using data collected from educated males working in the Ghanaian government. Among the findings are that lack of couple communication, segregated conjugal role relationships, and male-dominated decision-making are all significant predictors of non-use of family planning methods (pronatalist attitude is not). Possession of knowledge of family planning among Ghanaian males alone is unlikely to initiate use of family planning methods. Additional sociodemographic and modernization findings are reported.",Social biology,1998 Spring-Summer,United States,1998,90
9584578,"Economic security, informational resources, and women's reproductive choices in urban Mozambique.","Reproductive changes in sub-Saharan Africa are contingent upon women's socioeconomic conditions and informational and cultural resources. This study focuses on socioeconomic and cultural determinants and correlates of the intention to stop childbearing and of contraceptive use among urban women in Mozambique. It uses data from a survey of 1,585 married women conducted in Greater Maputo in 1993, and it employs logistic regression for multivariate analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that although the stopping intention and contraceptive use are interrelated and similarly affected by such factors as education or the area of residence, the intention to stop childbearing is mainly driven by women's perception of their material conditions and socioeconomic security, while contraceptive use is largely a product of social diffusion and the legitimization of innovative, Western-origin information and technologies. The study proposes that these findings may help explain the unique features of the fertility transition in sub-Saharan Africa.",Social biology,1998 Spring-Summer,United States,1998,90
9581450,Early life and later determinants of adult disease: a 50 year follow-up study of the Newcastle Thousand Families cohort.,"The relative contribution of socioeconomic, behavioural and biological factors operating in fetal and infant life, childhood and adulthood to risk for cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases and non-insulin-dependent diabetes in middle age has become an important research issue. All 1142 babies born in Newcastle upon Tyne in May and June 1947 were recruited into a prospective cohort study of child health (the 'Thousand Families' study) and followed in great detail to the age of 15 y, with a brief further follow up at age 22 y. Children from poorer families were at greatest risk of severe respiratory tract infection in infancy. Children from professional and managerial families were on average taller and heavier throughout childhood than those from semi- and unskilled manual social classes. Repeated infections in early childhood greatly increased the risk of developing chronic respiratory disease by age 15 y. This paper outlines a new investigation designed to trace surviving members of this cohort and to chart the relationships between their socioeconomic circumstances, lifestyles, experiences and health from birth through to the present day. Existing data on socioeconomic circumstances and infections in infancy and childhood, infant nutrition, birthweight and physical development to age 22 y will be linked to information gained from a new study. This comprises a postal questionnaire survey of study members' adult health, socioeconomic circumstances and lifestyle, and a hospital based clinical examination including heart and lung function, glucose tolerance, blood lipids and anthropometric measurements at age 49-51 y. Out of a target sample of 979 people for whom sufficient data are available on the first year of life, 866 (88%) have been traced and 649 are still resident in the North of England. Those study members who have been traced are highly representative of the original cohort. The Thousand Families cohort provides a unique opportunity for detailed epidemiological study because of the wealth of data available on infant and childhood socioeconomic and family circumstances, all of which was collected prospectively. In addition, there has been comparatively little loss to follow-up since 1948.",Public health,1998 Mar,Netherlands,1998,90
9580501,[Use of health services by a population of 60-year olds and older in Mexico].,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the sociodemographic characteristics and determinants of health services utilization by the Mexican population of 60 years of age or more. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Information obtained from the National Health Survey II (ENSA-II) allowed analysis of 4,628 elderly people. Prevalence of chronic diseases was analyzed and the determinants of individuals who had used the health services in the two weeks prior to the interview. RESULTS: The chronic diseases most frequently reported were: hypertension, diabetes and heart disease. The utilization and hospitalization rates of that age group were 11.4 and 5.5%, respectively. The services most frequently used were: the private physician, social security (IMSS, ISSSTE) welfare services (Ministry of Health--SSA- and IMSS-Solidaridad). Interestingly, 25 to 45% of social security insurance holders did not use the services, instead they consulted a private physician. The most important explanatory variables for health services utilization were: the perceived illness, not having worked for the previous week and being a social security insurance holder. Gender, area of residence and level of education were not significant in the explanation of health services utilization. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the need to strengthen preventive and support programs for the elderly population, since they only demand health services when they feel sick.",Salud publica de Mexico,1998 Jan-Feb,Mexico,1998,90
9477737,"[""We do what we can"": health service providers facing the utilization problem].","This study presents the second part of the general results obtained by a qualitative study conducted within the National Health Survey II. The object of this study was to identify main patterns and micro-social determinants which affect the process of selection and utilization of health services in order to propose policies aimed at more equity, quality and efficiency in health service delivery. The study was conducted in urban areas among the middle and middle-low class sectors. A total of 192 individual open-ended interviews and eight focus groups were completed among health users in four cities. Also, 61 service providers both from public and private services were interviewed. Since a previous work reported findings related to health service users, this study focuses only on the results pertaining to health service providers. The first part briefly discusses the study design which allowed to explore the meaning that actors--health service providers--attach to their job and working conditions. The second part presents the main findings. The sense of economic and material precariousness with which health providers from public institutions do their work is among the most important results. Common conflicts between health service users and providers are also mentioned, mainly those which arise from the organizational problems of the health center and from the scarcity of the basic drug stock. The third part reports the main coincidences and divergences between health service users and providers. Some of the divergences may be the reason for the under-utilization of health services. The work concludes with a series of policy recommendations aimed at improving the quality and opportunity of health services provided by public institutions for the needs of the population.",Salud publica de Mexico,1997 Nov-Dec,Mexico,1997,90
9578991,The critical impact of early cellular environment on neuronal development.,"Normal brain development requires the precise interactions of environmental signals with genes that drive cellular differentiation and circuit formation. Experimental studies in animal models reveal that early environmental influences in utero can modulate cell fate choice and neuronal growth. Modification of the determinants can have long-lasting consequences. Studies using transplant and cell culture methods have examined the development of the limbic system, regions of the brain that mediate cognition, emotion, memory, and learning. The results show that growth factors in the environment of progenitor cells control long-term gene expression that characterizes neurons in limbic brain regions. Other studies in which the cellular environment is altered by prenatal cocaine exposure result in modified fetal neurotransmitter function and specific pharmacological and structural alterations in the cerebral cortex that lead to abnormal behavior. The cellular milieu of the developing central nervous system prenatally thus serves functions as critical as environmental stimuli postnatally that promote synaptic development and refinement.",Preventive medicine,1998 Mar-Apr,United States,1998,90
9577516,Determinants of management errors in acute severe asthma.,"BACKGROUND: It is hypothesised that, despite recent initiatives to improve asthma self-management including asthma education, detailed investigation of the sequence of events culminating in hospital admission will lead to the identification of important management errors and thus the likelihood that the majority of severe asthma attacks are preventable by currently available strategies, and that psychological, health care and socioeconomic factors are risk factors for such management errors. METHODS: A cross sectional study was undertaken of 138 patients aged 15-50 years admitted to hospital (general ward or intensive care unit) with acute severe asthma who were assessed within 24-72 hours of admission using a number of previously validated instruments. A detailed history of events of the attack was assessed against predetermined criteria for non or delayed use of oral corticosteroids and non or delayed use of emergency ambulance services. RESULTS: Subjects had evidence of severe chronic asthma and had acute severe asthma at presentation (n = 90, pH = 7.3 (0.2), PaCO2 = 7.2 (5.0) kPa) but duration of hospital stay was short (3.7 (2.6) days). Serious management errors occurred very frequently and most were deemed to have been made by the patient. Forward stepwise regression revealed that delayed or non-use of oral corticosteroids was predicted independently by lack of paying job (p = 0.02), high total use of inhaled beta agonists in the 24 hours before index admission (p = 0.04), loss of a job in the last year (p = 0.04), low frequency of use of oral corticosteroids in the last year (p = 0.06), concerns during the index attack about medical expenses (p = 0.07), and delay in the use of ambulance services (p = 0.05)--the model being responsible for 23% of the variance. Delayed or non-summoning of emergency ambulance services was predicted independently by total life events (p = 0.03), having something stolen in the last year (p = 0.003), panic during the index attack (p = 0.01), and concerns during the index attack about taking time off work (p = 0.07)--the model being responsible for 21% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that, despite recent educational advances, serious management errors are common in those admitted to hospital with acute severe asthma and that most management errors relate to patient self-management behaviour. Serious management errors are predicted by a variety of socio-economic and psychological factors. While the results of this study are consistent with the widely held view that most acute severe attacks are theoretically preventable, the challenge for the future is to change patients' behaviour in the face of considerable adverse socioeconomic and psychological factors.",Thorax,1998 Jan,England,1998,90
9577303,The determinants of iron status in early pregnancy.,"In pregnancy, the additional demands for Fe are thought to be met principally through increased maternal dietary Fe absorption and by mobilization of maternal Fe stores. In a general population sample of 576 women we examined the maternal and dietary characteristics which influenced Fe stores (assessed by serum ferritin concentration) in early pregnancy. The effects of these characteristics on two measures of functional Fe status (mean cell volume and haemoglobin concentration) were also considered. Serum ferritin concentrations were lower in multiparous women (P < 0.0001) and in those with a lower BMI (P = 0.01), and rose with increasing alcohol intake (P < 0.0001). Ferritin concentrations fell with increasing Ca intake (P < 0.0001); the proportion of women with serum ferritin values < or = 12 micrograms/l rose from 14% of the women in the lowest quarter of Ca intake to 29% of the women in the highest quarter. Mean cell volume and haemoglobin concentration were not related to Ca intake in early pregnancy. Although Ca added to test-meals reduces Fe absorption, long-term Ca supplementation has not been shown to lower plasma ferritin concentration, suggesting that high habitual Ca intakes would be unlikely to influence Fe status in non-pregnant individuals. Our findings show that in early pregnancy there is an association between high dietary Ca intake and lower Fe stores. This effect of Ca on one aspect of Fe status may result from its influence on Fe bioavailability.",The British journal of nutrition,1998 Mar,England,1998,90
9576126,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices on hypertension in a country in epidemiological transition.","Assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) is a crucial element of hypertension control, but little information is available from developing countries where hypertension has lately been recognized as a major health problem. Therefore, we examined KAP on hypertension in a random sample of 1067 adults aged 25 to 64 years from the Seychelles Islands (Indian Ocean). KAP were assessed from an administered structured questionnaire. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension (screening blood pressure [BP] > or = 160/95 mm Hg or taking antihypertensive medication) was 36% in men and 25% in women aged 25 to 64 years. Among hypertensive persons, 50% were aware of the condition, 34% were treated, and 10% had controlled BP (ie, BP <160/95 mm Hg). Most persons, whether nonhypertensive, unaware hypertensive, or aware hypertensive, had good basic knowledge related to hypertension determinants and consequences, possibly an effect of a nationwide cardiovascular disease prevention program over the last years. However, favorable outcome expectation, positive attitudes, and appropriate practices for hypertension and relevant healthy lifestyles were found in smaller proportions of participants, with little difference between aware hypertensives, unaware hypertensives, and nonhypertensives. Furthermore, hypertensive persons with other concurrent cardiovascular risk factors affecting the overall heart risk knew well the detrimental effects of these other factors but reported making little actual change to control them (particularly regarding overweight and sedentary habits). These data point to the need to maximize the efficiency of hypertension prevention and control programs so that delay in achieving effective hypertension control is minimized in countries experiencing recent emergence of hypertension as a major public health problem.","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",1998 May,United States,1998,90

The prevalence of noncondom use was 45.3%. Women whose sexual partners were noncondom users were four times more likely to believe that asking their partner to use a condom implied he was unfaithful, three times as likely to have a partner who resisted using condoms, three times more likely to receive AFDC, twice as likely to be sexually nonassertive, three times more likely to believe that it was not difficult to find an ""eligible"" African American man, and three times as likely to have had one sexual partner.

The intervention was developed using an innovative new program planning process: intervention mapping. Theory and empirical evidence broadly defined performance objectives and determinants of parental monitoring. These objectives were further refined through group and individual interviews with the target parent group. Learning objectives for the intervention guided the content of the intervention that used modeling as the primary method and role model stories as a strategy delivered through newsletters. Stage-matching members of the target population for their readiness to implement the parental monitoring behaviors further refined the social cognitive message design strategies. Intervention mapping provides an explicit theory- and data-driven guide for intervention development that maximizes intervention impact for a specific target population.",The Journal of school health,1998 Feb,United States,1998,90
9567529,A prospective cohort study on the survival experience of under five children in rural western India.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the role of birth weight, nutrition, immunization and other medical as well as social factors in determining child survival. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: 45 villages in Shirur Development Block in Pune District in Maharashtra. METHODS: A cohort of 4129 children were followed from birth till 5 years of age. Weight and length/height of the child was measured at birth and at 3 monthly home visits. Information was also obtained on common childhood morbidities, immunization status and other bio-medical factors. Cause of death was ascertained by verbal autopsy. RESULTS: The neonatal, infant and underfive mortality was rates were estimated to be 37, 60 and 79 per 1000 live births, respectively. Diarrhea and ARI contributed to the major mortality burden. The Kaplan Meier Survival curve showed a sharp fall in the neonatal period, a less rapid decline in the post-neonatal period followed by a marginal fall in the post-infancy period till 5 years age. Girls had a better survival in the early neonatal period but the trend reversed in the late neonatal period. Normal birth weight children had better survival curves compared to low birth weight children. Survival improved with increasing birth order. Multivariate analysis revealed that birth weight, immunization status, and mother's and child's nutritional status influenced infant and under five mortality. CONCLUSION: Birth weight continues to exert its influence not only on survival/mortality in early life but even as late as 5 years of age. Strategies to improve child survival should include immunization and breastfeeding.",Indian pediatrics,1997 Nov,India,1997,90
9561667,The influence of traditional religion on fertility regulation among the Kassena-Nankana of northern Ghana.,"This article presents findings from a study of the influence of traditional religion on reproductive preferences of Kassena-Nankana lineage heads in northern Ghana. Seven reproductive preference questions were administered to nine lineage heads who are primary practitioners of the cult of soothsaying. With the assistance of soothsayers, interviews were repeated in conjunction with the invocation of religious rites in order to determine the views of ancestral spirits on the seven questions. Pairs of lineage head and ancestral interviews are compared to determine the role of traditional religion in shaping male reproductive preferences. Interview pairs reflect a shared preference for sons, large compounds, and a growing lineage. Findings nonetheless show that some ancestral spirits want small families, some even wanting fewer children than corresponding lineage heads. Spiritual consultations are nondogmatic and open to external ideas and influences, suggesting that family planning introduction will not encounter systematic religious opposition among the Kassena-Nankana.",Studies in family planning,1998 Mar,United States,1998,90
9560871,Changes in cognitive coping skills and social support during cognitive behavioral stress management intervention and distress outcomes in symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive gay men.,"OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported decreases in dysphoria, anxiety, and total mood disturbance in symptomatic HIV seropositive gay men after a 10-week cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) group intervention. This structured intervention was designed a) to increase cognitive and behavioral coping skills related to managing the distress of symptomatic HIV, and b) to increase social support among group members. Here we examine the relative contribution of changes in coping skills and social support during the intervention period to reductions in dysphoria, anxiety, and distress-related symptoms in this sample. METHODS: Participants were randomized to a 10-week CBSM group intervention or to a wait-list control condition. Coping, social supports, and mood were measured before and after the intervention period. RESULTS: Members of the CBSM group (N = 22) showed significant improvement in cognitive coping strategies involving positive reframing and acceptance, and in social supports involving attachment, alliances, and guidance at the end of the 10-week CBSM program compared with controls (N = 18) who showed decrements in these coping abilities and no changes in social support. Improved cognitive coping, specifically acceptance of the HIV infection, was strongly related to lower dysphoria, anxiety, and total mood disturbance in both conditions. Changes in social support and in cognitive coping skills seem to mediate the effects of the experimental condition on the changes in distress noted during the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cognitive coping and social support factors can be modified by psychosocial interventions and may be important determinants of the changes in psychological well-being and quality of life during symptomatic HIV infection that can be achieved through this form of intervention.",Psychosomatic medicine,1998 Mar-Apr,United States,1998,90

The purpose of this framework is twofold. First, it is designed to emphasize that the professional requirements for future psychiatrists will demand a greater knowledge of the structure and functioning of the brain than is currently available in most training programs. Second, it is designed to illustrate that the unique domain which psychiatry occupies within academic medicine, the analysis of the interaction between social and biological determinants of behavior, can best be studied by also having a full understanding of the biological components of behavior.",The American journal of psychiatry,1998 Apr,United States,1998,90
9541065,"Wealth, equity and health care: a critique of a ""population health"" perspective on the determinants of health. Critical Social Science Group.","In this paper we examine the recent ascendancy of a ""population health"" perspective on the ""determinants of health"" in health policy circles as conceptualized by health economists and social epidemiologists such as Evans and Stoddart [Evans and Stoddart (1990) Producing health, consuming health care. Social Science & Medicine 31(12), 1347 1363]. Their view, that the financing of health care systems may actually be deleterious for the health status of populations by drawing attention away from the (economic) determinants of health, has arguably become the ""core"" of the discourse of ""population health"". While applauding the efforts of these and other members of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research for ""pushing the envelope"", we nevertheless have misgivings about their conceptualization of both the ""problem"" and its ""solutions"", as well as about the implications of their perspective for policy. From our critique, we build an alternative point of view based on a political economy perspective. We point out that Evans and Stoddart's evidence is open to alternative interpretations--and, in fact, that their conclusions regarding the importance of wealth creation do not directly reflect the evidence presented, and are indicative of an oversimplified link between wealth and health. Their view also lacks an explicit substantive theory of society and of social change, and provides convenient cover for those who wish to dismantle the welfare state in the name of deficit reduction. Our alternative to the ""provider dominance"" theory of Evans and Stoddart and colleagues stresses that the factors or forces producing health status, which Evans and Stoddart describe, are contained within a larger whole (advanced industrial capitalism) which gives the parts their character and shapes their interrelationships. We contend that this alternative view better explains both how we arrived at a situation in which health care systems are as costly or extensive as they are, and suggests different policy avenues to those enunciated by Evans, Stoddart and their confreres.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Apr,England,1998,90
9538699,Factors associated with pre-eclampsia and quality care of affected teenagers during labour within health region H. in Kwa-Zulu Natal.,"This is a descriptive, exploratory study which aimed at identifying the factors that are associated with pre-eclampsia in teenagers. The study also aimed at assessing the quality of midwifery care during labour in teenagers with pre-eclampsia so that recommendations can be made based on empirical findings. The study was done within Health Region H of KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa. A structured interview schedule was designed to tap information from pre-eclamptic teenagers in an attempt to identify factors associated with pre-eclampsia. A checklist was also designed and administered to assess the care of a pre-eclamptic teenager during labour. The study revealed that factors like age, nulliparity and socio-economic status were associated with pre-eclampsia. In as far as the rest of the factors, there was no relationship as indicated in previous studies. The study also revealed that teenagers affected by pre-eclampsia delayed in attending the antenatal clinic resulting in the control of the disease being difficult. In as far as midwifery care, the study revealed that psychological and social care, as well as the hygienic state of patients was not satisfactory. Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended that health education on prevention of pre-eclampsia should be done on an ongoing process, while carers for teenage mothers should be given inservice education programmes on psychosocial care. The physical environment for maternity units must be improved.",Curationis,1997 Dec,South Africa,1997,90
9534587,[Validation of a model of psychosocial determinants of occupational health of geriatric nurses].,"The purpose of this study was to verify a model of relationships between psychosocial factors and health for 8066 francophone nurses working in geriatric care in Quebec. A random sample of 1990 subjects was drawn and a participation rate of 77.9% and 55% was obtained for the two-time study taken twelve months apart. Based on the theory of Maddi and Kobasa (1984), the model was reproduced for the two-time periods with the aid of structural equations. The analyses showed that three variables exert a direct influence on psychological distress: professional burnout, occupational stressors and hardiness. Also, variables have a direct effect on burnout: listed in order of importance, these are hardiness, occupational stressors, work support, active strategies of coping and employment status. In dealing with the work stressors, the nurses who are hardy make use of active strategies of coping and look for support form their colleagues. The results of the study help to better understand the psychological and social resources that best favor adaptation of working women in highly demanding work environments. The fallout of the study converges towards the quality of life of helping professionals and towards the cost and quality of health and social services.",Sante mentale au Quebec,1997 Autumn,Canada,1997,90
9533742,Unionisation in a comparative neural network model: a trade union membership prediction in 12 states.,"The sociometric and theoretical models traditionally associated with the determinants of unionisation and based on international comparisons, generally use linear analysis of a restricted number of complex variables. The effectiveness of such models often have an unsatisfactory result. In this study a different theoretical and methodological approach has been used. It is based on a integrated scheme made by transposing the principles of the ""Squashing Theory"" (Buscema, 1994) into the social field, by the connectionist paradigm, and by the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This has permitted the carrying out of a larger data base (49 variables, 12 Nations, 12 Years maximum time interval), the adjusting of a model that has an elevated explanatory capacity (in terms of open variance) an ulterior capacity of generalization (in terms of a one-year span) and of metageneralization (in terms of generalization to nonprocessed nations).

A comparison of discriminant analysis and artificial neural networks.,"The paper focuses on the role of the spouse's occupation as a resource for mobile individuals, from the perspective that social positions are held by families, rather than by individuals. Three groups are confronted in terms of the role of the key variables and other relevant factors: men whose spouse does not have a paid job (group 1), men and women whose spouse has a paid job (group 2 and 3). The data set is provided by the national survey on social mobility in Italy, carried out in 1985; social achievements of members of the three groups are considered, including social origins and destinations, social position corresponding to respondent's first job, cultural background (educational achievement of respondent's father and mother found), respondent's education and spouse's social position. The techniques used are discriminant analysis and back propagation Neural Networks. Both techniques traced a clear boundary between group 1 and groups 2 and 3, which were discriminated mainly on the basis of the spouse's occupation; Artificial Neural Networks reached better classification results and allowed a deeper insight into the nonlinear effects of the discriminating variables for the three groups.",Substance use & misuse,1998 Feb,England,1998,90

A sample of 128 African-American women, 18-29 years of age completed a baseline interview and 3 months later completed a similar follow-up interview (n = 100). Compared to women who were inconsistent condom users, women who were consistent condom users were more likely to: have high assertive communication skills (OR=13), desire not becoming pregnant (OR=8.6), have high sexual self-control over condom use (OR=7.6), perceive having control over their partners' use of condoms (OR=6.6), be younger (OR=5.8), and report having a partner that was not committed to the relationship (OR=3.3). Prospective analyses identified baseline level of condom use as the best predictor of condom use at 3-month follow-up. Women who were consistent condom users at baseline were 6.3 times as likely to be consistent condom users at 3-month follow-up. In conclusion, HIV prevention programmes for women need to be gender specific and need to be implemented before high-risk behaviours are established and may be more difficult to modify.",International journal of STD & AIDS,1998 Mar,England,1998,90

DESIGN: Personal and telephone cross-sectional surveys were performed using population-based sampling frames. The overall response rate was 72%. SETTING: Workplaces in Western Australia. SUBJECTS: Random samples of household respondents aged 16 to 69 years in 1992 (n = 1310) and 1994 (n = 1113). MEASURES: Measures of association between healthy workplace attributes and trade unionism were adjusted for workplace location, size, sector, and industrial classification. RESULTS: Trade unionism was strongly associated with healthy catering practices (adjusted OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.30 to 3.23), sun protection practices (2.66; 1.69 to 4.17), disability access (1.47; 1.10 to 1.95), and worksite health promotion programs (2.56; 2.07 to 3.17). A weak and nonsignificant association was observed with restrictive smoking policies (1.21; .95 to 1.55). Generally, healthy workplace attributes were reported less often by respondents working in rural locations, in the private sector, and at small worksites. There was no consistent relationship with sociodemographic factors, including an index of social disadvantage, but members of blue-collar occupations experienced a low prevalence of restrictive smoking policies. CONCLUSIONS: The study raises the hypothesis, but cannot confirm, that trade unions could provide a means for employees to pursue the creation of a health-promoting workplace. Small business represents an excellent target for health promotion activities.",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,1998 May-Jun,United States,1998,90
10180676,Economic transition and health transition: comparing China and Russia.,"Drawing on experiences from China and Russia (the world's two largest transitional economies), this paper empirically examines the impact of economic reforms on health status. While China's overall health status continued to improve after the economic reform, Russia experienced a serious deterioration in its population health. The observed differences in health performance between China and Russia can be explained by the different impacts of economic reforms on three major socioeconomic determinants of health. Depending on whether or not the reform improves physical environment (as reflected in income level and nutritional status), social environment (including social stability and security system), and health care, we would observe either a positive or a negative net effect on health. Despite remarkable differences in overall health development, China and Russia share some common problems. Mental and social health problems such as suicides and alcohol poisoning have been on the rise in both countries. These problems were much more serious in Russia, where political and social instability was more pronounced, associated with Russia's relatively radical reform process. With their economies moving toward a free market system, health sectors in China and Russia are undergoing marketization, which has had serious detrimental effect on the public health services.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",1998 May,Ireland,1998,90

9526726,Problems in search of solutions: health and Canadian aboriginals.,"The purpose of this paper is to explore the health status of Canadian Aboriginals, along with their perceived community health problems and proposed solutions to these issues. Data are drawn from the 1991 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS), which is a weighted random sample of the Aboriginal population. Comparisons were made with respect to group identity (North American Indian, Metis and Inuit) and geographic location (reserve, urban, rural and North) and across a series of health status and health care use indicators. Analysis reveals that geographic location, as compared with Aboriginal identity, appears to have a large impact with respect to health status and use of physician services. On-reserve Aboriginals, for example, reported a lower likelihood of having seen a physician and were more likely to rank their health as fair or poor. Location also influenced perceived community health problems and solutions. Self-identified problems included drugs, cancer and arthritis, while corresponding solutions included education, counseling and service access. Although the problems and solutions were relatively consistent across space, they too varied in their importance. In general, the results tend to reinforce the determinants of health framework, suggesting that the provision of health services is insufficient to remove health disparities on its own. Instead, broader social-welfare provisions must be considered.",Journal of community health,1998 Feb,Netherlands,1998,90

The Inventory of Drug-Taking Situations (Heroin) (IDTS[H]; Annis y Martin, 1985) was administered to a sample of 124 opiate dependent patients in order to study its reliability and factor structure. An Alpha reliability coefficient of .93 was obtained. A principal component analysis of the measure revealed a five-component solution which accounted for 50.6% of the variance. Nevertheless, a confirmatory factor analysis of the self-report showed that the original eight-factor model provides an acceptable fit to the data. Lastly, the frequency at which each of the eight original IDTS(H) subscales appeared as the highest risk situation in the profile was calculated, showing the predominance of Negative Emotional States (35%) and Social Pressure to Use (18%) as the two most important high-risk situations. Theoretical and clinical implications of the results are discussed.","Actas luso-espanolas de neurologia, psiquiatria y ciencias afines",1997 Nov-Dec,Spain,1997,90

9520917,The effect of falls and fall injuries on functioning in community-dwelling older persons.,"BACKGROUND: Several preventive strategies have proven effective at reducing the occurrence and rate of falling. It remains to be determined, however, whether, and to what extent, falls and/or fall injuries are independent determinants of adverse functional outcomes in older persons. METHODS: A probability sample of 1,103 community-dwelling persons over age 71 years was followed for 3 years. The 957 cohort members (87%) who participated in at least one follow-up interview while residing in the community were included in this study. Outcome measures included one and three year change in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (BADLs-IADLs), social activities, and physical activities. Based on daily calendars and hospital surveillance, participants were placed into one of four levels of fall status: no falls, one fall without serious injury, at least two falls without serious injury, and one or more falls with serious injury. Hierarchical linear regression models, sequentially adding six domains of covariates, were constructed to examine fall status as a risk factor for change in function. RESULTS: One noninjurious fall (beta = -.437; p < .01), at least two noninjurious falls (beta = -.877; p < .001); and at least one injurious fall (beta = -1.254; p < .001) were each associated with decline in BADL-IADL function over 3 years after adjusting for covariates (model R2 = .2617). Experiencing two or more noninjurious falls (beta = -.538; p < .05) was associated with decline in social activities (model R2 = .2779) while experiencing at least one injurious fall (beta = -.580; p < .01) was associated with decline in physical activity (model R2 = .4231). CONCLUSIONS: Falls and fall injuries appear to be independent determinants of functional decline in community-dwelling older persons. Falling is a health condition meeting all criteria for prevention: high frequency, evidence of preventability, and high burden of morbidity.","The journals of gerontology.

9519570,"Geographical distribution and dramatic increases in incidences of malaria: consequences of the resettlement scheme in Gambela, SW Ethiopia.","The spatial distribution of malaria results from the interaction between vector, parasite, host, physical and human environments. This basic geographical approach provides an illustration of the geographical distribution of malaria in the world, particularly in the tropical regions. Due to the global climate change and population movements, it is predicted that malaria could have a greater impact on the non-immune or unprepared populations in the Northern Hemisphere in the coming decades. Presently, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the most adversely affected region in the world. Like any other SSA country, Ethiopia suffers from both epidemic (unstable) and endemic (stable) malaria in the high and lowland regions, respectively. Gambela is one of the areas with stable malaria in the humid tropical region of the country. This study is based on observations, unpublished data, interviews and discussions with settlers and officials in Gambela. It is found that a degree of diverse malaria prevalence is associated with altitudinal, temperature and rainfall variations. Owing to the settlement and land-use changes, unexpected rainfall patterns, temperature increase, unstable political system and poverty, malaria has gone beyond its geographical limits. As a result, the number of malaria affected people has increased in the last 12 years. It is suggested that proper physical and social planning, understanding the geography, entomology, epidemiology, behaviour and life-cycle of malaria parasite, cooperation between the policy-makers, malaria specialists, neighbouring countries and international communities are urgent, if malaria has to be controlled and eradicated.",Indian journal of malariology,1997 Sep,India,1997,90
9519092,Determinants of general practitioner recognition of psychological problems in a multi-ethnic inner-city health district.,"BACKGROUND: With few exceptions, evaluation of the capacity of general practitioners (GPs) to recognise psychiatric disorder in their patients has failed to consider the role of ethnic diversity in the consultation process and whether such knowledge can improve understanding of the degree to which psychiatric morbidity is recognised within GP settings. METHODS: This research was completed in five general practices representative of all those within an inner-city health district. Psychiatric morbidity in patients consecutively attending the practices was then assessed using the General Health Questionnaire; in addition, GPs were asked to complete a checklist of current problems identified during each consultation. RESULTS: Analysis suggested that Asian and Black patients were less likely than White patients to have psychological problems identified; that social problems and a psychiatric history facilitated recognition; and that current physical illness hindered recognition. CONCLUSIONS: GP recognition of psychological problems varies according to patient ethnicity but can be substantially masked by both the physical and social circumstances of patients at consultation.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1997 Dec,England,1997,90
9517877,Socioeconomic variation in back and joint pain in Finland.,"UNLABELLED: Differences in the prevalence of back and joint pain by occupational class and education were studied in surveys representative of adult Finns. The effects of lifestyle factors and mental distress on these differences were also analysed. The material comprised 3915 women and 3629 men, all occupationally active. Occupational class and level of education were associated with back and joint pain; the associations were more obvious in men than in women. Among men, the age-adjusted odds ratio of joint pain in farmers was 3.2 (95% CI: 2.1-5.0), in manual workers 2.6 (1.9-3.6), in entrepreneurs 2.4 (1.5-3.7) and in lower white-collar workers 1.7 (1.1-2.4) as compared with upper white-collar employees. Similar odds ratios of back pain were 2.1 (1.6-2.9) in farmers, 1.8 (1.5-2.3) in manual workers, 1.7 (1.2-2.4) in entrepreneurs and 1.4 (1.1-1.7) in lower white-collar workers. Most of the associations persisted in multivariate analyses, in which height, marital status, lifestyle (smoking, leisure-time physical activity and body mass index (BMI)) and mental distress were considered; in these models, mental distress was consistently associated with pain. Back pain was associated with smoking in men and with BMI in women; BMI was also associated with joint pain in both sexes. In women, height showed an association with back pain for which a doctor had been consulted. Marital status, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity and the urbanization level of the community were not important as determinants of pain. CONCLUSION: Obvious differences occurred in back and joint pain by indicators of social class that were not due to socioeconomic differences in lifestyle, height or mental distress.",European journal of epidemiology,1998 Jan,Netherlands,1998,90
9515651,The theory and practice of health education applied to nursing: a bi-polar approach.,"The authors contend that health education is an intrinsic part of nursing practice. The paper outlines two models of health education each with different aims, methods and outcomes and these are related explicitly to nursing practice. The tensions between the two approaches are discussed and whilst the authors acknowledge that both models constitute legitimate health education activity within nursing, it is argued that emphasis should be given, where practically possible, to the patient empowerment model. In addition the authors argue that the social determinants of health and health-related behaviour need to be considered by nurses as a powerful factor in the formation of health lifestyles. Therefore a range of approaches should form part of a repertoire of nursing health promotion interventions.",Journal of advanced nursing,1998 Feb,England,1998,90

9514067,Determinants of risk of invasive cervical cancer in young women.,"We analysed determinants of risk of cervical cancer in women aged less than 45 years using data from a case-control study conducted in Italy. Cases were 261 women aged < 45 years with histologically confirmed invasive cervical cancer. Controls were 257 women aged < 45 years, with acute, non-neoplastic conditions, judged to be unrelated to any of the known or suspected risk factors for cervical cancer. In comparison with women reporting one or no sexual partner, the multivariate odds ratio (OR) of cervical cancer was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.3-4.6), for women reporting two or more sexual partners, and, in comparison with women reporting their first intercourse at 17 years of age or before, the multivariate OR was 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-0.9) in women aged > or =23 years at first intercourse. The risk of cervical cancer was higher in parous women and increased with number of births (OR = 8.1 for three or more births). Among parous women the risk tended to increase with later age at last birth; in comparison with parous women reporting their last birth before age 25, the OR was 1.9 in those reporting their last birth at > or =35 years. No clear association emerged between oral contraceptive use, smoking, education, social class and risk of cervical cancer.",British journal of cancer,1998 Mar,England,1998,90
9511134,What makes women tired? A community sample.,"We aimed to determine the major health concerns or problems of women and their personal attributions for the causes of their primary health concerns. We used a survey of women from the Toronto area attending a women's health symposium. Completed questionnaires were returned by 153 (85%) of 180 women attendees. Persistent fatigue was the primary and most commonly cited health concern. Fatigue was ranked first by 42 (27.5%) women and among the top 10 concerns by 123 (80.4%) women. Women attributed their fatigue to a combination of home and outside work (63.4%), poor sleep (38.2%), lack of time for self (34.1%), lack of exercise (32.5%), financial worries (28.5%), relationship problems (22.0%), emotional causes (17.9%), care of ill family members (13.8%), lack of social or individual support (9.8%), poor physical health (8.9%), work in home or child care (3.3%), or gender bias/harassment (2.4%). Our subjects, women from the community, overwhelmingly endorsed social determinants as the cause of their persistent fatigue. Although depression and anxiety form the most robust associations with persistent fatigue in primary care and community studies, women in this sample ranked these factors in seventh place in their attributions. Similarly, although physicians often assume physical causes for fatigue, women rank physical health low in their own attributions. Given the high prevalence of fatigue in women and its impact on quality of life, more attention needs to be given to the social, systemic, and personal factors that women feel contribute to their fatigue to develop more effective interventions.",Journal of women's health,1998 Feb,United States,1998,90
9508254,Evidence-based critical care medicine: a potential tool for change.,"This issue of New Horizons is about change. While our traditional apprenticeship model of physician training has served us well, adaptation is required for the new millennium. Among several sectoral trends in medicine, two are particularly relevant for intensivists: a) the information explosion and b) increased accountability to society regarding effective, efficient, compassionate, and culturally sensitive care. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) (or any other single initiative, for that matter) is not going to address all of tomorrow's challenges. However, EBM does help by enhancing clinical informatics and critical appraisal skills so that clinicians are better able to keep up with the growing literature, and decide whether, and if so, this literature applies to individual patients. In addition, EBM can help to highlight the determinants of clinical decisions, which may include contributions of caregiver knowledge, patient pathophysiology, research evidence, patient and societal values, and increasingly, costs. While EBM is best practiced at the individual level, its application to other aspects of health care is growing.","New horizons (Baltimore, Md.)",1998 Feb,United States,1998,90

9493751,"State-level infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality: the contribution of selected structural socioeconomic variables.","Reducing infant mortality in the United States is a national priority. States' infant mortality rates vary substantially. Public health researchers, practitioners, and leaders have long argued that social and other structural factors must be addressed if health outcomes are to be improved. A knowledge of which structural variables are most strongly related to state-level infant mortality is needed to guide the development of policies and programs to reduce this mortality. The authors examine the importance of several structural (social, economic, and political) variables for state-level infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality. With the state as the unit of analysis, data for all 50 states were analyzed using multiple regression. Together, the structural variables accounted for two-thirds of the variance in infant and neonatal mortality rates and over half of the variance in postneonatal mortality rates. States with proportionately larger black populations had higher infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality rates. States with greater percentages of high school graduates had lower neonatal mortality rates but higher postneonatal mortality rates. The findings suggest that a better understanding of the relationship between states' social structure and infant health outcomes is needed if state-level infant mortality is to be reduced.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1998,United States,1998,90
9491044,Social determinants of pediatric residents' injury prevention counseling.,"BACKGROUND: Social norms imparted by preceptors and the requirements necessary to pass American Board of Pediatrics' examinations are potentially important contributors to physician behavior. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships between perceived professional norms regarding injury prevention and the injury prevention topics discussed, and counseling strategies employed, by pediatric residents. DESIGN: A self-administered survey. SETTING: All 5 North Carolina pediatric residency programs. PARTICIPANTS: Physicians training in pediatrics or medicine-pediatrics in these programs (N = 160, 72% response rate). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correlation between perceived professional norms and self-reported content of injury prevention counseling and use of behavior change strategies. RESULTS: Although 95% of the pediatric residents reported counseling all or almost all parents with children younger than 1 year about car seat use, only 19% reported counseling this many parents about gun safety. Of the 7 behavior change strategies that residents were asked about, respondents were most likely to report ""showing approval for safe behaviors"" to all almost all parents (78%). Two thirds reported asking all or almost all parents about the safety of their homes. Pediatric residents' reported injury prevention counseling was correlated with their perceived professional norms regarding such counseling for most of the content areas and behavior change strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived professional norms regarding injury prevention are related to pediatric residents' counseling, Preceptors should be aware that they transmit professional norms to residents. Also, the American Board of Pediatrics can increase residents' attention to injury prevention by informing them that it will be a topic included in the board examination.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,1998 Feb,United States,1998,90

POPULATION AND METHODS: The surveys were carried out on a representative sample, made up by quotas method, of the population concerned (12 to 18 years old). The last data (1995) were analyzed in order to evaluate present smoking behaviour and to measure the influence of the social environment. RESULTS: In 1995 more than one out of three (35.1%) young people smoked at least once in a while; this smoking prevalence was nearly the same among boys (34.7%) as among girls (35.5%). Since 1977, the long-term trend of the rates showed a decrease and the monitoring of the starting age proved that adolescents began to smoke more and more later. The influence of peer and parents smoking was strong. The socioeconomic status of the family and also the amount of pocket money were other determinants of smoking. The family and school atmosphere played an important role as well. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of all these environmental variables on the young person's smoking behaviour underlines the necessity of developing simultaneously campaigns aimed at young people and actions among different populations. The emergence of a positive status for the non-smoker supports the choice of the strategies for the latest campaigns.",Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,1997 Nov,France,1997,90
9489050,"Social determinants predict needle-sharing behaviour among injection drug users in Vancouver, Canada.","Despite the fact that needle exchange was introduced in Vancouver as early as 1988, needle sharing remains common. An analysis was conducted to identify determinants of borrowing used needles among subjects participating in a case-control study. IDUs had a documented HIV seroconversion after 1 January, 1994 (n = 89), or repeatedly tested HIV-seronegative after this date (n = 192). Interviewer-administered questionnaires focused on drug use, sexual behaviours, source of needles and depression. Subjects were asked if they had ""ever been forced to have sex"" as a child, youth or adult. Logistic regression identified determinants of borrowing needles. After controlling for HIV serostatus, factors independently associated with borrowing were injecting > 4 times/day, polydrug use, and ever experiencing non-consensual sex (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.8, 6.5). Depression was associated with borrowing, although not independently so. Homosexual activity was independently associated with borrowing among males, whereas living with a sexual partner was an independent predictor for females. Access or barriers to clean needle use were not associated with borrowing. Social determinants, particularly a history of sexual abuse, are among the most significant predictors of needle borrowing among Vancouver's IDUs. Early identification of these factors should be a component of HIV prevention programmes.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1997 Oct,England,1997,90

Clearer policies giving patients more control, and more health and treatment services, were related to more supportive, autonomous, expressive, and practically oriented milieus. In contrast, more policy choice and daily living assistance were associated with less support, personal expression, and practical orientation. Programs in which staff had more paraprofessionals and better team functioning, and in which patients had more social resources and better mental functioning, tended to be more supportive and to have more emphasis on autonomy, personal expression, and practical orientation.

Highly significant relations between maternal prepregnancy weight status and newborn size were observed. With higher maternal prepregnancy body mass index, higher birthweight, length, head circumference, acromial circumference and fronto occipitalis diameter occurred. Furthermore the incidence of low weight newborns (< 2500 g) was significantly higher in underweight women than in normal weight, overweight and obese women. Although the pregnancy weight gain was significantly higher in underweight women than in normal weight, this higher pregnancy weight gain was not able to compensate for the negative impact of poor weight status before pregnancy. These results indicate that even in a highly developed country such as Austria, where starvation is a nearly unknown problem and the medical and social system are well developed, a poor maternal weight status is a risk factor for growth retarded and low weight births.",Annals of human biology,1998 Jan-Feb,England,1998,90

9472279,An investigation into the causes of absconding among black African breast cancer patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To discuss the complexities facing the researcher in attempting to determine reasons for the high rate of absconding from biomedical treatments by black African women diagnosed with breast cancer. DESIGN: Qualitative study based on in-depth interviews and participant observations of the informants, to ascertain attitudes, beliefs and practices of black African breast cancer patients with regard to the choice of healer. PARTICIPANTS: 10 black breast cancer patients, 4 African indigenous healers, 4 black lay persons, and 8 Groote Schuur Hospital members. SETTING: Radiation Oncology Department, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. RESULTS: The study revealed that various determinants affect black women's decision to abscond from biomedical breast cancer treatments. These determinants were based on social and cultural peculiarities. However, these findings did not explain the difference in absconding rates between black cervical (30%) and breast cancer (80%) patients. Although the two patient groups shared social, economic, and cultural backgrounds, their decisions with regard to biomedical treatments of cancer were remarkably different. CONCLUSIONS: The methods chosen for the research project provided a framework for a qualitative study of one ethnic group of breast cancer patients. However, the research framework failed to allow comparisons between breast and cervical cancer patients from the same ethnic backgrounds. Therefore, although the research findings revealed determinants affecting black breast cancer treatments, they do not explain the discrepancy between absconding rates of black cervical and breast cancer patients.",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,1997 Nov,South Africa,1997,90
9471289,[The representations of menopause: social products of age and sex].,"The aim of this survey is to identify the representations of the menopause in general population and to identify socioculturals determinants of attitudes toward hormone replacement therapy (HRT). For this qualitative study 60 through interviews were performed with women aged between 40 and 65. Four representations were found: negative, ambivalent, neutral and positive. The negative pole, which is dominant, corresponds to the assignation of women to domestic and reproduction functions. The positive pole corresponds to access of women to some social autonomy. Thus, representations of the menopause form a major element of the symbolic domination on middle aged women. Medicalisation and cosmetic practices are the most strongly correlated variables with taking HRT. Three dimensions appear in the social uses of HRT: medical, cosmetic and symbolic, which intervene in various ways according different representations.","Contraception, fertilite, sexualite (1992)",1997 Nov,France,1997,90
9468745,Perceived coercion among clients entering substance abuse treatment: structural and psychological determinants.,"Little is known about the extent to which admission to alcohol and other drug treatment programs is perceived as a coercive imposition. This is because coercion is typically inferred from referral source rather than measured. In this study, clients (N = 300) entering substance abuse treatment were assessed on structural variables (sociodemographic background, criminal history, current legal status, referral source), psychological variables (personal beliefs about substance abuse, perceived interpersonal pressures), alcohol/drug use, and perceived coercion. Mandated treatment status predicted perceived coercion; however, many mandated clients did not, and many self-referrals did, report being coerced into treatment. Psychological factors accounted for additional variance in perceived coercion, controlling for referral source. Substance dependence did not add to the predictability of perceived coercion beyond structural and psychological variables. These findings are inconsistent with the notion that coercion can be inferred from referral source. Instead, results support self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), which proposes that multiple social and psychological events promote perceived coercion by undermining personal autonomy.",Addictive behaviors,1998 Jan-Feb,England,1998,90
9467703,(Dis)respect and black mortality.,"OBJECTIVES: A growing number of studies have documented the deleterious health consequences of the experience of racial discrimination in African Americans. The present study examined the association of racial prejudice--measured at a collective level--to black and white mortality across the United States. METHODS: Cross-sectional ecologic study, based on data from 39 states. Collective disrespect was measured by weighted responses to a question on a national survey, which asked: ""On the average blacks have worse jobs, income, and housing than white people. Do you think the differences are: (A) Mainly due to discrimination? (yes/no); (b) Because most blacks have less in-born ability to learn? (yes/no); (c) Because most blacks don't have the chance for education that it takes to rise out of poverty? (yes/no); and (d) Because most blacks just don't have the motivation or will power to pull themselves up out of poverty? (yes/no)."" For each state, we calculated the percentage of respondents who answered in the affirmative to the above statements. Age-standardized total and cause-specific mortality rates in 1990 were obtained for each state. RESULTS: Both measures of collective disrespect were strongly correlated with black mortality (r = 0.53 to 0.56), as well as with white mortality (r = 0.48 to 0.54). A 1 percent increase in the prevalence of those who believed that blacks lacked innate ability was associated with an increase in age-adjusted black mortality rate of 359.8 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval: 187.5 to 532.1 deaths per 100,000). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that racism, measured as an ecologic characteristic, is associated with higher mortality in both blacks and whites.",Ethnicity & disease,1997 Autumn,United States,1997,90
9465373,[The roles of various media in the decision making processes for recycling behavior: a path analysis model].,"This study researched the effects of cognitive variables on recycling behavior, as well as effects of various media of influence on the cognition and behavior. According to Hirose (1994), the decision making process for recycling consists of two steps. The first leads to goal intention of an ecological lifestyle. The second is related to behavior intention of recycling in line with the goal intention. Mass media, such as newspaper and TV, are thought to influence beliefs about environmental problems, including three determinants of goal intention: perception of seriousness, responsibility, and effectiveness. Personal media, such as personal contacts with pro-environmental activists, are thought to influence evaluation of behavior, including three determinants of behavior intention: evaluation of feasibility, cost and benefits, and social norms. Local media, such as municipal announcement and circular, are hypothesized to have a mixed effect of the two. Path analysis indicated that goal intention affected recycling behavior through behavior intention. Effects of the three media of influence on the cognitive variables were also consistent with the hypothesis.",Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology,1997 Oct,Japan,1997,90
9460074,Implications for health services.,"Health services for older people in the NHS have developed pragmatically, and reflect the nature of disease in later life and the need to agree objectives of care with patients. Although services are likely to be able to cope with the immediate future, the growth of the elderly population anticipated from 2030 calls for long-term planning and research. The issue of funding requires immediate political thought and action. Scientifically the focus needs to be on maximizing the efficiency of services by health services research and reducing the incidence of disability in later life through research on its biological and social determinants. Senescence is a progressive loss of adaptability due to an interaction between intrinsic (genetic) processes with extrinsic factors in environment and lifestyle. There are grounds for postulating that a policy of postponement of the onset of disability, by modifications of lifestyle and environment, could reduce the average duration of disability before death. The new political structures of Europe offer under exploited-unexploited opportunities for the necessary research.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

9459470,Health values of hospitalized patients 80 years or older. HELP Investigators. Hospitalized Elderly Longitudinal Project.,"CONTEXT: Health values (utilities or preferences for health states) are often incorporated into clinical decisions and health care policy when issues of quality vs length of life arise, but little is known about health values of the very old. OBJECTIVE: To assess health values of older hospitalized patients, compare their values with those of their surrogate decision makers, investigate possible determinants of health values, and determine whether health values change over time. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal, multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Four academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred fourteen hospitalized patients aged 80 years or older and their surrogate decision makers who were interviewed and understood the task. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time-trade-off utilities, reflecting preferences for current health relative to a shorter but healthy life. RESULTS: On average, patients equated living 1 year in their current state of health with living 9.7 months in excellent health (mean [SD] utility, 0.81 [0.28]). Although only 126 patients (30.7%) rated their current quality of life as excellent or very good, 284 (68.6%) were willing to give up at most 1 month of 12 in exchange for excellent health (utility > or =0.92). At the other extreme, 25 (6.0%) were willing to live 2 weeks or less in excellent health rather than 1 year in their current state of health (utility < or =0.04). Patients were willing to trade significantly less time for a healthy life than their surrogates assumed they would (mean difference, 0.05; P=.007); 61 surrogates (20.3%) underestimated the patient's time-trade-off score by 0.25 (3 months of 12) or more. Patients willing to trade less time for better health were more likely to want resuscitation and other measures to extend life. Time-trade-off score correlated only modestly with quality-of-life rating (r=0.28) and inversely with depression score (r=-0.27), but there were few other clinical or demographic predictors of health values. When patients who survived were asked the time-trade-off question again at 1 year, they were willing to trade less time for better health than at baseline (mean difference, 0.04; P=.04). CONCLUSION: Very old hospitalized patients who could be interviewed were able, in most cases, to have their health values assessed using the time-trade-off technique. Most patients were unwilling to trade much time for excellent health, but preferences varied greatly. Because proxies and multivariable analyses cannot gauge health values of elderly hospitalized patients accurately, health values of the very old should be elicited directly from the patient.",JAMA,1998 Feb 4,United States,1998,90
9459066,"Effects of task strain, social conflict, and emotional activation on ambulatory cardiovascular activity: daily life consequences of recurring stress in a multiethnic adult sample.","Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) may be an independent predictor of cardiovascular endpoints, but little is known about its psychosocial determinants. The acute effects of psychosocial processes on cardiovascular activity during daily life were examined by random-effects regression. Healthy adults (N = 120) were monitored over a 6-day period with ABP monitors and computer-assisted self-report assessments. Task strain, social conflict, and emotional activation were rated following each ABP measurement, as were activity, posture, and other covariates. Results show that blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were elevated during periods of emotional activation (high negative affect or high arousal). Diastolic BP was lower during periods involving high decisional control, and HR was lower during high-control, low-demand activities. There were substantial individual differences in the effects of psychosocial influences on ambulatory cardiovascular activity. Psychological factors are reliable determinants of ABP, which may account in part for the unique predictive value of ABP.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1998 Jan,United States,1998,90
9458585,The dental health status of five-year-old children in north and west Belfast.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of social deprivation upon the diet, dental health behaviours and dental health status of five-year-old children in Northern Ireland. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Fifty-eight primary schools in North and West Belfast. SUBJECTS: A nine per cent (240) random sample of 2,666 five-year-old children resident and attending school in North and West Belfast. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dental health status measured by dmft index; parental assessments of the child's dental health behaviours: parental dental attendance patterns and attitudes towards dental health; parental assessments of the child's diet and snacking behaviours: parental attitudes towards snack foods; and demographic profile of child's family. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three children were examined, a 68 per cent response. The majority of the families were either in low income employment or unemployed. Sixty-eight per cent of children had experience of dental caries. Dental decay was unrelated to parental employment status but more children from unemployed families attended when in pain. The diet of the children was related to both employment status and parental attitude and was reflected in their caries experience. Caries experience was dependent upon parental dental attendance, the consumption of carbonated drinks and sugar containing bedtime drinks. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that unemployment and parental attitudes are important as determinants of dental caries in five-year-old children from North and West Belfast. These factors may influence the child's dental health care as well as type of diet.",Community dental health,1997 Dec,England,1997,90
9458570,Health promotion practice and public health: challenge for the 1990s. Heart Health Think Tank Group.,"The issue of practice skills arose in the course of a process evaluation of the Heart Smart North Shore (HSNS) project in British Columbia. We created a Think Tank of researchers and community practitioners to make recommendations for improvement of our skills. These recommendations differed according to different values for health and opinions on how to create health in the community. Because the site reviewers of the HSNS project were clear this was a disease prevention project and not a community development initiative, HSNS's orientation to skill development after the Think Tank moved toward the Precede/Proceed model, the Transtheoretical model and social marketing approaches. The Health Unit has now been restructured into multidisciplinary service teams which must focus on population health, evidence-based practice and the social determinants of health, and thus need to consider health promotion from a community development perspective and empowerment model. We suggest that learning and the development of staff and community volunteers should be seen as a continuous and reflective process that takes place at the individual, community and organizational level.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1997 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1997,90
9431652,Ethnocultural identity and induced abortion in Kazakstan.,"This study analyzes ethnic differences in induced abortion among ever-married women in Kazakstan, drawing on data from the 1995 Kazakstan Demographic and Health Survey. Instead of conventional ethnic markers, such as ""Kazak"" or ""Russian,"" it focuses on more complex ethnocultural identities that combine ascribed ethnicity with language use. Because of the history of russification in Kazakstan, three ethnocultural groups are defined and compared--Kazak women who chose to be interviewed in Kazak, Kazak women who chose to be interviewed in Russian, and women of European background interviewed in Russian. Whereas women of European origin were the most likely to undergo induced abortion, the Russian-interviewed Kazaks had higher abortion ratios and were more likely to terminate their pregnancies than were the Kazak-interviewed Kazaks, net of other characteristics. The implications of the results for induced abortion trends and family planning policy in Kazakstan are discussed in addition to other findings.",Studies in family planning,1997 Dec,United States,1997,90
9455171,Looking for the agent: an investigation into consciousness of action and self-consciousness in schizophrenic patients.,"The abilities to attribute an action to its proper agent and to understand its meaning when it is produced by someone else are basic aspects of human social communication. Several psychiatric syndromes, such as schizophrenia, seem to lead to a dysfunction of the awareness of one's own action as well as of recognition of actions performed by others. Such syndromes offer a framework for studying the determinants of agency, the ability to correctly attribute actions to their veridical source. Thirty normal subjects and 30 schizophrenic patients with and without hallucinations and/or delusional experiences were required to execute simple finger and wrist movements, without direct visual control of their hand. The image of either their own hand or an alien hand executing the same or a different movement was presented on a TV-screen in real time. The task for the subjects was to discriminate whether the hand presented on the screen was their own or not. Hallucinating and deluded schizophrenic patients were more impaired in discriminating their own hand from the alien one than the non-hallucinating ones, and tended to misattribute the alien hand to themselves. Results are discussed according to a model of action control. A tentative description of the mechanisms leading to action consciousness is proposed.",Cognition,1997 Dec,Netherlands,1997,90
9415513,Determinants of pressure pain threshold in adult twins: evidence that shared environmental influences predominate.,"The objective of this study was to examine the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors in determining pain perception in a classical twin study. Dolorimeter measurements of pressure pain threshold (PPT) were recorded in 609 healthy female-female twin pairs of whom 269 pairs were monozygotic (MZ) and 340 were dizygotic (DZ). There was a strong correlation (R) in PPT in both MZ and DZ pairs (R(MZ) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): [0.49, 0.65]; R(DZ) = 0.51, 95% CI: [0.42, 0.59]). The slight excess in intraclass correlation observed in MZ when compared with DZ twins corresponds to a heritability for PPT of only 10% and is not statistically significant. Neither estimate of intraclass correlation was substantially altered after adjusting for a range of potential confounding variables including age, current tobacco and alcohol use, current analgesic use, psychological status assessed by the general health questionnaire, and social class. The dolorimeter measurements were shown to be reliable (between observer agreement R = 0.66; within observer agreement R = 0.70-0.76) and stable over time. In conclusion, these data suggest that there is no significant genetic contribution to the strong correlation in PPT that is observed in twin pairs. These findings reinforce the view that learned patterns of behaviour within families are an important determinant of perceived sensitivity to pain.",Pain,1997 Nov,United States,1997,90
10178658,Average annual drug cost and its determinants in a population based cohort of HIV-positive adult men and women.,"The purpose of this study is to determine drug costs and the sociodemographic and clinical determinants of drug costs in a large open cohort of HIV-positive adult men and women in British Columbia, Canada from 1993 to 1995. The study is descriptive and population-based using time-series data. Individuals included in the study were men and women enrolled in a province-wide HIV/AIDS drug treatment programme who had given consent to access their entire prescription records held by the provincial drug plan. The primary outcome measure was the average annual drug cost for treating HIV/AIDS among programme participants; results were stratified by sociodemographic status, drug category and disease severity. The analysis was restricted to 1271 consenting programme participants. The average annual drug cost per participant in 1996 Canadian dollars ($Can) was $Can3431 in 1993, $Can3892 in 1994 and $Can4377 in 1995. Between 1993 and 1995, the average annual cost of antiretroviral therapies increased by 6.6% ($Can2579 in 1995), anti-infectives increased by 61.4% ($Can2402 in 1995) and other drugs used in the management of patients with HIV disease increased by 35.7% ($Can1146 in 1995). The overall increase over this period was 27.6%. In 1995, the average annual drug cost was $Can4720 for those on social assistance, $Can4545 for seniors and $Can5937 for the general population (nonpoor and nonelderly). In 1995, the average annual drug cost was $Can6887 for those with AIDS and $Can3911 for those without. Multivariate modelling indicated that drug costs were significantly related with CD4+ cell count (p < 0.001), diagnoses of AIDS (p < 0.001), provincial drug plan type (p = 0.002), time participants had spent in the HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program (p = 0.003), number of hospitalisations (p = 0.003) and patient's age (p = 0.004). Our data demonstrate that the average annual drug costs for persons with HIV/AIDS in British Columbia have been increasing even though the cost of antiretrovirals has been relatively stable. This was due mainly to the increase in the cost of anti-infectives and other drugs. Important cost drivers were participant's age, socioeconomic status (by provincial drug insurance coverage level) and rate of disease progression as measured by CD4+ cell counts, hospitalisation events and duration of illness.",PharmacoEconomics,1998 Mar,New Zealand,1998,90
10178622,"Examining emotional, physical, social, and spiritual health as determinants of self-rated health status.","PURPOSE: To determine whether individuals' perceptions of their emotional, physical, social, and spiritual health constitute elements of their self-rated health status operationalized with a commonly employed single indicator. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data. Structural equation modeling with LISREL was used. SETTING: The Yukon Health Promotion Survey, Yukon Territory, Canada, 1993. SUBJECTS: The population-based sample was made up of 742 women and 713 men between 15 and 90 years of age; 80.3% responded. MEASURES: Self-rated health status was operationalized with the ""excellent, good, fair, poor"" indicator derived from the question: ""In general, compared to other people your age, would you say your health is...."" Social, spiritual, emotional, and physical health status were also self-rated from excellent to poor. RESULTS: The model's fit of the data was acceptable. Only physical health status significantly contributed to the variance in self-rated health status (55.1% of the variance was explained). Emotional, social, and spiritual health were found to have no effect on individuals' ratings of their health status. CONCLUSIONS: Although recent conceptualizations have broadened in much of the theoretical and political discourse about health, especially in health promotion, the self-rated health status indicator measures only physical health status.",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,1998 Mar-Apr,United States,1998,90

The effects of 2 indicators of developmental readiness (age and duration of relationship) were also explored. It was expected that (a) the likelihood of having a baby would increase as a function of intentions, evaluations of being childless, and expected rewards of having children and (b) developmental readiness would be positively related to whether respondents had children at the 2nd wave of the study.

9446197,[Dependency: possible risk or inevitable outcome?].,"This is the burning issue of the hour. In attempting to resolve it within the context of advanced age, it is important to clarify the meaning of the words involved: Independence and autonomy are far from being synonyms. Independence refers to the ability to perform physical activities of daily living (bathing, eating, preparing meals, shopping, money management), whereas the second word, autonomy, refers more to the ability to make decisions, to reason, to express an appropriate opinion in a given situation. Hazard and inevitability are totally at variance. Hazard implies the likelihood of occurrence of an event harmful to health, or to the length or quality of life. Hazard is more or less predictable, whereas inevitability is the expression of a supernatural power controlling all events. To find out whether ""dependency is a hazard or an inevitability"", it is necessary to conduct a historical review of the extension in human longevity and in particular of the current ""weight"" of aging both on individuals and on society at large. In Geneva, the proportion of the over 65-year-olds grew from 5.1 percent in 1880 to 13.4 percent in 1990. During that time, the gain in life expectancy was 52.4 percent for Geneva males of 80 years of age and 93 percent for Geneva females of the same age. This drastic change in age groups was coupled with a noteworthy change in household sizes. In 1860, the number of persons per household was 4.5. In 1990, it was down to 2.2. Conversely, the number of inmates in Geneva's medico-social institutions went up from 649 to 1168 between 1982 and 1992. In this socio-economic and cultural perspective, the concept of ""globality of the individual"" throughout his lifetime explains: age-related physiological changes; the long-term repercussion of physical, professional or leisure activities; the consequences of the accumulation of such varied risk factors as overweight or its opposite, malnutrition, tobacco or stress. Such frailty caused by aging is an ideal breeding ground for disease. For now, what matters most is the functional consequence of disease. Is the disease acute or chronic? Two out of three deaths result from a chronic disease, which caused loss of function by organs (impairment), loss of function by the subject himself (disability) or loss of function by the individual in society (social handicap or disadvantage). Raising the question ""Dependency: a hazard or an inevitability?"" boils down to asking oneself about the place of disease in our society and its determinants, and about all aspects of medicine and especially of prevention. When detected, a susceptibility brings into play primary prevention, aimed at averting the onset of the disease. After a disease has set in, measures to prevent recurrence, or secondary prevention, are required. Lastly, prevention of dependency and of loss of autonomy is part of tertiary prevention. Except for violent traumatic accidents, the formulation of the above concepts proves that dependency is essentially ""a hazard"". Therefore, let us anticipate!",Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,1997 Oct 25,Switzerland,1997,90
9444540,Emotional distress and morbidity in dementia carers: a matched comparison of husbands and wives.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to: (i) replicate previous findings that women experience more strain and distress than men when caring for dementing spouses; (ii) explore what factors underlie this sex difference. DESIGN: Two closely matched subsamples of spouse carers, husbands and wives respectively, were selected and the two groups compared. SETTING: An urban psychogeriatric service in the UK. SUBJECTS: 48 spouses of referred dementia cases. MEASURES: Mental health was rated by the General Health Questionnaire, the Strain Scale and the Life Satisfaction Index. Various factors related to caregiving were assessed by the Problem Checklist, and a specially devised instrument to record caregiving task involvement, formal/informal support, objective burden, satisfaction with supports and attitudes to the relationship and to caregiving. RESULTS: The wives' levels of strain and morale were significantly worse than husbands'. There were qualitative differences between husbands and wives in terms of caregiving tasks undertaken. Wives tolerated dementia sufferers depending on them less well. Wives were also more likely to wish to leave caregiving to someone else and cited more reasons for giving up. Subjects of both sexes displayed a strong tendency to view women as generally better suited to the caregiving role, and wives felt a greater obligation to care. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that such attitudinal or social factors are the chief determinants of wives' higher levels of strain and distress.",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,1997 Dec,England,1997,90
9435709,Contemporary medical students' quest for self-fulfillment through community service.,"The author argues against the criticism that contemporary medical students, like most educated youth in our society, are self-centered moral relativists without a sense of social responsibility. He first frames his argument in terms of what Charles Taylor calls the three ""malaises of modernity,"" namely, the rise of individualism, an emphasis on instrumental reasoning based on bureaucratic efficiency, and the loss of political action. He goes on to show how these malaises are manifested in the academic health center and their effect on the professional socialization of future physicians. Then, using John Evan's perspective of the need to shift from ""supply-side"" to ""demand-side"" thinking in the way today's medical students are trained and Hafferty and Frank's thesis that the most critical determinants of a physician's identity operate not within the formal curriculum but in a ""hidden curriculum,"" he presents his own case of how Rush medical students, by participating in student-generated, voluntary projects--via the Rush Community Service Initiatives Program--are harnessing their individualism through commitment to serving the poor and disadvantaged. To show that the situation at Rush is not unique, the author also points to the impact that the Health of the Public and service-learning programs have been having both in academic health centers and in the communities being served. Finally, it is his contention that these community service experiences, given unconditionally to people in need, broaden the students' education by offering a population and community perspective of health and illness and, perhaps more important, bind them closer to society in both a moral and a political sense.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,1997 Dec,United States,1997,90

RESULTS: At time A the prevalence of postnatal depression was 9.9-22.3%, and at time B it was 5.2-12.4% (p < 0.0001). Four of the psychosocial determinants examined correlated significantly with depression at times A and B. These factors were: a positive psychiatric history, Oriental ethnic origin, being foreign born, inconvenient timing of pregnancy.

9430056,Persons with intellectual disability receiving psychiatric treatment.,"Determinants of (1) referral to psychiatric services and (2) the amount of mental health care consumed were analysed in a population of individuals with intellectual disability, using data from a cumulative mental health case register in a defined geographical area. Associations between level of disability, gender, age and social environment on the one hand, and psychiatric referral and service consumption on the other were expressed as odds ratios (ORs). Being older (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.5-2.5), having milder intellectual disability (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.9-2.3) and living alone (OR = 5.8; 95% CI = 2.8-11.9) predicted a higher probability of receiving psychiatric treatment.

9427096,Care services for dementia patients: predictors for service utilization.,"AIM: The objective of this study was to examine service utilization figures among a representative sample of demented patients and to determine whether sociodemographic and health-related variables are associated with care utilization. METHOD: The study population was derived from a population-based, two-stage cross-sectional study in The Netherlands and consisted of 102 demented subjects. Four levels of care intensity were used: level 1, no use of professional care; level 2, use of one or more types of professional care by community-dwelling subjects; level 3, residential living in homes for the aged; level 4, long-term care in specialized nursing homes. Sociodemographic variables and variables related to mental and physical health, functional dependency and severity of dementia were studied as determinants of levels of care. RESULTS: Eighty-two per cent of the study subjects used one or more types of formal care and 55% were institutionalized. Multivariate analysis yielded age, severity of dementia, somatic disorders, dependency in terms of ADL and martial status as predictors of higher levels of care. Sets of predictors differed across different care levels. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the importance of the social network and the relevance of general medical treatment and an active approach towards decreasing the impact of ADL dependency in demented subjects.",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,1997 Nov,England,1997,90
9422828,Toward an integrated framework for understanding child physical abuse.,"OBJECTIVES: The article constructed an integrated conceptual framework for understanding child physical abuse based on a content analysis of different theories. Three major determinants of physical abuse were identified: exposure to aggression, exposure to stressors, and access to resources. To test the framework, we included variables from all three major categories in the analyses. METHODOLOGY: Data from a case-comparison study that included 81 physically abusive and 148 nonabusive mothers was used. Logistic regression determined the relative importance of the predictors. RESULTS: The probability of child physical abuse varied in the expected direction with the number of emotional resources received (listening, help with decision-making, companionship), the number of stressors experienced, and the mothers exposure to physical abuse by their own mothers, current partners, and former partners. The estimation results showed that exposure to aggression in one's own childhood (abused by one's own mother) and exposure to domestic violence in one's adult life (abused by one's previous and current partners) were the most potent factors for predicting whether a mother physically abused her child. CONCLUSION: The results suggest further research on the interdependencies between domestic violence and child physical abuse.",Child abuse & neglect,1997 Nov,England,1997,90

That dominance may soon be brought to an end by the progress of neuroscience, which offers more direct ways of studying the mechanisms in question. At that point functional issues may move to centre stage. Those issues include the act of remembering and its social functions, the skills and presuppositions of the remembered, the interaction of those skills and presuppositions with the particular material being remembered, and the determinants of accuracy and confabulation in recall.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

9415858,Determinants of psychological distress and its course in the first year after diagnosis in rheumatoid arthritis patients.,"In order to examine determinants of psychological distress and its course in the first year after diagnosis in rheumatoid arthritis patients, self-report data and clinical and laboratory measures were collected in 91 patients (70% female, mean age 57 years) shortly after diagnosis and 1 year later. Multiple regression analysis indicated that sex, pain and functional status, disease impact on daily life, life events, and perceived social support were related to psychological distress (anxiety and depressed mood) shortly after diagnosis. Coping strategies were related to distress levels only 1 year later. Multiple regression analysis of change in anxiety and depressed mood revealed that a decrease of psychological distress after 1 year could be predicted by male sex, an initially less severe inflammatory activity and an initially more extended social network. In addition, a decrease in distress was related to parallel improvements in clinical status. Results indicate the importance of a multimodal assessment of demographic variables, clinical and life stressors and social resources for the understanding of distress and the identification of risk factors in the first stage of the disease. Personal coping resources appear to become more important predictors of distress in a later phase of the disease.",Journal of behavioral medicine,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90
9415853,Social determinants of experienced anger.,"We investigated two social determinants (i.e., availability of social support and status differentials of the provocateur) for the degree of perceived anger in two populations. Because no suitable tool was available, the conceptual and psychometric development and validation of a new vignette-based measure for anger level (STandardized Experience of Anger Measure, STEAM) is described first. Two versions of STEAM were developed: one for students and one for community-living adults. Through a series of four studies, two sets of a 12-item vignette-based questionnaire were developed and validated. The resulting test had excellent test-retest stability and high internal consistency. Using the new STEAM measure, a variety of analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized influence of social determinants of anger. In the student sample, presence of social support was associated with lessened anger, and in both samples decreasing status of the provocateur also led to lessened anger arousal. In addition, findings in both samples revealed that social support reduced anger when the provocateur was of higher status relative to situations of equal and lesser status. In the community sample, the availability of support was associated with greater intensity of the anger experience in the lesser status condition than in the equal or greater status condition. No gender main effects or interactions were noted.",Journal of behavioral medicine,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90
24441555,Violence in the Swedish school environment: extent of the problem and its manifestations.,"The current importance of school violence due to its recent increase, and also its association with school-specific psychosocial and physical environmental problems were considered as part of a recent survey of Swedish public-sector schools. The responses of the principals of a representative sample of schools (68.4% response rate) revealed that, for the school year 1995-1996, violence was a problem regarded as 'moderate' or 'large' in 15% of schools, 'small' in 62%, and as 'non-significant' in 20%. There has been a non-uniform trend in perceptions of violence across types of schools and municipalities since 1990. Schools where violence has been a problem for some time were more likely to express dissatisfaction with the psychosocial and physical environment of the school, and to emphasize individual and adult-supervision factors as injury determinants. Prevention of intentional injuries requires a variety of interventions, adapted according to factors associated with the problem at local level.","Work (Reading, Mass.)",1998,Netherlands,1998,90
24441483,The physical and psychosocial environments in Swedish schools: quality aspects and relations to pupil-injury determinants as perceived by school principals.,"The study investigated relations between the quality of the physical and psychosocial environments in Swedish schools and pupil-injury determinants as perceived by school principals. Data came from a representative sample of public-sector Swedish schools. Schools were divided into four classes on the basis of the types and magnitudes of environmental problems they experienced. Associations between problems and type of school, type of district, and degree of importance attributed to various pupil-injury determinants were measured. Two schools in three were classified as having no environmental problems, and one in 20 as having both types. Significant associations were found between type of problem (environmental load), type of district and perceptions of some injury-inducing factors. Improvements to the school environment may benefit pupils' education and development as well as their safety and well-being. The study provides an aid for the setting of priorities in these respects.","Work (Reading, Mass.)",1998,Netherlands,1998,90
9415002,Dietary determinants of ischaemic heart disease in health conscious individuals.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate dietary determinants of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in health conscious individuals to explain the reduced risk in vegetarians, and to examine the relation between IHD and body mass index (BMI) within the normal range. DESIGN: Prospective observation of vegetarians, semi-vegetarians, and meat eaters for whom baseline dietary data, reported weight and height information, social class, and smoking habits were recorded. SUBJECTS: 10,802 men and women in the UK aged between 16 and 79, mean duration of follow up 13.3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Death rate rations for IHD and total mortality in relation to dietary and other characteristics recorded at recruitment (reference category death rate = 100). RESULTS: IHD mortality was less than half that expected from the experience reported for all of England and Wales. An increase in mortality for IHD was observed with increasing intakes of total and saturated animal fat and dietary cholesterol-death rate ratios in the third tertile compared with the first tertile: 329, 95% confidence interval (CI) 150 to 721; 277, 95% CI 125 to 613; 353, 95% CI 157 to 796, respectively. No protective effects were observed for dietary fibre, fish or alcohol. Within the study, death rate ratios were increased among those in the upper half of the normal BMI range (22.5 to < 25) and those who were overweight (BMI > or = 25) compared with those with BMI 20 to < 22.5. CONCLUSIONS: In these relatively health conscious individuals the deleterious effects of saturated animal fat and dietary cholesterol appear to be more important in the aetiology of IHD than the protective effect of dietary fibre. Reduced intakes of saturated animal fat and cholesterol may explain the lower rates of IHD among vegetarians compared with meat eaters. Increasing BMI within the normal range is associated with increased risk of IHD. The results have important public health implications.",Heart (British Cardiac Society),1997 Nov,England,1997,90
9414976,Do patients with irritable bowel syndrome in primary care really differ from outpatients with irritable bowel syndrome?,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the comparability of outpatients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and patients with IBS in primary care with regard to severity of complaints, perceived limitations, other aspects of the complaints, and sex differences. AIMS: To compare outpatients with IBS with primary care patients with IBS. PATIENTS: One hundred and nine patients with IBS were recruited from general practices in Amsterdam and 86 patients with IBS were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Internal Medicine of the University Hospital in Nijmegen. METHODS: Each patient completed a questionnaire on demographic variables, abdominal complaints, related complaints, and attributed causes of their abdominal complaints. The scores of the two groups were compared by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The outpatient group contained significantly more men, reported more severe abdominal pain, more frequent complaints, more interference with daily activities, and a higher degree of avoidance of activities (p < 0.01) than the primary care group. When each sex was analysed separately, these differences remained for female (p < 0.01) but not for male patients. Outpatients were more likely to attribute their complaints to somatic causes (p < 0.01), whereas primary care patients were more likely to attribute their complaints to stress (p < 0.01) or their agitated way of life (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that a high severity score, a large number of additional complaints, and a low score on the stress attribution were important determinants for being in the outpatient group. CONCLUSIONS: Female outpatients consider their complaints to be more serious and interfering than do patients with IBS in primary care. Male outpatients were comparable to primary care patients with IBS. More research needs to be done into sex specific differences in IBS and into the factors that influence the decision to refer a patient with IBS.",Gut,1997 Nov,England,1997,90
9408740,Determinants of general practice utilization in Denmark.,"The study was undertaken to identify determinants of health services' utilization related to organizational characteristics of the health services, social characteristics of the community, and health and socio-demographic characteristics of the population. We used a follow-up design involving a time dimension of 12 months. A cohort of 3000 50-year old males and females were randomly selected from an urban county near Copenhagen and a rural county in Western Jutland and 65% agreed to participate. Data were collected through: 1) mailed questionnaires to the participants every three months, 2) a mailed questionnaire to all general practitioners in the counties, and 3) the Health Insurance Register. Data were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Utilization of health services was found to be strongly associated with gender and health characteristics, especially with respect to functional status and chronic diseases. Health service characteristics, demographic and psycho-social factors had very little impact on utilization patterns. The utilization of publicly financed health services was found to be determined by health needs rather than by social, psychological and organizational factors, indicating geographical and social equity in the access to the Danish health services.",Danish medical bulletin,1997 Nov,Denmark,1997,90
9408702,Results of a pilot study of the time to azoospermia after vasectomy in Mexico City.,"In a joint pilot study by Family Health International (FHI), AVSC International, and the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), information was gathered on the determinants of azoospermia following vasectomy on 38 healthy men who chose vasectomy for contraception. The time and number of ejaculations associated with loss of sperm motility and loss of sperm eosin vital staining were also evaluated. ""Azoospermia"" was defined on the basis of two consecutive azoospermic semen samples collected at least 3 days apart. The single decrement life table method was used to calculate weekly gross cumulative life table rates for the time to azoospermia, zero motility, and zero viability. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the product-limit estimates of the cumulative rates for the total number of ejaculations to azoospermia, 0% motility and 0% viability. The median time to azoospermia was 10 weeks and at the end of week 20, the life table rate (+/- standard error) was 93.0 (+/- 6.30) weeks/100 men. The median number of ejaculations to azoospermia was between 25 and 30, and the cumulative rate (+/- standard error) at 60 ejaculations reached 94.5 (+/- 5.16)/100 men.",Contraception,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90
9386029,Physical abuse and low birthweight: a case-control study.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether physical abuse of a woman by her partner was associated with low birthweight. DESIGN: A case-control study. SETTING: Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital of Trondheim, Norway. PARTICIPANTS/SAMPLE: Eighty-six women who were delivered of a low birthweight (< 2500 g) infant (cases) and 92 women who were delivered of an infant with birthweight > or = 2500 g (controls). METHODS: An in-depth interview, either postpartum at the maternity ward or one year after delivery. Information about abuse was obtained by direct questioning and a modified version of the Conflict Tactics Scales. RESULTS: A total of 17% of the women had experienced abuse by a partner. While 7% had been abused by their current partner before the index pregnancy only one woman reported abuse during pregnancy. Relatively more mothers of low birthweight infants were abused (20%) compared with controls (15%), but the association was not statistically significant (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.63-2.99). Abused women reported a higher consumption of alcohol and cigarettes in pregnancy compared with nonabused women. CONCLUSION: Abuse was not found to be a risk factor for low birthweight in this study.",British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,1997 Nov,England,1997,90
9383625,Individual risk and social risk as interacting determinants of victimization in the peer group.,"This study evaluated the hypothesis that the behavior problems that place children at risk for victimization by peers are associated with victimization primarily when children are also at social risk for victimization. Social risk was defined as lacking supportive friends or as being rejected by the peer group. Participants were 229 boys and girls in the 3rd through 7th grades (M age = 11 years 2 months). As predicted, behavior problems (internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and physical weakness) were more strongly related to victimization when children had few friends, had friends who were incapable of fulfilling a protective function (e.g., were physically weak), or were rejected by peers than when children had more friends, had friends capable of defending them, or were better liked by peers. Results illustrate the principle that individual risk variables depend on social context for expression.",Developmental psychology,1997 Nov,United States,1997,90
9406264,Disruptive behavior and the determinants of costs in the public mental health system.,"Efforts to increase the cost-effectiveness of public mental health systems are hindered by inadequate information about the determinants of use and cost. This paper reviews empirical research and theory suggesting that costs in the public health system are affected more by the disruptive behavior of persons with severe mental illness than by their age, sex, race, and diagnosis, which have been the focus of most economic studies. The author proposes modifications of traditional theories of health service use to explicitly account for the role of disruptive behavior in determining public mental health system costs. He describes a help-seeking pathway in the public mental health system in which the decision to seek treatment is initiated not by the mentally ill person but by others affected by the person's disruptive behavior. This ""other-determined"" pathway into treatment is contrasted with the self-determined pathway in which an individual with distressing symptoms makes a rational choice to seek help. Empirical research consistent with the other-determined perspective will help target clinical interventions and system reforms to the factors responsible for high-cost mental health care and will improve the ability to predict resource use from observable clinical characteristics of consumers.","Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)",1997 Dec,United States,1997,90
9403607,Population versus clinical view of case fatality from acute coronary heart disease: results from the WHO MONICA Project 1985-1990. Multinational MONItoring of Trends and Determinants in CArdiovascular Disease.,"BACKGROUND: The clinical view of case fatality (CF) from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in those reaching the hospital alive is different from the population view. Registration of both hospitalized AMI cases and out-of-hospital coronary heart disease (CHD) deaths in the WHO MONICA Project allows both views to be reconciled. The WHO MONICA Project provides the largest data set worldwide to explore the relationship between CHD CF and age, sex, coronary event rate, and first versus recurrent event. METHODS AND RESULTS: All 79,669 events of definite AMI or possible coronary death, occurring from 1985 to 90 among 5,725,762 people, 35 to 64 years of age, in 29 MONICA populations are the basis for CF calculations. Age-adjusted CF (percentage of CHD events that were fatal) was calculated across populations, stratified for different time periods, and related to age, sex, and CHD event rate. Median 28-day population CF was 49% (range, 35% to 60%) in men and 51% (range, 34% to 70%) in women and was particularly higher in women than men in populations in which CHD event rates were low. Median 28-day CF for hospitalized events was much lower: in men 22% (range, 15% to 36%) and in women 27% (range, 19% to 46%). Among hospitalized events CF was twice as high for recurrent as for first events. CONCLUSIONS: Overall 28-day CF is halved for hospitalized events compared with all events and again nearly halved for hospitalized 24-hour survivors. Because approximately two thirds of 28-day CHD deaths in men and women occurred before reaching the hospital, opportunities for reducing CF through improved care in the acute event are limited. Major emphasis should be on primary and secondary prevention.",Circulation,1997 Dec 2,United States,1997,90
9400911,Epidemiological study of hypertension and its determinants in an urban population of North India.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine age-specific prevalence of hypertension and blood pressure (BP) levels in relation to diet and lifestyle factors in North Indians. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional survey in 20 randomly selected streets in Moradabad, North India. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 1806 subjects from North India (904 males and 902 females) age range 25-64 years. The survey methods were as follows: dietary diaries for 7 days food intake record; BP measurements; physician administered questionnaire and anthropometric measurements. Diagnosis of hypertension was based on new World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension (WHO/ISH) criteria. Risk factors were assessed based on WHO guidelines. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension according to WHO/ISH criteria was 23.7% and by old WHO criteria 13.3%. In the WHO/ISH hypertensive group, isolated diastolic hypertension was present in 47.3% males and 40.6% females. Males have a slightly higher prevalence than females in the young age group, however, the prevalence rates are comparable in the older age groups. In both sexes, the prevalence rates and BP level increased with older age. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, higher body mass index, central obesity and higher socioeconomic status were independently and strongly associated with hypertension in both sexes. Higher dietary fat and salt intake and lower physical activity were weakly but significantly associated with hypertension. CONCLUSION: Association of higher socioeconmic status, higher body mass index and central obesity in North Indian adults with higher fat intake, lower physical activity and higher prevalence and level of hypertension indicate that these populations may benefit by decreasing the dietary fat intake and increasing physical activity, with an aim to decrease central obesity for decreasing hypertension in North Indians.",Journal of human hypertension,1997 Oct,England,1997,90
9394205,Patient satisfaction with emergency house calls.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify determinants of patient satisfaction with emergency house calls and to assess the properties of a satisfaction measurement questionnaire. DESIGN: Patient survey, combined with routinely collected information on the circumstances of the house call. SETTING: Emergency house calls provided by an independent emergency care organization (ECO) in Geneva, Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive sample of 389 patients (67% response rate). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Patient satisfaction. PREDICTOR VARIABLES: patient age and sex, type of medical problem, time of visit, waiting time, duration of visit, perceived effectiveness of treatment. RESULTS: The satisfaction questionnaire was easy to administer. Factor analysis identified 3 separate dimensions of satisfaction, which pertained to the visit itself, to access and to general attitude toward the ECO. Validation tests were consistent with expectations. In multivariate analysis, older patient age and greater perceived treatment effectiveness predicted independently all satisfaction scales. Presence of a mixed physical and mental problem reduced satisfaction with the visit itself only, a delay between the phone call and the visit exceeding one hour reduced satisfaction with access and worsened the attitude toward the ECO. CONCLUSION: The instrument used to measure patient satisfaction with emergency house calls performed well. Overall levels of satisfaction were high. Perceived effectiveness of treatment was the strongest correlate of patient satisfaction. Monitoring of patient satisfaction in emergency settings may contribute to improvements of quality of care.",International journal for quality in health care : journal of the International Society for Quality in Health Care,1997 Oct,England,1997,90
9391926,Risk and protective factors as predictors of adolescent alcohol involvement and transitions in alcohol use: a prospective analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Determinants of initial alcohol use may differ from predictors of accelerated or problematic consumption. Social influences may be strong predictors of initial drinking; however, later stages of problem drinking may be linked developmentally to intrapersonal deficits. This study prospectively examined the influence of chronic and changing risk and protective status in predicting adolescent alcohol involvement and transitions in alcohol use. METHOD: Data were obtained from a three-wave cohort (N = 823) of 8th-10th grade nonintervention students participating in a school-based drug abuse prevention trial. Cognitive, attitudinal and social influence measures were dichotomized using empirical cut-offs to designate risk or protective status. Using a conceptually based assignment scheme, additive risk indices were created assessing chronic (averaging across time) and changing features of competence, psychological and interpersonal functioning, cognitive-affective and social influences. Three chronic and change protective indices were created tapping competence, psychological, and interpersonal functioning. RESULTS: Controlling for initial drinking and gender, chronic risk for social influence and psychological functioning and increased risk for social influences and competency predicted subsequent drinking behavior. Chronic psychological protection attenuated subsequent drinking. Using categorical measures of drinking behavior to designate nonuse, experimental or moderate-heavy use, chronic social influence and competency risk were associated with an increased likelihood of accelerated drinking, whereas improved psychological functioning diminished the likelihood of increased drinking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the need for implementing prevention strategies that reinforce developmentally appropriate skills and enhance personal competence and psychological functioning as effective barriers against initial and more problematic alcohol use. The unique contribution of protective forces also underscores that risk reduction and protection enhancement are complementary processes and are both required to offset social influences for alcohol consumption.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1997 Nov,United States,1997,90
9391511,Maternal nutrition and socio-economic status as determinants of birthweight in chronically malnourished African women.,"The birthweight is the most important determinant of mortality and morbidity in the neonatal period and may have an influence on health in adult life. The high rate of low birthweight in developing countries is therefore a major health problem. Maternal malnutrition is usually assumed to be a causal factor but other environmental factors are also involved. In this study we analysed maternal nutritional and socio-economic factors as determinants of birthweight in term infants from a rural African society characterised by a high rate of chronic malnutrition. Relations of maternal weight, gestational weight gain, parity, socio-economic status and infant sex with birthweight were analysed in 1,477 women and child pairs. The selected women were followed from early pregnancy and had an uncomplicated delivery at term of a living singleton child. The gestational weight gain was 5.6 (SD 6.0) kg and the mean birthweight 2.933 kg (SD 408). Maternal weight, representing the maternal long-term nutritional situation, was the most important independent determinant of birthweight, accounting for 13.0% of the variance in birthweight. The weight gain, representing the short-term nutritional situation, explained only 5.6% of the variance. Birthweight increased by 20 g (CI 18-23) for each kg maternal weight and by 15 g (CI 12-18) for each kg gestational weight gained. The socio-economic difference in birth-weight was 153 g (CI 109-196) 88 of which (CI 48-128) remained unexplained after adjustment for differences in maternal weight, parity and gender. Improved long-term nutritional situation and living conditions seems to be the most important prerequisites to counteract low birthweight in developing countries.",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,1997 Nov,England,1997,90
10185693,Elective admission policies in New South Wales public hospitals.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the existence and content of elective admission policies in New South Wales acute public hospitals. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to managers of all acute public hospitals (n = 76). Copies of elective admission policies were sought from respondents. Results were analysed with EpiInfo 5.01b and policy content by thematic analysis. RESULTS: Survey response was 91% (69/76). Policies existed in 71% (49/69) of hospitals. Of these, 96% (47/49) disseminated their policy, with 23% (11/47) disseminating it at least annually, 41% (19/47) only when updated, and 32% (15/47) infrequently, with one policy being new (2%) and one hospital not stating its frequency (2%). Policy compliance was assessed in 86% (42/49) of hospitals and guidelines reviewed periodically in 92% (45/49) of hospitals. Twenty per cent (10/49) of the policies had been developed since a departmental instruction of May 1994. Of the 20 acute hospitals with no policy, 75% (15/20) were rural and 85% (17/20) thought they should have a policy. Analysis of policy content revealed emphases on resource availability and clinical need as determinants of elective admission, an institutional rather than a patient focus, and a high level of senior nurse manager involvement in admission decisions in rural hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a specific departmental instruction, nearly one-third of hospitals still had no admission policy 18 months later. This could be indicative of miscommunication between hospitals and NSW Health or perceived irrelevance of department guidelines by hospital managers. Existing policies were mostly institutionally focused and dominated by perceived resource limitations. NSW Health might consider other medico-social factors and manager involvement in future policy development.",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,1998,Australia,1998,90
10174382,Causal pathways to infant mortality: linking social variables to infant mortality through intermediate variables.,"Using a conceptual model that integrates social and biomedical models of causation, this paper delineates the pathways through which social factors ultimately influence infant mortality in the African-American community. Two social factors, maternal education and marital status, are shown to influence the risk of infant death through the following intermediate variables: bio-demographic (maternal age, birth order, birth interval and outcome of last pregnancy), health care (prenatal care utilization) and proximate infant health status at birth (preterm delivery and low birth weight). While the impact of maternal education is largely explained by the intermediate variables, marital status remains a significant, albeit a weak, predictor net of all other variables.",Journal of health & social policy,1998,United States,1998,90
9389609,The conceptual framework of the PMM Network.,"Understanding the determinants of maternal mortality is a complex task, in part because maternal deaths are influenced by many different categories of events or conditions. Biology, economics, culture, demography and the distribution and effectiveness of health services all contribute. Conceptual frameworks have made important contributions to our understanding of the determinants of other, equally complex events, such as fertility and child survival. Also referred to as 'proximate determinants frameworks', such models are useful because they identify the specific mechanisms through which social, economic and cultural factors lead to the event of interest. Our model identifies the precise sequence of events that lead to maternal death (pregnancy, complication and death) and specifies categories of intermediate factors and distant factors that directly affect one or more of these events. When the world literature on maternal mortality was analyzed in light of the causal pathways laid out in the conceptual framework, it became clear that some pathways are more amenable to intervention and change than others. Implications for strategies, programs and monitoring and evaluation are discussed.",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,1997 Nov,United States,1997,90
9386919,Genealogical and demographic influences on infant abuse and neglect in group-living sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys).,"This study investigated the occurrence of infant abuse and neglect in a large population of group-living mangabeys over a period of almost 3 decades. The prevalence of infant abuse and neglect did not differ significantly among the 9 families comprising the population, but within some families there was evidence of genealogical effects on infant abuse. Maternal inexperience and infant age were risk factors for neglect but not for abuse. Whereas neglecting mothers neglected only 1 of their offspring, usually their first-born infant, abusive mothers abused several of their offspring, and risk of severe abuse increased with later births. Infant sex was not a risk factor for neglect or abuse. These and other results concur with the findings of a previous investigation of infant abuse and neglect in a different primate species in indicating that neglect and abuse are different phenomena and in emphasizing genealogical influences on infant abuse in primates. The investigation of biological, experiential, and social determinants of the spontaneous occurrence of infant abuse and neglect in relatively undisturbed primate populations could significantly enhance our understanding of the etiology of child abuse and neglect in humans.",Developmental psychobiology,1997 Nov,United States,1997,90

Consistent with common observations, fan-club respondents were mostly females. Significant differences were found between the two samples. Logistic regression analysis showed that being a fan-club member was associated with poor self-esteem and strong fear of negative evaluation, while the bias toward females in the fan-club sample could be attributed to the effects of these two variables.",Adolescence,1997 Fall,United States,1997,90
9358295,Predictors of reported condom use in central Harlem youth as conceptualized by the health belief model.,"PURPOSE: To examine the relationship of reported condom use to specific sociodemographics, psychosocial variables, and perceptions of and motivations for condom use as conceptualized by the Health Belief Model. METHODS: This study performed a cross-sectional survey of 557 adolescents enrolled in a hospital-based pregnancy prevention program in an urban community hospital (Harlem Hospital). Multiple logistic regression analysis examined the combined relationship of the significant psychosocial variables to consistent condom use. RESULTS: Males were less likely than females to report teen-parent conflict and depression and more likely to report support for birth control, participation in community activities, and favorable attitudes toward delaying parenthood. Consistent with the Health Belief Model adjusting for age, the strongest predictors of consistent condom use were partner preference for condoms, perceived benefit of avoidance of pregnancy, male gender, and support for birth control (usually by a parent). CONCLUSIONS: The data on this urban, predominantly African-American sample of adolescents suggest the importance of the influences on specific motivations to use protection--that is, the wish to avoid pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and sexually transmitted diseases, although the mechanisms are still unclear. In addition, gender and the modifying effects of parental and partner support of the use of protection strongly influence the reported use of condoms by adolescents. These factors (in addition to psychosocial factors such as depression) may be important in planning interventions to increase condom use by sexually active teens.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1997 Nov,United States,1997,90
9352729,Determinants of nocturnal enuresis in England and Scotland in the '90s.,"The aim of this study was to assess whether changes have occurred in the determinants of nocturnal enuresis in Scotland and England in comparison with previous studies. The study was based on 22 study areas from a representative English sample, 14 areas from a representative Scottish sample, and 20 areas from an English inner-city sample. A total of 14,674 subjects was included in the analysis from 16,835 eligible children in the age range 5 to 11 years. For the main analysis, an enuretic child was one who wet the bed at least once a week. As expected, the frequency of enuresis was higher in boys and decreased markedly with age in both sexes. Bedwetting was more frequent in: Afro-Caribbean children compared with white children in the representative samples (OR 1.72 95% CI 1.22 to 2.42); those whose mothers smoked at least 10 cigarettes at home compared with non-smokers (OR 1.58 95% CI 1.26 to 1.98); children who had disturbed sleep compared with those who slept well (OR 1.96 95% CI 1.53 to 2.51); those with mothers aged less than 20 years at the child's birth compared with mothers in the age range 25 to 34 (OR 1.63 95% CI 1.20 to 2.22); and in the second- or third-born in the family in comparison with the first-born (OR 1.42 95% CI 1.17 to 1.72). Father's social class was associated with enuresis only in girls. Only 50% of the parents consulted a doctor for enuresis in their child. The percentage was even lower in Afro-Caribbean families (33%). Enuresis continues to be a highly prevalent problem and has not decreased over the last 45 years. We confirm that environmental factors are still important in the aetiology of enuresis. It is surprising that despite the availability of effective treatment only half of parents consult a doctor about the problem.",Developmental medicine and child neurology,1997 Oct,England,1997,90
9329480,Determinants of functional status in healthy Italian nonagenarians and centenarians: a comprehensive functional assessment by the instruments of geriatric practice.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the physical ability and psychocognitive status of a population more than 90 years of age with regard to sociodemographic, behavioral, and biomedical variables known to affect functional status in old age. DESIGN: A survey design was used. SETTING: Emilia Romagna, Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four healthy community-dwelling subjects aged 90 to 106 years. MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic variables, health behavior, anthropometric indices, and serum DHEAS levels were recorded. Functional assessment was performed by instruments currently used in geriatric practice: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: GDS scores correlated directly with MMSE scores and inversely with ADL severity scores. Poor education, institutionalization, sensory impairment, muscular mass loss, and lower DHEAS levels were the variables with the highest correlation to functional impairment. Smoking, alcohol consumption, and marital status were relatively unimportant. An inverse association was found between DHEAS levels and dependency scores of single ADLs (continence, mobility). CONCLUSION: Impaired cognitive and physical ability with no increase in depression prevalence was found in a sample of subjects more than 90 years of age free of major age-related disease. Muscular mass and DHEAS levels seem to play a role in maintaining physical independence. In turn, physical independence, as well as social and cultural factors, strongly affect the compliance of long-lived subjects with psychocognitive tests currently used in the clinical evaluation of younger old people, suggesting that these instruments are not reliable for screening for cognitive impairment and depression in the oldest old subjects.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90
9329421,Human development index as a predictor of infant and maternal mortality rates.,"OBJECTIVE: The United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite index of life expectancy, literacy, and per capita gross domestic product that measures the socioeconomic development of a country. We estimated infant and maternal mortality rates in the world and assessed how well the HDI and its individual components predicted infant and maternal mortality rates for individual countries. MATERIALS: Data on mortality rates and values for HDI components were obtained from the United Nations and the World Bank. RESULTS: For the 1987 to 1990 period, approximately 9 million infant deaths and 349,000 maternal deaths occurred in the world annually, yielding global infant and maternal mortality rates of 67 per 1000 and 250 per 100,000 live births, respectively. HDI is a powerful predictor of both infant and maternal mortality rates. It accounts for 85% to 92% of the variation in infant mortality rates, and 82% to 85% of the variation in maternal mortality rates among countries. Each component of HDI is also strongly correlated with both infant and maternal mortality rates (significance of all values for r, p < 0.001), and eliminating life expectancy from HDI does not decrease significantly the predictive power of HDI for infant or maternal mortality rates. CONCLUSION: HDI is not only a useful measure for socioeconomic development, but also a powerful predictor of infant and maternal mortality rates for individual countries.",The Journal of pediatrics,1997 Sep,United States,1997,90
9327590,"Personality, social networks, and perceived social support among alcoholics: a structural equation analysis.","In this study we tested relations among personality characteristics, social network properties, and perceived social support both concurrently and prospectively. A sample of 294 men in treatment at a Department of Veterans Affairs Alcohol Treatment Unit was assessed during treatment and 3 months after discharge. Results of the cross-sectional structural equation analyses indicated that the personality characteristics of extraversion and neuroticism were related to both social network properties and perceived social support. Characteristics of the alcoholic's social network were also related to perceived availability of support. Longitudinal analyses of perceived social support after treatment indicated that two social network properties (size of the network and the proportion of confidants) were predictive net of initial levels of social support. Extraversion and neuroticism were found to be indirectly related to perceived social support at Time 2 through their effects on social network properties and perceived social support during treatment. Implications of these findings for models of the nature and determinants of perceived social support are discussed.",Journal of personality,1997 Sep,United States,1997,90
9327484,Determinants of obesity in relation to socioeconomic status among middle-aged Swedish women.,"BACKGROUND: It has been previously demonstrated that obesity is common among women with low socioeconomic status (SES), but the factors accounting for this association are not well known. According to our hypothesis, low SES is associated with psychosocial stress, an unhealthy lifestyle, and reproductive history, which may increase the likelihood of women with low SES to be overweight or obese. METHODS: We examined overweight and obesity in relation to SES among 300 healthy women ages 30-65 years, who constitute the control group of the Stockholm Female Coronary Risk Study, a population-based case-control study of women with coronary heart disease. This control group was compared with a large population-based sample and found to be representative of healthy Swedish women ages 30-65 years. We used an aggregate of education and occupation as a measure of SES and defined overweight as body mass index (BMI) between 23.8 and 28.6 kg/m2 and obesity as BMI > 28.6 kg/m2. RESULTS: Low SES was a strong determinant of overweight and obesity among middle-aged healthy Swedish women. The odds of being overweight or obese increased with lower social position. After adjustment for age, the odds ratios for overweight and obesity among women in a low vs high position were 2.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 4.4) and 2.7 (95% CI 1.1 to 6.7), respectively. Both low social position and obesity were related to reproductive history (higher parity and earlier age at menarche), unhealthy dietary habits, and unfavorable psychosocial factors (poor quality of life, low self-esteem, and job strain). These factors together explained 53% of the low-SES-obesity association. CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive history, unhealthy dietary habits, and psychosocial stress accounted for a large part of the association between low SES and obesity. Dietary habits and psychosocial stress are potentially modifiable factors, which should be taken into account in intervention programs among women with low SES.",Preventive medicine,1997 Sep-Oct,United States,1997,90
9311952,Vitamin B-12 deficiency is very prevalent in lactating Guatemalan women and their infants at three months postpartum.,"Vitamin B-12 status was evaluated in 113 Guatemalan women and their infants at 3 mo of lactation. Plasma vitamin B-12 was deficient or low in 46.7% of the mothers, and holotranscobalamin II (holo TC II) concentrations were low in 32.3%, which may indicate vitamin B-12 malabsorption. Only 9% had deficient or low plasma folate. Breast milk vitamin B-12 was low in 31%, and negatively correlated with infant urinary methylmalonic acid (UMMA, r = -0.22, P < 0.05, n = 88); UMMA was elevated in 12.2% of the infants, indicating vitamin B-12 deficiency. Mothers of the infants with elevated UMMA had significantly lower concentrations of vitamin B-12 in their breast milk compared with mothers of infants with normal UMMA concentrations (410.7 +/- 247.7 vs. 705.3 +/- 487.5 pmol/L, P = 0.05, n = 87). Mean maternal dietary intake of vitamin B-12 was significantly correlated with plasma vitamin B-12 (r = 0.20, P = 0. 05, n = 94) and was the main determinant of plasma vitamin B-12 in a linear regression model. Determinants of maternal holo TC II concentrations included dietary intake of vitamin B-12 and Giardia lamblia infection. There were no statistically significant determinants of infant UMMA concentrations. We conclude that vitamin B-12 deficiency is highly prevalent in these lactating women and is associated with depletion of the vitamin in their infants. The cause of the maternal deficiency is unknown, but malabsorption exacerbated by low dietary intake of the vitamin is a possibility.",The Journal of nutrition,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90

9308380,Health knowledge of children in Bangladesh: an exploratory study.,"This article explores the relationship between selected socio-economic factors and health knowledge of children in Bangladesh. Data was generated from a representative sample survey of 2520 children aged 11-12 y and resident throughout the country. A total of six health knowledge items, all of which are very relevant to Bangladesh, were assessed in this study. Both bivariate and multivariate analysis were used for this purpose. Analysis revealed that the urban/rural residence of the child, the length of the child's schooling in years, the parental level of education and the economic status of the household was associated with the level of health knowledge of the children. To achieve the required improvement in health knowledge of Bangladeshi children this study concluded that adequate schooling of all children must be ensured by removing social barriers to this. Greater educational investment as well as quality education related to everyday life should be provided in rural areas.",Public health,1997 Sep,Netherlands,1997,90
9257397,Quality of life and social production functions: a framework for understanding health effects.,"Quality of life (QofL) has emerged as a new outcome paradigm. It is now the endpoint in various taxonomies of patient outcomes, in which relationships are modeled amongst biological abnormalities, symptom status, functional status, disability, health perceptions and quality of life. Although current models and taxonomies point at important determinants of QofL, they do not provide a heuristic that guides the conceptualization of QofL and the systematic development of an explanatory theory of how ill health affects QofL. General mechanisms linking ill health, behavior, and QofL are lacking. In this paper we propose social production function (SPF) theory as providing such a heuristic, relating the effects of ill health, the activities that patients engage in to maintain QofL, and QofL itself. This theory basically asserts that people produce their own well-being by trying to optimize achievement of universal human goals via six instrumental goals within the environmental and functional limitations they are facing. Three important notions of SPF theory are: (1) the linkages between goals, needs, and well-being; (2) the distinction between universal needs and instrumental goals; and (3) substitution among instrumental goals, activities and endowments according to cost-benefit considerations, whereby costs refer to scarce resources such as functional capacity, time, effort and money. We will argue that SPF theory meaningfully relates the ""biomedical model""-with its focus on pathological processes and biological, physiological and clinical outcomes-to the ""quality of life"" model, with its focus on functioning and well-being. We describe SPF theory and how SPF theory can be used to: (1) operationally define and measure QofL; (2) clarify persistent measurement problems; and (3) develop an explanatory framework of the effects of disease on QofL. In the discussion section, we address the limitations of the SPF approach of QofL and its relationship with personality.",Social science & medicine (1982),1997 Oct,England,1997,90
9378866,"Distress, stress and coping in first-year student nurses.","Levels of affective distress, sources of stress and coping strategies reported by first-year student nurses in Tayside, Scotland, were measured using the General Health Questionnaire (30-item version), the Beck & Srivastava Stress Inventory (BSSI) and a modified 'Ways of Coping Questionnaire'. Screening showed that, around the time of an initial series of hospital placements, 50.5% of students in cohort 1 (n = 109, week 40) and 67.9% of students in cohort 2 (n = 111, week 24) suffered significant affective distress. This exceeds levels reported in published studies of degree nursing students, fourth-year medical students, and the general female population. Distressed students reported the same sources of stress as the non-distressed students, but suffered them more intensely. Many BSSI items were seen as common sources of stress; however, the frequency with which an item was reported to be stressful was not related to whether scores on that item predicted overall distress. In both cohorts, the use of direct coping was associated with lower levels of distress, and with lower total stress scores on the BSSI. The use of fantasy and hostility was associated with high levels of distress and stress, in both groups. This screens of 220 first-year student nurses suggests that there is a problem with student distress around an initial series of general/surgical and psycho-social ward placements. The possible determinants of this distress and complex, and it is unlikely that presenting information alone will be sufficient to reduce this distress.",Journal of advanced nursing,1997 Sep,England,1997,90

While the biomechanics of injury, methods of repair, and general demography of blunt facial trauma are well known, statistical associations between epidemiological factors, incidence, and outcome are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive epidemiological survey of this patient population. To assess factors determining outcome and pattern of injury. DESIGN: Retrospective review of 802 patients admitted with blunt assault facial trauma. Statistical analysis of associations between epidemiological factors, incidence, and outcome with chi 2 test, 2-tailed t test, and Fisher exact test. SETTING: Urban university and county hospital. RESULTS: Statistically significant associations are demonstrated between gender and the context of assault, incidence of armed assault, presence of fracture, and rate of intoxication at injury. Poor prognostic indicators for outcome include use of tobacco and presence of a mandible fracture. Open reduction and internal fixation were found to bear a higher complication rate only in mandible fractures. CONCLUSIONS: While choice of treatment carries a statistically significant association with outcome, social variables, including gender, tobacco use, intoxication, and low socioeconomic status, produce dramatic worsening of both injury incidence and outcome.",Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,1997 Sep,United States,1997,90
9300522,Intra-individual versus extra-individual components of social support.,"BACKGROUND: Most studies of social support appear to assume that it is something that the external environment provides to an individual. However, longitudinal and genetic studies are beginning to question this assumption. The purpose of the present study is to differentiate quantitatively the intra-individual determinants of social support from its extra-individual components. METHODS: The subjects were 103 high school exchange students who were enrolled in a 1-year placement with a host family in various countries of the world. The People In Your Life scale, a reliable and validated self-report measure of perceived social support, was administered before their departure from home, after 6 months of stay in a completely unfamiliar foreign community and 6 months after their return home. Structural equation models were examined that partitioned the intra-individual and extra-individual components of social support, and the best fitting models were selected. RESULTS: Between 24% and 69%, or up to 86% depending on the situation, of the variances of social support measures were stable across situations and considered intra-individual; 31% to 76% of what is measured as social support was of extra-individual origin. Moderately strong correlations were noted between the intra-individual components and the trait extraversion. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of social support, which is usually tacitly understood as something extrinsic to an individual, in fact may not be measures of the external environment only.",Psychological medicine,1997 Sep,England,1997,90
9300116,"The association between birthweight, sociodemographic variables and maternal anthropometry in an urban sample from Dhaka, Bangladesh.","The relationship between birthweight, sociodemographic variables and maternal anthropometry was examined in a sample from an inner urban area of Dhaka, Bangladesh. About 21% of babies were of low birthweight (LBW) using the World Health Organization cut-off of < 2500 g. LBW was more common in younger (< 20 years) and older (> 30 years) mothers, the low-income group and those with little or no education. The mean birthweights of the higher-educated, higher-income group and male children were on average 290, 260 and 120 g, respectively, higher than uneducated, lower-income groups and female children. The best cut-offs for detecting LBW and normal-weight infants was maternal weight of 50 kg (odds ratio = 4.6), maternal arm circumference of 23 cm (odds ratio = 5.0) and body mass index of 20.5 (odds ratio = 6.5). The sensitivity and specificity were best for maternal weight (69% and 68%, respectively). Logistic regression analyses show that mothers' weight at term was the best single predictor of LBW (31%), while maternal weight along with age, educational level and income group correctly predicted just over 35% of LBW. Regression analyses also confirmed that mothers' weight at term was the best predictor of birthweight, with a correlation coefficient of 0.49.",Annals of human biology,1997 Sep-Oct,England,1997,90

Mortality rates by race and birthplace were compared for all causes of death and for specific causes. Although overall death rates for blacks generally exceeded those for whites (1224.8 per 100,000 inhabitants vs. 721.4 for males and 593.7 vs. 393.1 for females), foreign-born blacks had death rates (664.6 for males and 350.2 for females) slightly lower than those for whites. The most striking variation among blacks was among those aged 25 to 64 years. US-born black males were three times as likely (1588.9 vs. 525.2) and US-born black females were more than 2.5 times as likely (673.5 vs. 263.4) to die as were foreign-born blacks. Among US-born blacks AIDS, homicide, and cancer for males and AIDS, heart disease, and cancer for females were the most important determinants of excess deaths, defined as the difference between observed deaths and expected deaths; these causes of death account for about half of the excess deaths for each sex. Among whites natives generally had higher death rates than migrants, but less prominently and consistently so than for blacks. Excess mortality of blacks is largely explained by higher death rates of US-born compared with foreign-born Americans.",Human biology,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90

There is also increasing investment in electronic patient record systems to aid care delivery. Both are intended to benefit the individual, yet neither gives full consideration to the human aspects and values--largely because of the under development of appropriate terms and structures.

10176379,Mothers' management of childhood diseases in Yorubaland: the influence of cultural beliefs.,"Several studies have noted that, besides inadequate availability of health care services in many areas, especially the less developed countries, certain disease-specific and non-disease-specific cultural beliefs may influence people's health seeking behaviour. It has even been noted that health services may be underutilized and several health and child care instructions may be ineffective or ignored in traditional and transitional societies where people's ideas and behavioural patterns conflict with the knowledge being passed to them (Feyisetan and Adeokun 1992; Feyisetan 1992). Feyisetan and Adeokun (1992) argued that non-adoption of modern preventive and curative measures cannot be attributed to poverty alone since the costs of some preventive and curative measures are not exorbitant in several of these societies. Rather, they suggested that the gap between awareness of modern health measures and health seeking behaviour must be sought in the social and cultural determinants of behaviour in such matters as child care and disease management. Earlier studies have noted that children in Nigeria die mainly from malaria, diarrhoea, measles, neonatal tetanus, whooping cough, tuberculosis, and bronchopneumonia (Morley and MacWilliam 1961; Ogunlesi 1961; Morley, Woodland and Martin 1963, 1966; Baxter-Grillo and Leshi 1964; Animashaun 1977; Tomkins 1981). Because these diseases are preventable at low cost to the individual, there is a need to investigate why large percentages of children are still subjected to many episodes of these diseases. In this paper, we examine (1) the mothers' perceptions of the aetiology of the three most cited childhood diseases in our study areas, measles, diarrhoea and fever, and the effect of these perceptions on the mothers' suggested curative measures; and (2) the persistence of the belief in abiku and how this cultural belief can influence mothers' management of childhood diseases. Since, for most mothers, perceptions of the aetiology of the childhood diseases are rooted in cultural beliefs, a brief review of disease-specific cultural beliefs is undertaken. In order to determine the effect of socio-economic factors, the mothers' perceptions of the aetiology of the childhood diseases, their recommended curative measures and the belief in abiku are examined according to selected socio-economic variables.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1997 Oct,Australia,1997,90
10176378,"Does maternal employment augment spending for children's health care? A test from Haryana, India.","Evidence that women's employment and earnings foster increased allocations of household resources to children's well-being have led to advocacy of investment in women's employment as a method for targeting the social benefits of enhanced economic opportunity. Work and associated earnings are hypothesized to empower women, who can then exercise their individual preferences for spending on child well-being as well as influence household spending patterns. This paper presents results from a small detailed household and community study of maternal employment and child health in northern India (one of six studies in a research network), which sought to show that such effects did indeed occur and that they could be linked to work characteristics. Careful analysis of employment and earnings showed that they are multidimensional and highly variable over occupations and seasons. Contrary to expectations, spending on health care for children's illness episodes was negatively associated with maternal employment and earnings variables in econometric analysis. The expected individual effects on women of work and earnings, if they did occur, were not sufficient to alter the general spending pattern. We conclude that the attributes of work as well as the social and cultural environment are important mediators of such effects, suggesting a confluence of 'individual' and 'collective' behavioural determinants meeting in the locus of the household.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1997 Oct,Australia,1997,90
9283935,Female adolescents and onset of sexual intercourse: a theory-based review of research from 1984 to 1994.,"PURPOSE: To review a decade of research on the correlates of early onset of sexual intercourse among female adolescents in the United States, using Social Cognitive Theory as a framework for classification. METHODS: Forty-nine studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 1984 and 1994 were reviewed and their findings coded by two independent coders. RESULTS: Findings indicate that most of the studies emphasized quantitative methodologies, using cross-sectional designs and univariate statistical analyses. Many studies lacked a theoretical framework or conceptual model to guide their investigations. When evaluating empirical findings, 61% of the studies found environmental correlates and 47% found biological factors (e.g., age and pubertal development) to be significantly associated with early initiation of sexual intercourse. CONCLUSION: These findings raise important questions about the quality of research on adolescent sexuality, as well as its relationship to the development of risk-reduction programs which tend to focus mainly on intrapersonal factors (such as attitudes, knowledge, and expectancies.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1997 Sep,United States,1997,90
9270960,"Socioeconomic status, number of siblings, and respiratory infections in early life as determinants of atopy in children.","Asthma and allergic disorders have been on the increase in recent decades, especially among children living in affluent countries; some aspects of the ""Western"" way of life may explain this trend. We evaluated the relation of aeroallergen skin test reactivity with socioeconomic status, number of siblings, and respiratory infections in early life. We examined a total of 2,226 schoolchildren, ages 7-11 years, in three areas of Lazio, Italy. Skin prick tests were performed to assess atopic status, and self-administered questionnaires were completed by the parents. The prevalence of prick test positivity was greater among children whose fathers were in the highest educational level than among those in the lowest [prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-2.06]. There was also a lower prevalence of atopy among larger sibships (PR = 0.38 for subjects with four or more siblings vs those without siblings; 95% CI = 0.14-0.99). A history of bronchitis or bronchiolitis before age 2 years was weakly associated with an increased risk of atopy, whereas a history of pertussis or pneumonia was not. Both the effect of father's education and the influence of larger sibship size remained when we adjusted for several potential confounding factors, including respiratory infections in early life. We infer that higher socioeconomic status and lower sibling number are determinants of atopy in this Italian population. Protection arising from early severe respiratory infections does not explain this association, although we cannot exclude a role for other viral infections.","Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",1997 Sep,United States,1997,90
9255926,Unplanned pregnancies in Harare: what are the social and sexual determinants?,"A hospital-based study was undertaken in Harare, Zimbabwe to estimate the proportion of unplanned or unintended pregnancy among mothers who delivered at the referral hospital and to analyse their socio-demographic pattern and sexual relationships. A case-referent study design was used with systematic sampling of maternity records of mothers who had delivered. Interviews were performed before discharge using a semi-structured questionnaire. Mothers who reported that the index pregnancy was unplanned or unintended constituted the cases, and the referents were those reporting the pregnancy as planned. Out of 923 deliveries, 41% were unplanned and 9% unwanted. The mean age of the mothers was 25 years and women aged 19 or below [Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.5-3.2] and 35 or above (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.7-4.6) were significantly more likely to present with unplanned pregnancy. Nulliparous women (OR = 2.4) and mothers with five or more pregnancies (OR = 8.2) had a significantly increased likelihood of the pregnancy being unplanned. Level of education in the mothers studied had no independent association to planning of pregnancy. Unemployed (OR = 14) and single (OR = 7.8), or divorced/separated/widowed (OR = 5.1) women as well as those with low income (OR = 2.1) and whose partner earned no income (OR = 2.2), were more at risk of unplanned pregnancy. Those living with their own parents despite being pregnant were also more likely to report an unplanned pregnancy. In conclusion, there are documentable social and reproductive factors underlying unwanted pregnancy. Risk factors for unplanned pregnancy form a pattern similar to those for maternal mortality. Thus unplanned pregnancy is a major indicator of the presence of factors known to increase the risk of maternal death. Policy makers and health education should address factors contributing to unplanned pregnancy and its prevention in order to prevent reproductive mortality and morbidity. The presence of those factors associated with unplanned pregnancy at booking or delivery should also alert service providers to the need for appropriate contraceptive counselling as part of post delivery care.",Social science & medicine (1982),1997 Sep,England,1997,90
10173402,Infant mortality due to acute respiratory infections: the influence of primary care processes.,"A population-based case control study was conducted to ascertain whether the process of primary care can be a determinant of infant mortality due to Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). Cases were 118 infants who died from ARI, individually matched with 118 infants who suffered an ARI episode and recovered. Information was gathered through interviewing mothers. Study variables were assembled into five subsets: children's characteristics; mothers' characteristics; access to medical services; process of primary care, and; sociodemographic variables. An index per subset was built to analyze the independent influence of each on ARI death risk. The index was constructed upon the weighted sum of the adjusted odds ratios (OR) within each subset. Then, the values of each index were collapsed into high/low values with the 50 percentile as a cut-off value. Next, by means of a conditional logistic regression procedure, an explanatory model of ARI mortality was obtained. The final multivariate model included the indexes that showed an independent effect: I) Process of care (OR 9.68, CI 95% 3.59-26.1): inadequate referral, attention provided by more than one physician and being attended by a private physician; II) children's characteristics (OR 7.22, CI 95% 2.35-22.2): perinatal history, lack of breast-feeding and incomplete immunization scheme; III) access to medical services (OR 5.27, CI 95% 2.02-13.7): geographic and economic barriers, lack of confidence in public health services, and; IV) mothers' characteristics (OR 4.03, CI 95% 1.18-13.8), mainly represented by untimely care seeking. We conclude that the management of the disease is a key determinant in which factors relating to the mother and the health services are strongly related. Our study reveals untimely care seeking, difficult access and inadequate disease treatment as important factors which deserve careful attention in the future. We also confirm the importance of biological determinants previously described. A main strategy to reduce infant mortality due to ARI should be to encourage training of primary care physicians, including private practitioners, focused on providing effective case management and emphasizing the education to mothers.",Health policy and planning,1997 Sep,England,1997,90
9595772,[Research on social support in health: current status and new challenges].,"On the borderline between sociology and psychology, the concept of social support has made it possible to develop a whole research tradition aimed at explaining some of the differences existing in the distribution of mental and physical disease. The concept of social support itself, however, still presents some ambiguities which must be clarified. These problems are discussed and it is showed and shows that the topic can be enriched with the contribution of the social sciences. Different definitions of the concept itself, are briefly analysed and the complexity and multidimensional character of social support are highlighted. The association between social support and health is discussed. The differences and implications of the direct effect model and the buffering effect model are addressed, and the relevance of the construct of social support is enhanced. The need to study social support not only as a likely determinant of some forms of disease, but also as a dependent variable, is brought out. Some recent developments in the study of factors associated with the availability of social support are discussed. It is shown that social support is a product of certain social factors which can be clearly identified by sociological analysis. In order to illustrate this point, the structural determinants of a specific dimension of social support-attention-are discussed. The importance of structural variables like social class and gender in attempting to explain the differential distribution of certain forms of social support is emphasized. It is proposed, on the theoretical level, that the intersection between two related autonomous constructs-social class and social support-may better explain those aspects of these concepts that are of importance to observed heterogeneity in the distribution of mental and physical health. Different theoretical and methodological approaches to the understanding of the determinants of social support and its effect on health are suggested.",Revista de saude publica,1997 Aug,Brazil,1997,90

9332807,Effect evaluation of an oral health education programme in primary schools in Tanzania.,"This study aimed to assess the clinical oral health outcome effects among schoolchildren participating in a school-based oral health education (OHE) programme. Local social, cultural and environmental conditions were determinants of the school-based OHE programme, which was compiled on the basis of prevailing beliefs and on what teachers and educational authorities considered to be important for the oral health of schoolchildren. Consequently, the practical aspects of oral hygiene and information on the cause and prevention of caries and gingivitis were the components of oral health education. The teachers were prepared to carry out weekly supervised toothbrushing sessions and monthly lessons on aspects of oral health for the school year in grade 4. Eight participating schools were selected for the clinical effect evaluation and four non-participating schools served as the control. In total, 309 children from the participating schools and 122 children from the non-participating schools were available for the evaluation. Their ages varied between 9 and 14 years. The mean plaque score, calculus score and gingival bleeding score at baseline and at follow-up examinations 3, 8, 15 and 36 months later were not significantly different for participating schools and controls. The mean DMFT value at baseline was 0.4 and 3 years later 0.9 in both the participating and control schools. In conclusion, the present study shows that the implemented school-based OHE programme did not result in significant reductions of the clinical parameters measured.",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,1997 Aug,Denmark,1997,90

Moderate obesity was defined as BMI between 85th and 94th percentiles inclusively, and severe obesity as a BMI greater than the 94th percentile. RESULTS: Independent predictors of severe obesity at 5 years were birthweight, female gender, maternal BMI and paternal BMI. Moderate obesity at 5 years was predicted by birthweight, paternal BMI and sleeplessness at 6 months, while small for gestational age (SGA) status and feeding problems at 6 months were protective factors for moderate obesity. Obesity was not associated with problems of language comprehension or behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study suggest that biological rather than psychosocial factors are the major determinants of obesity at 5 years.",Journal of paediatrics and child health,1997 Aug,Australia,1997,90
9279623,Epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection among 4742 randomly selected subjects from Northern Ireland.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread prevalence and serious clinical sequelae of infection with Helicobacter pylori, there have been few large population-based studies, using randomly selected subjects, examining the epidemiology of this infection. AIM: To examine the distribution and determinants of H. pylori infection in a developed country. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Overall 4742 subjects, aged 12-64, from Northern Ireland were randomly selected. METHODS: Helicobacter pylori specific IgG antibodies were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, using an acid-glycine extract antigen, in stored serum from subjects who had participated in three linked population-based surveys of cardiovascular risk factors performed in 1986 and 1987. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of H. pylori infection was 50.5%. Prevalence increased with age from 23.4% in 12-14 year olds to 72.7% in 60-64 year olds: chi 2 for trend 518, P < 10(-4). In subjects aged > or = 25, infection was more common in males (60.9%) than females (55.2%): chi 2 = 9.53, P < 0.01. This relation remained significant after adjusting for age, and measures of socioeconomic class: odds ratio (OR) for infection, male versus female was 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.40). Infection was associated with social class: the adjusted OR of infection in subjects from manual social classes relative to those from non-manual classes was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.47-1.98). Infection was significantly more common in current smokers and ex-smokers than in subjects who had never smoked: adjusted OR for infection, ex-smokers versus never smoked was 1.22 (95% CI: 1.01-1.49); for smokers of > or = 20/day versus never smoked OR = 1.33 (95% CI: 1.05-1.67). Infection was not associated with height in adult males but mean height in infected women was lower than in uninfected women after adjusting for age and socioeconomic status: difference in mean height (SE), -0.85 cm (0.32), P < 0.01. There was no demonstrable relationship between H. pylori infection and current alcohol intake. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a high prevalence of infection in a population from a developed country. Previously reported associations between H. pylori infection, age, sex, social class, and reduced height in females were confirmed and smoking was identified as a possible risk factor for H. pylori infection.",International journal of epidemiology,1997 Aug,England,1997,90

Of those accepted into the program, only 54% participated for at least 6 months. The primary reasons for stopping were the death or institutionalization of the relative, while those not using respite services felt they didn't really need them. Determinants of program use included the poorer cognitive status of the relative and less anxiety and greater burden among the caregivers. After 6 months, users reported fewer hours of informal assistance, less burden, and that the relative had fewer behavioral problems although cognitive status and activities of daily living (ADLs) had deteriorated.",The Gerontologist,1997 Aug,United States,1997,90
9272258,Characteristics of the new long-stay population in an inner Melbourne acute psychiatric hospital.,"OBJECTIVE: There has been an accumulation of so-called 'new long-stay' (NLS) patients in psychiatric hospitals. To date, no Australian studies have characterised this patient group. We aimed to study the demography, and clinical and social functioning of the NLS population at Royal Park Hospital (RPH) together with patients' attitudes to treatment and views on future placement. METHOD: All 30 NLS patients at RPH were identified. Twenty-seven consenting patients were assessed using the following standardised instruments: Manchester Scale for psychopathology, Life Skills Profile (LSP), Physical Health Index and Patient Attitude Questionnaire. Information on past psychiatric history, past treatment and current treatment was collected. Insight and compliance were assessed. RESULTS: The majority of patients were single men with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Forty-one percent were detained in hospital involuntarily and 56% were considered dangerous to themselves or others. The patients were characterised by high levels of positive and negative symptoms. They were most impaired with respect to 'social contact' relative to the other subscales of the LSP. While 10 (48%) patients expressed a desire to leave hospital, only one patient considered that anyone would cohabit with them. Over two-thirds considered they had been unwell and that medication had helped. Staff rated one-third as having major problems with compliance. About two-thirds of patients had disability secondary to comorbid physical illnesses. CONCLUSION: Like other NLS patients studied in the United Kingdom and Ireland, this group had significant handicaps secondary to psychiatric illness, concomitant physical illness and disability and behaviour unacceptable in community settings. They were also characterised by significant social isolation. These factors may be important determinants of rehabilitation failure and need to be addressed in the process of de-institutionalisation as well as in longitudinal studies examining these and other factors predicting NLS status.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,1997 Aug,England,1997,90
9268413,Late adolescent risk-taking: effects of perceived benefits and perceived risks on behavioral intentions and behavioral change.,"To assess the predictive utility of perceived benefits and risks of risk-taking behaviors (RTBs) on behavioral intentions and behavioral change, data were collected from 187 male and female late adolescent college students (ages 17-20). Perceived benefits, perceived risks, behavioral intentions, and involvement for 18 RTBs were assessed at T1 and T2 (3 months later). Factor analyses were performed on T1 involvement data, and six RTB factors emerged: Alcohol RTBs, Illegal Drug RTBs, Stereotypic Male RTBs, Social RTBs, Sex RTBs, and Imprudent RTBs. Regression analyses indicated that perceived benefits accounted for significant variance in behavioral intentions for each of the six factors and Overall RTB; perceived risks accounted for significant variance in behavioral intentions for five of the factors. Similar regression analyses indicated that perceived benefits accounted for significant variance in behavior change (over a 3 month period) for each of the six factors and the Overall RTB score, whereas perceived risks accounted for significant variance for only one factor (Illegal Drug RTBs). The result suggest that, among late adolescents, perceived benefits are better determinants of behavior change for RTBs than are perceived risks. Both perceived benefits and perceived risks, however, are important determinants of behavioral intentions. These findings support previous work identifying adolescents as ""sensation seekers"". Interventions should address perceived benefits of RTB, rather than relying solely on promoting knowledge of the risks. Assessment of adolescent RTB should continue to use multi-item measures to obtain a broad picture of the variety of behaviors commonly endorsed by adolescents.",Journal of adolescence,1997 Aug,England,1997,90
9268254,Determinants of regular source of care among homeless adults in Los Angeles.,"OBJECTIVES: The authors explore the determinants of having a regular source of care in a community-based probability sample of homeless adults in Los Angeles. Results from this study should be more representative than those from previous studies of the homeless that are clinic- or shelter-based. In addition to those factors found to be barriers to regular sources of care in the general population, we hypothesized that psychosocial characteristics of the homeless and the homeless lifestyle would negatively impact their likelihood of having a regular source of care. METHODS: The authors conducted a multiple logistic regression to predict regular source of care among the homeless, using an adaptation of the Behavioral Model of health services utilization as an analytic framework. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of the sample reported that they had a regular source of care. Of those with a source of care, 30% reported a hospital outpatient department; 25% reported a community or homeless clinic; 23% reported a hospital emergency room; 14% reported a government clinic; and 9% reported a private physician's office as their source of care. Some factors found to be barriers to having a regular source of care in the general population (male, Hispanic, young age) also were barriers among homeless adults. Additional barriers in this sample included homelessness-related characteristics such as competing needs, long-term homelessness, and social isolation. Chronic mental illness and chronic substance dependence were not related to having a source of care among the homeless. Characteristics that increased the likelihood of having a regular source of care in the general population (poor health status, Medicaid) were not related to having a regular source of care among the homeless. CONCLUSIONS: In a context of limited resources, the distribution of regular source of care among the homeless appears to be highly inequitable. Although some of the characteristics identifying those with a regular source of care suggest differential patterns of behavior across subgroups, others suggest differential advantage in access to care and a lack of fit between the needs of the homeless and the organization of health services.",Medical care,1997 Aug,United States,1997,90
9250099,Determinants of body composition measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in Dutch children and adolescents.,"Knowledge about body composition is important in metabolic and nutritional studies. In this cross-sectional study the body composition of 403 healthy white Dutch children and adolescents was evaluated by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Possible determinants of body composition were analyzed. In 85 subjects the results of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) were compared with DXA. Fat mass, lean tissue mass, and bone mineral content were greater in older boys and girls. Percentage body fat was greater in older girls but not in boys and it was higher in girls than in boys at all ages. From the age of 14 y boys had higher lean tissue mass and bone mineral content than girls. Tanner stage had a significant relation with body composition in both sexes. Percentage body fat was lower in boys in stage 4 than in stage 3 and was higher in consecutive Tanner stages in girls. After adjustment for age, Tanner stage was significantly positively related to lean tissue mass and bone mineral content in boys and girls and to percentage body fat and fat mass in girls. The profession of the parents and the education of the father had a significant negative correlation with percentage body fat and fat mass in girls (P < 0.01). Physical activity was related to lean tissue mass (P = 0.001) but not to fat mass in boys after adjustment for age. A high correlation and a small difference was found between lean body mass by BIA and lean tissue mass by DXA. Body composition in healthy Dutch children and adolescents is related to age, sex, Tanner stage, socioeconomic status, and physical activity.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1997 Aug,United States,1997,90
9198314,Determinants of breast-feeding patterns in an urban society of India.,"Breast feeding is the focus of rapidly growing interest in many areas of demographic research. However, relatively few rigorous studies on breast-feeding patterns and correlates in contemporary India have been published. This study uses data from a retrospective survey conducted in 1991-1992 to investigate current breast-feeding patterns and to identify the key factors that influence the duration of exclusive breast feeding and infant's age at the time of weaning in an urban Hindu society of the northeast Indian state of Assam. Applying life table procedures and a hazards regression model, we found evidence that the median duration of exclusive breast feeding and infant's age at the time of weaning were negatively associated with mother's education, per capita income, and social status of the household. Those infants who were breast-fed longer at night than in the daytime were also at greater risk of earlier introduction of non-breast-milk foods and of earlier termination of breast feeding than infants who were breast-fed longer during the day. Gender bias toward males in rearing infants prevails in this urban society, and male infants were found to have a significantly lower risk of early weaning than female infants.",Human biology,1997 Aug,United States,1997,90
9263464,Who mixes with whom? A method to determine the contact patterns of adults that may lead to the spread of airborne infections.,"Although mixing patterns are thought to be important determinants of the spread of airborne infectious diseases, to our knowledge, there have been no attempts to directly quantify them for humans. We report on a preliminary study to identify such mixing patterns. A sample of 92 adults were asked to detail the individuals with whom they had conversed over the period of one, randomly assigned, day. Sixty-five (71%) completed the questionnaire, providing their age, the age of their contacts and the social context in which the contacts took place. The data were analysed using multilevel modelling. The study identified, and allowed the quantification of, contact patterns within this sample that may be of epidemiological significance. For example, the degree of assortativeness of mixing with respect to age was dependent not only on the age of participants but the number of contacts made. Estimates of the relative magnitude of contact rates between different social settings were made, with implications for outbreak potential. Simple questionnaire modifications are suggested which would yield information on the structure and dynamics of social networks and the intensity of contacts. Surveys of this nature may enable the quantification of who acquires infection from whom and from where.",Proceedings. Biological sciences,1997 Jul 22,England,1997,90
22013024,Understanding how inequality in the distribution of income affects health.,"Research on the determinants of health has almost exclusively focused on the individual but it seems clear we cannot understand or improve patterns of population health without engaging structural determinants at the societal level. This article traces the development of research on income distribution and health to the most recent epidemiologic studies from the USA that show how income inequality is related to age- adjusted mortality within the 50 States. (r = -0.62, p = 0.0001) even after accounting for absolute levels of income. We discuss potential material, psychological, social and behavioral pathways through which income distribution might be linked to health status. Distributional aspects of the economy are important determinants of health and may well provide one of the most pertinent indicators of overall social well-being.",Journal of health psychology,1997 Jul,England,1997,90

In this paper we consider the effects of race, age, female headship, and college education on the distribution of family income by developing a multivariate methodology that allows us to gauge the influence of one factor while holding other determinants of family incomes constant. Over the period studied we find that race had only a minor effect on the overall size distribution of income. Age had a somewhat greater effect than race. In contrast, the impact of female heads and college education were quite substantial. The multivariate estimates reveal that the effects of female heads and college education both increase the Gini to a much greater extent than the progressivity of federal income taxes decreases it. The effects of college education and female headed families on inequality have grown larger across time, while the influence of age has declined. We find that the effects of race on inequality have changed little over the 1976 to 1989 period.""",Southern economic journal,1997 Jul,United States,1997,90

Theoretical references used to approach the food experience are the concepts of social representation and habitus. The methodology consisted of a qualitative analysis of interviews with 21 administrative employees and field observations made at commercial establishments in downtown Sao Paulo, such as snack bars and restaurants. Study of eating behavior and practices was developed along two planes: food actually eaten and food desired. Results were classified into three segments: ""ingesting and digesting affection"", ""determinants of social representations of eating practices"", and ""rituals in eating practices"". Due to their origin in a domestic universe, symbolic aspects associated with food have a strong affective matrix. Concrete conditions of the urban environment associated with the subject's financial limits establish a structure of values and feelings compatible with the subject's possibilities.

9881141,The impact of social status and migration on female age at marriage in an historical population in north-west Germany.,"It has been suggested that parish-based reconstitution studies may underestimate the true age at marriage because they do not normally include data for emigrants who may be expected to behave differently from individuals who remain in their natal parishes. This study uses data from C18-19th parish registers of north-west Germany to estimate the difference in age at marriage between leavers and stayers. The difference is not significant for males; although that for females is significant, it is small and the consequence of failing to include migrants is likely to be negligible for most studies. However, it is shown that there is also an independent effect on age at marriage that is due to the woman's natal social (economic) status; historical demographic studies that ignore this dimension may risk confounding two different effects.",Journal of biosocial science,1997 Jul,England,1997,90

9488839,The social contract challenge in medical education.,"Medical education has been criticized for loss of touch with the health needs of society. A social contract implies that medical schools, their students and teaching staff have certain rights and privileges in return for serving society. Commitment to this important reciprocal relationship makes it necessary to ensure that medical students gain understanding of the basic health needs of the communities they will serve. Health, Illness and the Community (HIC) is a mandatory course in the first and second years of the curriculum at the University of Toronto. Its goal is to provide students with community learning experiences by involving over 300 community agencies as learning sites. The course takes place one half-day per week throughout first and second year. All 177 students initially work with patients in their homes and in public health units and related agencies. Students are then assigned to agencies using health determinants and health promotion strategies. In the second year, each student selects an agency in the community, and carries out for the entire year a major project focused on the interaction of a health problem with a social issue. This educational initiative has been received well by community agencies and patients. Teaching staff have been enthusiastic and students have performed very well. A major obstacle has been the negative attitudes of some students to community-based learning, but these appear to be improving with time. Involving multiple agencies as learning sites is a feasible method for enabling students to learn about community health needs.",Medical education,1997 Jul,England,1997,90

To assess these potential impacts, there is a need to broaden the scope of health impact assessment. Eco-epidemiology is emerging as a response to this need. Eco-epidemiology entails a shift in focus: from direct (toxicological) to indirect (ecological) mechanisms; and from effects occurring at 'human' temporal and geographical scales to those at regional and geophysical scales. We discuss the potential health impacts of climate change on each scale. At the global scale, interactions and feedbacks between systems are critical determinants of long term outcomes. From an eco-epidemiological perspective, the study of climate change becomes inseparable from the study of global change more generally.",Reviews on environmental health,1997 Jul-Sep,Germany,1997,90
9290864,The Inventory of Drinking Situations (IDS) in current drinkers with different degrees of alcohol problems.,"The Inventory of Drinking Situations (IDS) is a questionnaire developed to characterize the situations where alcoholics in treatment drank excessively. The purpose of the present study was to extend the understanding of this instrument as a research and diagnostic tool by applying it to drinking situations in individuals who have never been diagnosed as alcoholics, but who may have problems due to alcohol. Seventy-three current drinkers (32.1 +/- 9.98 years) were examined with a version of the IDS suitable for nonalcoholic individuals. Using the CAGE test we categorized the subjects in five groups according to their score. Correlational analysis revealed that the IDS subscale scores increased significantly with the severity of drinking problems. The CAGE score, the factor-derived scale Negative Situations, being male, and a preference for drinking alone were also correlated with the amount of alcohol consumed, while age was correlated with none of the variables of interest. To facilitate the analysis of the profiles of drinking situations, the IDS subscales underwent a factor analysis that rendered two factor-derived scales, suggesting that drinking occurs both in positive and in negative situations. In persons with more alcohol problems, according to their high CAGE scores, there was more drinking in negative situations that in positive ones. Accordingly, we confirmed that the profiles of drinking situations seen in problem drinkers indicated that situations related to negative emotions are more important determinants to drink. Implications of a shift from drinking in positive to drinking in negative emotional situations are discussed. We further substantiated the value of this test instrument for studies on drinking situations and for studies in nonalcoholic individuals.",Addictive behaviors,1997 Jul-Aug,England,1997,90
9250629,Effects of marital status on the risk of mortality in poor and non-poor neighborhoods.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to consider whether the mortality risks associated with marital status are conditioned by the socioeconomic quality of neighborhoods. METHODS: The analysis is based on the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1971-1974 (NHANES I), and the 1987 NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Survey (NHEFS). Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to assess whether the effect of marital status on the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality is altered by local area poverty. Analyses are stratified by age, sex, and urbanicity. RESULTS: The interaction between neighborhood poverty and marital status is suggested for non-elderly men, particularly for cancer mortality and for men in urban areas. Interaction effects are evident among older women residing in urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a spouse elevates the risk of mortality but this risk is moderately higher in impoverished neighborhoods, notably in urbanized areas, for non-elderly men and elderly women. Future studies with larger samples of non-married persons where marital status changes are incorporated are needed to improve our understanding of the joint mortality effects of local area poverty and marital status.",Annals of epidemiology,1997 Jul,United States,1997,90
9248239,Identifying the social contexts of effective sex refusal.,"A factorial survey was conducted to identify social situations that inhibit or promote college students' sex-refusal skills. Respondents evaluated five different situations in which sexual intercourse might occur and ranked each according to how certain the respondent would be to refuse to have sexual intercourse in that context. Regression analysis of the survey data showed that knowing the other person well, being with one's boyfriend or girlfriend, having condoms available, wanting to have sex, and both persons' wanting to have sex reduced the probability of refusal. On the other hand, having no condoms and the presence of drugs in the situation increased the probability the individual would refuse to have sex. In addition, men, individuals with previous sexual experience, and drinkers displayed diminished ability to refuse sex. However, the lack of condoms, when combined with these three respondent characteristics, acted to increase the ability to refuse sex.",Journal of American college health : J of ACH,1997 Jul,United States,1997,90

The role of psycho-social stressors, and in particular environmental work or home stress is far less clear. Some but not all studies using the Karasek 'job-strain' model have found a relationship with ambulatory blood pressure levels. Other studies using more 'subjective' measures of occupational stress have found no relationship or even inverse associations with blood pressure. The possibility that relationships between external stressors, personality factors and blood pressure levels might be mediated or confounded by coping mechanisms influencing lifestyle factors known to directly affect blood pressure has not been adequately studied. This paper briefly explores the paradigm relating environmental psychosocial stress, individual coping mechanisms, lifestyle behaviours and blood pressure levels. The issues are critical for research methodology in this area and for the development of better behavioural strategies for the prevention and nonpharmacological management of hypertension.","Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)",1997 Jul-Aug,England,1997,90
9246691,Ecological and individual predictors of birthweight in a northern Finland birth cohort 1986.,"This multilevel study of spatial variability in, and determinants of, birthweight was conducted using individual and ecological data in a geographically defined prospective birth cohort for 1986 in northern Finland. The study area comprises three large areas defined by latitude: Northern Lapland (NL), Southern Lapland (SL) and Oulu province (OP), comprising 74 localities with a total study population of 9216 singleton births. The mean birthweight was 3482 g for NL, 3537 g for SL and 3587 g for OP (NL vs. OP and SL vs. OP: P < 0.05). The crude rate for stillbirths was highest in NL. The women in the northernmost area were socially less privileged and the localities less prosperous compared with those in the southernmost area. Significant spatial clustering of mean birthweights was found (P = 0.0016), with highest birthweight in the south-western part of the study area. A variable expressing the wealth of each locality, the financial capacity category (FCC), had its lowest mean value in NL, with a range of one to six for the localities studied here. A multilevel multiple regression model showed that, after allowing for sex, gestational age, mother's age, height and hypertensive disorders, parity, body mass index, previous low birthweight child and smoking as individual determinants of birthweight, part of the residual variation could be explained by the locality wealth parameter. Using the multilevel model, the differences in mean birthweight across the three latitude areas persisted but were reduced (difference OP vs. NL reduced from 105 g to 86.5 g). The relationship between birthweight and FCC was inverse U-shaped with the highest mean birthweight estimated for localities occurring in the middle of the range (FCC = 3). The wealthiest urban localities (FCC = 6) and the most deprived localities (FCC = 1) both had a predicted birthweight about 60 g below the maximum at FCC = 3, if all other factors were held constant. This result, taken together with the spatial clustering of birthweights, suggests that there may be important social and environmental determinants of birthweight that have yet to be identified.",Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,1997 Jul,England,1997,90
9245679,Evaluation of a national Quit and Win contest: determinants for successful quitting.,"BACKGROUND: Within the CINDI framework, a European ""Quit and Win"" contest was organized in 1994. In Finland the number of participants was 5,879 (0.6% of smokers). In the CINDI demonstration area, North Karelia (NK), the participants numbered 618 (2.0% of smokers). This study compared abstinence maintenance among the participants in NK with the rates found elsewhere in Finland and analyzed determinants for successful quitting. METHODS: A follow-up study was conducted 12 months after the quit date with a sample of 2,114 participants. Response rates of 67-68% were achieved (n = 1,419). The abstinence was assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months. Two estimates are presented: (1) the proportion of abstainers among the respondents and (2) the proportion of abstainers among the sample, considering all nonrespondents smokers. The determinants for maintenance of smoking cessation were analyzed with logistic regression. RESULTS: Using the first estimate, the rates at 1/6/12 months were 75/36/28% in NK and 70/28/21% elsewhere (P < 0.01). Using the second estimate, the corresponding rates were 50/24/19% in NK and 46/19/14% elsewhere. The most significant determinants for successful quitting were sex, age, marital status, level of withdrawal symptoms, previous quitting attempts, and support received. CONCLUSIONS: The recruitment of smokers and the maintained cessation were more successful in the demonstration area. The difference between areas was explained by differences in the combined professional and lay support and by the sex and age distributions.",Preventive medicine,1997 Jul-Aug,United States,1997,90
9245669,Participation in a breast cancer screening program: influence of past behavior and determinants on future screening participation.,"BACKGROUND: This study analyzed the relationship between past screening behavior, determinants, intention, and future screening participation in the Dutch national breast cancer screening program. METHODS: Participation at the first and second screening rounds was monitored. Furthermore, between the first and the second screening rounds, women received a questionnaire (response 58%, n = 395). The questionnaire was based on the ASE model, including attitude (consequences, anticipated regret, and moral obligation), social influence (support and modeling), and self-efficacy. Other distal variables assessed were previous screening behavior, evaluation of screening characteristics, and demographics. RESULTS: Participants at the second screening differed from nonparticipants on all ASE determinants. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that for previous participants and nonparticipants different ASE determinants and distal variables explained the variance in intention to participate in the next screening (30 to 45%). Logistic regression analyses showed that past behavior and intention (which mediated the effects of the ASE variables) were significant predictors of participation in the second screening. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between previous participants and nonparticipants in determinants of intention and future screening behavior can be used to improve participation and adherence to breast cancer screening.",Preventive medicine,1997 Jul-Aug,United States,1997,90
9231287,Adherence: a matter of self-efficacy and power.,"This paper examines the relationship between self-efficacy and social power (expert and referent) and how the application of this relationship, leads to client adherence and compliance. Referent power is defined, including methods that health care professionals may use to develop and apply referent power. Expert power is defined and addressed in the context of referent power, self-esteem and self-efficacy as a means of promoting adherence. Self-efficacy as a concept is defined and explored in the context of social power. The relationships between self-efficacy and social power (expert and referent) are shown as important determinants of adherence and compliance. The theory of the application of referent and expert power in relationship with self-efficacy has been compared with an effective programme, yielding high compliance, at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, showing the theory's relevance and applicability in determining compliance. Explored are the reasons for non-compliance in the elderly population and how the theory model can remedy these detriments for compliance. The empowerment of elderly patients through the application of this theory to medication compliance is examined. The determination of adherence and compliance is shown by the application of the relationship between self-efficacy and both expert and referent power.",Journal of advanced nursing,1997 Jul,England,1997,90
9228591,Determinants of HIV seroconversion in injection drug users during a period of rising prevalence in Vancouver.,"To identify determinants of HIV seroconversion among injection drug users (IDUs) during a period of rising prevalence, a case-control investigation was conducted. Cases were IDUs with a new positive test after 1 January 1994, and a negative test within the prior 18 months. Controls required 2 negative tests during the same period. Subjects completed a questionnaire on demographic, psychosocial, and behavioural factors. Eighty-nine cases and 192 controls were similar with respect to gender, age, ethnicity and inter-test interval. Multivariate analyses of events during the inter-test interval showed borrowing syringes (adj. OR = 2.96; P < 0.006), unstable housing (adj. OR = 2.01; P = 0.03) and injecting > or = 4 times daily (adj. OR = 1.71; P = 0.06) to be independently associated with seroconversion. Protective associations were demonstrated for sex with opposite gender (adj. OR = 0.36; P = 0.001) and tetrahydrocannabinol use (adj. OR = 0.41; P = 0.001). There is a need to evaluate programmes dealing with addiction, housing and the social underpinnings of risk behaviours in this population.",International journal of STD & AIDS,1997 Jul,England,1997,90
9224450,Transitions in chronic low back pain in Japanese older adults: a sociomedical perspective.,"This study examines the patterns and determinants of chronic low back pain over a three-year period among older adults in Japan. We tested our model based on a sociomedical perspective, using a two-wave national probability sample survey of persons aged 60 and older (N = 2,200) conducted in 1987 and 1990 in Japan. At baseline, the prevalence of chronic low back pain was 18 percent. Among those who were free of back pain at baseline, the probabilities of onset, death, and nonresponse were 13 percent, 7 percent, and 10 percent. Among those who had back pain at baseline, the probabilities of recovery, death, and nonresponse were 43 percent, 8 percent, and 9 percent, respectively. Our multinomial logistic regression analysis supports our thesis that societal factors (age, gender, education, and social relationships) affect transitions in chronic back pain not only directly, but also indirectly through mediating health and health behavior factors. The results suggest that social relationships have both favorable and unfavorable effects on chronic low back pain.","The journals of gerontology.

It found that children as young as age 8 reported sexual activity, and that more than one-third of the children age 8 to 18 reported being sexually active. Of those who were sexually active, more than one-third were not using contraceptives. Using logistic regression, five variables are identified as having importance in explaining sexual activity. Two variables had some limited ability to explain contraceptive use. Implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for policy and practice are made.",Child welfare,1997 Jul-Aug,United States,1997,90

The authors reviewed medical records of all first time admissions during a 22 month period. A total of 272 patients age 60 and older were admitted for the first time during this period. Nine variables comprised of medical, demographic, social, and discharge information were examined in retrospective analysis to assess their relationship to LOS. The mean and standard deviation of days spent in hospital was 392.3 +/- 752.81. The median number of days of hospitalization was 72.0. Single marital status, type of living arrangement, polypharmacy, and limited functional status were predictive of LOS. Our findings underscore the challenge within geropsychiatry of treating patients with coexisting medical conditions who also have significant behavioral, mood, and/or cognitive disturbances.",The Psychiatric quarterly,1997 Summer,United States,1997,90
24394711,Nutrition rehabilitation and the importance of the perception of malnutrition in the follow-up of rehabilitated children.,"Nutrition rehabilitation of malnourished children remains a challenge for health services. This paper reports the results of an evaluation of the nutrition component of a mother and child health program in Nepal. The treatment of severely malnourished children was very satisfactory: case fatality rate varied from 4 to 9 % between projects. Follow-up, however, was found to be very poor: only one percent of the discharged children came for a follow-up visit after the first two weeks. The perception of malnutrition within the communities was identified as one of the possible determinants for a successful follow-up and small scale qualitative investigations were organized to gain insight in the topic. Results are quite revealing regarding the perception of nutrition problems. If for severe cases (kwashiorkor and marasmus) awareness of malnutrition did exist in the community, chronic malnutrition seems to be considered as a normal state of being. When a problem is perceived (in severe cases) people will seldom think of it as a nutrition related disease. Results show that the aetiology used by the people differs significantly from the western paradigm, and that traditional convictions put the causes at natural, supra-natural or social levels. The striking point is that no relation is established in the traditional framework between malnutrition (either severe or mild) and food intake of the children. Perception of malnutrition and of its causes influences health seeking behaviour in terms of prevention and treatment. Traditional healers play an important curative role and will often be the first to be contacted. The absence of perception of the links between the shape of the body and nutrients is put forward as one of the possible explaining mechanisms for low follow-up rates observed. An implication of this study would be to revise the health messages delivered to the communities in order to make them culturally more appropriate and relevant.",Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition,1997 Jun,Australia,1997,90

Although considering religious factors as a cause of population change, the research compares the BUA with other urban areas and relates developments in Belfast to some literature on sociospatial polarisation and the inverted question markunderclass'.... The results suggest that population change is not driven by explicitly religious factors, the relationship between religion and socio-economic well-being has changed, and that changes in religious mixing and segregation occur in many contexts. The BUA is like other urban areas, albeit with unique features arising from the influence of religion.""",International journal of population geography : IJPG,1997 Jun,England,1997,90

This research uses ordinary least squares regression to compare the effects of demographic, economic, and amenity factors on county-level net migration rates for five age groups: the young (25-44), the middle-aged (45-54), the pre-elderly (55-64), the young-old (65-74), and the old-old (75+). Pre-elderly migration patterns emerge as distinct from those of both younger and older age groups. Their net migration patterns are not fully shaped by labour force considerations. At the same time, pre-elderly migration appears to be driven by factors beyond retirement. These findings are discussed in the context of life-course change and their implications for the ageing baby-boom cohorts [considered].""",International journal of population geography : IJPG,1997 Jun,England,1997,90
9659409,Environmental factors affecting nutritional status in urban areas of developing countries.,"The demographic and economic transition that many developing countries are undergoing is producing important changes in diet and lifestyle that greatly impact on disease risks. Among the risk behaviors associated with socioeconomic transition and urbanization are excessive dietary fat intake, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and environmental contamination. Combined with a reduced infant mortality and increased life expectancy, those risk factors lead to an increasing prevalence of chronic disease like non-insulin dependent diabetes and coronary heart disease. This disease. This disease profile is a relatively new phenomenon in developing countries, where health programs have traditionally focused on ""acute"" interventions such as immunization or oral rehydration. A new approach will be needed to address chronic diseases, which frequently demand a life-long and technically complex medical management, and may have significant impact on the quality of life and productivity of the population. Efforts to address this situation should focus on a) expanding the information base on diet, nutritional status and lifestyle changes in populations migrating to urban areas; b) developing and evaluating approaches for improving diet quality in urban populations, including fortification and community-based supplementation programs; c) understanding better the social and behavioral determinants of nutritional status in the urban poor; and d) defining the role of the food industry and of agricultural production for improving the quality of the food supply in urban areas.",Archivos latinoamericanos de nutricion,1997 Jun,Venezuela,1997,90
9243430,"Social class, spoken language and pattern of care as determinants of continuity of carer in maternity services in east London.","BACKGROUND: The Government's policy of Changing childbirth gives priority to user-oriented outcomes, such as continuity of carer. It has been assumed that the organization (or pattern) of maternity care is the main determinant of continuity, with relatively little attention paid to sociodemographic factors. The aim of this study was to assess the relative contribution of social class, spoken language and pattern of care in determining continuity of carer. METHOD: Postal questionnaires were sent 14 days after delivery to East London and the City Health Authority residents delivering within a three-week period in May 1994. Bilingual interviews were carried out for non-English-speaking women. Pattern of care was assigned by the midwife as either hospital or community (including team based care, 'domino' and home births). The main outcome measure was self-reported continuity of carer in antenatal, delivery and postnatal care. RESULTS: The response rate was 69 per cent (370/533). The community pattern of care affected only antenatal continuity (62 per cent community vs 50 per cent hospital, p < 0.05). Women whose main spoken language was English or whose social class was I-IIIn reported higher levels of continuity at each phase of care, although this effect was largely confined to the community pattern of care. The odds ratios (95 per cent confidence intervals) for the effect of social class (I-IIIn vs other) on antenatal, labour and postnatal continuity within the community pattern of care were 3.64 (1.09-12.18), 3.08 (1.09-8.74) and 4.93 (1.48-16.46), respectively. CONCLUSION: Spoken English and high social class were associated with continuity of carer, although this effect was mainly confined to women with a community pattern of care. Achievement of national targets for continuity of carer may not be possible in east London without explicit consideration of sociodemographic factors.",Journal of public health medicine,1997 Jun,England,1997,90
9225541,Accessing primary dental care in three London boroughs.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate and identify factors that may influence individuals' ability to access primary health care services. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study SETTING: Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham. SUBJECTS: A 0.1 per cent random sample of people aged 18 years and over in the population of 626,621 people in the three boroughs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic as well as psychosocial profile of the sample, perceptions of their dental health needs, accessed dental care. RESULTS: The results indicated that people believed that their oral health was good. The majority of the sample had attended for dental care within the previous year and were registered with a general dental practitioner. Accessing dental care was related to age, social class, borough of residence, dentate status and dental phobia status. In addition subjects experiencing problems with their teeth gained access to care more readily than others. This was related to social class. Accessing dental care was predicted by dental care being provided by a general dental practitioner, experiencing problems with teeth and not being dentally phobic. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that psychosocial factors together with dental health status can act as determinants when accessing primary dental services. It is considered that family health services authorities should be aware of these influences when developing and monitoring dental health services, in order to make them responsive and sensitive to the needs of the people whom they serve.",Community dental health,1997 Jun,England,1997,90
9224179,The association between the purchase of a handgun and homicide or suicide.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether purchase of a handgun from a licensed dealer is associated with the risk of homicide or suicide and whether any association varies in relation to time since purchase. METHODS: A case-control study was done among the members of a large health maintenance organization. Case subjects were the 353 suicide victims and 117 homicide victims among the members from 1980 through 1992. Five control subjects were matched to each case subject on age, sex, and zip code of residence. Handgun purchase information was obtained from the Department of Licensing. RESULTS: The adjusted relative risk of suicide was 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 2.5) for persons with a history of family handgun purchase from a registered dealer. The adjusted relative risk for homicide, given a history of family handgun purchase, was 2.2 (95% CI = 1.3, 3.7). For both suicide and homicide, the elevated relative risks persisted for more than 5 years after the purchase. CONCLUSIONS: Legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death.",American journal of public health,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90
9224176,Frequent attendance at religious services and mortality over 28 years.,"OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the long-term association between religious attendance and mortality to determine whether the association is explained by improvements in health practices and social connections for frequent attenders. METHODS: The association between frequent attendance and mortality over 28 years for 5286 Alameda Country Study respondents was examined. Logistic regression models analyzed associations between attendance and subsequent improvements in health practices and social connections. RESULTS: Frequent attenders had lower mortality rates than infrequent attenders (relative hazard [RH] = 0.64;95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53,0.77). Results were stronger for females. Health adjustments had little impact, but adjustments for social connections and health practices reduced the relationship (RH = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.64, 0.93). During follow-up, frequent attenders were more likely to stop smoking, increase exercising, increase social contacts, and stay married. CONCLUSIONS: Lower mortality rates for frequent religious attenders are partly explained by improved health practices, increased social contacts, and more stable marriages occurring in conjunction with attendance. The mechanisms by which these changes occur have broad intervention implications.",American journal of public health,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90
9220563,Homelessness and vulnerability among adults with and without alcohol problems.,"While many works compare traits of homeless adults across levels of alcohol use, few specifically consider whether drinking status affects determinants of either homelessness or ""vulnerability"" to homelessness. This paper relies on a 1986 Chicago, Illinois sample (n = 535) to consider the potential contributions of resources, social network characteristics, disaffiliation, and mental health problems. Results suggest that resource problems may determine homelessness regardless of drinking status. But drinking-associated problems may raise the resource threshold for ""vulnerability,"" reduce the protection afforded by social networks against both homelessness and ""vulnerability,"" increase the deleterious impact of disaffiliation, and spur complicating mental health problems.",Substance use & misuse,1997 Jun,England,1997,90
9220127,Treatment of anxiety disorders in late life.,"OBJECTIVE: To provide a current review and synthesis of the present state of knowledge of anxiety disorders and symptoms in the elderly. METHODS: Current research derived from a MEDLINE search and references in key textbook articles and other papers were reviewed. These data were combined with the clinical empirical knowledge and experience of the authors. RESULTS: Anxiety disorders and symptoms are a common presenting problem in the elderly. Current knowledge and research findings are limited. Extrapolation from adult studies are of use, but important limitations are evident because of the nature, uniqueness, and complexity of the geriatric psychiatry patient. Comorbidity, especially with depression, medical conditions, drugs, and dementia, remains an important concept in assessment and approach to management of anxiety in the older person. Comprehensive assessment of anxiety symptoms requires consideration of physical, intellectual, environmental, and social determinants. Major anxiety disorders, as defined by DSM-IV, and anxiety symptoms are significant problems in the older adult population and are responsible for significant morbidity and cost to the health care network. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety disorders and symptoms in old age, although common, have received little research focus to date. A comprehensive, careful approach by the clinician to assessment and management is required because anxiety is often a comorbid condition in the elderly. Effective treatments are available and should be applied in a flexible, integrated, and specific manner.",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

All three main modes of assessment (clinical examination, laboratory tests, and self-reports) reveal a high burden of reproductive tract infections. The two most common conditions, identified by laboratory tests, were bacterial vaginosis and mucopurulent cervicitis. Approximately one-fourth of the women had clinical evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical ectopy, and fistula. The contribution of sexually transmitted diseases to overall gynecological morbidity appears to be relatively modest; 10 percent were so diagnosed. Associated conditions of anemia and chronic energy deficiency were common. Severe anemia was found in 17 percent of cases and severe chronic energy deficiency in 12 percent. These results indicate that radical improvements in women's health in India will require far more than the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive tract infections.",Studies in family planning,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90
9212534,The social determinants of the decline of life expectancy in Russia and eastern Europe: a lifestyle explanation.,"This paper examines the social origins of the rise in adult mortality in Russia and selected Eastern European countries. Three explanations for this trend are considered: (1) Soviet health policy, (2) social stress, and (3) health lifestyles. The socialist states were generally characterized by a persistently poor mortality performance as part of a long-term process of deterioration, with particularly negative outcomes for the life expectancy of middle-aged, male manual workers. Soviet-style health policy was ineffective in dealing with the crisis, and stress per se does not seem to be the primary cause of the rise in mortality. Although more research is needed, the suggestion is made that poor health lifestyles--reflected especially in heavy alcohol consumption, and also in smoking, lack of exercise, and high-fat diets--are the major social determinant of the upturn in deaths.",Journal of health and social behavior,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90
9195528,Work and disability status of persons with fibromyalgia.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and determinants of self-reported work disability in persons with fibromyalgia (FM). METHODS: A longitudinal, multicenter survey of 1604 patients with FM from 6 centers with diverse socioeconomic characteristics was begun in 1988. Assessments were by self-report questionnaire and telephone contact, and included work and disability events that occurred before and after 1988. Comparative analyses were performed on the entire data set and, separately, on the Wichita data set. RESULTS: More than 16% of patients reported receiving US Social Security disability (SSD) payments (highest center rate 35.7%; lowest center rate 6.3%) compared to 2.2% of the US population (US Social Security Administration data) and 28.9% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis seen at the Wichita outpatient rheumatology clinic. Overall, 26.5% reported receiving at least one form of disability payment when SSD and other sources of disability payments were considered. In Wichita, less than 25% of SSD awards were made specifically for FM, but after 1988 that figure increased to 46.4%. Work disability was greatest at the San Antonio and Los Angeles centers. Multivariate predictors (correlates) included pain, Health Assessment Questionnaire disability, and unmarried status. In addition, more than 70% of patients reporting being disabled did receive disability payments. On the other hand, 64% reported being able to work all or most days, and more than 70% were employed or were homemakers. CONCLUSION: Although most patients (64%) report being able to work, we found high rates of self-reported work disability awards among persons with FM followed in 6 rheumatology centers. But we also found great variability among centers as to awards and as to self-reported work ability. Center differences in work disability might reflect clinic referral patterns, physician beliefs, or socioeconomic status.",The Journal of rheumatology,1997 Jun,Canada,1997,90
9183339,Acute stroke care and rehabilitation: an analysis of the direct cost and its clinical and social determinants. The Copenhagen Stroke Study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke represents a major economic challenge to society. The direct cost of stroke is largely determined by the duration of hospital stay, but internationally applicable estimates of the direct cost of acute stroke care and rehabilitation on cost-efficient stroke units are not available. Information regarding social and medical factors influencing the length of hospital stay (LOHS) and thereby cost is needed to direct cost-reducing efforts. METHODS: We determined the direct cost of stroke in the prospective, consecutive, and community-based stroke population of the Copenhagen Stroke Study by measuring the total LOHS in the 1197 acute stroke patients included in the study. All patients had all their acute care and rehabilitation on a dedicated stroke unit. Neurological impairment was measured by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale. Local nonmedical factors affecting the LOHS, such as waiting time for discharge to a nursing home after completed rehabilitation, were accounted for in the analysis. The influence of social and medical factors on the LOHS was analyzed in a multiple linear regression model. RESULTS: The average LOHS was 27.1 days (SD, 44.1; range, 1 to 193), corresponding to a direct cost of $12.150 per patient including all acute care and rehabilitation. The LOHS increased with increasing stroke severity (6 days per 10-point increase in severity; P < .0001) and single marital status (3.4 days; P = .02). Death reduced LOHS (22.0 days; P < .0001). Age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, claudication, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, former stroke, other disabling comorbidity, smoking, daily alcohol consumption, and the type of stroke (hemorrhage/infarct) had no independent influence on LOHS. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care and rehabilitation of unselected patients on a dedicated stroke unit takes on average 4 weeks. In general, comorbidity such as diabetes or heart disease does not increase LOHS. Efforts to reduce costs should therefore aim at reducing initial stroke severity or improving the rate of recovery.",Stroke,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90

It begins by establishing the importance of policy language and an interpretive approach to reveal dominant meanings and assumptions. This approach points out the significance of language and its contexts (text and intertext) and of developing a formal analytic strategy, based on semiotics. The paper concludes with a detailed, illustrated analysis of AHFA, suggesting that the document's discourse, through appealing to all, with emphases on the nation, community and all Canadians, establishes a frame of individual responsibility and rights, health promotion and broad health determinants--a frame that resonates with the cost-constrained nature of health care delivery-as found in provincial reform documents in the 1980s and 1990s.",Social science & medicine (1982),1997 Jun,England,1997,90

Mothers were first interviewed about their children when they were between the ages of 1 and 10 years old. Three subsequent interviews were conducted with the children when they reached adolescence and young adulthood. Results show support for the mediational model. In accordance with family interactional framework conceptions, there was a sequence in patterning: from parenting during early adolescence; to personality and peer factors, extending to smoking in late adolescence; and culminating in smoking in adulthood. With a developmental approach, a number of psychosocial measures were related in both younger and older children. Nevertheless, some interesting developmental differences emerged. The findings suggest at least four possible targets for therapeutic or preventive intervention: the parent, the child, the adolescent, and the peer group.",The Journal of genetic psychology,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90
9183207,Socioeconomic determinants of health. The contribution of nutrition to inequalities in health.,"Social class differences in health are seen at all ages, with lower socioeconomic groups having greater incidence of premature and low birthweight babies, heart disease, stroke, and some cancers in adults. Risk factors including lack of breast feeding, smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, and poor diet are clustered in the lower socioeconomic groups. The diet of the lower socioeconomic groups provides cheap energy from foods such as meat products, full cream milk, fats, sugars, preserves, potatoes, and cereals but has little intake of vegetables, fruit, and wholewheat bread. This type of diet is lower in essential nutrients such as calcium, iron, magnesium, folate, and vitamin C than that of the higher socioeconomic groups. New nutritional knowledge on the protective role of antioxidants and other dietary factors suggests that there is scope for enormous health gain if a diet rich in vegetables, fruit, unrefined cereal, fish, and small quantities of quality vegetable oils could be more accessible to poor people.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1997 May 24,England,1997,90

Our analysis involves the estimation of household monetary health care expenditures, using the economic and demographic characteristics of the household as covariates. We pay particular attention to the impact of household income on health expenditures, estimating the elasticity of health care expenditures with respect to income for different income groups and according to health insurance status. For the empirical analysis, we use the Mexican National Survey of Income and Expenditures of 1989. Our principle findings show that monetary health expenditures by Mexican households are sensitive to changes in household income levels and that the group which is most responsive to changes in income levels in the lower-income uninsured group. This suggests that in times of economic crisis, these households reduce cash expenditures on health care by proportionately more than higher-income and insured households.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",1997 Jun,Ireland,1997,90
9244971,[Asylum seekers and refugees in ambulatory health care: communication between physician and patient].,"Communication between asylum seekers/refugees and general practitioners/physicians of the three main outpatient sectors for the Swiss national Health System (general practice, medical outpatient and accident & emergency departments) are being described and analysed. The data have been collected during three cross-sectional studies investigating the health status of asylum seekers and refugees and the health services provided to them. These studies addressed the problem exclusively from the point of view of the health care providers. Data on language capabilities, sociocultural aspects of communication and the necessity and availability of interpreters have been collected with questionnaires. The main results of the questionnaires have been followed up in group discussions with general practitioners. The majority of general practitioners/physicians felt that most of the communication problems were related to speaking a common language. Only about one out of two adult asylum seekers/refugees knew German, French, Italian or English. Particularly during the group discussions it was brought forward that cultural and social factors additionally complicate communication during patient-doctor interactions. When the data of the outpatient consultations of the main studies were analysed, it became obvious that interpreters were significantly more often present in consultations with patients with psychological/psychosocial diagnoses than those with somatic diagnoses (72% vs. 55%). This can be interpreted in two ways: (1) if a patient suffers from a psychological/psychosocial problem, it is more likely that an interpreter will be asked to assist during the consultation or (2) if an interpreter is present during a consultation, it is more likely that a psychological/psychosocial problem will be detected. With the exception of children, most of the general practitioners/physicians felt that non-professional interpreters (relatives, friends) were adequate for coping with most of the tasks. The following areas for improvements were identified: (1) availability of professional interpreters and quality as well as organisational issues related to interpretation, (2) language training for asylum seekers and refugees and (3) creation of awareness among general practitioners/physicians towards cultural and socioeconomic determinants of patient-doctor interactions and training.",Praxis,1997 May 7,Switzerland,1997,90

Public policies and economic practices which increase marginalisation act to damage the ""weak ties"" of the community social networks which bind central city neighbourhoods into functioning units.

9498898,Aromatic amines and cancer.,"Epidemiological evidence on the relation between aromatic amines and cancer risk is reviewed. In particular, cancer risk in humans resulting from exposure to aromatic amines from occupational sources and tobacco smoking is assessed with reference to ecologic, cohort, and case-control studies. Seven arylamines have been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer: benzidine-based dyes and MOCA (4,4'-methylene bis 2-choloroaniline) were considered 'probably' carcinogenic, Group 2A, because of a high level of evidence in experimental animals; two occupational chemicals (2-naphthylamine and benzidine), one drug (Chlornaphazine), and two manufacturing processes (manufacture of auramine and magenta) were included in Group 1 on the basis of 'sufficient' evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. Occupational exposures to aromatic amines explain up to 25 percent of bladder cancers in some areas of Western countries; these estimates might be higher in limited areas of developing countries. Aromatic amines contaminate the ambient air as a component of environmental tobacco smoke. There is increasing evidence that the excess of bladder cancer in smokers is attributable to aromatic amines rather than to other contaminants of tobacco smoke such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). A modulating role in the risk of bladder cancer associated with exposure to aromatic amines is played by metabolic polymorphisms, such as the N-acetyltransferase genotype, raising important social and ethical issues. The consistent observation of a difference between men and women in bladder cancer risk, after allowing for known risk factors, suggests consideration of gender-related biological determinants for future investigation.",Cancer causes & control : CCC,1997 May,Netherlands,1997,90
9257620,Do sociodemographics and economic status predict risks for type II diabetes in African Americans?,"The prevalence of type II diabetes and the metabolic characteristics in high-risk African Americans were examined to determine whether certain socioeconomic and demographic characteristics (SED) increase the risk for type II diabetes in this population. Study participants were high-risk African Americans between the ages of 25 and 64 years. Glucose tolerance status was assessed and questionnaires were completed to obtain information regarding SED, hypertension, and physical activity. The majority of patients had normal glucose tolerance; undiagnosed type II diabetes was identified in 36 of 164 patients. Questionnaire data revealed that, in highly selected African Americans at risk for type II diabetes, there was a higher rate of obesity, prior gestational diabetes, and undiagnosed type II diabetes despite higher educational and income levels and greater access to health care and recreational facilities. Findings indicate that African Americans may be at higher risk for type II diabetes, regardless of socioeconomic status, due to genetic inheritance and other unknown environmental determinants. Further studies are needed to characterize SED and metabolic profiles that confer a high risk for type II diabetes in this population.",The Diabetes educator,1997 May-Jun,United States,1997,90
9184786,Determinants of handicap 1 and 3 years after a stroke.,"A total of 361 consecutive admissions to hospital with acute stroke were followed up to examine the determinants of handicap 1 year and 2-3 years later. Handicap was measured using the London Handicap Scale, and data were collected on initial stroke severity, disability, mood and sociodemographic variables. Ninety-five of 170 survivors returned handicap questionnaires at 1 year, 102 of 149 survivors at 2-3 years, and 58 on both occasions. Mean handicap score decreased slightly between 1 and 2-3 years (45-48 on a 0-100 scale, 95% confidence interval for difference -1 to +7, p = 0.09). At both 1 and 2-3 years handicap was associated with pre-stroke disability, 1-year score disability, initial stroke severity and mood. Age and sex were associated at 1 year but not at 2-3 years. In multivariate analyses disability, stroke severity and mood were independently associated with handicap. None of the variables examined predicted change in handicap score. The study demonstrates the overriding importance of stroke severity (impairment) and disability in determining handicap. In comparison, social variables were less important.",Disability and rehabilitation,1997 May,England,1997,90
9179583,"The association between substance use, condom use and sexual risk among low-income women.","Substance use is frequently assumed to be associated with higher levels of sexual risk-taking and lower levels of condom use. An analysis of 668 black, Hispanic and white low-income women at public health and public assistance facilities in Miami show that 19% engaged in risky sexual behavior over the preceding six months, 24% in substance use and 31% in condom use. Overall, substance users are nearly four and one-half times more likely to take sexual risks than nonusers, but are about half as likely to have relied on condoms. When the probability of condom use is considered in the context of both substance use and sexual risk, substance users who take sexual risks appear just as likely to rely on condoms as are nonusers who take sexual risks and those who do not (odds of 0.43-0.49). However, substance users who do not take sexual risks are much less likely to use condoms (odds of 0.15). This pattern holds among black, Hispanic and white women, and suggests that perceptions of risk and the risks that partners bring to sexual encounters may be more important determinants of condom use than substance use per se.",Family planning perspectives,1997 May-Jun,United States,1997,90
9150097,Practical issues in psychosocial measures.,"Psychosocial variables were recognized as key clinical determinants and outcomes in rheumatic disease. Clinical interventions can produce clinically important improvement in psychological status, and clinicians regularly employ anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs. Yet assessment of psychological status is rarely undertaken in routine clinical practice. In part, this failure stems from the fact that most formal psychological instruments are too complicated, take too much time to administer, cannot be administered in real time, and are difficult to interpret. A practical way to assess psychological status in the clinic is to use short depression instruments such as the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) or the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) anxiety and depression subscales. Another approach to psychological assessment is to measure surrogate variables, that is, variables that are not primarily psychological and have practical use in rheumatic disease care. The Clinical Health Assessment Questionnaire (CLINHAQ) assesses such surrogate variables via visual analog scales for pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, the helplessness subscale of the Rheumatology Attitudes index, a self-report measure of satisfaction with health, and the AIMS anxiety and depression scales. This instrument, which also contains the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index, a pain diagram, and assessment of global severity, can be completed in 5 minutes by almost all clinic patients.",The Journal of rheumatology,1997 May,Canada,1997,90
9144822,Determinants of mental health providers' expectations of patients' improvement.,"OBJECTIVE: Characteristics of individual mental health providers and of treatment settings were examined to determine their effects on providers' expectations about the improvement of patients with serious mental illness. METHODS: The sample consisted of 1,567 treatment providers working in 107 inpatient and outpatient units or programs in 29 Veterans Affairs mental health facilities. They completed a questionnaire about their prognostic expectations and a broad range of attitudes toward job satisfaction, professional relations, and team functioning. Unit or program directors of all 107 units completed another questionnaire about the average functional ability of patients, unit workload, and unit size. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to assess the effects of both individual and unit-level attributes on providers' expectations of improvement in clinical symptomatology and social-functional skills of patients in their care. RESULTS: The providers had generally low expectations about the improvement of patients with serious mental illness. Expectations were higher among staff in units or programs that were smaller and that had an outpatient focus, a greater proportion of staff involved in the treatment team, and higher-functioning patients. Individual characteristics significantly associated with prognostic expectations were occupation, age, and membership on the treatment team. CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic expectations among providers of care to persons with serious mental illness vary with identifiable individual and unit or program characteristics. The latter may be amenable to manipulation and intervention to improve mental health providers' prognostic expectations.","Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)",1997 May,United States,1997,90

9881127,Interacting factors affecting illegitimacy in preindustrial northern England.,"Illegitimacy in a historic, single community at Penrith, Cumbria (1557-1812), has been studied using aggregative analysis, family reconstitution and time series analysis. This population was living under extreme conditions of hardship. Long, medium and short wavelength cycles in the rate of illegitimacy have been identified by time series analysis; each represents a different response to social and economic pressures. In a complex interaction of events, the peaks of the cycles in wheat prices were associated with rises in adult mortality which promoted an influx of migrants and a concomitant rise in illegitimacy. The association between immigration and illegitimacy was particularly noticeable after the mortality crises of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Children of immigrant families also tended to produce illegitimate offspring. Native and immigrant families responded differently to extrinsic fluctuations, and variations in their reproductive behaviour were probably related to access to resources.",Journal of biosocial science,1997 Apr,England,1997,90

METHODS: 1,441 female high school students responded to a survey questionnaire containing quantity frequency measures of alcohol consumption and two sex roles scales. The Australian Sex Role Scale and the Women in Society Questionnaire. FINDINGS: Frequency of heavy drinking behaviors such as bingeing and getting drunk were a common occurrence. Levels of alcohol consumption and patterns of bingeing and getting drunk were related to the respondents frequency of drinking. Comparison between the two sex role scales and drinking behavior revealed that frequent and heavy drinkers were more likely to have masculine type personality traits and more liberal and contemporary views on the role of women in society. CONCLUSIONS: Young women who do not conform to traditional sex role stereotyping are likely to engage in what is considered to be risky health behaviors that have traditionally been associated with males.","Journal of child and adolescent psychiatric nursing : official publication of the Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nurses, Inc",1997 Apr-Jun,England,1997,90

This article describes the results of the investigation whether there are systematic differences in socio-economic and health-related factors between participants in a follow up study and those who are lost to follow-up. Subjects included were 1,030 men and 957 women aged 55-74 who participated in the second MONICA Survey Augsburg, F.R.G., 1989/90 (MONICA = Monitoring of trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease). They were reexamined in 1994-95. In 1994/95 910 men and 912 women of the baseline study were still alive, 1305 persons (663 men, 642 women) took part in the follow up by telephone. Altogether 120 men and 45 women had died since 1989/90. 144 persons were not eligible for the study (15 moved away, 5 severely ill persons, 124 without telephone). 373 persons were classified as eligible non-responders. The response rate was 77.8% concerning 1678 eligible persons (men 79.1%, women 76.4%). Non-response has led to an underrepresentation of the lower social class (workers, less than 10 years of education; household income less than 1500 DM) and of persons living alone (single, divorced, widowed; single-person households). In females, non-responders were overrepresented by ""never employed persons"" (odds ratio 3.02; 1.89-4.85). We found that the odds of being non-responder for single, divorced or widowed men was 3.40 (95 %-CI: 2.20-5.23) compared to married men. Men ""without chronic diseases"" at the baseline study compared with ill men had an odds for non-response of 1.54 (95%-CI: 1.00-2.37); the odds was 1.38 (95%-CI: 1.02-1.85) among women who had described their health status as ""not so good/bad"" in comparison with women with good self reported health. The reported distortions by non-response could be important in analyses of social conditions of morbidity and mortality. The underrepresentation of men without chronic diseases and women with bad self-assessment of their health is relevant for the estimates of morbidity as health outcome. Both aspects have to be taken into account in the interpretation of the results.",Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),1997 Apr,Germany,1997,90
9215087,Health education and promotion for STD prevention: lessons for the next millennium.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the evolution of health promotion for STD prevention. MAIN OBSERVATIONS: Information and education programmes were provided at the beginning of the 20th century to warn the public about the dangers of venereal infection and to support the medical model of case identification and case management under the care of qualified physicians. The public health approach offered advice about chemical, chemotherapeutic, and barrier prophylaxis, but avoided the issue of social prophylaxis. With the failure of antimicrobial agents to eradicate syphilis in the 1960s, rapid increases of viral sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and resistant strains of gonorrhoea in the 1970s, and the discovery of AIDS in the 1980s, alternatives to the traditional public health approach were sought and supported with a modest increase of resources. Three major innovations have been introduced to STD prevention as a result: social marketing, community involvement, and behaviour change programmes based on social and psychological concepts and theoretical models. CONCLUSIONS: Health promotion for STD prevention in the future will be characterised by careful assessments of the social and behavioural determinants of sexual risk taking, development and implementation of targeted interventions designed to reduce risk taking, and evaluation of social and behavioural interventions for improvements in STD prevention.",Genitourinary medicine,1997 Apr,England,1997,90

A study group comprising students enrolled in grade 7 or 8 in Helsinki, Finland (n = 172), performed a self-assessment based on two tests: the amount of bleeding after toothbrushing and after interproximal tooth cleaning with toothpicks. Clinical examinations based on bleeding on probing (BOP%) were carried out by four local community dentists. The highest observed kappa value was 0.43 for the agreement between BOP% and self-assessment when tested with different cut-off points of diagnosis. Multivariate analysis showed that clinical status and toothbrushing frequency were statistically significantly associated with self-assessed gingival bleeding in both tests. Socioeconomic status and locus of control orientation were also statistically significant factors in the toothpick test. In conclusion, the validity of self-assessment of bleeding was sufficient for monitoring adolescents' gingival health in groups.

However, ethnic misclassification can lead to false conclusions unless the extent of misclassification and the characteristics of those misclassified are understood. METHODS: This study explored determinants of ethnic misclassification in a sample of 1154 cancer cases in the San Francisco-Oakland cancer registry, where ethnic classification is based on surname or medical record report. We compared the following: correctly classified Hispanics, persons classified as Hispanic who self-identified as non-Hispanic, and persons classified as non-Hispanic who self-identified as Hispanic. RESULTS: Among men classified as Hispanic, those most likely to self-identify as non-Hispanic did not speak Spanish, had non-Spanish surnames, and were recent immigrants. Women misclassified as Hispanic did not speak Spanish or have Spanish maiden names, nor did they have mothers with Spanish maiden names. Persons who called themselves Hispanic, but were misclassified by the registry, were likely to be non-Spanish speaking college-education males.

All 5166 livebirths occurring in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 1993 were identified and mothers interviewed soon after delivery. Children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had a birthweight 142 g lower than those of non-smoking mothers. The odds ratio for low birthweight among children of smokers was 1.59 [95% CI 1.30-1.95]. There was no association between smoking and preterm delivery assessed by the Dubowitz score. In relation to intrauterine growth retardation, smoking was associated with an odds ratio of 2.07 [95% CI 1.69-2.53]. There was a direct dose-response association between the number of cigarettes smoked and the risk of growth retardation. Women whose partner smoked were also at higher risk of having a child with growth retardation. All the above results were adjusted for confounding factors.

9130317,The fate of the ego in contemporary psychiatry with particular reference to etiologic theories of schizophrenia.,"Despite its fruitfulness, the concept of the ego has fallen into disuse in contemporary psychiatry. It is the aim of this paper to explore the phenomenon of the decline of the concept of the ego by looking at the psychoanalytic theory of schizophrenia in which the ego is central and the genetic/neurochemical theory in which the ego is absent. Kuhn's (1970) explication of the competition of explanatory paradigms is utilized to frame this investigation and some of the factors involved in the displacement of the ego-oriented theory with the genetic/neurochemical theory are elucidated. Each theory is reviewed as to its theoretic and epistemological assumptions and its overall explanatory power. The psychoanalytic theory centers on the role of regression to an early state of ego development, and utilizes an intersubjective mode of data collection to describe developmental determinants of pathognomonic ego deficits. The genetic/neurochemical theory rests on the therapeutic outcome of neuroleptic treatment and family clustering of the illness. In failing to take into account data derived from intrapsychic, interpersonal, and cultural influences, the genetic/neurochemical theory is limited in its ability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the nature of schizophrenia. The ego-oriented theory gains significance at the border of these limitations. The concept of the ego is capable of integrating a wide range of biologic, developmental, and social influences that can account for the clinical phenomena of schizophrenia and should be restored to a central position in etiologic theories.",Psychiatry,1997 Spring,United States,1997,90

METHOD: Epidemiological data in the international literature addressing the issue of material poverty as a risk factor for the development of mental illness and as a prognostic factor for the outcome of mental illness were reviewed. RESULTS: The international literature reviewed supports the notion that material poverty is a risk factor for a negative outcome among mentally ill people. In addition, preliminary epidemiological data suggest that service-related variables may be determinants of outcome of mental illnesses. In our view, cooperation with developing countries is a great opportunity to evaluate mental health services in a natural setting.

Results indicated that negative relationship qualities, such as rivalry, competition, and conflict, were more closely related to younger sisters engaging in problem delinquent-like behavior and sexual behavior than were positive relationship qualities, such as warmth and closeness. Additionally, a shared friendship network with the older sister was found to be associated with extensive younger sister problem behavior and sexual behavior.

9100049,Quality of life in patients on chronic dialysis: self-assessment 3 months after the start of treatment. The Necosad Study Group.,"The aim of the present multicenter study was to assess quality of life of Dutch dialysis patients 3 months after the start of chronic dialysis treatment. The quality of life was compared with the quality of life of a general population sample, and the impact of demographic, clinical, renal function, and dialysis characteristics on patients' quality of life was studied. New end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who were started on chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in 13 dialysis centers in The Netherlands were consecutively included. Patients' self-assessment of quality of life was measured by the SF-36, a 36-item Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire encompassing eight dimensions: physical functioning, social functioning, role-functioning physical, role-functioning emotional, mental health, vitality, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. One hundred twenty hemodialysis and 106 peritoneal dialysis patients completed the SF-36. Quality of life of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients was substantially impaired in comparison to the general population sample, particularly with respect to role-functioning physical and general health perceptions. Mean role-functioning physical and general health perceptions scores of the hemodialysis patients corresponded with the lowest scoring 8% and 12%, respectively, of the reference group. Mean role-functioning physical and general health perceptions scores of the peritoneal dialysis patients corresponded with the lowest scoring 10% and 12%, respectively, of the reference group. Hemodialysis patients showed lower levels of quality of life than peritoneal dialysis patients on physical functioning, role-functioning emotional, mental health, and pain. However, on the multivariate level, we could only demonstrate an impact of dialysis modality on mental health. A higher number of comorbid conditions, a lower hemoglobin level, and a lower residual renal function were independently related to poorer quality of life. The variability of the SF-36 scores explained by selected demographic, clinical, renal function, and dialysis characteristics was highest for physical functioning (29.7%). Explained variability of the other SF-36 dimensions ranged from 6.9% for general health perceptions to 15.4% for vitality. We conclude that quality of life of new ESRD patients is substantially impaired. Comorbid conditions, hemoglobin, and residual renal function could explain poor quality of life only to a limited extent.

9089923,Effects of socioeconomic disadvantage and women's status on women's health in Cameroon.,"Research on the effects of socioeconomic disadvantage and women's status on women's health is important for policy makers in developing countries, where limited resources make it crucial to use existing maternal and child health care resources to the best advantage. Using a community-based data set collected prospectively in Cameroon, this study attempts to understand the extent to which socioeconomic factors and women's status have influences on women's health. The most important finding is that the burden of illness rests disproportionately on the economically disadvantaged women and on those with low social status. The long-term effects of social disadvantage are apparent in the excesses of morbidity among women who are not employed at the time of their children's birth, women living in poor neighborhoods, and those living in households without modern amenities. The maternal morbidity patterns during the postpartum period indicate that the women's reports of their recovery and health status from childbirth extend far beyond the first few weeks that previous studies have focused on. From a theoretical perspective, this study has demonstrated the importance of the ""intermediate"" framework for the study of women's health: the operations of effects of a number of background characteristics are mediated by more proximate determinants of women's health. These results remain robust even after controlling for other measured factors and after correcting for unmeasured heterogeneity and sample selection; this helps to dismiss the potential influence of some artifacts. While this study suggests that there are opportunities within the existing health care system for meeting many of the health care needs of the socially disadvantaged, further biobehavioral and psychosocial research is needed to determine how women's status and social disadvantage influence the demand for health care services, in order to ensure equitable as well as a more effective delivery of health care services and to break the vicious circle of disadvantage.",Social science & medicine (1982),1997 Apr,England,1997,90
9103325,Consumption of fruit and vegetables: how to motivate the population to change their behavior.,"This study reports the discrepancy between two methods to assess fruit and vegetable consumption in a Dutch adult population (N = 367). The consumption of fruit and vegetables was assessed by using a food frequency method (the number of grams of fruit and vegetables subjects ate every day) and by assessing subjects' own estimates of their fruit and vegetable intake. Besides the behavior, intention and determinants were measured using a theoretical model including attitude, self-efficacy and social influence to eat fruit and vegetables. Results showed that there were large differences between the self-rated and estimated objective consumption of fruit and vegetables. Subjects rated their own intake as much higher than their estimated actual intake. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses showed that the determinants predicted the self-rated consumption much better than the estimated consumption.",Cancer letters,1997 Mar 19,Ireland,1997,90
9103316,Health beliefs and health behaviours in subpopulation of stomach cancer families and in the control group.,"The aim of the study was to assess the relation between health-related beliefs concerning the importance of risk factors in stomach cancer and positive health practices in eating habits. A multicentre hospital-based incident case-control study with 431 female stomach cancer cases aged less than 75 years and an equal number of age-matched controls without cancer has been carried out in Poland. The respondents were asked about their opinions on relevance in cancer prevention of such factors as protective role of raw vegetables and fresh fruit, consumption of fats, alcohol and coffee or using table salt. The data were compared with information on eating habits and diet behaviours in the reference group. It was shown in both groups that beliefs about the importance of raw vegetables and fresh fruit were closely associated with high frequency of everyday consumption of vegetables and fruit; however, statistically significant differences were found between cases and controls as regards the frequency of eating vegetables and fresh fruit at every meal. The same relation was observed between the belief in an unhealthy role of consumption of fats and using the animal fat in cooking. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that a relation between beliefs and behaviours existed in the cases with the same demographic and social determinants.",Cancer letters,1997 Mar 19,Ireland,1997,90

DESIGN: Analysis of TB and AIDS surveillance data. SETTING: Catalonia, north-east Spain. PATIENTS: Two separate sources were used: (i) TB cases reported to the Catalan TB registry diagnosed between January 1982 and December 1993; (ii) AIDS cases reported to the AIDS Catalan registry diagnosed between January 1982 and December 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected and observed TB cases, and number and characteristics of AIDS cases presenting with TB. RESULTS: From 1987 to 1993 the annual TB crude incidence rate increased by 50% to a rate of 49.7 per 100,000, with a least 60% of the increase directly due to AIDS. During that period specific rates among children aged 0-4 years remained high at around 40 per 100,000. A total of 7,010 AIDS cases were diagnosed between 1988 and 1994, of whom 24.3% had TB. Multivariate analysis from those AIDS cases showed that besides male sex, young age, and urban residence, the strongest predictors of TB among AIDS cases were history of imprisonment (odds ratio, 2.16; P < 0.001) and intravenous drug use (odds ratio, 1.65; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The high rates of TB among children and young adults suggest that TB transmission has increased during this period, especially among people at high risk of AIDS. The determinants of individual risk of TB among AIDS patients act together, especially in prisons. The HIV/TB coepidemic is an emerging threat potentially for all and requires expanding targeted measures to prevent and control both disease in our setting.","AIDS (London, England)",1997 Mar 15,England,1997,90
9063337,The failure of academic epidemiology: witness for the prosecution.,"Academic epidemiology has failed to develop the scientific methods and the knowledge base to support the fundamental public health mission of preventing disease and promoting health through organized community efforts. As a basic science of public health, epidemiology should attempt to understand health and disease from a community and ecologic perspective as a consequence of how society is organized and behaves, what impact social and economic forces have on disease incidence rates, and what community actions will be effective in altering incidence rates. However, as taught in most textbooks and as widely practiced by academicians, epidemiology has become a biomedical discipline focused on the distribution and determinants of disease in groups of individuals who happen to have some common characteristics, exposures, or diseases. The ecology of human health has not been addressed, and the societal context in which disease occurs has been either disregarded or deliberately abstracted from consideration. By essentially assuming that risk factors for disease in individuals can be summed to understand the causes of disease in populations, academic epidemiology has limited itself to a narrow biomedical perspective, thereby committing the bio-medical fallacy of inferring that disease in populations can be understood by studying risk factors for disease in individuals. Epidemiology should be redefined as a study of the distribution and societal determinants of the health status of populations. This definition provides a stronger link to be the primary mission of public health and places an appropriate emphasis on the social, economic, environmental, and cultural determinants of population health. Epidemiology must cross the boundaries of other population sciences and add to its scope a macro-epidemiology, a study of causes from a truly population perspective, considering health and disease within the context of the total human environment.",American journal of epidemiology,1997 Mar 15,United States,1997,90

The symbolism and dynamics of condom use between sex workers and their clientele were explored. These issues were also investigated when sex workers negotiated sex with their personal partners. An additional focus was the extent to which HIV/AIDS influences women's condom use in these situations. Results demonstrate considerable contrast between factors influencing condom use in professional versus private sex situations. With clients, practical issues such as financial strain were the major obstacles to condom use. With personal sex partners, sex workers avoided condoms due to their negative symbolism. Condoms were seen as suggestive of filth, disease, infidelity, and mistrust. HIV/AIDS awareness had minimal impact on condom use. HIV/AIDS was viewed as a remote threat, overridden by immediate practical and emotional concerns. The intervention implications of condom symbolism and differential barriers to condom use are discussed.",African journal of reproductive health,1997 Mar,Nigeria,1997,90
9273118,"[The reduction of mother-child transmission of HIV infection in developing countries: potential intervention strategies, obstacles to implementation and perspectives. The Reduction of Mother-Child Transmission of HIV Infection in Africa Group].","Mother to child transmission (MCT) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the main cause of the spread of the HIV epidemic in the pediatric population. It is estimated that to date, three million children worldwide have been infected by HIV. The epidemic burden in developing countries is dramatic. Ninety-five percent of the world's HIV-infected women are living in developing countries. In industrialized countries, antiretroviral treatment of pregnant women and newborns with azidothymidine (AZT, ACTG 076 regimen) and discouraging breast feeding by HIV-infected mothers are effectively reducing MCT of HIV. However, there are three major obstacles to the systematic application of these strategies in developing countries: (a) difficulties in implementing the complex AZT administration and its corollary the avoidance of breast feeding; (b) the complexity of the logistics of the ACTG 076 regimen; (c) cost. Indeed, in developing countries the socioeconomic situation of the populations are precarious and health structures and services are underdeveloped. In addition, the anxiety and the reluctance of general population in the face of the HIV problem and the high prevalence of maternal anemia reduce the acceptability and safety of AZT treatment for pregnant women in developing regions. Only interventions that are applicable, acceptable, safe, affordable, of low cost and integrated into health system will be able to reduce HIV MCT. We now know that MCT occurs mostly during the perinatal period and the maternal viral load in blood, in cervical secretions and in breast milk appears to be the main determinant of transmission. Maternal vitamin A deficiency may also favor MCT of HIV. It is however possible that this association is confounded by the relationship between advanced maternal HIV disease (a known risk factor for transmission) and vitamin A deficiency. In spite of these uncertainties concerning determinants of MCT of HIV, several interventions have been designed. The first involves treating the mother with antiretroviral drugs for the perinatal period. The second is vaginal disinfection by application of virucidal antiseptics during the perinatal period. The third is to give vitamin A supplements to pregnant women and children. Finally, passive immunotherapy with anti-HIV antibodies applied to pregnant women and/or new born, may be beneficial. The feasibility, safety and efficacy of these potential interventions have not yet been demonstrated in developing countries. In view of the dramatic spread of HIV infection in these countries, the evaluation of these interventions is of utmost priority. These trials are necessary because of the public health emergency but should be performed in strict respect of human rights and medical ethics.","Sante (Montrouge, France)",1997 Mar-Apr,France,1997,90
9269889,Evaluation of the validity of the condom use self-efficacy scale (CUSES) in young men using two behavioral simulations.,"Assessment of behavioral skills remains critical to the evaluation of HIV prevention interventions; however, investigators often rely upon participant reports of self-efficacy to estimate such skills. We evaluated the relationship between self-efficacy beliefs for condom use and behavioral performance. Forty-three men completed the Condom Use Self-Efficacy Scale (CUSES) and participated in 2 behavioral assessments. Regression analyses indicated that the CUSES subscales relevant to negotiation of condom use did not account for a significant amount of variability in interpersonal skills; similarly, the CUSES subscale relevant to technical condom use skill did not account for variability in the condom application scores. We caution investigators against the assumption that higher self-efficacy reflects behavioral competence for HIV-risk reduction.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1997 Mar,United States,1997,90
9134518,Maternal-child health system and perinatal mortality in the United Arab Emirates.,"The United Arab Emirates has witnessed extensive social and economic development during the past 2 decades. Significant demographic changes have also taken place mainly as a result of the continuous flow of expatriates. The development of the health care delivery system resulted in the reduction of the infant mortality rate by 25% (10.93 per thousand live births by 1992), but the perinatal mortality rate has remained almost unchanged. Although maternal and child health care has improved dramatically, its limited impact on perinatal mortality can be attributed to underutilization of maternal health centers, absence of screening programs for mothers at high risk, absence of regionalization of perinatal care centers, poor maternal and neonatal transport facilities, absence of effective referral and cooperation and interaction between hospitals and health centers, the limited number of nursing and medical staff, and, finally, underutilization of available information to support and enhance research.

Using LISREL to estimate path coefficients, the findings support family satisfaction as directly and indirectly influenced by reciprocity, emotional well-being and family functioning. Explanatory variables accounted for 70% of the variance in predicting family satisfaction. Intrinsic rewards derived from giving care, positive affect, and family functioning contributed to higher levels of family satisfaction, while dysphoria contributed significantly to lower levels. Family satisfaction was also indirectly influenced by positive and negative exchanges received by the parent. Increasing caregivers awareness of the reciprocal nature of their relationships with all family members may be an effective strategy in helping them appreciate their contribution to the well-being of their parents and achieve satisfaction in the caregiving role.",Nursing research,1997 Mar-Apr,United States,1997,90

A core hospital team on lactation management and a sufficient number of health personnel skillful in breastfeeding counselling and adequate delivery room conditions are required to implement the Ten Steps. It is very difficult to provide these conditions in public hospitals with an excessive patient load.

9088057,Determinants of perceived health in patients with left ventricular dysfunction: a structural modeling analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Few studies have evaluated the determinants of perceived health in patients with chronic illness. The present study was designed to evaluate the role of biomedical, demographic, and psychosocial influences on global subjective health by means of a structural equation modeling approach. METHOD: A conceptual model of perceived health was tested in a subsample of patients (N = 146) from the multicenter Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) trial. Domain-specific quality of life constructs (emotional status, social support, and physical functioning), were assessed by means of multiple indicators. These latent (mediating) variables, along with six single-indicator biomedical and background variables, were modeled as predictors of a composite index of perceived health. RESULTS: A satisfactory fit was obtained for the proposed model, with practical fit indices ranging from .89 to .95. High levels of perceived health were associated with low levels of emotional distress and high levels of physical functioning. Social support was positively correlated with physical functioning and negatively associated with emotional distress. Among the background variables, no direct associations were observed between any of the single-indicator variables and perceived health. Several background variables (eg, age, income, walk-test scores) had indirect effects via associations with the latent variables of physical functioning and emotional distress. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of a structural modeling approach in assessing determinants of perceived health in patients with congestive heart failure. Further research is needed to evaluate the utility of the model in other patient populations.",Psychosomatic medicine,1997 Mar-Apr,United States,1997,90
9085396,A prospective study of the determinants of physical activity in rural fifth-grade children.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors that influence physical activity behavior is important in the design of intervention programs targeted at youth. METHODS: A prospective study design was used to identify the predictors of vigorous physical activity (VPA) (> or = 6 METs) and moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (> or = 3 METs) among 202 rural, predominantly African-American children. Selected social-cognitive determinants of physical activity were assessed via questionnaire in the fifth grade. Participation in VPA and MVPA was assessed via the previous day physical activity recall 1 year later in the sixth grade. RESULTS: For girls, participation in community sports, self-efficacy in overcoming barriers, enjoyment of school physical education, race (white > black), and perception of mother's activity level (active vs inactive) were significant predictors of VPA. For MVPA, participation in community sports and self-efficacy in overcoming barriers were significant predictors. For boys, self-efficacy in overcoming barriers was the only significant predictor of VPA, while beliefs regarding activity outcomes and participation in community sports were significant predictors of MVPA. CONCLUSION: Social-cognitive constructs such as physical activity self-efficacy, access to community physical activity outlets, and positive beliefs regarding physical activity outcomes are important predictors of future physical activity behavior among rural, predominantly African-American children.",Preventive medicine,1997 Mar-Apr,United States,1997,90
9085394,Development of questionnaires to measure psychosocial influences on children's physical activity.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate questionnaires used to measure psychosocial determinants of physical activity in preadolescent children. METHODS: Three theory-based questionnaires and a measure of after-school physical activity were administered to 422 fifth-grade students. A cross-validation design was employed for psychometric development of the scales, including factor analysis, reliability, and validation by correlating scale scores with intention to be physically active and after-school physical activity. RESULTS: The Social Influences scale contained a single factor. The Self-Efficacy scale contained three factors: support seeking, barriers, and positive alternatives. The Beliefs scale contained two factors: social outcomes and physical activity outcomes. Reliability coefficients ranged from about 0.50 to 0.78. Significant correlations were obtained between all six scales and intention in the development sample, and between five scales and intention in the validation sample. Significant correlations were obtained between social influence and self-efficacy barriers and physical activity in the development sample, and between social influences and physical activity in the validation sample. CONCLUSIONS: Three scales to measure psychosocial determinants of physical activity were refined for use with rural, predominantly African-American, preadolescent children, and shown to be both reliable and valid. Factor analysis resulted in interpretable subscales that may be used as variables.

9080569,"The integration of two health systems: social stratification, work and health in East and West Germany.","This is an analysis of system integration, social stratification and work for health status and health care in East and West Germany. It is based on aggregate data and representative survey data of random samples of 2554 adults in both subsystems. Findings show that there were marked differences in life-expectancy prior to unification. The integration of the two systems, which occurred almost totally with regard to terms of West German health care organization, shows adjustment problems in the East for the public Health-Care-Funds and few if any for ambulatory care. The work situation has an impact on health, but there are no significant differences for East versus West. Social stratification variables show an influence on subjective health status for education (East) and for income, social status (West), while physician utilization (despite a preference of specialists by those with higher status) is not significantly determined by stratification variables in either East or West Germany. Beyond the central focus on work and stratification determinants a major finding pertains to a comparatively worse health situation for the aged and for women in what was the former East Germany. System models of Capitalism versus Socialism fit the results and recent history of the two systems to only a limited degree, as the West German corporate health system shows clear limits in following free market principles. The East German system, regardless of its centralized organization and move towards a socialist system, never fully abandoned the traditional model of German health care. Unlike the East German health system, that of West Germany, with its general expansion to 92% of the population, shows an increasing effect for social redistribution. The latter may be a reason why standard indicators of social stratification show less of an impact on health and health care than expected, while conditions at work clearly determine the health of people-the latter being the case in both the former East and West Germany.",Social science & medicine (1982),1997 Mar,England,1997,90
9071256,Avoidable morbidity in infants. A classification based on diagnoses in administrative databases.,"OBJECTIVES: A hierarchical classification for avoidable morbidity in infants was developed based on a conceptual model for causes of morbidity. Experts rated the impact of risk factors and health services on diseases coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Classification Modification (ICD-9-CM). An etiologic framework was chosen for the classification because knowledge of etiology often suggests strategies for prevention. Causes of morbidity that cluster on the basis of similar risk factors might be avoided using similar strategies. METHODS: Diseases (346 different diagnoses) were rated by 16 general pediatricians; 12 attributes were considered, including the impact on disease occurrence and on severity of five risk factors, preventive health services, and medical treatment. Raters evaluated the impact of health services, constitutional risk factors, and environmental risk factors without regard for service site (eg, inpatient, emergency department, primary care office). Environmental risk factors categories, including family, social, and physical environments, were rated separately. The impact of health services was rated on prevention, treatment, and complications of care. RESULTS: Only ratings indicating that the impact of a risk factor category was substantial were used for the final classification of 275 diagnoses. Consistent with the multifactorial etiology of many diseases, many diagnoses had ratings indicating substantial impact of multiple risk factors. Five mutually exclusive clusters were derived from the 12 ratings based on factor analysis and recognized strategies for prevention. Ordered by level of avoidability, these clusters were termed vaccine-preventable, health-care quality indicators, environmental, environmental/constitutional, and constitutional. CONCLUSIONS: The usefulness of this classification for policy-oriented epidemiologic and health services research is grounded in the premise that prevention is the cardinal objective of child health policy. Cluster-specific hospitalization rates, ie, rates aggregated for all diagnoses falling in a cluster, might be used for allocating resources to interventions directed at environmental or health service determinants of morbidity. Widespread use of ICD-9-CM codes in hospital discharge and ambulatory databases suggests many potential applications for this classification of morbidity burden in population groups.",Medical care,1997 Mar,United States,1997,90

Lipman and colleagues show that single motherhood is associated with an increased risk of affective disorder and poverty and with increased rates of mental health services utilization. These findings have important implications for primary prevention interventions that focus on the social determinants of family health. Studies have shown that higher levels of psychological distress among single mothers are more closely related to their exposure to stressors than to their personal vulnerability to stress. Research has also shown that the stresses that affect single-parent families are greater in degree but not in kind than those that affect other families. Therefore, intervention programs that address the needs of all families are preferable to those that target specific types of families. Community-based primary prevention programs can promote the well-being of all families by improving the social and economic conditions in which they live.",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,1997 Mar 1,Canada,1997,90

DESIGN: Community coronary event register from 1985 to 1991. SETTING: City of Glasgow north of the River Clyde, population 196,000. SUBJECTS: 3991 men and 1551 women aged 25-64 years on the Glasgow MONICA coronary event register with definite or fatal possible or unclassifiable events according to the criteria of the World Health Organisation's MONICA project (monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of coronary events; proportion of subjects reaching hospital alive; case fatality in admitted patients and in community overall. RESULTS: Event rates increased with age for both sexes and were greater in men than women at all ages. The rate increased 1.7-fold in men and 2.4-fold in women from the least (Q1) to the most (Q4) deprived socioeconomic quarter. The socioeconomic gradient decreased with age and was steeper for women than men. The proportion treated in hospital (66%) decreased with age, was greater in women than men, and decreased in both sexes with increasing deprivation (age standardised odds ratio 0.82 for Q4 v Q1) Case fatality in hospital (20%) increased with age, was greater for women than men when age was standardised, and showed no strong socioeconomic pattern. Overall case fatality in the community (50%) increased with age, was similar between the sexes, and increased from Q1 to Q4 (age standardised odds ratio 1.12 in men, 1.18 in women). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic group affects not only death rates from myocardial infarction but also event rates and chance of admission. This should be taken into account when different groups of patients are compared. Because social deprivation is associated with so many more deaths outside hospital, primary and secondary prevention are more likely than acute hospital care to reduce the socioeconomic variation in mortality.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1997 Feb 22,England,1997,90

METHODOLOGY: Cohort. Children born in the city Pelotas, Brazil, in 1993. Cases were children admitted to hospital for 24 hours or more, between the ages of 28 and 364 days, with a diagnosis of pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 5,304 children in the cohort, 152 (2.9%) were hospitalized with pneumonia. The positive predictive value of the clinical diagnosis compared to the radiological assessment was 76%. Analysis by conditional logistic regression showed that social class and maternal schooling were strongly inversely associated with pneumonia Children of adolescent mothers were twice as likely to be admitted. The relative risk for children whose mothers were of parity three or greater was 2.8 relative to primiparae. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy of less than 10 kg was associated with a 40% increase in risk. CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic factors were important determinants of pneumonia admissions.

METHODS: In studies where determinants of disease are sought, it is suggested that the complex hierarchical inter-relationships between these determinants are best managed through the use of conceptual frameworks. Failure to take these aspects into consideration is common in the epidemiological literature and leads to underestimation of the effects of distal determinants.

Despite an increase in the movement of food around the world, there is still a wide spectrum of dietary patterns and the aim of the present study was to examine the association between a Mediterranean dietary pattern and mortality in a cohort of elderly people living in a North European Community. METHODS: Diet and nutritional status was studied among 202 men and women born 1914-1918 and living in a Danish Municipality (Roskilde) in 1988. They were followed for 6 years. RESULTS: A diet score, with seven dietary characteristics of the Mediterranean diet, was associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality. A one unit increase in the diet score predicted a 21% (95% confidence interval 2-36%) reduction in mortality. Subjects with high diet scores (> or = 4) had significantly higher plasma carotene levels than those with a low score and plasma carotene was negatively associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: A Mediterranean diet score predicts survival in a North European population. Plasma carotene may serve as an intermediate factor in this association.",International journal of epidemiology,1997 Feb,England,1997,90
9116164,Determinants of primate social organization: comparative evidence and new insights from Malagasy lemurs.,"The aim of this review is to summarize newly available information on lemur social systems, to contrast it with the social organization of other primates and to relate it to existing models of primate social evolution. Because of their evolutionary history, the primates of Madagascar constitute a natural experiment in social evolution. During millions of years of isolation, they converged with other primates only in the most fundamental way in the evolution of solitary, pair-living and group-living species, but deviate in several respects within these basic categories of social organization. Solitary lemurs remain poorly studied, but their social organization appears to be broadly similar to that of other solitary primates, even though the unexpected lack of sexual dimorphism may indicate that similar types of social organization can give rise to different mating systems. The determinants of a solitary lifestyle remain elusive. Pair-living lemurs show striking convergences with other monogamous primates in several behavioural traits, but also deviate in that the majority of species are at least partly nocturnal and do not exhibit direct paternal care of dependent young. Group-living lemurs have not evolved single-male groups, male-bonded and multi-level societies, and polyandrous groups may also be lacking. Female philopatry is common, but female bonds are generally weakly developed and eviction of females from natal groups is not unusual. Group-living lemurs also differ from anthropoids in that their groups have even adult sex ratios, smaller average size and may split up on a seasonal basis. Feeding competition, predation risk and reproductive competition can not fully explain these unusual aspects of lemur social organization. It has therefore been suggested that the social consequences of the risk of infanticide and of recent changes in activity may be ultimately responsible for these idiosyncracies of group-living lemurs, an explanation largely supported by the available evidence. Thus, social factors and fundamental life-history traits, in addition to ecological factors, contribute importantly to variation in social systems among lemurs, and possibly other primates. However, neither the diversity of lemur social systems, nor the evolutionary forces and mechanisms operating in these and other primates are yet fully understood.",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,1997 Feb,England,1997,90
9107004,Determinants of observed confidant support for divorced mothers.,"Marital separation can be a time of extreme stress and can significantly disrupt support networks and support processes when they are needed most. The purpose of this investigation was to test mechanisms of support erosion in a multimethod study of 138 divorced mothers and their confidants. Previous work was extended by using observational measures of confidant support in a process model including (a) maternal characteristics over time, (b) support person characteristics, and (c) relationship characteristics (intimacy and confidant relationship type). A hypothesized mechanism of erosion was supported in which ongoing maternal distress was positively associated with levels of confidant negativity, which in turn was related to lower levels of observed support. Having a partner was related to more intimacy than was having family and friends. Contrary to expectation, however, having a partner was related to lower levels of support, and intimacy was not related to observed support.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1997 Feb,United States,1997,90
9104086,Behavioral and social sciences at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Critical disciplines for public health.,"The mission of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Fifty years ago, CDC's efforts were focused on epidemiologic and laboratory studies of malaria, typhus, and plague. Today, CDC's activities cover a broad range of diseases and conditions, and a broader range of disciplines are required to address these diverse public health problems. The behavioral and social sciences have a critical role to play in helping the public understand risk group characteristics and the frequency, context, and determinants of risky behaviors and in developing, implementing, and assessing prevention programs. CDC is taking steps to foster an environment in which behavioral and social sciences can flourish and to integrate these sciences into all of CDC's prevention activities.

9090699,The Pharmacists' Implementation of Pharmaceutical Care (PIPC) model.,"PURPOSE: Study purpose was to develop a theoretical framework that will explain pharmacists' behavior relative to the provision of pharmaceutical care. The model was developed from four attitude models by testing their predictive validity relative to pharmaceutical care implementation. Four hypotheses and one research question were investigated to identify determinants of behavioral intention and behavior. METHODS: 617 community pharmacists in the state of Florida, U.S.A., were surveyed twice using mail survey methodology to collect data. The first survey assessed community pharmacists' attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, past behavior recency, self-efficacies, instrumental beliefs and affect. The second survey assessed pharmacists' behavior relative to the implementation of pharmaceutical care. After establishing reliability and validity of measures, regression analysis was used to test hypotheses and research question investigated. RESULTS: The Pharmacists' Implementation of Pharmaceutical Care (PIPC) model developed postulates that (i) behavior is directly determined by past behavior recency, behavioral intention and perceived behavioral control; (ii) psychological appraisal processes-instrumental beliefs, self-efficacies, and affect toward means-influence behavior through past behavior recency; and (iii) behavioral intention is determined by attitude, social norm and perceived behavioral control. CONCLUSIONS: The PIPC model provides a formal scientifically validated theoretical framework which can be used to design successful intervention for pharmaceutical care implementation.",Pharmaceutical research,1997 Feb,United States,1997,90
9084997,Serum immunoglobulin G subclasses in healthy infants and children in Greece.,"Serum concentrations of immunoglobulin IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 were determined by radial immunodiffusion in a sample of 414 healthy Greek children, who were admitted to the major Teaching Hospital for Children in Athens for minor surgical operations. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple regression after logarithmic transformation of the immunoglobulin values. There was a statistically significant increase of IgG3 with age, whereas IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 levels reached a turning point at the age of five years. Older than 5 years male children were found to have marginally higher IgG4 levels than females. Low socioeconomic class was positively and significantly associated (9% increase) with IgG1 levels only among the older age group. History of frequent infections was associated with a 16% increase of IgG1 levels in the younger (less than 5 years) (p = 0.01) and with a 47% increase of IgG4 among the older age group (p = 0.03). Atopic history was associated with a 16% increase of IgG1 in the younger (p = 0.02). The findings of the present study provide an insight on the determinants and the clinical significance of IgG subclass levels among children.",European journal of epidemiology,1997 Feb,Netherlands,1997,90
9059478,Exercise induced bronchospasm in Ghana: differences in prevalence between urban and rural schoolchildren.,"BACKGROUND: As more developing countries adopt a westernised style of living, an increase in the prevalence of asthma can be expected to occur in these areas. A study was undertaken to establish the normal response to exercise in Ghanaian children and to use these normal values to determine the prevalence of exercise induced bronchospasm (EIB) in urban rich (UR), urban poor (UP), and rural (R) school children. Skin test reactivity to common inhalant allergens in UR, UP, and R children with and without EIB was also investigated. METHODS: Two hundred children aged 9-16 years without a previous history of respiratory symptoms were randomly selected and underwent free running exercise testing. A normal response to exercise was defined as the group mean change in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) +/- 2 standard deviations. This value was used to identify the prevalence of EIB in UR, UP, and R schoolchildren. A total of 1095 children from three different schools underwent exercise testing (220 UP, 599 UR, 276 R), after which 916 children underwent skin prick testing to six common inhalant allergens (D farinae, D pteronyssinus, cat, dog, Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans). RESULTS: From the results of exercise testing in asymptomatic children the normal range was defined as a fall in PEFR of < 12.5% after exercise. Thirty four children were classified as having EIB on the basis of the above definition, giving an overall prevalence of 3.1%. The prevalence of EIB was significantly higher in UR children (4.7%) than in both UP (2.2%; p < 0.05) and R children (1.4%; p < 0.01). However, the prevalence rates in the UP and R children were similar. The prevalence of atopy in the whole population was 4.4%. Of the children with EIB, 10% were skin test positive to at least one of the allergens tested. The prevalence of atopy was significantly higher in UR children (6.55%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.5% to 9.2%) than in UP (2.9%, 95% CI 0.9% to 6.7%) and R children (1.5%, 95% CI 0.4% to 3.7%), respectively (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EIB and atopy is higher in urban rich than in urban poor or rural children suggesting that, in addition to genetic predisposition, social and environmental factors such as wealth, life style, and housing are important determinants of these phenotypes.",Thorax,1997 Feb,England,1997,90
9040268,Determinants of exercise-induced ST segment depression in patients with coronary artery disease: a multivariate approach.,"The purpose of this study was to delineate among the usually gathered parameters in an electrocardiographic exercise test the determinants of its positive outcome (delta ST decreases > or = 1 mm measured at 80 msec from the J point). The authors studied 832 patients investigated with Bruce's exercise testing and with diagnostic coronary arteriography, all of whom were shown to have significant coronary artery disease (diameter stenosis > or = 50%). Twenty-five demographic, clinical, electrocardiographic, exercise, and anatomic/hemodynamic parameters were analyzed. The stepwise forward logistic regression analysis retained seven among them as significant independent predictors: four as positive contributors: (1) three-vessel and/or left main disease (P = 0.0000), (2) Gensini's angio-graphic score for disease extent (P = 0.0025), (3) anginal pain during the test (P = 0.0000), and (4) age (P = 0.0031) and three as negative contributors: (1) resting heart rate (P = 0.0004), (2) history of old myocardial infarction (P = 0.0019), and (3) pathological Q waves at the resting ECG (P = 0.0018). These findings establish standards that permit the prediction of the positive electrocardiographic exercise outcome in patients with significant coronary disease.",Angiology,1997 Feb,United States,1997,90
9017952,Medicaid participation among urban primary care physicians.,"OBJECTIVES: This article describes Medicaid participation among office-based primary care physicians in cities and examines its determinants. METHODS: Data used in this study were collected through the 1993 and 1994 American Medical Association Socioeconomic Monitoring System telephone surveys. The sample includes 1,300 primary care physicians. Our multivariate model includes a variety of personal, practice, community, and policy factors thought to influence participation. Logistic regression was used to examine determinants of accepting any Medicaid patients and ordinary least square regression was used to examine determinants of the extent of participation among participants. RESULTS: The authors found that 19% of respondents did not participate in Medicaid and 62% had practices with 9% or fewer Medicaid patients. Multivariate analyses indicated that Medicaid payment levels were not associated with observed patterns of Medicaid participation. Community sociodemographic characteristics and demand from Medicaid-eligibles, by contrast, play a significant role in influencing observed levels of participation. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies other than raising Medicaid payment levels will be needed to achieve equitable access to office-based primary care for the poor residing in cities.",Medical care,1997 Feb,United States,1997,90
9004368,Past or present? Childhood living conditions and current socioeconomic status as determinants of adult health.,"The aim was to study the associations of childhood living conditions, together with past and present socioeconomic status, with adult health among Finnish men and women. The data were derived from a nationwide interview Survey on Living Conditions collected by Statistics Finland in 1986. The sample represents the non-institutional Finnish population aged 15 years or older. The number of respondents was 12,057 and the response rate 87%. In this study we analysed 30-year-old and older subjects. Two health indicators were analysed: first, limiting long-standing illness; and second, self-assessed health as ""below good"". Four different indicators of childhood living conditions were included: one concerning economic problems, and three concerning family related social problems during childhood. Additionally, the degree of urbanisation of the childhood living area was examined. Past and present socioeconomic status were measured by the status of origin, i.e. the respondent's father's and mother's education, and the status of destination, i.e. the respondent's own current education. Economic problems during childhood were associated with current health. The association of childhood social problems with health was somewhat weaker and less consistent than that of economic problems. A comparison of the mutual impacts of economic and social problems, respectively, shows that economic problems are stronger and more independent determinants of adult health than social problems. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, past and, particularly, present socioeconomic status are both important determinants of adult health. Current socioeconomic status showed strongest associations with adult health, but living conditions during upbringing, particularly economic problems and status of origin, were also significant predictors.",Social science & medicine (1982),1997 Feb,England,1997,90

The target group analysis provided information on credibility problems and negative attitudes toward health education. Men operate with more knowledge types and direct their health behavior toward experiential knowledge rather than theoretical knowledge. The strategy aims at the needs of the target group by focusing on experiences and action-oriented information at individual and social levels.

The Health Belief Model (HBM), supplemented by other factors (locus of control, self-efficacy, health value, and social support), was used as a theoretical model. In multiple regression analyses both DA (p<.01) and SMBG (p<.001). SMBG showed strong associations with self-efficacy in SMBG (p,.001) and net benefits of SMBG (p<.001). The revised models explained 14% and 21% of the variation in DA and SMBG, respectively. The results suggest that although perceived net benefits are important determinants of both SMBG and DA, DA is also related to diabetes support, whereas SMBG is more strongly related to perceived self-efficacy. Thus self-care regimen should be planned individually for diabetic patients.",International journal of behavioral medicine,1997,England,1997,90

It argues that Weekley has not fully appreciated the context for local population losses, namely the emergence of a new structural relationship between people, households, and dwellings, and the growing tension between production and consumption interests in rural locales. Moreover, the paper disputes claims that depopulation is triggered by the actions of either the landowner or the planner. Drawing on case study material informed by critical realism, it argues that planners and landowners have been drawn into an asymmetrical power relationship. This has tended to buttress landed interests and, in so doing, reproduce mechanisms which protect the less populous communities from growth and change.""",Journal of rural studies,1997 Jan,England,1997,90

The data suggest that the new economic policy induced a surge in permanent migration during the post-reform years. Such positive impact of the reform on permanent migration has started to fade away in 1985, as government relaxed its control over residence. Moreover, market mechanisms started playing a more important role in employment, exchange, and consumption. The data also suggest that the new economic policy has particularly favored the better educated, and thereby increased educational differentials between permanent migrants and nonmigrants. For all other characteristics examined, the results show consistently that post-reform migrants are less differentiated from nonmigrants than their pre-reform counterparts.""

METHOD: Observational cross-sectional analysis of 414 primary care patients in a rural community health center and 125 ESRD patients requiring hemodialysis in two community dialysis units. The Duke Health Profile (DUKE) anxiety-depression scale was used to assess mental health; the DUKE disability scale, to indicate disablement; the Duke Social Support and Stress Scale, to measure support and stress; and the Duke Severity of Illness Scale, to rate severity of illness. RESULTS: Perceived current mental health in terms of anxiety and depression symptoms was worse for primary care than for ESRD patients, and perceived current disablement was no different for the two groups. Patients' perception of their health status and of stress from family members were more closely associated with their level of anxiety and depression symptoms than were their diagnostic profiles or overall severity of illness. In turn, their level of anxiety and depression symptoms was the principal correlate of their disablement. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration of strong relationships among anxiety and depression symptoms, disablement, and family stress in these two very different patient populations should stimulate further research and motivate clinicians to evaluate all three parameters as part of routine patient care.",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,1997,United States,1997,90
9561644,"Aging, food, culture and health.","International comparison of food intake and health studies amongst the aged is providing new insight into the importance of food culture in social context for healthy aging. At same time the possible variance in eating behavior compatible with good health requires consideration. The IUNS (International Union of Nutritional Sciences) FHILL (Food Habits in Later Life) Project, comprises (1) a morbidity study on about 2,000 elderly in 13 communities (now available on CD Rom) and (2) a mortality follow-up study. In the morbidity study, a total health assessment score or Later Life Status Score (LLSS) has been considered in relation to non-nutritional and nutritional factors. The elderly Greek cohorts aged 70+ in Melbourne. Australia (M = 94, F = 95) and Spata, Greece (M = 51, F = 53) have been used as a model for multivariate analyses to determine separately the importance of non-nutritional (well-being, memory, general health, medication-use, activities of daily living, exercise, social activity and social networks scores) and nutritional variables (intake of food groups g/day, food group variety scores, nutrients) in accounting for LLSS. A mortality follow-up study on the elderly cohort in Spata, Greece has also been completed and published. The findings from these preliminary analyses on the Greek cohorts will be reviewed as an example of how food culture may be influencing both quality of life and survival in Greek elderly. The most important non-nutritional determinants of LLSS in Greeks included: mobility and independence (exercise and activities of daily living), well-being and memory (collectively explained 80% of the variation of LLSS). For nutritional variables, a high intake and variety of plant foods (in particular vegetables, legumes and fruit); a high intake and variety of seafood and a low intake of meat emerged with statistical and biological significance. Results from the mortality study also agree with findings from the morbidity study--particularly the importance of the overall traditional greek food culture, with its emphasis on plant derived food of various kinds, as opposed to individual food categories, in protecting against premature death.

9499467,[Employment after the first myocardial infarct and rehabilitation].,"Which are the determinants of return to work in middle aged myocardial infarction patients?

Our aim was to determine the predictive power of social and psychological as compared to cardiologic factors. These factors were operating under two relevant conditions: 1. relative social homogeneity of the samples; 2. rehabilitation including qualified cardiologic diagnostic and an interdisciplinary therapeutic program. As a result we found age--at the same time a biologic and a social variable--to be the best independent predictor in logistic regression as in discriminant analysis. Age was followed by hopelessness in the year before MI, ST segment depression in physical stress test and, with restriction, marital status. Thus our study points to three factors limiting employment status: age as a biological and social limit for achievement, ST segment depression as a coronary and ongoing hopelessness as a psychological limit, with a social background of living alone in some cases. It is important for cardiac rehabilitation to take into account not only biological but also social and psychological limits of work capacity. Comprehensive care tries to modify these limits but cannot remove them.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1997,Switzerland,1997,90

Of the survivors (N = 143), 70 percent agreed (N = 100). The purpose was to describe the population from physical, social, and psychological points of view; to characterize centenarians with various health conditions and diverse degrees of autonomy and life satisfaction; and to identify factors at 100 years that predict future survival. RESULTS: Eighty-two percent were women, 25 percent lived in their own home, 37 percent in old age homes, and 38 percent in nursing homes. Socioeconomic status showed a similar distribution compared to nationally representative data. Fifty-two percent managed activities of daily living with or without minor assistance. The incidence of severe diseases was low. In 39 percent a disorder of the circulatory system was found. Thirty-nine percent (women) and 11 percent (men) had had at least one hip fracture. Twenty percent had good hearing and good vision. Twenty-seven percent were demented according to DSM III-R criteria. Means on cognitive tests (word-list, digit-span, learning, and memory) were lower compared to seventy to eighty year old groups. The variation in performance was extremely widespread. Personality profiles (MMPI) indicated that the centenarians were more responsible, capable, easygoing and less prone to anxiety than the population in general. Extensive neuropathological investigation revealed no major diseases or large lesions but mild through multiple changes. RESULTS suggest that centenarians are a special group genetically.

9406337,Factors influencing priorities in hospital social work departments: a director's perspective.,"This study compares the perceived influence of several factors, each representing a popular perspective, on priority setting in hospital social work departments: (1) leader characteristics of the director; (2) organizational characteristics of the department and hospital; and (3) the preferences of constituency groups. The authors surveyed the views of directors to ascertain influences on their allocation of resources. We find that organizational factors and the preferences of constituents are the strongest determinants of departmental priorities, with leader attributes playing a less influential role. An interesting discovery is that each factor's influence varies depending on the nature of the priority area. We conclude that all three explanations for how performance priorities are shaped-a political model, a leader influence model and an institutional model-find support.

9399119,"Economy, politics, and health status in Cuba.","An economic contraction occurred in Cuba at the beginning of the 1990s, of a magnitude greater than in any developed country in the last half century. This resulted primarily from the disappearance of the European socialist bloc and simultaneous tightening of the U.S. government's blockade at a time when Cuba was engaged in correcting its main economic problems. The economic crisis affected a number of areas of Cuban society. The state adopted a series of measures to cope with the socioeconomic situation, which have yielded positive results in the social and economic fields, as well as some undesirable results. In the health sector, the economic crisis has mainly reduced the availability of resources and has adversely affected some health determinants and some aspects of the population's health status. Despite the prevailing economic difficulties, the government is determined to preserve the country's achievements in health, and to develop them still further. The solution is not privatization or the introduction of health insurance systems or similar measures. Rather, Cuba will seek greater rationality and economic efficiency in the health sector. It has ratified the principles that the state should continue to finance the health system and maintain universal coverage and accessibility through free services.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1997,United States,1997,90
9366000,Determinants of medication compliance in schizophrenia: empirical and clinical findings.,"Advances in psychopharmacology have produced medications with substantial efficacy in the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and the prevention of relapse or symptom exacerbation after an acute episode. In the clinical setting, the individual patient's acceptance or rejection of prescribed pharmacological regimens is often the single greatest determinant of these treatments' effectiveness. For this reason, an understanding of factors that impede and promote patient collaboration with prescribed acute and maintenance treatment should inform both pharmacological and psychosocial treatment planning. We review the substantive literature on medication adherence in schizophrenia and describe a modified health belief model within which empirical findings can be understood. In addition to factors intrinsic to schizophrenia psychopathology, medication-related factors, available social support, substance abuse comorbidity, and the quality of the therapeutic alliance each affect adherence and offer potential points of intervention to improve the likelihood of collaboration. Because noncompliance as a clinical problem is multidetermined, an individualized approach to assessment and treatment, which is often best developed in the context of an ongoing physician-patient relationship, is optimal. The differential diagnosis of noncompliance should lead to interventions that target specific causal factors thought to be operative in the individual patient.",Schizophrenia bulletin,1997,United States,1997,90
9353675,Unemployment and cancer: a literature review.,"With a tenth of the labour force involuntarily out of work, unemployment has become an important element among the socioeconomic determinants of health in the rich countries. Unemployed men have an excess cancer mortality of close to 25% compared with that of all men in the labour force. The available data from various countries indicate that this excess risk is found both in periods when the unemployment rate is about 1% and in periods when it is about 10%. Furthermore, it persists long after the start of unemployment and it does not disappear when social class, smoking, alcohol intake, and previous sick days are controlled for. The excess cancer mortality comes mainly from lung cancer, and the increased risk of lung cancer does not disappear when social class and number of previous sick days are controlled for. Unemployment does not increase smoking, but unemployed men have a slightly higher smoking prevalence before unemployment. However, as the excess lung cancer risk among unemployed men remains after controlling for social class, it seems unlikely that it can be explained only by differences in smoking prior to unemployment.",IARC scientific publications,1997,France,1997,90
9353673,"Infection with Helicobacter pylori and parasites, social class and cancer.","Three genera of parasites are known or suspected risk factors for cancer in humans: Schistosoma, Opisthorchis and Clonorchis. No adequate information is available on the determinants of infections related to social class. Infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is an important cause of stomach cancer. Studies, in particular from the United Kingdom and the United States of America, strongly suggest that social class factors, especially those acting during childhood, are determinants of the infection, with odds ratios of seroprevalence of the order of 1.5-5 for lower social class as compared with higher social class. A conservative estimate of the contribution of social class, acting through an increased prevalence of H. pylori infection, to the burden of stomach cancer gives a figure of over 50,000 stomach cancers per year worldwide, or 8% of all stomach cancers. In countries with both high and low prevalence of infection with H. pylori, it is likely that a sizeable proportion of this difference is due to social-class-related risk factors of infection.",IARC scientific publications,1997,France,1997,90
9347588,Life-cycle aspects of poverty among older women.,"This article focuses on the relationship between women's economic status earlier in their lives and their poverty status in old age. Previous research on the determinants of poverty among aged women has documented the socioeconomic and demographic correlates of the poor, and has examined the financial impact of adverse later-life events such as widowhood, deterioration of health, and loss of employment. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women (NLSMW), we find that most women who experience these types of adverse events in their later years do not become poor and that a large majority of older NLSMW respondents who were poor in 1991-92 were poor earlier in their adult lives. Whether women are impoverished by adverse later-life events depends on their economic resources just prior to the event. But, the financial resources available in old age, in turn, depend very much on their long-term economic status throughout much of their adult lives. This article underscores the fact that for most older women, these adverse events do not appear to precipitate poverty spells--at least not within the first couple of years--and directs attention at longer term circumstances that make some women more vulnerable to poverty.",Social security bulletin,1997,United States,1997,90

Health of workers has many determinants, and a multidisciplinary, integrated approach is important. An overview of trends in workplace health promotion shows that current thinking has changed from a narrowly based risk-factors approach aimed at individual behaviour changes, to an integrative approach aimed at creating health-promoting workplaces. The health-promoting workplace has 'an all-encompassing approach that empowers workers and employers to improve all facets of their health'. There are gaps in knowledge, at the state and national levels, relevant to the planning and assessment of workplace health.

Various socio-behavioral factors are found to play a significant role in determining the health conditions of aged people. Also, illiteracy and poverty are found to have their own impact on health during aging. It is also noted that due to adverse familial relationships, many stress-related disorders occur which may result in the poor health of the elderly.

9277007,High mortality despite good care-seeking behaviour: a community study of childhood deaths in Guinea-Bissau.,"The care-seeking behaviour of mothers of 125 children deceased aged 1-30 months was investigated by verbal autopsy in an urban area of Guinea-Bissau. A total of 93% of the children were seen at a health centre or hospital during the 2 weeks before death. In a previous survey covering the period 1987-90 we found that 78% of the children who died had presented for consultation (8); despite this increase in care seeking, infant mortality had not decreased. Comparison of elapsed time from disease onset to first consultation between children who died and matched surviving controls indicated that the interval was shorter for children who died than for those who survived (odds ratio (OR) = 0.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5-0.99). Of the 125 terminally ill children, 56 were hospitalized. A total of 20 children died on the way to hospital or while waiting in the outpatient clinic. Lack of hospital beds resulted in 15 mothers being refused hospitalization for their child. Of hospitalized children, 42% were discharged as improved or recovered during the 30 days preceding death. These results reveal a need for improved hospital admission criteria, improved recognition of the symptoms of serious illness, better discharge criteria, and the implementation of quality assurance systems for health services.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,1997,Switzerland,1997,90
9221653,[Shigellosis in Moscow: new trends in the epidemiological process and their social determinants].,"In Moscow for a long time morbidity in acute enteric infections, and in Shigella infections as their main constituent, steadily decreased. In recent years the opposite tendency was noted: a rise in morbidity. A pronounced tendency for Shigella infections, especially Flexner's dysentery, to affect older ages was observed. New risk groups, including adults busy in ""shuttle"" commerce and different asocial elements, appeared. The number of lethal cases considerably increased. Unusual manifestations of the epidemic process are socially determined and reflect a decrease in the living standards of the population, sharp social changes in its way of life and social instability in the country. Sporadic morbidity with low focality prevails. The so-called chronic multifactor alimentary route of infection transmission is mainly realized; its neutralization presents great objective difficulties.","Zhurnal mikrobiologii, epidemiologii, i immunobiologii",1997 Jan-Feb,Russia (Federation),1997,90
9213093,Physical activity among persons with disabilities--a public health perspective.,"Regular physical activity, sports participation, and active recreation are essential behaviors for the prevention of disease, promotion of health, and maintenance of functional independence. This health behavior is essential for persons with and without disabilities. Population-based surveys have consistently demonstrated that persons with disabilities are less likely to be physically active, compared to persons without such limitations. However, these observations are based on relatively few surveys and are dependent on physical activity assessment methods that may not be sensitive and specific enough for persons with disabilities. Studies clearly demonstrate that many persons, representing a variety of selected disabilities, can adapt to increased levels of physical activity, as evidenced by alterations in various components of physical fitness. More importantly, other studies consistently provide evidence that participation in regular physical activity among persons with selected impairments and disabilities results in improved functional status and quality of life. Further efforts are critically needed in the area of the development of physical activity assessment methodology for persons with disabilities. Methods need to be developed that will provide survey researchers and those in public health the capacity to measure and monitor activity patterns of persons with disabilities. This information is important not only for public health officials but also health policy analysts, service providers, and disability advocacy groups. Further understanding of the role of physical activity in the maintenance of function and independence among persons with disabilities is needed. The understanding of environmental and social barriers to physical activity among persons with disabilities needs further exploration. Finally, physical activity determinants research among persons with disabilities, including the role of assistive technology as well as maximizing the intrinsic capacity of functional anatomy and physiology, needs to be addressed.",Exercise and sport sciences reviews,1997,United States,1997,90
9209584,Determinants of female dispersal in Thomas langurs.,"Female dispersal occurs in a number of primate species. It may be related to: avoidance of inbreeding, reduction in food competition, reduction of predation risk, or avoidance of infanticide in combination with mate choice. Female dispersal was studied for a 5-year period in a wild population of Thomas langurs (Presbytis thomasi) that lived in one-male multi-female groups. Juvenile and adult individuals of both sexes were seen to disperse. Females appeared to transfer unhindered between groups, mostly from a larger group to a recently formed smaller one. They transferred without their infants and when not pregnant, and seemed to transfer preferentially during periods when extra-group males were harassing their group. During these inter-group encounters extra-group males seemed to try to commit infanticide. Thus, the timing of female transfer was probably closely linked to infanticide avoidance. Moreover, females seemed to transfer when the resident male of their group was no longer a good protector. The observations in the present study suggest that females transferred to reduce the risk of infanticide. Female dispersal may have another ultimate advantage as well, namely inbreeding avoidance. Due to the dispersal of both females and males the social organization of Thomas langurs was rather fluid. New groups were formed when females joined a male; male takeovers were not observed. Bisexual groups had only a limited life span, because all adult females of a bisexual group could emigrate. This pattern of unhindered female dispersal affects male reproductive strategies, and in particular it might lead to infanticidal behavior during inter-group encounters.",American journal of primatology,1997,United States,1997,90
9176910,Physicians' view of their work environment and organisation.,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess physicians' perception of their work, organisation and professional development. METHODS: All major disciplines at a major regional hospital were studied. Participants responded to a structured questionnaire concerning broad aspects of physicians' work. The response rate was approximately 78%, with 356 respondents. RESULTS: The results show that even though physicians are overall very satisfied with their work, they list high workload, lack of influence on daily work and work processes as dissatisfactory. Skills utilisation and development are some major areas for improvement. Physicians that were aware of the overall mission statement for their hospital were more satisfied with and informed about departmental goals. Perceived organisational efficiency and leadership qualities were important determinants of perceived workload and work climate. CONCLUSIONS: Stress among physicians is a growing occupational health concern, impacting negatively on patient care. In this article important individual and organisational factors related to physician stress are identified and suggestions to assess stress and intervene are provided.",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,1997,Switzerland,1997,90

9125369,Integration of coping and social support perspectives: implications for the study of adaptation to chronic diseases.,"In this article, empirical studies dealing with the relationship between coping and social support are discussed in order to identify promising themes for research on adaptation to chronic diseases. Although only few studies deal with this issue explicitly, the review reveals that four ways to study the relationship between coping and social support can be distinguished: (a) seeking social support as a coping strategy; (b) social support as a coping resource; (c) social support as dependent on the way individual patients cope; and (d) coping by a social system. It is argued that all four ways of integrating coping and social support contribute to a better understanding of adaptation to chronic diseases. However, exploring the interrelatedness of both concepts by studying social support as a coping resource and social support as dependent on the patient's own coping behavior appear to be especially fruitful in the short term, as they: (a) provide a better insight in the social determinants of coping, and (b) may help to clarify the way social support affects health and well-being.",Clinical psychology review,1997,United States,1997,90

Based on Ajzen and Fishbein's theory of planned behavior, open-ended questions were used in audio-taped face-to-face interviews with 25 married 19-44-year-old Jordanian Muslim women. A majority of respondents interviewed were currently using an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception. Few women were using oral contraceptives, condoms, or the rhythm method and none of them reported using foam or a diaphragm. Content analyses of narrative transcriptions suggest the individual's concerns for family and individual well-being, as well as husbands' and families' opinions, may influence women's contraceptive behavior in this population.",Health care for women international,1997 Jan-Feb,England,1997,90
9111158,Prevalence and determinants of hypertension in the Indian social class and heart survey.,"To determine the association of socio-economic status (SES) and prevalence of hypertension and its risk factors in a rural population, a cross sectional survey was conducted in two randomly selected villages in the Moradabad district in North India. There were 1935 residents aged over 25 (984 men and 951 women) who were randomly selected and categorised into social classes 1-4 depending upon SES based on occupation, housing conditions, land holding, total per capita income, ownership of consumer durables and education. The prevalence of hypertension diagnosed by JNC V criteria (>140/90 mm Hg) was significantly higher among social class 1 and 2 and showed positive relation with SES in both sexes. Among social class 1 and 2 subjects, there was a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity and sedentary lifestyle. Logistic regression analysis with adjustment of age showed that SES had a positive relation with hypertension (odds ratio: men 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.14; women 1.08, 95% CI 1.05-1.13), body mass index (odds ratio: men 1.12, 1.08-1.18; women 1.11, 1.06-1.16) and sedentary lifestyle (odds ratio: men 1.45, 1.32-1.58; women 1.38, 1.26-1.49). Only weak but significant associations were observed with smoking, alcohol and salt intake. The association of hypertension with social class was reduced after adjustment of body mass index, sedentary lifestyle, smoking and salt intake (odds ratio: men 0.96, 0.81-1.14; women 0.73, 0.54-1.04). There was an increase in the prevalence of hypertension and age-specific blood pressure (BP) with increasing age in both sexes. The overall prevalence of hypertension by WHO criteria (>160/95) was 4.6% and by JNC V criteria 20.8%, and the rates were comparable in both sexes. Social class 1 and 2 subjects in rural North India have a higher prevalence of hypertension and its risk factors of overweight and sedentary lifestyle.",Journal of human hypertension,1997 Jan,England,1997,90
9110831,Cues to action in the process of changing lifestyle.,"This research has been carried out in order to evaluate cues to action in health behavior. Which cues produce changes and how does the process of change proceed? In-depth qualitative interviews based on the Grounded Theory Method were made with 21 40-year-old men. Ten men were interviewed three times during a 1-year period to trace the process of change. In total 40 interviews were carried out during 1989-1990. All the interviewees were randomly selected from the population registers in the municipalities of Aarhus and Vejle. The main themes of the interviews are changes in previous health behavior, motivation for intentions to change in health behavior, and the role of health education in the process of change. Health behavior determinants seem to be knowledge, attitude, confidence, social influence, experiences and possibilities for change. Individuals typically exhibit a wide range of these determinants which makes it difficult to affect behavioral change through health education. Cues to action seem to arise from social influence, experiences, or underlying shifts in the possibilities of change. Experiences and social influence due to the health behavior in question seem to initiate changes in confidence, attitude and thereby motivation to change. Cues to action arising from these determinants are categorized as own illness or illness among friends and relatives, changes in self-perception, exceeded limits determined by the behavior in question, and social pressure. Shifts in the possibilities for change, such as change of partner or other life events, produce changes also affecting health behavior. A strategy to initiate changes in health behavior could be to create cues to action through personal experiences in the context of a specific health behavior or to establish contact to people when they are experiencing new life circumstances.",Patient education and counseling,1997 Jan,Ireland,1997,90
9110829,Effectiveness of health education and health promotion: meta-analyses of effect studies and determinants of effectiveness.,"Interventions to promote health that have been developed over the last 20 years in the relatively new scientific health education tradition, have often been evaluated for their effectiveness. Meta-analyses of effect studies on various subfields, show that these interventions generally have quite substantial effects (mean effect sizes, ES, of 0.46 for primary prevention and 0.49 for secondary prevention and patient education). A planned and systematic application of social science theory in intervention development is a strong determinant of effectiveness. However, learning principles such as rewards and feedback, that have been shown to increase effectiveness, are often not or not adequately applied. Also, too few interventions focus on possibilities to facilitate the desired behavior (such as reminders, financial stimuli, and skills improvement). The potential effectiveness of interventions in practice may be increased by systematic development of adoption and implementation strategies, including the creation of 'linkage systems' between intervention developers and representatives of the target and user systems.",Patient education and counseling,1997 Jan,Ireland,1997,90
9068417,"Influence of breeding season and reproductive status on male reproductive characteristics in the common mole-rat, Cryptomys hottentotus hottentotus.","The effects of breeding season and reproductive status on male reproduction were investigated in the common mole-rat (Cryptomys hottentotus hottentotus), a co-operatively breeding rodent that exhibits seasonal reproduction and a reproductive division of labour. Testicular anatomical and histological morphometrics, and selected sperm parameters were studied in 50 males from 17 wild caught colonies. Males exhibited no apparent manifestation of season on testicular activity: spermatogenesis and sperm quality (motility and percentage normal morphology) were similar in the reproductively active and inactive periods. This maintenance of reproductive activity during the non-reproductive period is essential in C. h. hottentotus males, as this period coincides with the period of maximal dispersal opportunities. Such reproductive activation in dispersing males may aid intersexual recognition, and assist pair-bond formation or successful assimilation into foreign colonies, thereby facilitating later outbreeding. Consequently, outbreeding opportunities may be important determinants of reproductive activity in male common mole-rats, moderating seasonal effects. Reproductive and non-reproductive males revealed no differences in any of the testicular or sperm parameters studied. The absence of a physiologically well-defined suppression of reproduction in male common mole-rats is more typical of social suppression in male mammals.",Journal of reproduction and fertility,1997 Jan,England,1997,90
9049796,The relationship between life-events and periodontitis. A case-control study.,"This case-control study (n = 100 dental patients, matched for age and sex) investigated the role of life-events in periodontitis. Data collected included life events, tobacco use, oral health behaviours and socio-demographics. The results of conditional simple logistic regression analysis showed that periodontitis was associated with the negative impact of life-events (p < 0.01), the number of negative life-events (p < 0.05), high levels of dental plaque (p < 0.01), tobacco smoking (p < 0.01) and being unemployed (p < 0.05). These associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for oral health behaviour and socio-demographic variables, but not tobacco smoking (p > 0.05). Marital status became statistically significant after adjusting for the other variables (p < 0.05). A model is suggested to explain the pathways through which life events may affect periodontal health. It was concluded that psychosocial factors and oral health risk behaviours cluster together as important determinants of periodontitis.",Journal of clinical periodontology,1997 Jan,United States,1997,90
9029985,Early onset depression: the relevance of anxiety.,"The aim of this study was to determine risk factors that may differentiate early onset from late onset depression. A non-clinical cohort that had been assessed from 1978 to 1993 at 5 yearly intervals and that had a high prevalence rate of lifetime depression took part in the study. We established an appropriate age cut-off to distinguish early onset (i.e. before 26 years) of major and of minor depression, and examined the relevance of a number of possible determinants of early onset depression assessed over the life of the study. Despite several dimensional measures of depression, self-esteem and personality being considered, they generally failed (when assessed early in the study) to discriminate subsequent early onset depression, with the exception of low masculinity scores being a weak predictor of major and/or minor depression. Early onset depression was strongly predicted, however, by a lifetime episode of a major anxiety disorder, with generalised anxiety being a somewhat stronger and more consistent predictor than panic disorder, agoraphobia and minor anxiety disorders (ie social phobia, simple phobia). The possibility that anxiety may act as a key predispositional factor to early onset depression and to a greater number of depressive episodes is important in that clinical assessment and treatment of any existing anxiety disorder may be a more efficient and useful strategy than focussing primarily on the depressive disorder.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1997 Jan,Germany,1997,90

METHODS: Clinicians in 77 orthodontic offices were trained (and asked) to provide anti-tobacco counseling and prescriptions to 10- to 18-year-olds for 2 years. Each of eight prescriptions was provided for distribution to adolescent patients. Information concerning prescription-tracking methods and operant learning theory variables such as modeling and feedback was obtained using a cross-sectional interview of clinical staff. The proportion of prescriptions written was regressed on possible ""determinants."" Analyses were replicated for two time periods. RESULTS: Mean anti-tobacco prescription compliance was 66 and 73% for two separate time periods. Multiple regression analyses were computed for the first (R = 0.45, F(7,63) = 2.29, P < 0.001) and second (R = 0.48, F(7,63) = 2.76, P < 0.001) time periods. Prescription tracking and praise from patients were significant correlates for the first time period; praise and modeling were significant for the second time period. Twenty and twenty-three percent, respectively, of the variance in office prescription rate was explained. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that compliance with primary prevention procedures may be influenced by feedback from patients, staff modeling, and formal office tracking information.",Preventive medicine,1997 Jan-Feb,United States,1997,90
9009810,Social determinants of cardiovascular reactivity: effects of incentive to exert influence and evaluative threat.,The effects on cardiovascular reactivity of incentive to influence the judgements of the experimenter and the threat of social evaluation were examined in a sample of 60 male and 60 female undergraduates. Participants either were guaranteed $5.00 to prepare and deliver a brief speech or were told that the money was contingent on an evaluation by the experimenter. Participants believed that their speech would be rated for either simple clarity or verbal intelligence. The contingent incentive increased systolic blood pressure reactivity by 6.5 mmHg (32%). Evaluative threat increased systolic reactivity by 7.1 mmHg (36%). These interpersonal processes could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and are likely to affect the degree of cardiovascular reactivity in laboratory studies.,Psychophysiology,1997 Jan,United States,1997,90
9008668,Determinants of patient adherence to consultative comprehensive geriatric assessment recommendations.,"BACKGROUND: In consultative models of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), lack of implementation of CGA recommendations is well documented and appears to be a potential explanation for negative findings. The purpose of this study is to identify patient determinants of adherence to recommendations received from a community-based CGA consultative model program. METHODS: Subjects (N = 139) received self-care and/or physician-initiated CGA recommendations and were interviewed three months later to determine adherence with the most important recommendation, and health belief, communication, and social support factors associated with adherence. Independent variables were organized into the Andersen Behavioral Model for analysis. RESULTS: At the bivariate level, one predisposing factor (intention) and six enabling factors (low difficulty level, high support, high utility, high self-efficacy, agreement on the importance of the recommendation and good specific communication about the recommendation) were significant determinants of adherence. Two functional health measures and seriousness of the target condition of the recommendation were significant need factors. In the final logistic regression model, one predisposing variable (intention), one enabling variable (utility), and one need factor (high functional status), and two interaction terms significantly predicted adherence. CONCLUSION: CGA recommendations that are seen as worthwhile, not too much trouble, and able to be accomplished are the most likely to be initiated. Older adults with relatively higher functional levels are also more likely to follow through with CGA recommendations even though their needs may be lower. We found the Andersen Behavioral Model useful in the analysis of factors associated with adherence behavior to consultative CGA recommendations.","The journals of gerontology.

8996132,Determinants of postchemotherapy nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer. Quality of Life and Symptom Control Committees of the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group.,"PURPOSE: To assess whether prechemotherapy health-related quality-of-life (HQL) variables are associated with postchemotherapy nausea and vomiting (PCNV), and to determine their relationship to patient and treatment variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred thirty-two chemotherapy-naive patients scheduled to receive antiemetic regimens containing a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) antagonist with or without dexamethasone for moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy were enrolled. HQL was measured by the self-report European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Care Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) within 7 days before chemotherapy. Prechemotherapy HQL scores, as well as other patient, disease, and treatment variables were compared in the groups of patients who had PCNV and those who did not have PCNV. All variables were assessed initially in a univariate analysis and then together in a multivariate analysis using step-wise logistic regression. The final model generated by the multivariate analyses was used in a risk factor analysis to predict PCNV. RESULTS: Univariate analyses identified 10 HQL variables and five patient and treatment characteristics that were associated with PCNV. In the multivariate analysis, the variables remaining in the final model included low social functioning, prechemotherapy nausea, female gender, highly emetogenic chemotherapy, and the lack of maintenance antiemetics (5-HT3 antagonists with or without dexamethasone) after chemotherapy. A history of low alcohol use was also associated with PCV, whereas increased fatigue and lower performance status were associated with PCN. In the risk factor analysis, the incidence of PCV increased from 20% in those having no risk factors to 76% in those having any four of the six risk factors. CONCLUSION: Several pretreatment HQL, patient, and treatment characteristics are associated with the occurrence of PCNV. Patients about to receive moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy should be screened for these factors and additional measures, such as behavior modification and modification of antiemetic therapy, should be considered in attempts to improve the control of PCNV.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,1997 Jan,United States,1997,90
8990990,"Attendance at cultural events, reading books or periodicals, and making music or singing in a choir as determinants for survival: Swedish interview survey of living conditions.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the possible influence of attendance at cultural events, reading books or periodicals, making music or singing in a choir as determinants for survival. DESIGN: A simple random sample was drawn of 15,198 individuals aged 16-74 years. Of these, 85% (12,982) were interviewed by trained non-medical interviewers between 1982 and 1983 about cultural activities. They were followed up with respect to survival until 31 December 1991. SETTING: Swedish interview survey of living conditions comprising a random sample of the adult Swedish population. SUBJECTS: 12,675 people interviewed between 1982 and 1983. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival of subjects after controlling for eight confounding variables: age, sex, education level, income, long term disease, social network, smoking, and physical exercise. RESULTS: 6,301 men and 6,374 women were followed up; 533 men and 314 women died during this period. The control variables influenced survival in the expected directions except for social network for men; a significant negative effective was found when the analysis was made separately for men and women. We found an influence on mortality when the eight control variables were controlled for in people who rarely attended events compared with those attending most often, the relative risk being 1.57 (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.09). CONCLUSION: Attendance at cultural events may have a positive influence on survival. Long term follow up of large samples with confounders that are well controlled for and with the cultural stimulation more highly specified should be used to try to falsify the hypothesis before experiments start.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 Dec 21-28,England,1996,90
10169950,"Race, ethnicity, and access to health care, Rhode Island, 1990.","Differences in access to health care by race and ethnicity have been examined using data obtained from a statewide health interview survey conducted by Rhode Island Department of Health in 1990 (N = 6,536 individuals in 2,586 households), in which ethnic minorities were oversampled. Compared to White non-Hispanic (WNH) respondents, White Hispanics (WH) were more likely to lack a regular source of medical care at some time in the past twelve months (14.0% vs. 9.8%) and were much more likely to lack health insurance coverage (22.7% vs. 7.5%). Black respondents were more likely to lack regular source of care (10.4%) and health insurance coverage (17.4%). Asian respondents also had a high proportion without insurance (13.5%). Multivariate analysis has been employed to identify significant social, economic, and demographic determinants of inadequate access to care, including variables for race/ethnicity, age, sex, income, education, and employment status, and to quantify their independent contributions as predictors of level of access.",Journal of health & social policy,1997,United States,1997,90

10168487,Major determinants of social networks in frail elderly community residents.,"Although social networks has been extensively studied as independent, intervening, and moderating variables affecting health, little attention has been paid to social networks as dependent variables. The present research is a longitudinal study which focuses on social networks as the dependent variable. A sample of 3,559 poor, frail, elderly from California Multipurpose Senior Services Project (MSSP) were evaluated in six month intervals over an eighteen month period. The results indicate that life events, sex, ailments, mental functioning, and health habits are significant predictors of the elderly's social networks after six months, and that life events, sex, age, and health habits are significant predictors of the elderly's social networks after twelve months, as well as after eighteen months. Implications for intervention and for further research are discussed.",Home health care services quarterly,1997,England,1997,90
9136289,The relationship between socioeconomic status and recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in physical functioning, pain, and depressive symptoms among newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with severe disease. METHODS: Data are from 118 non-Hispanic patients of European origin at baseline of a longitudinal study of early, severe RA. Outcome measures with the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) functional disability index, the HAQ visual analog pain scale, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using a health status block (disease activity and comorbidities), a non-SES related social structure block (age, sex and Lubben Social Network Scale), and indicators of SES (income and education). RESULTS: Non-SES related social structure and SES were important independent determinants of functional disability and depressive symptoms, but both they and the health status variables were unrelated to pain. Further, neither income nor education was related to disease activity or comorbidities. CONCLUSION: It cannot be argued from these data that poorer health status explains the link between SES and disability and depressive symptoms. Although, at baseline, the psychosocial effects of early RA are more severe for those with SES, the disease does not appear to be more severe. It may be that the biologic impact of status differentials will become clearer as the effects of treatment and the course of the disease unfold over time.",Arthritis care and research : the official journal of the Arthritis Health Professions Association,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90
9041742,Use of the Pap test by a population group in Buenos Aires.,"The study reported here sought to assess Pap test coverage of a group of asymptomatic Argentine women from the poor urban district of La Matanza in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area Initially, all 2495 women who voluntarily enrolled in a program for early detection of breast cancer between January 1991 and June 1993 were included. After removing those who did not meet various study criteria, there remained 779 study subjects with no gynecologic or mammary symptomatology. Two subgroups of these 779 were established-women who had received a Pap test at any time and those who had received such a test within the previous three years. Using these subgroups, the influence of certain sociodemographic and other variables upon the likelihood of Pap testing was assessed. The results indicated significant associations between past Pap testing and age, formal education, parity, and a family history of cancer Likewise, significant associations were found between Pap testing within the preceding three years and age, formal education, and parity. The study findings affirm the idea that it would be advisable to seek Pap testing for all study population women once every three years instead of every year. Since the study population was not necessarily representative of Buenos Aires population, however, and the findings could have been affected by self-selection and other biases, additional studies are needed to determine actual Pap test coverage among women of the metropolitan area.",Bulletin of the Pan American Health Organization,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90
9039380,The sociodemographic pattern of tobacco cessation in the 1980s: results from a panel study of living condition surveys in Sweden.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To analyse the factors that determined whether or not people were successful in quitting tobacco during the 1980s in Sweden. DESIGN: A logistic regression model was used for the analyses and included: education, marital status, socioeconomic group, social network, physical activities, cigarette consumption, and years spent smoking as independent variables. Men and women were analysed separately for smoking. A specific univariate analysis was also performed for men who used snuff. SETTING: Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: A panel of 5104 randomised people aged 16-84 years was interviewed in 1980-81 and followed up in 1988-89 in the survey of living conditions undertaken by Statistics Sweden. The participation rate was 86%. The panel included 1546 men and women who were daily smokers. There were 418 daily users of snuff among the men, and 129 men both smoked and used snuff. MAIN RESULTS: Together 26% of women and 23% of men had quit smoking. Five percent in both groups were new smokers. Among men, 26% had quit using snuff and 5% had begun smoking. New snuff users among men were 5%. In the multivariate analysis, unmarried men kept smoking at significantly higher rates (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2,3.6), as did those men who smoked 11-20 cigarettes/day (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.5, 3.4), or more than 20 cigarettes/day (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.4,5.7). Among women, smoking 11-20 cigarettes/day was also a significant factor (OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.1,5.0). Men and women aged 25-44 were significantly more likely to continue smoking (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.1,3.7, and 2.2; 95% CI 1.2,4.4) as were those who had smoked for 20 years or more (OR 4.7; 95% CI 2.0,10.8 and OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.1,5.5, respectively). For women, low education (up to grade 9) was also a significant factor (OR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.2,5.1). Among men who had quit using snuff we did not find any values of significance. CONCLUSIONS: One in four smokers had quit during the 1980s and a few started smoking (5%). Some men quit smoking and started using snuff instead. For both sexes, the daily consumption of cigarettes, years spent smoking, and age were the most important determinants of successful quitting. In men, being married/ cohabiting was an important factor as was higher education in women.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1996 Dec,England,1996,90
9027535,Hepatitis A in a Chinese urban population: the spectrum of social and behavioural risk factors.,"BACKGROUND: Viral hepatitis is a major public health problem in China. Hepatitis A infections represent a substantial proportion of these, particularly in urban centres. Little is known about the social and behavioural factors in the urban household environment that influence the transmission of hepatitis A. METHODS: We conducted a register-based case-control study to investigate the risk factor patterns for hepatitis A in the general population of the City of Wuhan, in the PR China. Cases were selected from district-based health registers. One control, matched for sex and age, was identified from the case's neighbourhood. Home-based interviews combined with household observation were performed to obtain information on social, behavioural and economic risk factors and the household's indoor and outdoor environment. Analysis included conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Hepatitis A infection was associated with a variety of social and household-related factors, like handwashing habits (after working in the garden: adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 8.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-44.2, before food preparation: OR = 4.68, 95% CI: 1.8-12.0; before eating: OR = 4.92, 95% CI: 1.5-15.7), and the source of fresh vegetables (OR = 3.90, 95% CI: 1.6-9.8). Hygiene in the kitchen and the household surroundings and the disposal of children's stools in vegetable gardens or refuse pits were significantly associated with univariate analysis only. The lack of possession of luxury consumer items as a surrogate indicator for income was significantly associated with the disease (OR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.0-6.1). The study clearly established that exposure to health and hygiene education was less in the group of hepatitis A cases when compared to healthy controls (OR = 2.80, 95% CI: 0.9-8.3). CONCLUSION: The results of this study underline how social and behavioural factors are important determinants for hepatitis A in urban Chinese populations. These issues could be addressed by appropriate health and hygiene education targeted at high risk groups, and by strengthening existing procedures for monitoring and control of food hygiene.",International journal of epidemiology,1996 Dec,England,1996,90

9010510,Predictors of African American adolescents' condom use and HIV risk behavior.,"This study evaluated predictors of risky and safer behavior in a sample of low-income African American adolescents, assessed their perceptions of the risk associated with their sexual behavior, and examined differences between adolescents who used condoms consistently, inconsistently, or engaged only in unprotected intercourse. African American adolescents (N = 312) completed measures related to AIDS knowledge, frequency of condom use, attitudes toward condoms, and sexual behavior over the preceding 2 months. Multiple regression analyses for the sexually active youths (N = 114) revealed that lower self-efficacy, higher perceived risk, and male gender were associated with high-risk behavior. Positive attitudes toward condoms and younger age had the strongest association with condom use. Consistent condom users were more knowledgeable and held more positive attitudes toward condoms, and nonusers were older. Regardless of their behavior, the adolescents generally did not perceive themselves to be a risk for HIV infection. The findings suggest that precautionary practices (condom use) and high-risk behavior (unprotected sex with multiple partners) may have different correlates. In addition, the data indicate that theoretical models developed with homosexual male populations may also be generalizable to African American adolescents' sexual behavior.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90

This article reports on commercial, spousal, and other sexual partners and on condom use among 327 drivers interviewed in 1992. Forty-eight percent reported a commercial sex worker (CSW) as their first partner and 87% had contact with a CSW at some time. Median lifetime number of all partners was 29. In the 6 months prior to interview, 35% had two or more partners. Among the currently married, 23% had CSW contact within the past 6 months; 13% had contact with a nonmarital, noncommercial partner; and about 8% reported marital as well as both CSW and noncommercial relationships in the same time period. Over half the unmarried reported sexual relations in the 6 months; 25% reported contacts with both CSW and noncommercial partners. About 40% of subjects visiting CSWs used condoms inconsistently or not at all. Drivers were knowledgeable about AIDS and prevention measures, with some important misconceptions, but self-assessment of risk of HIV showed a negligible sense of their personal vulnerability.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90

In this project qualitative approaches were used to allow a comparison of the results with those achieved by standardised quantitative investigations. Besides the fact that satisfaction in basic nursing education has so far been investigated predominantly with quantitative methods which limit the responses of the subjects from the outset, critics in the field of occupational research have pointed to the necessity of using qualitative methods in investigating job satisfaction.

8997789,Lest taxonomy become taxidermy: a comment on the relapse replication and extension project.,"In this commentary on the Relapse Replication and Extension Project, several points are addressed. First, the selection of the pretreatment ""baseline relapse"" as the key predictor variable for post-treatment relapse in the predictive and construct validity studies is questioned. It is doubtful whether retrospective accounts of drinking episodes after 4 days of abstinence qualify as relapse episodes for the following reasons: clients may not have been committed to abstinence (e.g. weekend binge drinkers); treatment may have included coping skill training for pretreatment high-risk situations (i.e. treatment intervention is viewed as a ""nuisance variable""). By assuming that a client's retrospective report of a poorly defined pretreatment ""relapse"" is predictive of the type of relapse episode experienced during the post-treatment follow-up assessment is to commit an error of ""taxidermy"" in evaluating the reliability and validity of the taxonomy; i.e. the tendency for researchers to ""stuff and permanently mount"" distal baseline episodes as static predictor variables, thereby depriving them of their dynamic and fluid role as proximal determinants in the relapse process. The difference between researchers who assess distal trait predictors of relapse and clinicians who focus more on proximal state predictors in conducting relapse prevention therapy is discussed and illustrated by means of a case study. Finally, the metaphor of relapse as ""falling off the wagon"" is described as an example of a systems approach to relapse prevention.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1996 Dec,England,1996,90
8997780,Taxonomy of high-risk situations for alcohol relapse: evolution and development of a cognitive-behavioral model.,"The purpose of this paper is to provide an historical overview of the development of the taxonomy of high-risk situations for relapse in patients receiving abstinence-based treatment for alcoholism. Research conducted during the 1970s on determinants of relapse is briefly reviewed, beginning with a preliminary analysis of relapse patterns in alcoholics treated with aversion therapy. Theoretical foundations underlying the development of the taxonomy are then discussed with an emphasis on social-learning theory and its implications for cognitive-behavioral interventions for relapse prevention. Findings supporting the efficacy of coping-skills training for high-risk relapse situations, based on a prospective treatment outcome study for inpatient alcoholics, are also presented in support of the clinical validity of the relapse model. The paper concludes with a description of the refined and extended taxonomy of high-risk situations and the associated cognitive-behavioral model of relapse described in the Marlatt & Gordon (1985) text on relapse prevention.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1996 Dec,England,1996,90
8990587,The burden of aging: a theoretical framework for understanding the shifting balance of caregiving and care receiving as cohorts age.,"Unless changes occur in the way cohorts age, the future aging of the population will make the burden of caring for older persons an increasingly salient political issue in American society. There is no reason, however, why aging in the future should replicate the pattern of aging that currently exists. A helpful step toward understanding what social changes would reduce the burden that aging cohorts place on society is the development of aging theory. This article develops a theoretical framework that explicates factors determining the level of care given and care received by cohorts moving through different stages of later life. Four proximate determinants of caregiving and three proximate determinants of care receiving are specified. Once the proximate determinants are identified, attention is focused on social changes that could reduce the burden of aging produced by cohorts aging through later life in the future.",The Gerontologist,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90
8986206,Models of treatment seeking for alcoholism: the role of genes and environment.,"We investigated the relative influence of genes and environment on the decision to seek treatment for alcoholism under three models of health care utilization. Lifetime alcohol dependence and two measures of treatment seeking for alcohol problems were determined from a 1992 telephone administration of the Diagnostic interview Schedule. Data were analyzed from 1,864 monozygotic and 1,492 dizygotic male twin respondents from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Genetic and environmental contributions to the decision to seek treatment for alcoholism were assessed under competing models for the relationship between genetic influences on alcoholism risk and genetic influences on treatment seeking among those who became alcoholics. Under the best-fitting model, genetic influence accounted for 41% of the variance in treatment seeking and 55% of the liability for alcoholism. Shared environment explained none of the variance in liability for alcoholism, but 40% of the variance in treatment seeking. The severity of alcoholism alone is an inadequate model of treatment seeking, because decisions to seek alcohol treatment are also influenced by substantial genetic and or shared environmental factors unrelated to the determinants of alcoholism.","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",1996 Dec,England,1996,90
8982541,Outcome studies for burn patients in Hong Kong: patients' satisfaction.,"With the recent advances in burns treatment, many more survive the burn to experience pain, scarring, physical deformity, loss of function and psychological trauma. Pressure therapy prescribed by occupational therapists for more than 20 years in Hong Kong has proved its effectiveness in treating the visible scars. However, the inconvenience and impaired appearance that is brought about by these garments during the long phase of therapy bears some weight in worsening patients' social acceptance and happiness in life, also their families especially in children. The objects of the studies were to measure the subjective rating of the effectiveness of pressure therapy through patients' satisfaction towards treatment effectiveness and its effect on daily life. Seventy cases with burn injuries over 1 year previously were selected randomly among the centres for the survey. The scale used was ordinal from 1 to 6. Eleven items concerning treatment effectiveness, life at home, work and leisure aspects were questioned. Results were analysed into two streams-satisfaction towards pressure therapy and change of life satisfaction pre- and post-injury. Non-parametric tests were used for data analysis. Through the Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test and Cluster analysis, major determinants were identified. These factors also showed significant correlation with this demographic data. The conclusions helped to evaluate and improve the existing service in both the garment properties and our scope of therapy for these patients, especially in work rehabilitation and finally (sexual) counselling which should be addressed by a team with interdepartmental support.",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,1996 Dec,Netherlands,1996,90
8979038,Refinement and psychometric evaluation of the Attitudes Toward Loss of Hearing Questionnaire.,"OBJECTIVE: To refine and statistically validate the Attitudes Toward Loss of Hearing Questionnaire (ALHQ) so that it will be appropriate for clinical application and to understand some of the personality attributes underlying attitudes toward hearing loss. DESIGN: An American-English version of an ALHQ, originally designed by Brooks (1989), was completed by 226 men; a subset of 80 also completed personality questionnaires. All subjects underwent pure-tone testing and speech audiometry. Factor analysis was used to extract scales from the ALHQ. Reliability analyses using Cronbach's alpha were carried out on each scale. Test-retest reliability was evaluated from questionnaires completed 6 to 18 mo after initial administration. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the audiometric and personality determinants of attitudes. RESULTS: Five reliable scales were extracted from a 24-question version of the ALHQ: 1) Social and Emotional Impact of Hearing Loss, 2) Acceptance/ Adjustment to Hearing Loss, 3) Perceived Support from Significant Others, 4) Hearing Aid Stigma, and 5) Awareness of Hearing Loss. Audiometric data explained little of the variance in attitude scores; age and other demographic factors did not correlate with attitudes either. The personality traits of extroversion, self-esteem, and anxiety/neuroticism played a larger role in determining attitude. CONCLUSIONS: The ALHQ is psychometrically acceptable and is a potentially useful clinical tool. It is quick and easy to complete and to score and could be used as a basis for counseling and for following attitude change in patients over time.",Ear and hearing,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90
8970719,"Summary of track D: social science: research, policy and action.","SCOPE: This review summarizes the main issues discussed during Track D, which examined the societal impact of HIV/AIDS, and responses to the epidemic by individuals, families, communities and societies worldwide. Micro- and macrolevel issues addressed included the development, implementation and evaluation of programmes for prevention and care; policy development and implementation; structural issues such as the impact of gender relations, development and migration on the development of the epidemic; and the social and economic impact of HIV/AIDS on affected societies and communities. RECURRENT THEMES: Presentations provided strong evidence that peer-led, community-based programmes offer particularly effective ways of working, and that participatory research involving affected communities provides useful results for the design and evaluation of programmes and policies. This is the case across settings, issues, populations and countries. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Emerging needs include how best to ensure sustainability of national and international responses, how best to scale up successful interventions for wider reach, and how best to work with systematically marginalized, neglected groups and populations. Research priorities include the characterization of the multiple determinants of HIV-related vulnerability, and the evaluation of interventions that take these complex determinants as their starting point. A more coherent and strategic response requires less separation between the different constituencies involved in AIDS work, and the more sustained involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS themselves.","AIDS (London, England)",1996 Dec,England,1996,90
8970692,The acceptability of voluntary HIV antibody testing in the United States: a decade of lessons learned.,"OBJECTIVE: As the benefits of early diagnosis of HIV increase, US adults are more likely to be offered HIV counseling and testing in settings where they may not seek testing. Rates and determinants of counseling and testing acceptance in these settings are poorly understood. DESIGN: We reviewed articles and abstracts published from 1985 to 1995 which addressed rates or determinants of counseling and testing acceptance in facilities that provide perinatal, family planning, gynecology, sexually transmitted disease (STD) and drug treatment services, hospitals, and prisons. Data reflected testing experience of more than 240,000 adults. RESULTS: Acceptance rates varied widely (3-100%), even within settings of the same type. Acceptance was generally higher (> 50%) among persons at high risk for acquiring or transmitting the infection (e.g., STD patients, pregnant women at high risk) than among low-risk persons. Factors associated with high acceptance rates included the client's perception of HIV risk, acknowledging risk behaviors; confidentiality protections; presenting counseling and testing as 'routine' rather than optional; and the provider's belief that counseling and testing will benefit the client. Factors associated with low acceptance rates included prior HIV testing, fears about coping with results, and explicit informed consent. CONCLUSIONS: To institute and evaluate counseling and testing programs for persons who do not specifically seek testing, multiple determinants of acceptance must be considered. Practices that protect confidentiality, endorse counseling directed to a client's unique circumstances, and highlight the medical and social benefits of testing are likely to promote acceptance. Acceptance of counseling and testing offered nonroutinely to the numerous Americans who have been previously tested or are at low risk is likely to be low.","AIDS (London, England)",1996 Dec,England,1996,90
8968626,Women's self-esteem: a community study of women who report and do not report childhood sexual abuse.,"BACKGROUND: The determinants of self-esteem have been little studied in non-clinic samples. It has been suggested recently that child sexual abuse (CSA) may be a major determinant of low self-esteem in adulthood. METHOD: The psychosocial circumstances associated with low self-esteem in two random samples of women, one reporting CSA, the other not, were compared, with particular emphasis on characteristics of family of origin. A two-phase (postal-then-interview) random community study assessed self-esteem and related variables. RESULTS: Psychosocial variables predicting low self-esteem were the same in the two groups. They included being a follower or a loner, having an overcontrolling mother, being poorly qualified, giving a history of depressive disorder and displaying current psychiatric disorder. In addition, the subject's CSA status led to low self-esteem but only when it was of the most intrusive type. The CSA women had substantially lower mean total self-esteem score. However, not all aspects of self-esteem were diminished equally; 12/30 items differed between the two groups, and two of the five generated self-esteem factors, which we named Pessimism and Fatalism, which differed between the control group and the whole CSA group. There were no differences for Likeability and Determination. CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of low self-esteem for women include childhood temperament, a poor relationship with the mother, low qualification attainment, psychiatric morbidity, both previous and current, and, only when it is the most intrusive, CSA.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1996 Dec,England,1996,90
8961415,Determinants of the use of ambulant social care by the elderly.,"Policy makers and scientists are increasingly concerned with the use of formal care services by the elderly. This article demonstrates that there are three different care systems: the informal, the commercial and the formal (public) system. In terms of prevalence, the formal system is the least important one. By means of a cross-sectional sample of the elderly population of Antwerp, an Andersen model is estimated to explain the use of formal services. This model shows that the level of functional capacity of the elderly is a crucial factor. Yet, the effect this has on the use of care varies according to the different living arrangements. ""Need"" as such, therefore, does not determine the use of formal services, since its effect is modified by the different alternatives that are at the disposal of the elderly person (living arrangements, informal care, income, availability of commercial alternatives). In the conclusion it is argued that the Andersen model, in a cross-sectional design, is inadequate to construct a theory concerning the use of care services.",Social science & medicine (1982),1996 Dec,England,1996,90

Immigrants leave their homeland, experience the chaos of moving, then begin life in a new country. A new parent relinquishes an identity, waits for the birth of an infant, then develops an altered identity with reconfigured relationships. Belsky's theoretical framework is modified to illustrate the determinants of parenting in immigrants who make the transition to parenthood and cultural transition simultaneously. The primary focus is on the contextual determinants of premigration, postmigration, ethnicity, and the sociopolitical environment.

8909379,Fetal growth and coronary heart disease in south India.,"BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease is predicted to become the commonest cause of death in india within 15 years People from India living overseas already have high rates of the disease that are not explained by known coronary risk factors. Small size at birth is a newly described risk factor for coronary heart disease, but associations between size at birth and the disease have not been examined in India. METHODS: We studied 517 men and women who were born between 1934 and 1954 in a mission hospital in Mysore, South India, and who still lived near to the hospital. We related the prevalence of coronary heart disease, defined by standard criteria, to their birth size. FINDINGS: 25 (9%) men and 27 (11%) women had coronary heart disease. Low birthweight, short birth length, and small head circumference at birth were associated with a raised prevalence of the disease. Prevalence fell from 11% in people whose birthweights were 5.5 lb (2.5 kg) or less to 3% in those whose birthweights were more than 7 lb (3.1 kg), p for trend = 0.09. The trends were stronger and statistically significant among people aged 45 years and over (p = 0.03 for birthweight, 0.04 for length, and 0.02 for head circumference). High rates of disease were also found in those whose mothers had a low body weight during pregnancy. The highest prevalence of the disease (20%) was in people who weighted 5.5 lb (2.5 kg) or less at birth and whose mothers weighted less than 100 lb (45 kg) in pregnancy. These associations were largely independent of known coronary risk factors. INTERPRETATION: In India, as in the UK, coronary heart disease is associated with small size at birth, suggesting that its pathogenesis is influenced by events in utero. The association with low maternal bodyweight is further evidence that the disease originates through fetal undernutrition.

An analysis of concepts and evidence.,"The phenomenon of maintenance of health-related physical activity is explored through an analysis of the underlying concepts and of the existing empirical evidence. The following targets were used for the analysis: (1) the concept of health-related physical activity, (2) the concept of maintenance, (3) common manifestations of maintenance in everyday living, (4) the promotional and behavioral characteristics of health-related physical activity, (5) the known determinants of free-living physical activity, and (6) intervention trials on physical activity in free-living groups. The analyses revealed the inherent resistance to adoption and maintenance of physical activity, particularly that of high-intensity and program-centered activities, the persistence, however, of many simple everyday routines and habits, the multiple determinants discovered for free-living physical activity and a few empirical demonstrations of the successful promotion of the maintenance of physical activity over a year or two. The promotion of the maintenance of health-related physical activity seems thus a distinct possibility provided that (1) the promotional situation is analyzed thoroughly, (2) the activity is chosen carefully with an emphasis on moderation in intensity and integration into the participant's life-style, (3) multiple promotional contacts are used, and (4) support from the participant's social and physical environment is provided. There is a need for more research on the maintenance of health-related physical activity using the stages of change models, behavior modification principles, self-control concepts, the concept of intrinsic motivation and the Relapse model. The method of analysis used here could apply to other health-related behaviors as well.",Health education research,1996 Dec,England,1996,90
12349133,Explaining Australian immigration.,"""This article reviews the post-Second World War literature on explanations for Australia's immigration program. It discovers three main schools of thought based on net pull factors: the official explanation and two unofficial explanations which focus on migrants as workers and on migrants as consumers. However the growing importance of net push factors after 1974 means that some of this work is less relevant today. Explanations focusing on net push factors have yet to cohere into a distinct perspective (or perspectives) but some research has been done on chain migration and family-based migration strategies, asylum seekers, temporary movement, and migration and the law.""",Journal of the Australian Population Association,1996 Nov,Australia,1996,90
11618375,Anchored narratives: the story and findings of half a century of research into the determinants of fertility.,"This paper reviews half a century of research into the determinants of fertility. It is argued that the quest for the determinants of fertility behaviour and change during that period can best be interpreted as the development of a series of sub-narratives from different disciplinary perspectives and orientations. These are normally based upon the initial narrative of the demographic transition and usually take the form of a verbal theory illustrated by a 'box and arrow' diagram. On occasions formalization has been attempted. Different parts of the initial narrative have been highlighted at different times depending on policy interest, improvements in technical skills, availability of data, changes in social setting, and the degree of satisfaction with the dominant sub-narrative of the day. There is every reason to believe that the research process identified will continue and will lead to a further accumulation of knowledge. In fact, all important variables have probably already been identified. That it will, ultimately, lead to a single, consolidated narrative fully satisfactory for all settings and for all time is, however, highly unlikely.",Population studies,1996 Nov,England,1996,90
9130411,Determinants of happiness and life satisfaction in elderly Zimbabweans.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess determinants of happiness and life satisfaction in elderly Zimbabweans. DESIGN: Community based cross sectional survey. SETTING: Randomly selected villages and two urban areas in north eastern Zimbabwe. SUBJECTS: 278 subjects aged 60 to 92 years (124 male, 154 female). METHOD: One subject per randomly selected household was interviewed, at home, by a trained interviewer to complete a questionnaire. RESULTS: Independent determinants of happiness were: rural residence, whether children gave material support and satisfaction with financial circumstances. [Adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals 0.25 (0.13 to 0.49), 0.45 (0.22 to 0.94) and 0.11 (0.01 to 0.87) respectively]. Independent determinants of life satisfaction were: feeling better off than their neighbours, receiving adequate respect from their children and satisfaction with financial circumstances. [Adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals 0.73 (0.59 to 0.91), 0.13 (0.03 to 0.59) and 0.24 (0.1 to 0.61) respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that, despite physical hardship, the majority of Zimbabwean elders are happy and 50% are satisfied with their lives and we have identified independent determinants of happiness and life satisfaction in this group. Characterization of these determinants allows us to predict that social changes such as rural/urban migration, declining family support and diminishing respect from children will have a negative effect on happiness and life satisfaction in our elders. It is important that, when planning intervention programmes for the elderly, these facets of wellbeing are not neglected.",The Central African journal of medicine,1996 Nov,Zimbabwe,1996,90
9124079,Public attitude towards psychiatric treatment.,"Past research on help-seeking behaviour and compliance among the mentally ill has mainly been focused on the examination of individual and structural determinants, while the impact of the socio-cultural context has been largely neglected. To examine this impact, we conducted a representative survey among German citizens who were eligible to vote. By means of vignettes describing different mental disorders we recorded the lay public's preferences for various treatment methods, together with their subjective reasons for voicing these particular preferences. While we found that psychotherapy was generally held in high esteem by the lay public, psychopharmacotherapy was rejected by the vast majority of respondents. This pattern was observed for all of the mental disorders included in our survey. While the public's image of psychotherapy is largely determined by popular views on psychoanalysis, public opinion about psychotropic drugs is strongly influenced by characteristics associated with tranquillizers. Among the different psychotherapeutic approaches, psychoanalysis is the preferred method among respondents in the western part of Germany, while the lay public in the eastern part tends to endorse group therapy. Finally, our research showed a considerable difference between the conceptions held by the lay public and those of psychiatric experts with regard to the adequate treatment of mental disorders. This, in turn, should not be without consequence for help-seeking behaviour and patient compliance.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,1996 Nov,United States,1996,90
9064553,"[Alcohol dependence in homeless men. Incidence, development and determinants].","Against the background of the complex relationship of alcoholism and homelessness, we investigated the question of whether homeless alcoholics and those with homes differed regarding biographical and clinical variables. Therefore, 49 of 72 (68.1%) homeless male visitors to a city kitchen in the center of Berlin, who had fulfilled the ICD-10 criteria for the alcohol-dependence syndrome, were compared with 141 outpatients of the addiction research unit of the Department of Psychiatry of the Free University of Berlin. It was found that homeless alcoholics had more psychosocial disadvantages than other alcoholics. They had been raised more frequently in families with an alcoholic father or mother and a higher number of children. The level of education and job qualification was lower in the homeless alcoholics. Early homelessness was predicted by a lack of sexual behavior (no partnership experienced) and a family history of alcoholism. In the interview, homeless alcoholics reported fewer symptoms of alcohol-dependence syndrome than other alcoholics; however, the first symptoms had been experienced earlier. Alcohol-related somatic and psychological consequences were reported more frequently in alcoholics with homes, whereas social problems were more common in the homeless subjects. The results are discussed in the light of methodological limitations and other reports on the topic.",Der Nervenarzt,1996 Nov,Germany,1996,90
9003886,Predicting disability in stroke--a critical review of the literature.,"Research articles on the prognosis of stroke patients were analysed to identify studies that met sound methodological principles of prognostic research as well as to identify variables capable of predicting functional outcome (ADL) after stroke. Data sources comprised a computer-aided search of published prognostic studies and references to literature used in prognostic studies. Seventy-eight studies were tested for adherence to the following key methodological criteria: reliability and validity of measurement instruments used to assess dependent and independent variables; inclusion of an inception cohort; adequate and uniform end-point of observation; control for drop-outs during period of observation; statistical testing of presumed relationship between dependent and independent variables; sufficient sample size in relation to number of determinants; control for multicollinearity; specification of patient characteristics (i.e. age, type, recurrent stroke and localization of stroke); description of interfering treatment effects during the period of observation, and cross-validation of the prediction model in a second independent group of patients. Only three studies satisfied nine out 11 criteria and ten studies eight criteria for the determination of valid prognostic research. The results of these studies indicate that the following variables are valid predictors for functional recovery after stroke: age; previous stroke; urinary continence; consciousness at onset; disorientation in time and place; severity of paralysis; sitting balance; admission ADL score; level of social support and metabolic rate of glucose outside the infarct area in hypertensive patients. This study supports the general opinion that not only are differences in objectives and heterogeneity in stroke patients responsible for the lack of accuracy in predicting functional outcome, but also the methodological flaws in published prognostic research.",Age and ageing,1996 Nov,England,1996,90
8986031,Women's position and family planning in Egypt.,"In this report, data from the 1988 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey are used to address some of the most frequently raised questions about the relationship between gender inequality and reproductive behavior. The findings from binomial and multinomial logit models show that while the relationship between women's position and fertility control in Egypt is complex, some clear, broad patterns exist that have important theoretical and policy implications. First, although women's status in Egypt is clearly multidimensional, the reproductive aspect of women's position has a strong connection with the nonreproductive dimensions. Second, the case of the continued use of education and employment as proxies of women's position, especially in relationship to fertility control, is considerably discredited by the results. Finally, the findings indicate that Egyptian culture supports gender equality in the form of interaction and negotiation rather than women's autonomy.",Studies in family planning,1996 Nov-Dec,United States,1996,90
8976599,Social determinants of loneliness among older Americans.,"To further understand loneliness among older persons, a conceptual model, predicated on a social-support perspective, was examined. Results were based on 1,071 participants in the congregate and home-delivered meal programs of the Senior Citizens Nutrition and Activities Program in Hillsborough County, Florida. A series of stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that loneliness was greater among men, those with no children, those with no friends, those more physically disabled, those who subjectively felt that their health was poorer, and those who subjectively felt that their economic condition was inadequate. Not related directly to loneliness but with indirect influence were age, race, education, marital status, and poverty status. Those variables with no direct or indirect effect included rural or urban location, identification of emotional closeness with existing children or friends, and living alone. Theoretically, the results do not fully support the social-support perspective but point to the impact of a broad spectrum of demographic, health, economic, and social factors.","Genetic, social, and general psychology monographs",1996 Nov,United States,1996,90
8959415,Determinants of early implant discontinuation among low-income women.,"The determinants of contraceptive implant discontinuation within six months of insertion were examined among 786 low-income women attending family planning clinics in three U.S. cities. The six-month cumulative life-table discontinuation rate was 7.6%. Menstrual side effects were the most common reasons given for early implant removal, although women who discontinued use were no more likely than those who continued with the method to report menstrual irregularities. Women who opted for early removal were more likely than those who continued with the method to experience headaches, hair loss, weight gain and arm infection. Logistic regression analysis indicates that dissatisfaction with prior contraceptive methods, a partner who wants a child within the next two years, perceived pressure from health care providers to choose the implant, exposure to negative media coverage and the number of implant side effects significantly predict early implant discontinuation. Women's social and demographic characteristics, Medicaid status and motivation to avoid an unplanned pregnancy were not significantly related to early removal.",Family planning perspectives,1996 Nov-Dec,United States,1996,90

The results show that 67.5% of the children studied have blood lead (PbB) levels > or = 10 micrograms/100 ml. Twenty-one percent of these children (1987) had PbB levels that required medical evaluation (> or = 20 micrograms/100 ml- < or = 40 micrograms/100 ml), and 112 children needed medical treatment (PbB > or = 40 micrograms/100 ml). In addition, the study found that the probability of higher blood lead levels (> or = 20 micrograms/dl) corresponds to children whose mothers use lead-glazed pottery dishes (OR = 2.80; CI 95%, 1.55-5.07) and to children who habitually bite colored pencils (OR = 2.05; CI 95%, 1.13-3.71) compared, respectively, with children whose mothers do not use that type of dishes and children who do not bite pencils. Our results provide baseline information for estimating the impact and costs of population-based interventions aimed at these populations and also confirm the need to strengthen health education programs to promote the reduction of lead exposure in the general population.",Environmental health perspectives,1996 Nov,United States,1996,90

In the present study we examined demographic and clinical predictors of EOI. METHOD: The predictors were examined in a Norwegian sample of 41 recently admitted patients (schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder) and 66 parents. Parents' expressed emotion was assessed by the Camberwell Family Interview. RESULTS: Regression analyses showed that higher EOI was significantly related, on the part of the parent, to being a mother, single, spending more time with the patient; and, on the part of the patient, to no substance misuse, more anxiety-depression, and less uncritical and aggressive behaviour. EOI was not linked to previous hospital admissions. CONCLUSION: Our analyses indicate that characteristics of the parent and of the parent-patient dyad seem to be the most important determinants of EOI. EOI is probably not linked to psychotic relapse, but rather to affective disturbances in the patient.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1996 Nov,England,1996,90
8913996,Alcohol-related measures as factors in traffic fatalities.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if alcohol-related measures (per capita consumption, drinking-driving arrest rate, alcohol abuse treatment rate and Alcoholics Anonymous [AA] membership rate) were related to differences between states in traffic fatality rates (total and alcohol-related). METHOD: Fatality rates were regressed onto the alcohol-related variables, using state level data for 1982 and 1990 as well as measures of relative change between the 2 years. RESULTS: Fatality rates demonstrated significant positive relationships with per capita consumption and drinking-driving arrest rates, and significant negative relationships with AA membership rates, for the years 1982 and 1990. Also, changes in per capita consumption were significantly and positively related to changes in both traffic fatality measures. CONCLUSIONS: Per capita alcohol consumption measures were the strongest and most consistent determinants of traffic fatality measures. The negative relationship between AA membership rates and traffic fatality measures for 1982 and 1990 suggests a beneficial impact of AA on these measures at the aggregate level, although other explanations are possible.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1996 Nov,United States,1996,90
8910029,Using the theory of reasoned action (TRA) to understand the decision to use condoms in an STD clinic population.,"The theory of reasoned action (TRA) provides useful information when designing health education interventions. In this study, 703 heterosexual STD clinic clients responded to a TRA-based survey. With steady partners, social norms and attitudes toward condom use were significant predictors of intention for both men and women. The interaction of attitude and norm increased prediction for men (R = .64, p < 0.001) and women (R = .70, p < 0.001). With casual partners, attitude was a predictor for men and social norm was a predictor for women. Prior use of condoms increased prediction for men (R = .38, p < 0.001) and women (R = .47, p < 0.001). Findings suggest that, in addition to traditional TRA model variables, the relationship between sexual partners and the individual's prior experience with condom use should be incorporated into attempts to understand this complex, dyadic behavior. Examining specific outcome and normative beliefs also provides important information for intervention design.",Health education quarterly,1996 Nov,United States,1996,90

Based on the value-expectancy framework of migration decisionmaking, an explanatory model is tested which includes migration-related value measures along with individual, household and community-level determinants of both intentions to move and change in intentions to move. Multinomial logistic regression results based on data from the 1992 Thailand National Migration Survey provide some support for the hypothesis of gender-specific determinants of both intentions to move and the reconsideration of migration intentions. For men, value measures of affiliation and comfort, social networks, the presence of young children in the family, and land holdings are significant determinants of migration decisionmaking; for women income and comfort values, the presence of elderly persons in the household, community size, and crop losses are the salient factors.""",The International migration review,1996 Fall,United States,1996,90

This HLA and complotype pattern was not found in Mexican Mestizo patients with amoebic rectocolitis. No linkage disequilibrium was found between these and the other MHC determinants tested in this survey. Thus, HLA-DR3 and SCO1 may constitute primary, independent risk factors, not for any kind of amoebic tissue invasion (i.e. amoebic rectocolitis), but specifically for amoebic liver abscess, irrespective of age or sex. The possibility of linkage disequilibrium with other factors (i.e. the TNF family) within or close to the MHC that were not tested in this study, is discussed. Children with amoebic liver abscess revealed a significant increase in HLA-DR5, and the absence of HLA-DR6 when compared to adults with amoebic liver abscess, suggesting that at least in this ethnic group these class II HLA traits may contribute to some of the peculiarities of pediatric amoebic liver abscess as opposed to the adult version of this disease. HLA-DR3, SCO1, but also HLA-DR5 and HLA-DR6 have all been associated with certain forms of immune-dysfunction, and may thus contribute to some of the clinical and immunological features of this parasitic disease.",Parasite immunology,1996 Oct,England,1996,90

A discrete-time competing-risk event history method is employed to identify the determinants of IUD discontinuation by five kinds of reasons: contraceptive failure, expulsion, switching method, side-effects and other nonmethod-related reasons. The predictors of IUD discontinuation suggest that a number of mechanisms are in operation. Some of the determinants may reflect the effects of the family planning program; some may illustrate women's physiological and biological reactions to IUD's; some may be related to women's previous history of contraceptive use; and still others may indicate social characteristics of women that lead them to have their IUD's removed.",Social biology,1996 Fall-Winter,United States,1996,90
9125701,The application of postmodern thought to the clinical practice of psychoanalytic psychotherapy.,"The purpose of this article has been to acquaint psychoanalysts and psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapists with some of the most current ideas in philosophy and psychology, which have crucial implications for our professional organizations and our clinical work. The basic stance of this postmodern thinking constitutes a challenge to what is called foundationalism, which dominated scientific and philosophical thought until recently. In place of foundationalism, even in the production of scientific or philosophical works, we could hope for an ongoing dialogue between a king or queen who states the basic theoretical orientation, the loyal opposition that looks for inconsistencies and kinks in it, the jester who deconstructs the whole thing and introduces parenthetical digressions, and finally, a secret society of organization that functions to hold the adherents of the theory together and provide them with a unifying ego ideal. Postmodern thought is described and there is some discussion of its ""four horsemen,"" Derrida, Rorty, Foucault, and Lyotard, who in general question the possibility of whether any form of interpretation can be thought of as related to reality or the truth. My own point of view is that an intermediate position is necessary rather than a binary opposition between nihilism and foundationalism or more specifically, postmodernism and traditional psychoanalysis. That is to say, within certain horizons and with an understanding of the cultural and historical referents that always affect and delimit both the patient and the therapist, it is still possible to reach conceptions about what is going on both in the psychoanalytic process and the psyche of the patient that have at least a tentative ""truth."" Careful attention to the patient's material following an interpretation can provide clues about the validity of our conception at the time. But the horizons and historicity that delimit all ""truth"" reduce the authority and the stature of the analyst, make the analyst less of an arbiter of what is ""reality,"" and focus greater attention on the therapist-patient dyad, which is consistent with the modern trend in psychoanalytic treatment anyway. The notion of social constructions as constituting the psychoanalytic process was discussed and it was suggested that this notion suffers from the lack of sufficient attention to the historical determinants of how a given individual reacts in a given situation. A patient will react differently to different therapists, depending on the transference or projective identifications that the patient brings to the treatment, regardless of the interpersonal interaction. This is in opposition to the idea that transference is primarily an effect of the therapist-patient dyad, and preserves a major aspect of traditional Freudian theory. The dangers of postmodern thought disintegrating into nihilism are described, and the limitations of so-called postmodern thought are discussed, including the intrinsic paradoxical nature of any postmodern proposition. At the same time, postmodern thought is useful in calling attention to the ""space of the Other"" in human affairs, to the tendency to form binary oppositions in which the second element in each binary pair is part of the Other and is depreciated, and to remind us that there are always further interpretations of the narrative that emerges from the psychoanalytic situation. The feminization of psychotherapy and its relationship to feminism are important current issues. Postmodern thought is valuable in responding to the common complaint of feminists about Nietzsche's attitude toward women; postmodernist approaches emphasize the ambiguous and the allegorical aspects of Nietzsche's thought, to the extreme orf Derrida's contention that Nietzsche is not really interpretable at all. At the same time feminists legitimately object to postmodernist erosion of the grounds for political action.

8999476,[Smoking in students in secondary schools in Burkina Faso].,"A multi-centre enquiry in 12 of 30 provinces of Burkina Faso was carried out to study smoking in pupils at secondary schools. The prevalence of smoking was 13.6 per cent. Amongst the smokers, occasional smoking was the most common, involving 62 per cent. Boys smoked more than girls. The average age of starting smoking was early, at 13.4 years. The majority of smokers consumed less than five cigarettes a day and the favourite place for consumption was the home of their parents or guardian and at school. The determinants of school smokers were above all environmental: the influence of friends and advertising. The students showed a good knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking. This knowledge was linked to their educational level and to their status as a smoker or non-smoker. The proportion of pupils who had obtained good results in the term which preceded the enquiry was more significant amongst the non-smokers than amongst the smokers. An awareness of the significance of smoking amongst pupils by their parents, guardians and teachers involves health education and rigorous legislative measures on advertising and these would contribute to some reduction in the extent of the phenomenon in educational establishments.",Revue des maladies respiratoires,1996 Oct,France,1996,90

However, the presence of interpersonal and social problems, other psychiatric or physical disorders, and the type of depression (e.g. depression as one ""pole' in a bipolar disorder, dysthymia) are also factors of importance.

8955730,Desegregating health statistics and health research in South Africa.,"OBJECTIVE: This article aims: (i) to re-examine the use and usefulness of categorisation based on 'race', ethnicity and 'population group' membership in public health research; and (ii) to assess the consequences of using these categories for describing, analysing and redressing disparities in health within South Africa. The utility of categorisation based on 'race', ethnicity and 'population group'. Categorising populations and comparing patterns of disease between different groups of people can be a useful technique for identifying potential causes of disease. In this context, ethnicity is a valid social concept that could be used to investigate the consequences of self-ascribed identity on health. Likewise, 'population group', as defined during apartheid in South Africa, represents a valid political concept that could be used for assessing the impact of social discrimination on health. However, both these concepts are often seen, and used, as euphemisms for 'race', even though there are no genetically distinct human subspecies that can be identified and categorised as discrete 'races'. Indeed, 'race' as a biological concept has no validity in human biology. Nevertheless, categories based on 'race', ethnicity and 'population group; continue to be used in health research, and reinforce the perception that differences in disease between different 'racial', ethnic and 'population' groups are the result of heritable biological characteristics. In so doing, they undermine support for health interventions that would otherwise address the social and political origins of 'racial' and ethnic disparities in health. The utility of 'population group' for redressing the consequences of apartheid. Despite these problems, 'population group' classification provides important information for assessing the impact of apartheid on disparities in health within South Africa. Yet, the abolition of apartheid legislation is likely to result in extensive socio-economic and geographical migration that will weaken the sensitivity and specificity of 'population group' as an indicator for identifying inequalities in health. For this reason, targeting corrective action at specific population groups in order to tackle disparities in health, runs the risk of ignoring alternative social causes of inequalities in health, and ignoring disadvantaged individuals from elsewhere in the population. The continued use of 'population group' classification might also perpetuate the root cause of disparities in health, by maintaining the process used to formalise discrimination. CONCLUSION: If the purpose of health research is to monitor inequalities in health and to help target resources aimed at reducing these inequalities, then it should seek, in its language, concepts and methods to undermine the root cause of disadvantage. Health research aimed at monitoring and redressing the consequences of social disadvantage on health should therefore focus on non-biological determinants of social disparities in health. As a general rule, health researchers should avoid using categories based on 'race', ethnicity and 'population group' when collecting and analysing health data; journal editors should not accept articles that use these categories without justification; and health authorities should not collect data routinely segregated by 'race', ethnicity or 'population group'.",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,1996 Oct,South Africa,1996,90
8922084,Is breastfeeding beneficial and maternal smoking harmful to the cognitive development of children?,"The effects of breastfeeding on cognitive, visuomotor and language development were examined in healthy children born at full term, after they had reached 56 months of age. Three hundred and sixty-three children were breastfed for less than 5 months, and 363 for 5 months or more. The groups were matched pairwise having regard to maternal education and sex of the child. Significant differences were found in relation to scores reflecting general cognitive capacity, and the results of the visuomotor integration test between children breastfed for less than 5 months and those breastfed for 5 months or more, and between children of mothers who had smoked during pregnancy and non-smoking mothers. In multiple linear regression analysis prolonged breastfeeding was significantly related to scores reflecting general cognitive capacity and results of the visuomotor integration test. However, smoking by mothers during pregnancy was not significantly related to scores in cognitive tests. Biological factors, and factors such as lifestyle and social background, may be more important determinants of a child's development than breastfeeding.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1996 Oct,Norway,1996,90

DESIGN: Analysis of death registrations, 1970-1985, by country of birth. SETTING: England and Wales. POPULATION: Women dying in England and Wales during pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium, or dying from malignant tumour of the placenta. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The risk of dying in pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium, adjusted for age and year of death, and the risk of cause-specific death, adjusted for age, in immigrants compared with women born in England and Wales. RESULTS: Women born in West Africa (relative risk 10.3; 95% CI 8.0-13.2) and the Caribbean (4.6; 3.8-5.7) were at very elevated risk of maternal death and of the main causes of death. Women from Southern Asia (1.6; 1.3-2.0) and ""Europe and the USSR' (1.7; 1.2-2.3) were at moderate risk. Adjustment for year of death increased the estimates of risk and women born in the ""Rest of the World' and Scotland were at significantly elevated risk. CONCLUSIONS: An increased incidence of obstetric conditions in immigrant groups may account for the elevated risk but it is also possible that differences in care may account for some of the additional risk. The pattern of increased risk does not appear to be explicable by the parity or social class distribution of immigrants as far as data are available on these. Research is required into the aetiology of the differential incidence of obstetric disease. The collection of routine mortality data which include maternal reproductive and social factors would elucidate the significance of such factors to maternal health. Further investigation into possible differences in the process of antenatal care between immigrants and non-immigrants is required, and into whether this affects the risk of maternal mortality.",British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,1996 Oct,England,1996,90
8837535,Alberta Euthanasia Survey: 3-year follow-up.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the opinions of Alberta physicians about active euthanasia had changed and to assess the determinants of potential changes in opinion. DESIGN: Follow-up survey (mailed questionnaire) of physicians included in the 1991 Alberta Euthanasia Survey. SETTING: Alberta. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 1391 physicians who participated in the 1991 survey 1291 (93%) had indicated that they were willing to take part in a follow-up survey. A follow-up questionnaire was mailed in 1994 to 1146 physicians who could be traced through the 1994 Medical Directory of the provincial college of physicians and surgeons; 25 questionnaires were returned because they could not be delivered. OUTCOME MEASURES: Physicians' opinions about (a) the morality of active euthanasia, (b) changes in the law to permit active euthanasia and (c) the practice of legalized euthanasia. RESULTS: Of the 1121 physicians sent a follow-up questionnaire 866 (77%) returned it completed. The responses of these same 866 physicians in 1991 provided a basis for comparison. Of the 866, 360 (42%) stated in the 1994 survey that it is sometimes right to practise active euthanasia; a similar proportion (384 [44%]) gave this response in 1991. However, other opinions changed significantly. In 1991, 250 of the respondents (29%) indicated that they would practise active euthanasia if it were legalized, as compared with 128 (15%) in 1994 (p < 0.01). In 1991, 429 (50%) of the respondents thought that the law should be changed to permit active euthanasia, as compared with 316 (37%) in 1994 (p < 0.01). Religious activity was the most important characteristic associated with changes in opinion. Despite the decrease in support for the practice and legalization of active euthanasia between 1991 and 1994, in both surveys at least 70% of those who responded to this question indicated that active euthanasia, if it were legalized, should be performed only by physicians and should be taught at medical sites. CONCLUSION: Alberta physicians' support for the practice and legalization of active euthanasia decreased considerably between 1991 and 1994. However, most physicians remain in favour of restricting active euthanasia, if it were legalized, to the medical profession. These results suggest a need for caution and deliberation when changes in the law concerning active euthanasia are examined.",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,1996 Oct 1,Canada,1996,90
8823213,Management of the early and late presentations of rheumatoid arthritis: a survey of Ontario primary care physicians.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine primary care physicians' management of rheumatoid arthritis, ascertain the determinants of management and compare management with that recommended by a current practice panel. DESIGN: Mail survey (self-administered questionnaire). SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: A stratified computer-generated random sample of 798 members of the College of Family Physicians of Canada. OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions of respondents who chose various items in the management of two hypothetical patients, one with early rheumatoid arthritis and one with late rheumatoid arthritis. Scores for investigations, interventions and referrals for each scenario were generated by summing the recommended items chosen by respondents and then dividing by the total number of items recommended in that category. The scores were examined for their association with physician and practice characteristics and physician attitudes. RESULTS: The response rate was 68.3% (529/775 eligible physicians). Recommended investigations were chosen by more than two thirds of the respondents for both scenarios. Referrals to physiotherapy, occupational therapy and rheumatology, all recommended by the panel, were chosen by 206 (38.9%), 72 (13.6%) and 309 (58.4%) physicians respectively for early rheumatoid arthritis. These proportions were significantly higher for late rheumatoid arthritis (p < 0.01). In multiple regression analysis, for early rheumatoid arthritis, internship or residency training in rheumatology was associated with higher investigation and intervention scores, for late rheumatoid arthritis, older physicians had higher intervention scores and female physicians had higher referral scores. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians' investigation of rheumatoid arthritis was in accord with panel recommendations. However, rates of referral to rheumatologists and other health care professionals were very low, especially for the early presentation of rheumatoid arthritis. More exposure to rheumatology and to the role of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work during primary care training is strongly recommended.",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,1996 Sep 15,Canada,1996,90
15073816,Usage and users of natural remedies in a middle-aged population: demographic and psychosocial characteristics. Results from the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study.,"BACKGROUND: In Sweden, large amounts of money are spent annually on natural remedies (NRs), in spite of the fact that most products in this category lack scientific documentation of their efficacy and side-effects. The usage and users of natural remedies are not well defined. This paper describes NR use and NR users in a city in southern Sweden, and tests the hypothesis that the use of natural remedies is a strategy for coping with psychosocial stressors. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 6545 men and women, aged 45-65 years, who during 1991 and 1992 participated in the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study, a large-scale prospective cohort study. Data on consumption of natural remedies were recorded during seven consecutive days, as part of a dietary assessment. Each participant also completed a questionnaire, covering education, work history, alcohol and smoking habits, perceived health, and psychosocial factors such as social network, social support, job strain and global control. Body composition was also measured. RESULTS: The prevalence of NR consumption was 26% among women and 17% among men. NR use was most common during winter and spring. The most popular products were ginseng, garlic, and various herb and plant extracts. Important determinants of NR usage were higher education, Swedish origin, and lifestyle factors like low body weight fat percentage and high alcohol consumption among women. Other determinants were higher age and non-smoking among men. None of the psychosocial factors appeared to influence the prevalence of NR consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of NR consumption is influenced by sex, demographic factors, season of the year, and lifestyle. Use of NRs does not appear to be a common strategy for coping with psychosocial stress.",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,1996 Sep,England,1996,90
12292230,Outmigration of U.S. immigrants.,"""A methodology is devised for the empirical analysis of the determinants of outmigration of immigrants in a population. Empirical studies in this area have been hindered by a lack of longitudinal data on the characteristics of the immigrants. This problem is tackled by making use of cross-sectional data at two points in time. It is applied to the study of male immigrants in the United States. It is found that education is positively related to the rate of outmigration for immigrants from Canada, Asia and the pooled sample of immigrants. This finding suggests that the cross-sectional estimates of the growth in earnings of immigrants in the United States are underestimated for these groups of immigrants.""",Applied economics,1996 Sep,England,1996,90
8991242,Management of incomplete abortion with manual vacuum aspiration in comparison to sharp metallic curette in an Ethiopian setting.,"This institution based case control study emanated from the fact that manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) has been recently introduced in Ethiopia and Gandhi Memorial hospital is currently serving as the pioneering centre. Abortion is an important everyday medicolegal, social, political and public health issue. The objectives of the study were to focus on abortion issues, to show that MVA is alternative instrument applicable in our setting and to highlight some of the determinants that can influence the choice of instruments in the management of incomplete abortions of less than 12 weeks of gestation. A total of 1896 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria underwent evacuation and curettage with MVA and SMC during the study period. The main considered variables included socio-demographic characteristics, service-providers, complications in relation to operators and method of surgery, duration of the surgery, patient pain evaluation and uterine factors. MVA is found to be equally safe, effective, simple and fast set of instruments which can be employed in the management of incomplete abortions. Integration of MVA in the medical training is recommended as it is a measure which can greatly contribute towards the reduction of maternal morbidity and mortality especially in a developing country like ours where resources are scare and alternatives are quite limited.",East African medical journal,1996 Sep,Kenya,1996,90
8931354,"The gender difference in orienting liquid surfaces and plumb-lines: its robustness, its correlates, and the associated knowledge of simple physics.","In comparison between male and female psychology students, a greater proportion of female students fail to represent liquid surfaces and plumb-line objects as invariably horizontal and vertical, respectively. However, the occurrence of this perplexing gender difference has not been ascertained among young adults enrolled in science programs, who should ostensibly be more fully equipped in terms of academic competence, irrespective of their gender. The present large sample of undergraduates (N = 1412), majoring in natural and applied sciences, and social sciences or humanities and arts, completed water-level and plumb-line items, along with other simple physics problems, indicating how and in reference to which principle they had solved these tasks. They also answered questions pertaining to possible personal proficiency correlates of a biological, experiential, perceptual, and sociocognitive nature. The data revealed not only that women's achievement was consistently poorer than men's across discipline categories, but surprisingly that this was so even within specific fields requiring and providing the most visuo-spatial skills as well as physical knowledge and training. Especially for women, mastery was predicted by success in simple physics problems, and to a lesser degree by perceptual, sociocognitive, and experiential variables. Biological variables did not contribute to proficiency for either gender, though the data fitted a recessive gene model. Responses based on relevant physics principles were more accurate, but men and women generally adopted the same procedural strategies. The present compelling demonstration of a gender gap in achievement that is not compensated by formal science education, extending thus even to future physical scientists, invites further investigation into its perceptual and cognitive determinants, as well as into those more distally connected with early aptitudes, interests, and experiences.",Canadian journal of experimental psychology = Revue canadienne de psychologie experimentale,1996 Sep,Canada,1996,90
8923653,Women's lives in transition: a qualitative analysis of the fertility decline in Bangladesh.,"The fertility decline that began in Bangladesh in the late 1980s and continues has prompted diverse theories to explain it. In this qualitative analysis of 21 focus-group sessions with rural women ranging in age from the teens to late 40s and living in the villages of the Matlab area, the women's perceptions of their changing society and of the influence of the family planning program are examined. The women's statements reveal their awareness of the social and economic transition they are undergoing and their interest in family-size limitation, which is bolstered by a strong family planning program. Although the shifts in economic and social circumstances are not large, in conjunction with the strong family planning program they constitute a powerful force for change in attitudes, ideas, and behavior among these women.",Studies in family planning,1996 Sep-Oct,United States,1996,90
8922237,The epidemiology of Hodgkin's disease.,"Much of the epidemiological heterogeneity of HD incidence reflects the behaviour of the NS subtype, at least in the USA. Incidence variation across races (except Asians) and time periods is most marked in this subtype. In young adults with HD, there is compelling evidence for social class modification of risk consistent with an infectious aetiology; limited data suggest that this effect occurs within the NS subtype, but considerable evidence indicates that it does not primarily involve EBV infection. Findings from familial aggregation studies and HLA associations point to inherited susceptibility to this subtype. Despite little sex difference for NS in young adulthood in the latest incidence data, parity nevertheless appears to be protective against this subtype for women. Therefore, the greater increase for females than males in the incidence of young-adult NS in recent years may reflect the impact of population trends towards later childbearing and lower parity. This change, as well as the concomitant smaller family sizes and growing affluence, could explain part of the burgeoning incidence of NS in young adults in the USA. These observations suggest that NS in young adults constitutes a separate disease, probably of infectious origin. The incongruous occurrence of this subtype in older adults, and the presence of EBV in some NS cases, could reflect heterogeneity within NS, for example, representing features of the cellular phase of NS (Cozen et al, 1992; Medeiros and Greiner, 1995). For the non-NS subtypes, many of the factors that predict risk of NS may also be relevant. Patterns of social class determinants in children and older adults, the age groups at risk for MC, support involvement of an infectious precursor given intense exposure, and EBV is a likely candidate, based on its high prevalence in these groups. However, little aetiological research has been directed explicitly at the non-NS subtypes. Considerable effort has gone into exploring an infectious aetiology of HD. Recently, this line of investigation has moved beyond social class determinants to molecular epidemiological studies of EBV and, to a lesser degree, other potentially involved viruses. The roles of genetic susceptibility and sex hormones also represent promising areas for exploration, particularly in their possible interaction with infectious agents and other environmental factors. Ultimately, clearer epidemiological understanding of HD will be aided by more precise classification of this disease at the molecular level.",Bailliere's clinical haematology,1996 Sep,England,1996,90
8909658,Determinants of functional health of low-income black women with osteoarthritis.,"This study examines 10 culturally relevant indices of physical, psychological, and social function in order to specify and quantify their influence on the multidimensional functional health of low-income Black older women who have a medical diagnosis of osteoarthritis and no known history of coexisting medical conditions that would cause severe debilitation. Using a non-experimental, correlational design, cross-sectional data were obtained in individual face-to-face interviews. A nonprobability sample of 100 low-income, community-living Black older female participants of two local senior centers were interviewed for analysis. Functional health was measured with the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2; physical function by body mass index, number of arthritic joints, and a timed 8-foot walk score; psychological function with scores for the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Spiritual Perspective Scale; and social function by the sociodemographics of age, income, years of education, and household size. Multiple regression analysis data indicated that functional health was best explained by three interrelated variables: depression, timed 8-foot walk score, and number of arthritic joints. This combination of variables explained 45% of the variance in functional health. Depression was highly correlated with other predictors and explained the largest amount of variance. Findings emphasize the need for enhanced education of providers to stimulate development of health promotion/disease prevention programs that will decrease the occurrence and effects of depression, joint pathology, and physical immobility, thereby improving health-related outcomes for Black older women who have osteoarthritis.",American journal of preventive medicine,1996 Sep-Oct,Netherlands,1996,90
8909120,Help-seeking behaviours among child psychiatric clinic attenders in Hong Kong.,"This study employed semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to describe the help-seeking processes and examine the determinants of help-seeking behaviours in 100 consecutive referrals to a child psychiatric clinic in Hong Kong. The help-seeking processes were characterized by (1) a sequential pattern of lay consultations starting from the families, relatives, friends and, rarely, neighbours; (2) detour via multiple professionals; (3) delay in reaching specialist services. A total of seven psychosocial variables were used to predict the help-seeking behaviours. The younger the child was, the more likely members outside the families were sought for advice. A large number of professional consultations was predicted by a high symptom score and relative old age in the referred child, less social disadvantages in the family and parental beliefs that family influences were not the cause of the child's problems. A long delay in reaching specialist services was predicted by a high symptom score in the child. Parental beliefs of outside influences being the cause of the child's problems predicted a short delay in reaching the clinic. Low awareness of services was the predominant difficulty parents encountered when they sought psychiatric care for their children. Public health education to demystify the cause of mental disturbances, close networking with teachers and general practitioners, and establishment of community child mental health clinics for easy access are recommended.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1996 Sep,Germany,1996,90
8902901,"Emotional reactivity, defensiveness, and ambulatory cardiovascular response at work.","OBJECTIVE: To examine whether individual differences in dispositional emotional reactivity (ER), denoting a proneness to sustained emotional arousal in the face of stressful events, are associated with tension arousal and cardiovascular (CV) response at work, and whether this association is modified by defensive coping. METHOD: Eighty-two male normotensive industrial workers participated in the study. ER was measured by the Emotional Reactivity Scale (Melamed, 1994). Defensive coping was identified by high scores on the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) was recorded concurrently with tension feelings during a typical workday. RESULTS: ER was positively associated with systolic BP (p = .04) and diastolic BP (p = .0009) response at work, whereas defensiveness was negatively associated with both systolic BP (p = .0001) and diastolic BP (p = .04) response. This was true even after controlling for several potent determinants of ambulatory BP. No interactive effect was found between ER and defensiveness on BP response at work. High emotional reactives (ERS) had a higher proportion of tension reports during work than low ERS (p < .0001); this also applied to low defensive compared to high defensive individuals (p < .0001). ER and defensiveness interacted to affect baseline (clinic) diastolic BP. The lowest values were observed in true low (nondefensive) emotional reactives (ERS). Defensive/low ERS (repressors) had elevated BP, similar to the high (nondefensive)/ERS. Defensive/ high ERS had an intermediate BP level. CONCLUSIONS: Both high ER and low defensiveness were independently shown to be effective in identifying persons who might display recurrent tension arousal and pressure responses at work as well as high baseline BP values. When considering both baseline and ambulatory BP values, nondefensive/high ERS appear to be at greatest CV risk.",Psychosomatic medicine,1996 Sep-Oct,United States,1996,90
8898496,"Exploring the determinants of support provision: provider characteristics, personal networks, community contexts, and support following life events.","To explore the determinants of support provision in the natural disaster context, we followed House (1981) and developed a model that specifies how characteristics of the providers, their personal networks, and the community contexts in which they live facilitate or impede their ability to provide support. All three sets of factors affected support provision during Hurricane Andrew, but the pattern of effects differs for the preparation and short-term recovery phases of the hurricane. Age, income, network density, and local economic conditions had significant effects on support provision in the preparation phase. Income did not have a significant effect on short-term recovery support, but religion, house damage, the size and diversity dimensions of network structure, and the local bonds and sentiments dimensions of community attachment did. After comparing the explanatory power of our model in the two phases, we conclude by investigating the implications of this test for understanding the determinants of support provision more generally.",Journal of health and social behavior,1996 Sep,United States,1996,90
8891080,Determinants of decision-making in the screening procedure of a community psychiatric service.,"This study is a predictor analysis of the screening procedure followed by a psychiatric service for a period of 1 year preceding and a period of 1 year following the introduction of community psychiatry. Throughout this period, the psychiatric service consisted of a local service within the catchment area and a central service at a psychiatric hospital outside the area. At the time of the reorganization, the responsibility for the psychiatric service was transferred from the public health authorities to the social services. Before the reorganization, screenings were conducted on the basis of referral papers or simply as a result of telephone communication. After the reorganization, the screening procedure was intensified by means of a pre-examination. One aim of the reorganization was to ensure that the severely mentally ill take priority over patients characterized predominantly by social strain. Patients with manic-depressive psychosis and other psychoses showed a significantly increased probability of being accepted for treatment, whereas those with schizophrenia showed no significant increase, irrespective of the service reorganization. Similarly, manic-depressive psychosis and other psychoses (not schizophrenia) were significant predictors of hospitalization at the mental hospital outside the catchment area as well as hospitalization in the local facilities, irrespective of the service reorganization. Indicators of social strain were not given higher priority following the service reorganization.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,1996 Sep,United States,1996,90
8889109,Getting started--a review of physical activity adoption studies.,"The aim of this paper has been to review methods that have been found to be effective in getting sedentary adults to adopt physical activity, to examine these methods within the multilevel framework conceptualised by Winett et al, and to provide recommendations for future research to test new methods and their effectiveness in leading to the adoption of physical activity in sedentary populations. Searches for relevant studies were conducted on the Medline computerised database. Additional studies were located in reference sections of these studies and other review papers. Surveys that specifically identified determinants of adoption of physical activity in adults were included. Reviewed articles were selected on the basis of quasi-experimental and experimental designs that specifically examined the question of how to get sedentary adults to adopt a programme of physical activity or exercise, had completely described methods, and evaluated the effectiveness of methods of increasing physical activity and/or exercise. While numerous reviews have been written on determinants on physical activity adoption and maintenance, only two prospective surveys have identified specifics of adoption of physical activity. Most of the evidence for techniques that help inactive people to adopt physical activity comes from quasi-experimental and experimental intervention studies examining various cognitive and behavioural strategies at the individual level. Fewer studies have examined techniques at the interpersonal, organisational, community, environmental, and policy level. More prospective observational studies aimed at homogeneous subgroups are needed to identify correlates of physical activity adoption to help tailor interventions. Continued clinical studies are needed to differentiate the necessary and sufficient strategies at the personal and interpersonal levels. Interventions aimed at environmental, institutional, and social levels remain largely unexplored and there is a need for more research that specifically targets inactive subgroups at these levels.",British journal of sports medicine,1996 Sep,England,1996,90
8888326,"Saying ""no"" to environmental tobacco smoke: determinants of assertiveness among nonsmoking employees.","BACKGROUND: Nonsmokers' assertiveness can help regulate smoking in worksites by enhancing the salience of nonsmoking social norms. This study examined determinants of employees' assertiveness toward smoking colleagues. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from 898 nonsmoking Dutch employees. Potential determinants were chosen using the attitude-social influence-efficacy model. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of nonsmoking employees asked co-workers not to smoke. Assertive respondents had colleagues who more often acted assertively toward smokers at work, had a more positive attitude to asking colleagues not to smoke, and had a higher perceived self-efficacy. Moreover, assertive employees more often perceived hindrance from environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and had more negative beliefs about ETS at work. CONCLUSIONS: What matters is whether ETS is perceived as bothersome and harmful. It is likely that both conditions must be met for nonsmokers to behave assertively. Worksite educational programs could focus more on increasing nonsmokers' awareness of the harmfulness of regular exposure to ETS at work to increase social pressure on employees who smoke in places that are shared by smokers and nonsmokers. However, the effectiveness of such strategies is yet unknown.",Preventive medicine,1996 Sep-Oct,United States,1996,90
8880401,Substance use: toward an understanding of its relation to nutrition-related attitudes and behavior among Israeli high school youth.,"PURPOSE: To study the distribution, prevalence, determinants, and association between substance use (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs) and eating attitudes and behavior of high school students in the Negev region of Israel in order to provide an improved basis for prevention and health services. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire regarding attitudes and behavior related to substance use and eating (e.g., breakfast before school, a snack or meal during school time, and three meals a day) was answered by 1,513 high school age youth. RESULTS: The study participants were at greater risk of poor eating behavior if they: (1) used cigarettes, alcohol, and/or illicit substances (p < .01); and (2) were female (p < .01). It was found that girls who used cigarettes were more likely than other young people studied not to eat properly and not to know about the relation between proper eating behavior and personal health (p < .05). Regardless whether cigarettes, alcohol, or illicit substances were used or not used, more than 50% of the youth reported not eating breakfast and 30% indicated they did not eat three meals daily. CONCLUSIONS: There are many concerns about the use and abuse of both licit and illicit substances among adolescents. More attention, however, needs to be given to the relationship between substance use and the attitudes and behavior of young people toward their health, including proper eating habits. The results support the need to develop drug prevention and health programs that are more comprehensive in terms of addressing the broad range of factors associated with adolescent growth and development.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1996 Sep,United States,1996,90

METHOD: The study is based on an empirical analysis of all psychiatric in-patient completed episodes in England in 1991/92. Any index of need should be independent of the effect of variations in health care supply on the use of psychiatric services. In order to disentangle the influences of supply from social and clinical determinants of utilisation, two stage least squares regression and multilevel modelling techniques were used. RESULTS: The outcome was an index comprising six health and socio-economic variables. This is now being used by the NHS Executive to distribute about pound 2.2 billion of annual NHS expenditure for psychiatric services between English health authorities. CONCLUSION: It is shown that the index is much more sensitive to needs and therefore more redistributive than the previous index of need used in the NHS.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1996 Sep,England,1996,90

These interventions are in the area of reproductive health, where most attention to women's health has focused; they consist mainly of assessment tools that can be used by peripheral health workers and rural women themselves. The paper argues that in nonreproductive health generally, there is a dearth of information on the biological and social determinants and consequences of infection and disease from a gender perspective.

8866164,Social barriers to optimal pain management in infants and children.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the social barriers that lead to less than optimal management of pain in children. DESIGN: Recognizing the vulnerabilities of infants and children and their dependence on caring adults, a model of pain communication is proposed. The model examines (a) the pain experiences of children, including social determinants; (b) developmental variations in the capacity to encode the severity and qualities of pain as expressive behavior; (c) adult skills and deficiencies in decoding pain; and (d) the actions of adults predicated on the meaning and significance attached to children's actions. Limitations in care were examined. DATA SOURCES: The current research and professional literature were accessed through searches of the Psyclit and Medline databases for relevant investigations on the basis of our working knowledge of the literature. CONCLUSION: Numerous deterrents to optimal care are identified in the domains of commonplace beliefs about the nature of pain in infants and children: failure to recognize the impact of socialization in familial and cultural modes of experience and expression; needs for age-specific assessment instruments; the limited capacity to use available evidence concerning pain; the need to employ clinicians, parents, and other adults more effectively in delivering care; and structural problems in the health care system.",The Clinical journal of pain,1996 Sep,United States,1996,90
8865822,The clinical learning environment.,"This paper presents a brief review of the attributes of effective learning environments in clinical settings. Recent studies articulate the perceived importance of social and organizational factors as determinants of learning. Differences are evident among hospitals and among departments within hospitals with regard to the quality of the learning environment they offer. These differences are reflected in the orientation towards teaching and learning, the level of autonomy, variety and workload, and the quality of supervision and social support. Differences are also evident in the type and quality of opportunities for practice of important skills and in the availability of educational resources. These factors are perceived as major determinants of the effectiveness of learning in clinical settings. The implications for clinical teachers and administrators are discussed. The authors argue that emphasis should be given to the creation of supportive and well-organized learning environments in clinical settings. This may require a great emphasis on the role of clinical teachers as designers of opportunities for learning and managers of learning resources.",Israel journal of medical sciences,1996 Sep,Israel,1996,90

The analysis has two objectives: (1) to evaluate the impact of selected demographic characteristics on the magnitude and trajectory of change in drinking across multiple samples, and (2) to assess the influence of methodological characteristics on the consistency of results across studies. METHOD: Raw data from studies including two serial measures of the frequency of alcohol consumption are analyzed. Fixed, random and mixed effects models for meta-analysis are used to pool measures across observations and model the influence of predictors on variability between results. RESULTS: Gender-based variation in the patterning of change is present across all observations, but concentrated in early periods of the life course. Age displays significant predictive effects across all observations, but statistically uniform results are obtained for subjects aged 30 and over. The national origin of study predicts larger amounts of variation than do other demographic predictors in the models. Significant effects are observed for several methodological characteristics of studies. Variation among effect estimates is associated with differences between samples in the interval between first and final measurements, the date of first measurement (a proxy for the historical context of the sample), the percentage retention of subjects between measurements and the time frame of the original alcohol measure. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the synthesis of data from multiple longitudinal samples, this study (1) characterizes normative developmental patterning in the frequency of alcohol consumption and demonstrates the varying effects of demographic factors across the life-course: (2) indicates the key influence of cultural and historical context on the establishment of drinking patterns; and (3) confirms the impact of methodological differences on variation in the results of studies.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1996 Sep,United States,1996,90
8780608,Method for separating patient and procedural factors while analyzing interdepartmental differences in rates of surgical infections: the Israeli Study of Surgical Infection in Abdominal Operations.,"The objective of this study was to develop a method for analyzing differences in the performance of hospitals with respect to outcome by separating patient factors from procedural factors. The setting included a prospective follow-up of a sample of 5571 patients undergoing all types of surgical procedures in general surgery departments of 11 hospitals (20 surgical departments) across Israel. Of these, 769 underwent surgery involving the opening of the bowel, and they are the subjects of this report. Our method consisted of a prospective follow-up by a nurse epidemiologist, including detailed clinical data from the day of admission to hospital discharge. Analysis was directed at identifying reasons for the observed variability in wound infections among departments. Observed rates were compared with ""expected"" rates calculated from a logistic model pooled over departments. An attempt was made to separate patient-inherent characteristics, such as age, sex, and diagnosis, from procedural factors, depicting the patient's experience during his hospitalization. Results indicated that the marked interdepartmental differences in the observed infection rates were not accounted for by differences in the ""case mix"" among departments. Procedural risk factors in this data set played the main role in explaining the observed variability among surgical departments. We conclude that the simple method presented here used the data pooled over departments to define the main risk determinants for infection in this data set. It separated intrinsic patient factors from procedural characteristics, and could be used in studies where the main interest is to compare institutions, and point at reasons behind the differences in outcomes.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,1996 Sep,United States,1996,90

SUBJECTS: 40 consecutive patients referred for echocardiography either because of symptoms (10 patients) or because of a heart murmur (30). 39 were shown to have a normal heart. INTERVENTIONS: Medical consultations and semistructured patient interviews were tape recorded. Structured interviews with consultant cardiologists were recorded in survey form. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient recall of the explanation and residual understanding, doubt, and anxiety about the heart after the test and post-test consultation. RESULTS: All 10 patients presenting with symptoms were left with anxiety about the heart despite a normal test result and reassurance by the consultant. Of 28 patients referred because of a murmur but shown to have no heart abnormality, 20 became anxious after detection of the murmur; 11 had residual anxiety despite the normal test result. CONCLUSIONS: Reassurance of the ""worried well""-anxious patients with symptoms or patients concerned by a health query resulting from a routine medical examination or from screening-constitutes a large part of medical practice. It seems to be widely assumed that explaining that tests have shown no abnormality is enough to reassure. The results of this study refute this and emphasise the importance of personal and social factors as obstacles to reassurance.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 Aug 10,England,1996,90
8683633,Determinants of survival in older cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: We and others have previously described a number of characteristics that are associated with delays in diagnosis and increased risk for inadequate treatment of older women and men with cancer. These characteristics include poor social support, limited access to transportation, and impaired cognition. However, there is little information on how these factors influence survival of older cancer patients. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine which patient characteristics predicted survival up to 10 years after the diagnosis of cancer. METHODS: In 1984, we initiated a population-based study of men and women who were 65 years of age or older, living in a six-county area of New Mexico, and newly diagnosed with cancer. For 646 individuals with cancer of the breast (n = 188), prostate (n = 247), or colon or rectum (n = 211), we assessed patient baseline characteristics, disease stage at diagnosis, and adequacy of treatment (definitive or nondefinitive) as determinants of survival for up to 10 years following diagnosis. Multivariate survival models were used to analyze the data; all P values were two-sided. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, we first included all patient characteristics, except the stage at diagnosis and the adequacy of treatment. In this initial analysis, the following were among variables that were significantly associated with patient survival: age, education, cancer knowledge, ethnic group, and cognitive status. When stage at diagnosis and adequacy of treatment were added to the model, both advanced stage at diagnosis (hazard ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval inverted question markCI inverted question mark = 1.3-2.1] for diagnosis at regional stage versus local stage; hazard ratio = 3.0 [95% CI = 2.0-4.7] for distant stage versus local stage) and inadequate treatment (hazard ratio = 1.6 [95% CI = 1.1-2.3]) were associated with poor survival. However, adding stage at diagnosis and adequacy of treatment to the analysis had little influence on the magnitude of the effect of patient characteristics on survival. In separate analyses of patient data by cancer site, receipt of nondefinitive therapy was associated with increased mortality among patients with colon/rectal cancer (hazard ratio = 7.8 [95% CI = 2.8-21.4]) and breast cancer (hazard ratio = 2.2 [95% CI = 1.1-4.3]) but not among patients with prostate cancer (hazard ratio = 1.0 [95% CI = 0.6-1.9]). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced stage at diagnosis and inadequate treatment of older cancer patients are associated with poor survival. Impaired cognition and inadequate education in elderly patients are also associated with poor survival. This decreased survival does not appear to be a consequence of known barriers to health care that are responsible for delays in diagnosis and for inadequate treatment. IMPLICATIONS: Efforts to facilitate early diagnosis and receipt of definitive treatment for cancer in older individuals may improve their survival.",Journal of the National Cancer Institute,1996 Aug 7,United States,1996,90
10163567,Evidence for success in health promotion: suggestions for improvement.,This paper argues that health promotion needs to develop an approach to evaluation and effectiveness that values qualitative methodologies. It posits the idea that qualitative research could learn from the experience of quantitative researchers and promote more useful ways of measuring effectiveness by the use of intermediate and indirect indicators. It refers to a European-wide project designed to gather information on the effectiveness of health promotion interventions. This project discovered that there was a need for an instrument that allowed qualitative intervention methodologies to be assessed in the same way as quantitative methods.,Health education research,1996 Sep,England,1996,90
8930590,Determinants of oral health in a group of Danish alcoholics.,"The purposes of this survey were to describe dental health in a group of alcoholics and to analyze the influence of social background, dental health behavior and alcohol-related variables on dental health among alcoholics. The dental health in a group of consecutively admitted alcoholics (n = 195) was described with respect to number of teeth present, DMFS, DS and the prevalence of dental erosion, removable dentures, edentulousness, and untreated dental decay. No major differences were found with respect to number of teeth and dental caries (DMFS), when compared to reference figures of the general population. As to untreated decay, however, 3-5 x more actual decayed surfaces were found among the alcoholics. In the multivariate analyses, neither DMFS, nor untreated decay were found to be associated with alcohol-related indicators. These variables were, however, related to variables of social background and dental health behavior. As to number of teeth present, an association was found with duration of alcoholism, but this relationship was eliminated, when the analysis was controlled with respect to social situation. In contrast, dental erosion was related to duration of alcoholism irrespective of confounding control of dental health behavior and social situation. Hence, the study indicates that oral health in alcoholics can be explained mainly by social situation and dental health behavior and not by variables associated directly with alcohol consumption. An exception was the presence of dental erosion, which was associated with the exposure to alcohol.",European journal of oral sciences,1996 Aug,England,1996,90
8921465,An investigation of the role of fathers in immunization uptake.,"BACKGROUND: Mothers, but not fathers, are the usual focus of strategies to maximize immunization coverage in low income countries. METHODS: A study of the immunization determinants of children aged 12-18 months was conducted in 1991 in the Eastern Region of Ghana using structured interviews of a population sample of 294 mothers and 170 (67%) of the children's fathers. RESULTS: Fathers were more likely than mothers to perceive that the fathers had participated in the decision to send children for immunizations. Where both parents reported that the father had participated in the decision, and he could speak English, the child was more likely to have completed the immunization schedule by 12 months (OR = 5.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-21.7), independently of other factors. Neither the father's participation, nor his ability to speak English, was independently associated with the child's immunization status. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study suggest that, where fathers have a higher level of education, programmes which are designed to involve them in decisions about their children's use of preventive health services have the potential to increase timely immunization coverage levels.",International journal of epidemiology,1996 Aug,England,1996,90
8874650,HIV-related concerns and behaviors among Hispanic women.,"Hispanic women whose sexual partners have other sexual partners may be at risk for HIV. A structured interview was administered to 106 Dominican and Puerto Rican women who reported that they knew or suspected that their partner had other partners. A subsample participated in qualitative interviews. The study assessed concern about HIV and predictors of condom use. The majority of women reported that they worried about getting HIV and almost half had been HIV-tested. Most of the women discussed HIV/AIDS concerns with their partners, and one-third reported some condom use. Predictors of condom use were: born in the Dominican Republic/Puerto Rico, having talked with their partner about being tested, and belief that he used condoms with others. Although the women were concerned about HIV, condom use was infrequent. Results suggested methods to address this discrepancy: introducing condoms early in the relationship, developing women-controlled methods, and directly influencing men's behavior.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,1996 Aug,United States,1996,90
8853736,"Risk factors for intravenous drug use and sharing equipment among young male drug users in Longchuan County, south-west China.","OBJECTIVES: To identify the risk factors for intravenous drug use and sharing of equipment in Longchuan County in south-west China. METHODS: Demographic information and sexual and drug-use-related behavior between 1 January 1991 and 1 August 1994 were collected retrospectively from a cohort of young male drug users aged 18-29 years in 82 villages. RESULTS: A total of 433 drug users were identified. The cumulative incidence of intravenous drug use was 40.0% during the 3.7-year study period. The annual incidence increased from 10% in 1991 to over 30% in 1994. Risk factors for intravenous drug use among drug users, according to the multivariate model, included having had premarital/extramarital sex [odds ratio (OR), 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-2.3], having a family member who used drugs in 1991 (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.9), and currently not married (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.98-2.7). Being Buddhist protected against intravenous drug use (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9). The population attributable fraction was 30% for not being currently married, 17% for having had premarital/extramarital sex and 14% for having a family member who used drugs. The risk factor for sharing of equipment was being of Jingpo ethnicity (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 2.5-13.8). The average incidence of sharing equipment was 19.6% per year. The population attributable fraction for sharing equipment was 58.5% for being Jingpo. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of intravenous drug use and sharing equipment is increasing. Therefore, it is urgent that vigorous, effective intervention programs be initiated in southern Yunnan. Unmarried, sexually promiscuous Jingpo drug users with a family history of drug use should be especially targeted. Given the problems of transport and communication in this remote area of China, intervention programs which use existing social, governmental and community networks should be implemented.","AIDS (London, England)",1996 Aug,England,1996,90

8816874,Determinants of loneliness in Jerusalem's 70-year-old population.,"This study aims to find the determinants of feelings of loneliness in 70 year olds living in Jerusalem. Results based on home interviews (n = 605) of a 40% systematic sample of 70 year olds in the electoral register showed that around 46.3% of females and 21.3% of males reported being lonely. Persons of European/North American origin felt less lonely than those of Asian or African origin, probably due to the former's wider social support network, perceiving friends, neighbors or other relatives as being available to back up children in an emergency. The major factors associated with loneliness were: being depressed, having a poor self-assessed health status, not attending synagogue, and being widowed but not remarried. Factors that did not reduce loneliness included having paid employment, watching TV or listening to the radio. No association was found between cognitive status and loneliness. Our systems model suggests a strong reciprocal relationship between loneliness and depression.",Israel journal of medical sciences,1996 Aug,Israel,1996,90

As the transition proceeds, contraceptive use diffuses to the less educated, and fertility differentials by education eventually tend to reconverge. The question addressed here is: Do fertility differentials by education disappear or become positive in advanced industrial societies? Evidence presented in this paper indicates that in the United States they do not. As late as 1990, the latest year that we consider, fertility differentials by education were still strongly negative."" (SUMMARY IN ITA AND FRE)",Genus,1996 Jul-Dec,Germany,1996,90

The paper uses data from a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in June 1993. Respondents were asked whether they would like to see the level of immigration to the United States increased, decreased or kept the same. We test several hypotheses about factors influencing respondents' attitudes, including the importance of previously unexamined predictors. These new hypotheses relate to views about the health of the U.S. economy, feelings of social and political alienation, and isolationist sentiments concerning international economic issues and foreign relations. One important discovery is the close connection between possessing restrictionist immigration attitudes and having an isolationist perspective along a broader array of international issues.""",The International migration review,1996 Summer,United States,1996,90
8964453,"[Psychological coping with stillbirth. Course of grief response, influential factors, treatment satisfaction, patient management needs].","Course of Grief Response, influencing Factors, Satisfaction with treatment, Need for Psychotherapeutic Support: The emotional response to a late miscarriage or a stillbirth was examined retrospectively in a systematic study involving 51 patients. The women had lost a child either by stillbirth (beyond the 20th week of gestation) or shortly after delivery. We assessed the long-term course of possible determinants of grief, a complicated grief response, as well as the patients' satisfaction with the treatment and their need for further psychotherapeutic support. The mourning response was complicated by a depressive reaction in 22%. Major risk factors were individual disposition, lack of partner and professional support. The findings reveal that the course of the grief response is positively influenced by: 1. open discussion (thematisation) with the skilled personnel and the patients' families, 2. direct or indirect contact with the deceased child (concretisation) and 3. the patients concerned being extensively informed as to place and circumstances of the funeral (whereabouts of the child).",Geburtshilfe und Frauenheilkunde,1996 Jul,Germany,1996,90
8828747,"HIV seroincidence and correlates of seroconversion in a cohort of male factory workers in Harare, Zimbabwe.","OBJECTIVES: Given that health promotion messages on transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) have been widely publicized in Zimbabwe and elsewhere in the late 1980s, it is vital to analyse which risk events still expose individuals to infection. A cohort was established with the objectives of estimating HIV seroincidence, behavioural and biological determinants of infection, and ultimately, evaluating the impact of AIDS prevention interventions in the workplace. METHODS: HIV seroincidence was estimated in a prospectively followed cohort of male factory workers recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe during the period prior to a workplace AIDS prevention intervention. Correlates of HIV seroconversion were identified using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: There were 51 seroconversions among 1607 HIV-negative participants following 1738 person-years (PY) of observation [seroincidence, 2.93 per 100 PY; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.18-3.86]. The prevalence of HIV in the cohort was 19.1%. HIV seroincidence was significantly increased among men who were younger [hazard ratio (HR) per year, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99], were single (HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.56-6.96), were married but resided separately from their wives (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 0.99-4.80), reported having any STD (HR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.53-5.86), reported having a genital ulcer (HR, 4.87; 95% CI, 2.18-10.91), and reported paying for sex (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.06-3.77). Seroincidence also increased with the number of sex partners reported in the year preceding enrolment (HR per partner, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21). In multiple Cox regression analysis, three independent associations with HIV seroconversion were reporting a genital ulcer (adjusted HR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.52-8.29), number of sex partners (adjusted HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21), and being married but residing separately from one's wife (adjusted HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.00-4.89). CONCLUSIONS: Innovative and sustained workplace-based interventions are needed to address the high risk of HIV infection in this economically productive population. The predictors of HIV seroconversion described in this study underscore the need for public health efforts to simultaneously address the biological, socioeconomic and behavioural factors that continue to place individuals at risk of HIV in general populations of Africa.","AIDS (London, England)",1996 Jul,England,1996,90
8816008,Lay theories of heroin addiction.,"This study examined the structure and determinants of lay people's implicit theories of heroin addiction. A questionnaire was derived from interviews with lay people about their beliefs and theories of heroin addiction and academic literature on the subject. One hundred and forty-four subjects completed the questionnaire, in which they rated 105 statements about the causes, correlates and cures of heroin addiction. The three parts of the questionnaire were individually factor analyzed and a clear, interpretable factor structure emerged for each. The factors seemed similar to explicit academic theories, but the exception was beliefs about cure, which did not show overall support for the most clinically used models. When the three factor analyses were combined into a single 'higher-order' factor analysis four factors emerged, labelled moralistic, psychosocial, sociocultural and drug treatment, which reflect more or less coherent views on the nature of heroin addiction. Subjects' political beliefs was the greatest (demographic and attitudinal) determinant of lay beliefs in these factors, with experience of addiction, addicts, drugs and age also highly correlated. Vote was the main determinant and best predictor of the four 'higher-order' structured lay theories: right-wing voters emphasizing moralistic and individualistic theory and left-wing voters supporting the psychological and societal ideas. Implications for policy and interventions to addicts of these lay theories are considered.",Social science & medicine (1982),1996 Jul,England,1996,90
8812822,The effects of the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health upon psychosocial determinants of diet and physical activity behavior.,"BACKGROUND: The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health is a multisite study of a school-based intervention to reduce or prevent the development of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this paper is to present the evaluation results of the 3-year intervention, focusing upon the psychosocial variables conceptualized as determinants of dietary and physical activity behaviors. METHODS: A total of 96 schools across four study sites (California, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Texas) were randomized to two treatment conditions: intervention and control. Pre- and postmeasurements on the health behavior questionnaire were collected from over 6,000 students. The data analyses utilized a nested design approach in which schools served as the primary unit of analysis. Repeated-measures multivariate analyses were applied to investigate effect sizes for each determinant and to explore theoretical relationships among the determinants over time. RESULTS: The findings indicated sustained significant effects in improved knowledge, intentions, self-efficacy, usual behavior, and perceived social reinforcement for healthy food choices (P < 0.0001 for these five variables) after 3 years. Intermittent effects were observed for perceived support and self-efficacy for physical activity. No gender by determinant interaction effects were observed, and girls reported significantly greater perceived reinforcement for healthy eating than did boys. CONCLUSION: The CATCH program was effective in changing the psychosocial variables likely to influence a reduction in behavior for cardiovascular disease. The study is significant in that it demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of a sustained multifaceted intervention in a preadolescent population. The results point to a need for greater understanding of adolescent developmental issues and the role of community environment (particularly social support) in creating effective curricula.",Preventive medicine,1996 Jul-Aug,United States,1996,90
8639009,"Alcohol-related problems in older persons. Determinants, consequences, and screening.","Demographic trends reveal the elderly to be the fastest growing segment of the population. Physicians can therefore anticipate encountering increasing numbers of older patients with alcohol-related problems. These problems include liver disease, dementia, confusion (masquerading as dementia), peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, late-onset seizure disorder, poor nutrition, incontinence, diarrhea, myopathy, inadequate self-care, macrocytosis, depression, fractures, and adverse reactions to medications. Despite the prevalence of alcohol use in older people, their risks and problems are often unrecognized. We reviewed published literature on the determinants and consequences of alcohol-related problems in persons aged 65 years and older and the usefulness of available screening measures. Thirteen of 25 eligible studies on determinants and consequences met quality criteria and were reviewed. Nine additional studies on screening tests were also evaluated. Determinants include history of alcohol use and abuse, social isolation, and reduced mobility; consequences consist of risks of hip fracture from falls, neoplasms, and psychiatric illness. Currently accessible screening tests focus on high levels of alcoholic beverage use and abuse and dependence. They are not useful in screening for hazardous consumption that may result from relatively low levels of alcohol use alone or in combination with medications, medical illness, or preexisting diminished physical, emotional, or social function. Research is needed on the consequences of lower levels of alcohol consumption on the physical and psychosocial health of older individuals and on methods for distinguishing alcohol-related from age-related problems. Existing screening tests should be expanded or new screening methods developed in anticipation of a growing public health problem.",Archives of internal medicine,1996 Jun 10,United States,1996,90
8935459,"A case-control study of childhood pedestrian injuries in Perth, Western Australia.","STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify the determinants of childhood pedestrian injuries, taking the child's exposure to the road environment into account. DESIGN: This was a case-control study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia between 1991 and 1993. Altogether 100 injured and 400 uninjured child pedestrians aged 1 to 14 years were studied. Aspects of the child's social and physical environments, measures of his or her behaviour, cognitive skills, and ""habitual"" exposure to the road environment, as well as his or her knowledge of road safety, were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: The likelihood of injury increased by 12% with each 10,000 vehicles per day increase in the volume of traffic (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05, 1.19) on roads most frequently crossed. In addition, the presence of visual obstacles on the verge of the child's street of residence increased the likelihood of injury by more than 2.6 times (OR 2.68, 95% CI = 1.42, 5.02). In contrast, the absence of footpaths was associated with a 52% reduction in the likelihood of injury compared with the presence of footpaths on the child's street of residence (OR 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27, 0.87). CONCLUSION: The amount of exposure to the road environment and the nature of the road environment to which the child pedestrian was exposed partly influenced the likelihood of injury in children from low socioeconomic areas, male children, and children aged 13 to 14 years. Until now, the excess incidence of childhood pedestrian injuries in these subgroups of the population had not been explained because the child's exposure per se had not been examined.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1996 Jun,England,1996,90
8816208,Perceived social norms as crucial determinants of mother's injury-preventive behaviour.,"In order to design injury-preventive programmes aimed at parents, an understanding of injury-preventive behaviour is essential. Questionnaires were obtained from 870 mothers of 3, 4 and 9-year-olds. The perceived social norm and other determinants for injury-preventive behaviour were analysed using three multivariate logistic regression models. The final logistic models classified 73.2-82.7% of respondents correctly. Perceived norms of relatives and friends were found to be the most important determinants of mothers' injury-preventive behaviour. Injury-preventive behaviour could neither be explained by mother's perception of injury risks, nor by the perceived norms of professionals within child health care and schools. This study indicates that in order to design injury-prevention programmes, an understanding of social norms is crucial.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1996 Jun,Norway,1996,90
8803732,"Psychosocial conventionality, health orientation, and contraceptive use in adolescence.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to determine psychosocial and behavioral factors that are associated with variation in contraceptive use among adolescents. Because regular use of contraception may be seen both as a conventional behavior and as a health-protective behavior, analyses assess the association between psychosocial conventionality and health orientation, on the one hand, and variation in contraceptive use, on the other. METHODS: Analyses are based on an urban sample of 971 white, African-American, and Hispanic male and female sexually active high school students. Study participants filled out a 38-page questionnaire that included a wide range of measures derived from Problem-Behavior Theory. RESULTS: Correlational analysis and hierarchical regression analysis indicate that more regular contraceptive use is associated with greater psychosocial conventionality and also with greater orientation toward health for both male and female adolescents. These relationships hold when the sociodemographic characteristics of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, grade in school, family composition, and pregnancy experience are controlled. The linkages of psychosocial conventionality and health orientation to contraceptive behavior are stronger for African-American than for white and Hispanic adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings establish a more comprehensive and more distal set of influences on regularity of contraceptive use. In its negative relationship to problem behavior and its positive linkage with health behavior, contraceptive behavior may be seen as part of a larger, organized system of behavior in this stage of development (i.e., a more conventional adolescent lifestyle).",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1996 Jun,United States,1996,90
8798937,Resuscitating the elderly: what do the patients want?,"OBJECTIVES: To study the resuscitation preferences, choice of decision-maker, views on the seeking of patients' wishes and determinants of these of elderly hospital in-patients. DESIGN: Questionnaire administered on admission and prior to discharge. SETTING: Two acute geriatric medicine units (Southampton and Poole). PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and fourteen consecutive consenting mentally competent patients admitted to hospital as emergencies. RESULTS: Resuscitation was wanted by 60%, particularly married and functionally independent patients and those who had not already considered it. Not wanted resuscitation was associated with lack of social contacts. Sixty-seven per cent welcomed enquiry about their preferences and 78% wanted participation in decision, 43% as sole decision-maker. Wishing to choose oneself was associated with not wanting resuscitation, prior knowledge of it, and lack of a spouse. Patients' opinions remained stable during their admission. CONCLUSIONS: Discussion of resuscitation is practical on hospital admission without causing distress and the views expressed endure through the period of hospitalisation. Elderly patients' attitudes depend partly on personal health and social circumstances.

8763808,Determinants of health-related quality of life after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery.,"Temporal lobectomy appears to be an effective treatment for medically intractable epilepsy. However, the influences of pre-operative health status and post-operative reductions in seizure activity on post-surgical health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are not well understood. We used the Epilepsy Surgery Inventory 55 (ESI-55) to evaluate changes between pre- and post-operative HRQOL in 47 temporal lobectomy patients. Patients exhibited significantly improved scores in five HRQOL domains: health perceptions; energy fatigue; social function; cognitive function and role limitations due to physical problems. Although significant improvements in HRQOL were observed, this was not the case for all patients. Specifically, patients with low or medium pre-operative HRQOL scores were found to have the greatest degree of improvement post-operatively. Patients with high pre-operative scores did not exhibit these same improvements, although they continued to report high scores. The results indicate that the ESI-55 is a satisfactory instrument to measure change in HRQOL but also emphasizes that the magnitude of change in post-operative HRQOL scores tends to vary according to baseline scores. The outcome of temporal lobectomy is not entirely based upon the procedure's ability to reduce the frequency of seizures, but is also influenced by level of HRQOL prior to surgery.","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",1996 Jun,Netherlands,1996,90

Overall, 1100 children and mothers from three subdivisions, two of low socio-economic status (LSES) and one of relatively high socio-economic status (HSES), provided stool and blood samples and were clinically examined. Plasmodium prevalence was higher in the two LSES subdivisions than in the HSES subdivision. Prevalence and intensity of Ascaris lumbricoides infection were low in the HSES subdivision and one of the two LSES subdivisions. In contrast, prevalence and intensity of Trichuris trichiura and of hookworms were similar in all subdivisions. Plasmodium and A. lumbricoides were the most frequently found single-species infections. The combination of A. lumbricoides and Plasmodium was the most frequent double-species infection and that of A. lumbricoides, Plasmodium and T. trichiura was the most frequent triple-species infection. Significant positive associations between parasite species were detected in the HSES subdivision, and in one of the two LSES subdivisions. Because the relationships were not consistently detected, it is hypothesized that the associations are determined by environmental conditions rather than synergy between the parasites in the host. The most commonly observed clinical conditions were abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, and low packed-cell volume (PCV). The occurrence of each was significantly lower in the HSES subdivision than in at least one of the two LSES subdivisions. Abdominal pain and low PCV were most common in individuals presenting with only a single clinical condition, and the combination of this symptom and sign was the most commonly observed pair of conditions. Abdominal pain, low PCV and diarrhoea was the most common combination in individuals with three clinical conditions. Logistic regression revealed that hookworm infection, T. trichiura infection, young age and residence in an LSES subdivision were determinants of diarrhoea. Trichuris trichiura infection, young age and living in an LSES subdivision were risk factors for abdominal pain. Plasmodium infection and young age were risk factors for fever.

8698957,Determinants of research follow-up participation in an alcohol treatment outcome trial.,"This study examined factors associated with research attrition in a long-term follow-up study (48 months). Researchers attempted to contact all randomized participants, not just those who completed treatment. The processes by which baseline characteristics, early treatment-research experiences, and short-term outcome affected subsequent participations were examined using logistic regression. The analyses deal primarily with refusal, the main reason for attrition. Baseline characteristics had small effects on likelihood of refusal; research engagement had some impact; but treatment participation had strong effect. Short-term outcome did not predict refusal. These findings, if generalizable, have implications for the conduct and reporting of outcome studies. By directly studying bias, rather than presuming its absence on skimpy evidence, researchers can achieve a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of outcome results.",Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,1996 Jun,United States,1996,90
8667167,Environmental and personal determinants of support perceptions: three generalizability studies.,"The extent to which perceived social support reflects characteristics of the environment, the personality of the perceiver, and their interaction is unknown. This article shows how the methods of generalizability theory can be used to address these questions. When participants rate the same targets on the targets' supportiveness, generalizability theory provides methods for determining the extent to which support judgments are determined by effects due to targets (supporters), perceivers, and their interaction. In 3 studies, each source of variance made significant contributions to support judgments, with the Perceivers x Supporters interaction, characteristics of supporters, and biases of perceivers making the largest contributions, respectively. The implications for theoretical models of perceived support are discussed.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1996 Jun,United States,1996,90
8654535,"Environment, social interaction, and physical activity as determinants of functional outcome after cerebral infarction in the rat.","Rats housed in an enriched environment allowing both social interaction and physical activity improve more than rats housed in standard laboratory cages after focal brain ischemia. To determine the relative importance of social and physical activity, rats that sustained ligation of the middle cerebral artery were kept in an enriched environment with opportunities for various activities (group A), housed together in the same size of cage as group A but with no activity-stimulating equipment (group B), or housed in individual cages with a running wheel (group C). There was no significant difference in infarct size between the groups. Limb placement, climbing, balance on an inclined plane, and ability to traverse a beam and a rotating pole were repeatedly tested 2-13 weeks after the operation. During the entire postoperative period, group A performed significantly better than group C in all tests and better than group B on the rotating pole. With time they also performed significantly better than group B in limb placement, climbing, and on the inclined plane. Group B performed significantly better than group C on the inclined plane and in climbing at all times, and by 13 weeks also in the limb placement test and on the beam. Thus, social interaction was superior to wheel-running but an enriched environment allowing free physical activity combined with social interaction resulted in the best performance.",Experimental neurology,1996 Jun,United States,1996,90
8634561,Role of patients' view of their illness in predicting return to work and functioning after myocardial infarction: longitudinal study.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patients' initial perceptions of their myocardial infarction predict subsequent attendance at a cardiac rehabilitation course, return to work, disability, and sexual dysfunction. DESIGN: Patients' perceptions of their illness were measured at admission with their first myocardial infarction and at follow up three and six months later. SETTING: Two large teaching hospitals in Auckland, New Zealand. SUBJECTS: 143 consecutive patients aged under 65 with their first myocardial infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attendance at rehabilitation course; time before returning to work; measures of disability with sickness impact profile questionnaire for sleep and rest, social interaction, recreational activity, and home management; and sexual dysfunction. RESULTS: Attendance at the rehabilitation course was significantly related to a stronger belief during admission that the illness could be cured or controlled (t = 2.08, P = 0.04). Return to work within six weeks was significantly predicted by the perception that the illness would last a short time (t = 2.52, P = 0.01) and have less grave consequences for the patient (t = 2.87, P = 0.005). Patients' belief that their heart disease would have serious consequences was significantly related to later disability in work around the house, recreational activities, and social interaction. A strong illness identity was significantly related to greater sexual dysfunction at both three and six months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' initial perceptions of illness are important determinants of different aspects of recovery after myocardial infarction. Specific illness perceptions need to be identified at an early stage as a basis for optimising outcomes from rehabilitation programmes.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 May 11,England,1996,90
10158455,Falling diarrhoea mortality in Northeastern Brazil: did ORT play a role?,"The impact of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) on the recent decline in diarrhoea mortality in the northeast of Brazil was studied. Proportionate infant mortality fell from 32% in 1980 to 17% in 1989 and infant deaths attributed to diarrhoea dropped from 41% to 25%, resulting in an overall reduction of 57%. Similar decreases were observed for children aged 1-4 years. Diarrhoea admissions also fell from 57% of infant hospitalizations in 1980 to 30% in 1990. None of the other major causes of death or admissions showed such decline. ORT was introduced in the early 1980s, being used in 35% of all episodes in 1991 and in 62% of those regarded as severe by the mother. Other changes included a worsening of socioeconomic conditions and increases in water supply, vaccine coverage, breastfeeding duration and nutritional status. A simulation model estimated that changes in factors other than ORT would lead to a 21% reduction in infant diarrhoea mortality, or about one-third of the actual decline. Finally, an ecological analysis showed that ORT use rates were inversely correlated to infant diarrhoea mortality (r=-0.61; p=0.04). Despite the shortcomings of the available data, these findings suggest an important impact of ORT on diarrhoea mortality.",Health policy and planning,1996 Jun,England,1996,90
8621244,Risks of testicular cancer and cryptorchidism in relation to socio-economic status and related factors: case-control studies in Denmark.,"To explore risk factors for testicular cancer and cryptorchidism, 2 parallel case-control studies were conducted in Denmark. The testicular-cancer study was population-based and included 514 cases and 720 controls. The cryptorchidism study included 387 cases and 416 controls and was based on 2 hospital series of men treated for cryptorchidism and a control group sampled among residents in the Copenhagen area. The 2037 men were interviewed by telephone, and self-administered questionnaires were sent to their mothers. A strong association was seen between low social class and cryptorchidism, with sons of unskilled workers having a 3-fold higher risk of cryptorchidism than sons of self-employed men. Testicular cancer was only moderately associated with high-social-class indicators, and only with such indicators pertaining to the mother. Both testicular cancer and cryptorchidism tended to occur more frequently in first-born men and in sons of older women but these associations were not statistically significant. Late puberty was associated with reduced risk of testicular cancer. The effect of age at puberty may be due both to advanced age at diagnosis and to the existence of common determinants of age at puberty and testicular cancer. Men who had been treated for cryptorchidism entered puberty later than other men, possibly because of impaired hormonal function of the testes. There was no indication of increased risk of testicular cancer or cryptorchidism in sons of mothers who smoked around the time of conception or during the pregnancy.",International journal of cancer,1996 May 3,United States,1996,90
21544449,Predictors of the interval between onset of symptoms and first medical visit in patients with digestive tract cancer.,"Lack of effective population screening programmes for digestive tract cancer makes a prompt diagnosis of symptomatic patients the primary option for early detection. The objective of the study was to analyze the characteristics and determinants of the interval between the first medical symptom and the first medical visit (ISV) in a sample of symptomatic patients of mid-low socioeconomic level admitted to hospital for a digestive tract cancer. During two years, 183 patients were personally interviewed with a structured questionnaire designed to elicit initial symptoms of digestive cancer. Fifty-seven percent consulted a physician during the first month after onset of symptoms, and over two-thirds did so within the first 2 months, but it took more than 3 months for 22.4% of the patients. In univariate analyses, the ISV was longer among patients illiterate, unemployed and in the lower social classes. The interval was also significantly longer when the physician-interviewer judged that the patient did not correctly identify the first symptom (p<0.05). In multivariate analyses, the chance of a longer ISV was 2.8 times higher in men; 16 times higher in unemployed patients; 9 times higher in patients with a first symptom of the lower digestive tract; and it increased 8-fold in subjects who attributed no importance to the first manifestation (all p<0.05). In spite of virtually universal health coverage, social factors seemed to act as barriers to seeking medical help in a subgroup of patients. Their procrastination was also related to the nature of the initial symptoms. Achieving an early clinical detection of digestive cancers may be difficult in some segments of the population, and may require substantial improvements in access to and the efficiency of the health system.",International journal of oncology,1996 May,Greece,1996,90
15374176,Lifestyle determinants for social activity levels among the Japanese elderly.,"We conducted a self-administered questionnaire survey to a total of 5239 elderly persons in four areas in Japan in 1993, which inquired about past lifestyles and present social activities. Based on the survey data, we first developed social activity measures, and then examined associations of the present total social activity measure with past lifestyles and physical conditions. The lifestyles significantly associated with high social activity after 65 years of age were 'high educational attainment'; having been 'healthy', 'plump', 'physically active' and 'having had hobbies' at about 50 years of age; and having 'frequent intake of many kinds of foods' during 30-50 years of age. Intake during 30-50 years of age of Japanese-style foods (rice, soybean paste soup, bean curd, pickles), noodles, beans, plant roots and potatoes was not significantly linked with the social activity levels at old age in either males or females. The same was true for smoking and drinking habits at about 50 years of age. Our findings essentially suggest the importance of a positive attitude at middle age to maintain and promote health status and improve lifestyles in order to attain high social activity at old age.",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,1996 May-Jun,Netherlands,1996,90

Cohabitation started as an alternative way of living, developed into a temporary phase before marriage, and finally became a strategy for moving into a union gradually.... This article addresses the question whether or not individual past and current life-course experiences become increasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into marriage across female birth cohorts, and yet become decreasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into cohabitation across female birth cohorts. This question is examined using a non-proportional hazard model. Empirical evidence supports this hypothesis strongly, in that both past determinants such as family size or religion and current life-course determinants such as work or education change in their impact on cohabitation and marriage across birth cohorts.""",European sociological review,1996 May,England,1996,90

I propose a mobile-fixed factor distinction as a framework in which to think about the differential impact of immigration on various labor market groups. Skilled workers are treated as a fixed factor of production since the strong reliance on skill certification in Germany inhibits mobility and shelters from competition. Unskilled workers, in contrast, receive competitive wages. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel for 1984-1989 I estimate panel wage regressions for groups of workers separated by skill certification. I find that university graduates' wages increase, and the wages of workers without postsecondary degree decrease, as the industry share of unskilled workers increases. The effect for apprentices is ambiguous.""",Journal of population economics,1996 May,Germany,1996,90

This study uses longitudinal data on 351 California white women aged 27-30 in 1990-1991 to identify characteristics in childhood and adolescence that predict who will have a nonmarital first pregnancy and, of those who do, which women will seek an abortion. Bivariate analyses reveal that psychosocial characteristics indicating a strong sense of autonomy, such as feeling it is important not to be tied down and engaging in socially undesirable behavior, are significantly associated with the likelihood of having a nonmarital first pregnancy (odds ratios of 1.7 and 1.5, respectively), but family characteristics are not. However, among women who have a first pregnancy out of wedlock, the odds of having an abortion are mostly influenced by family rather than psychological characteristics, particularly having been a good student and having a well-educated mother (2.0 and 1.7).",Family planning perspectives,1996 May-Jun,United States,1996,90

Data from an inner-city street survey compared women who were not contemplating condom use, women who were attempting to use condoms or had used them consistently for short periods of time, and those who had achieved long-term consistent use. Women's relationship with their main partner appears to be an important factor in understanding their use of condoms both with main partners and with other partners. For condom use with the main partner, factors such as emotional closeness and partner support were significant predictors of the likelihood that women would be attempting to use condoms rather than not contemplating use. Cohabitation and the belief that condom use builds trust were significant predictors of long-term consistent condom use. Having a regular or main partner was strongly associated with intentions to use condoms with other partners. Women who wanted to become pregnant were much less likely to intend to use condoms with their main partner, and women using oral contraceptives were less likely to be long-term consistent condom users.",Family planning perspectives,1996 May-Jun,United States,1996,90
8794456,Women for women's health: Uganda.,"The primary health care model targets social, political, and economic environments as key determinants of health for populations, as well as for individuals. If nursing in Uganda is to make a difference in health care outcomes and in the health of all Ugandans, nurses must look broadly at situations and be educated to practice primary health care nursing. After 14 years of civil war, Uganda is finally experiencing a period of reconstruction and rehabilitation: the whole infrastructure is undergoing a face-lift. Ugandan nurses recognize that their educational preparation has stagnated for many years and that it was not only the political unrest in their country that put them behind professionally. They realize that, given the new directions set by the government, they must become prepared to implement primary health care. They are demanding a university education so they may take their place alongside other health care providers prepared at the university level. Some of the most convincing arguments for a university program for nurses came from doctors at the university who spoke about the need to raise the standards of nursing practice, the quality of teachers, and the morale of practitioners. One nurse said: ""If we lose hope for a BScN program, I think all the nurses will quit and we won't have any new students going into the profession."" This program is designed to improve the health and well-being of all Ugandans, especially the most vulnerable groups of women and children in rural areas, through strengthening and expanding health services by targeting the educational preparation of nurses. Health planners in Uganda envision the professional nurse as key to the implementation of the national health policy of primary health care. University-educated nurses should be able to assess problems, make clinically sound decisions, and act appropriately within the scope of nursing practice. They should be able to interact and consult collegially with other health care professionals. Placed in rural community sites, nurses should function independently as community leaders, health education facilitators, primary health care practitioners, and educators for nursing students. Such intervention in community health care by BScN nurses should improve health care utilization and decrease mortality and morbidity from preventable causes. BScN nurses should make an impact on health care policy, nursing education, and primary health care. The evaluation of this project needs to be as comprehensive as its development and implementation. It will focus on health outcomes, particularly for women and children in rural areas of Uganda. Measurement of the effects of the process of nursing education (the BScN curriculum) in terms of output (nurses educated and placed in rural practice, nursing education, or government policy posts), outcomes (change in health status of rural communities), and broader impacts (changes in the status of women and in government policy toward women, nurses, or health at the local, regional, and national levels) is planned. An element of sustainability is present, as an operations research structure will be left in place at the community level. Timing, as the saying goes, is everything, and this project has had good timing. Our belief in the efforts and the goals of the project also gave us the strength to get support from various funding agencies for ""small"" things. For example, we got support from churches in the United States for building schools in Uganda; we persisted with the women's income-generating project when other support was pulled; we got books for the library in Uganda and got clothes, books, and furnishings for the students who came to this country. The motivation for project personnel has been altruism.

This study examined the impact of child maltreatment and age on perceptions of competence, and the relations among perceived competence, motivation, and school functioning. The sample included 76 school children living in poverty, approximately two-thirds of whom had been victims of child maltreatment. Results indicated that both maltreated and nonmaltreated children exhibited maladaptive motivational orientations toward scholastic tasks and poor academic performance, supporting the idea that threats to scholastic functioning reside as much within the ecology of poverty as in that of maltreatment. Over and above the general effects of poverty, maltreatment was found to disrupt the psychological processes accounting for children's scholastic performance. Results revealed that younger maltreated children (6- and 7-year-olds) reported more inflated self-perceptions of competence and social acceptance than nonmaltreated children. In contrast, older maltreated children (8- through 11-year-olds) reported lower perceived social acceptance than nonmaltreated children. Among older nonmaltreated children, perceived competence was positively related to teacher's ratings of their effort, intrinsic motivation, and grades. For older maltreated children, these relations among self-perceptions and school functioning were in the opposite direction from those of nonmaltreated children, suggesting that the determinants of academic engagement are different for maltreated and nonmaltreated children.",Child abuse & neglect,1996 May,England,1996,90

In addition, there was no bile reflux in the fragment-free group, ERCP studies showed no difference between both groups in the diameter of the cystic duct or the maximum diameter of the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct. The disappearance rate of stones was significantly higher in patients with type I a or I b gallstones according to Tsuchiya's classification when compared with patients who had non-I a, I b stones (p < 0.01) or stones showing low CT density values.

8620362,Health and social precursors of later life retirement-community migration.,"This study uses the developmental migration paradigm developed by Litwak and Longino (1987) as a framework to investigate the health and social determinants of late-life elderly mobility to retirement communities. Data from four waves of the Longitudinal Study of Aging are used to predict the likelihood of moving from the general community to two types of retirement communities--those with group meals and those without group meals. Multinomial logistic regression reveals that the likelihood of migrating to both types of retirement communities increases as disability advances to moderate levels, but declines as disability becomes severe. Migration to retirement communities is also more likely among elderly persons who live alone and among those whose children do not live nearby. The results suggest that retirement community migration in middle and late old age is motivated not only by social and amenity considerations, but also by the need for assisted living arising from physical frailty. Implications for developmental migration theory and long-term care policy are discussed.","The journals of gerontology.

8616346,Socioeconomic determinants of rates of consultation in general practice based on fourth national morbidity survey of general practices.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the socioeconomic determinants of consultation rates in general practice. DESIGN: Analysis of data from the fourth national morbidity survey of general practices (MSGP4) including sociodemographic details of individual patients and small area statistics from the 1991 census. Multilevel modelling techniques were used to take account of both individual patient data and small area statistics to relate socioeconomic and health status factors directly to a measure of general practitioner workload. RESULTS: Higher rates of consultations were found in patients who were classified as permanently sick, unemployed (especially those who became unemployed during the study year), living in rented accommodation, from the Indian subcontinent, living with a spouse or partner (women only), children living with two parents (girls only), and living in urban areas, especially those living relatively near the practice. When characteristics of individual patients are known and controlled for the role of ""indices of deprivation"" is considerably reduced. The effect of individual sociodemographic characteristics were shown to vary between different areas. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic and socioeconomic factors can act as powerful predictors of consultation patterns. Though it will always be necessary to retain some local planning discretion, the sets of coefficients estimated for individual level factors, area level characteristics, and for practice groupings may be sufficient to provide an indicative level of demand for general medical services. Although the problems in using socioeconomic data from individual patients would be substantial, these results are relevant to the development of a resource allocation formula for general practice.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 Apr 20,England,1996,90
8606563,Childhood social circumstances and psychosocial and behavioural factors as determinants of plasma fibrinogen.,"BACKGROUND: High plasma fibrinogen concentration is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. We have investigated associations between plasma fibrinogen and factors operating in childhood and in adulthood, including the psychosocial characteristics. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of Civil Servants in London, UK, 2095 men and 1202 women aged 45-55 years provided blood samples for fibrinogen measurement at the time of the Whitehall II study baseline. The participants completed a questionnaire on demographic characteristics, education, employment grade, parents' occupation, health behaviours, and work characteristics. FINDINGS: Measures of childhood environment (adult height, father's social class, and participant's education) were inversely associated with adult plasma fibrinogen concentration in both sexes. Lower socioeconomic status (as shown by employment grade) was associated with higher fibrinogen concentrations, with differences from top to bottom grade of 0.22 g/L (95% Cl 0.13-0.31) in men and 0.37 g/L (0.18-0.56) in women (p<0.0001, both sexes). This association was not accounted for by measures of childhood circumstances. Control over work, assessed by personnel managers, was inversely related to fibrinogen in both sexes, and a similar relation was seen for self-rated control over work among men but not women. Men in the bottom third of the distribution for self-rated and externally assessed control over work had higher fibrinogen concentrations than those in the top third for both measures (difference 0.16 g//L [0.07-0.26]; p<0.001.) There was no difference between these extremes among women (0.02 g/L [0.16 to 0.19]). Current smokers had higher fibrinogen concentrations than non-smokers, and moderate alcohol consumers had lower concentrations than those who drank occasionally or never. INTERPRETATION: Although our study was cross-sectional, it provides evidence that adult fibrinogen concentration is determined by factors operating throughout life. Fibrinogen may be a marker of the biological pathways that mediate the inverse socioeconomic gradient in coronary disease.","Lancet (London, England)",1996 Apr 13,England,1996,90

9077016,[Hierarchical model: a proposal for a model to be applied in the investigation of risk factors for severe diarrhea].,"In epidemiological investigations of infant diseases, data are usually collected on a large set of variables. The associations between presumptive risk factors and the outcome is commonly evaluated through statistical modeling, but the model-building strategies are seldom described. In the project, data collected in a case-control study of risk factors for dehydrating diarrhea in infants have been used to present a hierarchized approach to the assessment of risk factors. The variables were grouped into a hierarchy of categories, ranging from distal determinants to proximate ones. These categories included, in this order, socioeconomic, environmental, reproductive maternal, nutritional and demographic sets. According to the univariate analyses all variables were associated with the outcome. As the purpose was to identify a parsimonious model to explain the data, in each set the confounders were selected through backward elimination, according to an alpha level of 0.10. The risk factors were evaluated through logistic regression after adjustment for confounders in the same set or in hierarchically superior sets. This approach allows researchers to quantify the contribution of each level of adjustment, to understand the model-building strategy as well as interpret the independent associations. The goodness-of-fit assessed at each set showed significant improvements in the model. The gamma coefficient of association was employed to quantify the proportion of cases and controls correctly identified by comparing the observed value with that predicted by the variables in the model. The final model resulted in a gamma of 0.74. The children's ages did not improve the prediction of cases and controls, but they have been kept in the model as they affect some exposures such as breastfeeding.",Revista de saude publica,1996 Apr,Brazil,1996,90
8857378,Associations between drug use and behavioral repertoire in urban youths.,"Converging with psycho-social research findings, animal and human laboratory studies indicate that behavioral alternatives are important determinants of drug-taking. To investigate associations between how early adolescents spend their time, i.e. their behavioral repertoire and drug use (use of marijuana, crack/cocaine or inhalants), we analyzed data from an epidemiological sample of 1516 urban middle-school students who had completed private interviews in spring 1993. The interview included a 36-item questionnaire to assess how frequently the youth engaged in different activities; history of drug-taking was assessed separately. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate associations between drug use and each of seven behavioral domains as well as sex, age and racial-ethnic status. Youths spending a great deal of time working for pay and assuming other adult-like roles were more likely to have initiated drug use (estimated odds ratio, OR = 3.49; p = 0.002). Those who spent much time in religious activities were less likely (OR = 0.2, p <0.001). An exploratory search for interactions disclosed other associations that merit attention in future research. These results corroborate evidence on the potential etiological significance of behavioral repertoire in relation to risk of drug use.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1996 Apr,England,1996,90

8754600,Determinants of smoking behaviour in random samples of Greenlandic and Danish women 20-39 years of age.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of smoking among young women is of particular concern in most countries as it does not decline as in men. We studied smoking behaviour in Greenlandic and Danish women over a 2 year period to provide information on the social and behavioural determinants of smoking in women. METHODS: In 1986, samples of 800 women aged 20-39 years were drawn at random from Nuuk/Godthab (Greenland) and Nykobing Falster (Denmark). A total of 586 and 661 women were interviewed in Greenland and Denmark, respectively. In 1988, new random samples of 150 women were drawn from the same areas. Totally, 129 Greenlandic and 126 Danish women were included in this study. In 1987, a sample of 732 women aged 20-49 years from Copenhagen was randomly drawn from the computerized Central Population Register. Of these, 623 women completed a questionnaire. RESULTS: Smoking behaviour was almost the same among women in Nykobing Falster and Copenhagen (54% smoked) while a significantly higher percentage of smokers was observed among women in Greenland (88% smoked). Heavy smoking was most prevalent among Danish women and associated with early debut of smoking. Among Danish women, smoking was associated with use of oral contraceptives, early age at first intercourse, and multiple sexual partners. In Greenland, smoking was associated with early sexual debut and multiple sexual partners. In an extended analysis on a subgroup of Danish women, smoking was also associated with low education and infrequent intake of vegetables. The study showed no development in smoking behaviour in any age group over the two year period between the two studies, neither in Nykobing Falster nor in Nuuk. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of moderate smoking among women in Greenland suggests that broad anti-smoking initiatives are urgently needed. The high prevalence of heavy smoking and a social gradient among Danish women may indicate that a strategy focusing on restrictions of smoking may be more relevant than merely continuing a pure anti-smoking information strategy.",Arctic medical research,1996 Apr,Finland,1996,90
8737429,Antibiotic use in a periurban community in Mexico: a household and drugstore survey.,"In developing countries, antibiotics are the most common drugs sold, and some data suggest that they are frequently misused. In order to describe the pattern of antibiotic use in a periurban community in Mexico City, 1659 randomly-selected households were visited and an interview with the housewife was carried out. Six local drugstores also were selected at random. A social worker made six visits to each pharmacy, observed the events during the purchase of the drug and applied a structured questionnaire to the customer immediately after the transaction. Of 8279 individuals, 425 (5%) said that they had used at least one antimicrobial in the preceding 2 weeks and antibiotics were the majority (29%) of the drug sales. The main perceived reasons for drug use were acute respiratory tract ailments and gastroenteritis. Interviewees reported that antibiotic therapy was given in 27% of respiratory diseases and in 37% of all diarrheal episodes. The drugs most commonly reported were: penicillins, erythromycin, metronidazole, neomycin, cotrimoxazole and tetracyclines. While self-medication and drug purchases without medical prescription were common, the majority of antibiotics were prescribed by a physician. Approximately two thirds of individuals using an antibiotic said they had used it for less than 5 days and 72% of the purchases were for insufficient quantities of drugs. Our data suggest that antibiotics are frequently misused and they support the need to assess the determinants of self-medication, health-seeking behavior and physician prescribing practices. The need for effective educational programs to improve prescribers' decisions is stressed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1996 Apr,England,1996,90

Applying an organizing framework from the larger literature on service utilization, a logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the interaction among factors influencing treatment. The results identified unemployment status and lower educational level as barriers to alcohol treatment, but the impact of these factors differed depending on whether the respondent had previous experience with alcohol treatment. The major findings of this study are discussed in terms of consumer satisfaction, minimizing barriers to alcohol treatment services, and the need to examine individual determinants of alcohol treatment within the larger context of organizational and sociopolitical factors.","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",1996 Apr,England,1996,90
8693173,[Objective and subjective determinants in the benefits of home help services for the elderly].,"In this paper, we analyze the factors related to the allocation of home help services, a main component for maintaining elderly at home. The study is based on a random sample of 889 people aged 65 and over, living at home in the areas of Lunel and Pezenas (Herault, France). The factors taken into account were disabilities, income, social support, and subjective health assessed through the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). A logistic model allowed to bring out the factors related to the delivery of home help services. Positive statistical correlations were found for age (OR = 1.6 per 10-year age groups), disabilities for instrumental activities of daily living (OR = 3.8) and for the notion of mobility assessed through the NHP (OR = 3.3); negative statistical correlations were found for the level of income (OR = 0.3), as well as for disabilities for activities of daily living (physical dependency) (OR = 0.5). These results show that the main criterion for allocating home help services is not severe disability and that subjective aspects play an important part. Accordingly, current practices should be modified to obtain a better targeting of home help services for disabled elderly at home.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1996 Apr,France,1996,90
8683949,Gender differences in physical activity and determinants of physical activity in rural fifth grade children.,"This study determined if gender differences in physical activity could be accounted for by differences in selected social-cognitive determinants of activity behavior. Some 334 fifth grade, predominantly African-American students provided information regarding after-school physical activity and the hypothesized determinants of activity behavior. Boys reported significantly greater participation in vigorous ( > or = 6 METs) and in moderate to vigorous ( > or = 4 METs). Relative to girls, boys demonstrated higher levels of physical fitness, greater self-efficacy in overcoming barriers to physical activity, greater amounts of television watching, and higher levels of participation in community sports and physical activity organizations. When mean physical activity scores for girls and boys were adjusted for the effects of these determinant variables, the significant gender difference in physical activity remained. However, adjustment for self-efficacy in overcoming barriers and community sports reduced the gender gap by 5% and 7%, respectively. In contrast, adjustment for television watching increased the gender gap by about 8%. Results indicated perceived confidence in overcoming barriers to physical activity and participation in community physical activity programs are factors related to the gender difference in physical activity.",The Journal of school health,1996 Apr,United States,1996,90
8636902,Dispositional and situational determinants of repression.,This research project posits a model of repression that incorporates both repressive personality and repressive social behavior. The 1st parameter of the model specifies the motivation for repressors' distancing of themselves from emotional events. Experiment 1 demonstrates that repressors are hypersensitive--in their cognitive attention--to both negative and positive emotional events. The 2nd parameter of the model specifies the conditions under which repressors distance themselves from emotional events. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate that repressors psychologically distance themselves when the situation threatens their self-evaluation and provides opportunity for them to attend to and process self-relevant and non-self-relevant information. This 2-factor model extends the current conceptualization of repression in that it identifies motivation (dispositional emotional sensitivity) and context (situational threats to self-evaluation and distraction availability) for repressors' distancing of themselves from negative and positive emotional events.,Journal of personality and social psychology,1996 Apr,United States,1996,90
8625728,Trouble in the second year: three questions about family interaction.,"3 questions regarding family interaction in the second year of life are addressed in this report on 69 families rearing firstborn sons. Question 1 concerns the identification, via cluster analysis, of families having difficulty managing their child, using codings of narrative records of family interaction when children were 15 and 21 months of age. Parents in families identified as ""troubled"" at each age tried to control their toddlers most often, were least likely to rely upon control-plus-guidance management strategies, had children who defied them most frequently, and experienced the greatest escalation of negative affect in these control encounters. Families identified as ""troubled"" at both 15 and 21 months had children who received the highest ""externalizing"" problem scores at 18 months and mothers who experienced the most daily hassles during the second year. Question 2 concerns the antecedents of ""trouble in the second year."" Discriminant function analyses indicated that membership in the groups of families that appeared troubled at both ages of measurement (n = 15), at only one age (n = 28), or never (n = 26) could be reliably predicted (hit rate = 71%) using a set of 9 measurements of parent personality, child emotionality/temperament, marital quality, work-family relations, and social support, suggested by Belsky's model of the determinants of parenting, and social class. Question 3 concerns the proposition that extensive nonmaternal care in the first year is a risk factor for troubled family functioning in the second year. As hypothesized, prediction analysis showed that families at moderate and high contextual risk (based on 10 antecedent variables pertaining to Question 2), were significantly more likely to experience trouble in the second year when children experienced 20 or more hours per week of nonmaternal care in their first year, and these results could not be attributed to ""selection effects.""",Child development,1996 Apr,United States,1996,90

Using data from a retrospective survey conducted in 1992 among women of reproductive age, the paper examines fertility trends and determinants during the twentieth century. The analysis shows that the absence of a government-supported birth control programme and the strong pro-natalist policies of the Soviet authorities during most of the century did not affect either the onset, nor the progress of the fertility transition. The results indicate, however, that the social development programmes undertaken by the Soviet government did play a very active part in the transition as shown by the impact of education on reproductive behaviour, as well as on the very specific contraceptive mix adopted by the population after the mid-1970s.",Population studies,1996 Mar,England,1996,90

DESIGN: A descriptive prospective epidemiological study of a defined resident childhood population (< 16 years of age) for a one year period, 1990. SETTING: Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Child population estimate for 1990 was 54,400. SUBJECTS: Resident children who died, were admitted to local hospitals, or attended local accident and emergency departments. OUTCOME MEASURES: Using recognised severity scoring systems (for example the injury severity score, trauma score) injuries were classified as severe, moderate, or mild. RESULTS: There were six deaths, 904 admissions, and 11,682 accident and emergency department attendances. All deaths, 25% of admissions, and 1% of accident and emergency attenders were classified as severe. The underlying determinants of severe injuries are different than those for all other injuries (for example age, social class). A comparison with a local survey in 1986 showed a 26% rise in hospital admissions, but no significant rise in the frequency of severe or moderately injured children. Comparisons with other international data showed higher rates of injury admissions and attendances for England, but no significant differences in the frequency of severe injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Objective severity scoring enhances the case definition of unintentional injuries in childhood by allowing for the identification, and, therefore, the more reliable ascertainment of severely injured children. This more completely ascertained set of population cases increases the accuracy of comparisons of injury frequency over time and by place, and, in addition, enhances our basic understanding about the epidemiological characteristics of childhood unintentional injury.",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,1996 Mar,England,1996,90

The study also brought out that malariogenic potential of the country is increasing, and new malaria paradigms have been established requiring new approaches for its control. Unless this trend is checked losses due to malaria will increase in the coming decades. Effective malaria control requires immediate remedial measures to prevent environmental degradation conductive to vector proliferation; and renewed attack on malaria based on local epidemiological, entomological and social determinants. The first requirement for such an action is a reliable data base, both on the malariometric indices and the causative factors. Research therefore should be intensified to fill the gaps, generate new knowledge, disseminate malaria information as widely as possible and provide training for success in malaria control by the implementation of the global malaria control strategy.",The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,1996 Mar,Thailand,1996,90
8860285,Determinants of intention to quit smoking among Dutch employees: the influence of the social environment.,"BACKGROUND: This study examines the influence of the social environment in worksites on employees' intention to quit smoking by applying the attitude-social influence-efficacy model. METHODS: Regression analyses were conducted with 509 smoking employees from eight Dutch worksites. Variables of interest were attitudes toward smoking, perceived social pressure to quit, perceived smoking behavior of others, self-efficacy, demographics, smoking history variables, company type, and smoking tolerance. RESULTS: Attitude, social pressure from people out-side the worksetting (partner, children), and self-efficacy explained 23% of the variance for intention. Past behavior increased the adjusted R2 from 0.23 to 0.29. Social influences in the worksite were unrelated to employees' intention to quit smoking. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that, in Dutch work-sites, social influences stemming from people at work have less influence on employees' intention to quit smoking than other important people outside the work situation. Implications for smoking control strategies in worksites are briefly discussed.",Preventive medicine,1996 Mar-Apr,United States,1996,90

The illegally induced unsafe abortions were common among both rural and urban dwellers, and women from almost all social and economic strata were involved. However, they were more common among the youth (< 25 year olds), school girls, those with high formal education, in formal employment, and not currently married. Majority (90.4%), of the induced group said their pregnancies were unwanted, as compared to only 29.1% of the non-induced (p < 0.05). The main determining factor for termination of pregnancy amongst these women appeared to be the fact that it was unwanted and/or unplanned, either because of inappropriate timing, the type of man responsible, the relationship itself and the social and economic implications thereof. This is contributed to by poor contraceptive use inspite of very good awareness, and/or desire to use. There is urgent need to integrate abortion care and related services into the overall reproductive health care and as a part of the broader safe motherhood initiative in Kenya. In addition it is necessary to revise the legal provisions on abortion so as to make them more relevant. Appropriate management of adolescent fertility, should be undertaken with the aim of reducing the extent of illegally induced unsafe abortion with attendant sequealae.",East African medical journal,1996 Mar,Kenya,1996,90

Study 1 analyses showed that the SRGS has acceptable internal and test-retest reliability and that scores are not influenced by social desirability. Study 2 analyses showed that college students' SRGS responses were significantly related to those provided by friends and relatives on their behalf. Study 3 analyses tested the determinants of stress-related growth longitudinally. Significant predictors of the SRGS were (a) intrinsic religiousness; (b) social support satisfaction; (c) stressfulness of the negative event; (d) positive reinterpretation and acceptance coping; and (e) number of recent positive life events. The SRGS was also positively related to residual change in optimism, positive affectivity, number of socially supportive others, and social support satisfaction, lending further support to the validity of this new scale.

DESIGN: A single interview consisting of the Massara and Stunkard body image cards (1979) and questionnaires on sociocultural background, anthropometry, and dieting history were administered to volunteers from the staff of a hospital. SUBJECTS: The sample was a convenience sample of 186 women representing a range of staff positions recruited from Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, NY; 174 completed the study. Data on 150 women are presented in this article. RESULTS: Height and weight-for-height were stronger predictors of accuracy of perceived body size than ethnicity. Tall, slight women were more likely to overestimate and short, heavy women were more likely to underestimate actual body size. Ethnicity had an interactive effect with height as taller European Americans were more likely to perceive their body size as larger than actual compared with Afro-Caribbeans and African Americans. Women with a history of dieting were more likely to overestimate their size and to view it as different from what is perceived as attractive to others. APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, we conclude that body size is a stronger predictor of accuracy of perceived body size than ethnicity; and dieters overestimate their body size and believe it to be heavier than their social group would prefer.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1996 Mar,United States,1996,90
8601115,East-West mortality divide and its potential explanations: proposed research agenda.,"There is a sharp divide in mortality between eastern and western Europe, which has largely developed over the past three decades and is caused mainly by chronic diseases in adulthood. The difference in life expectancy at birth between the best and worst European countries in this respect is more than 10 years for both sexes. The reasons for these differences in mortality are not clear and data currently available permit only speculation. The contributions of medical care and pollution are likely to be modest; health behaviour, diet, and alcohol consumption seem to be more important; smoking seems to have the largest impact. There is also evidence that psychosocial factors are less favourable in eastern Europe. Available data show socioeconomic gradients in all cause mortality within eastern European countries similar to those in the West. Determinants of the mortality gap between eastern and western Europe are probably related to the contrast in their social environments and may be similar to those underlying the social gradients in mortality within countries.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 Feb 17,England,1996,90

This article argues that voluntarism needs to be balanced by the notion of collectivism which takes full account of the contribution made by sociopolitical determinants of health. The central concepts of voluntarism and health education are defined and then the article proceeds to examine the extent to which voluntarism has underpinned various models of health education which can be used to support nursing practice. A critique of the concept of voluntarism, as used in health education, is provided. It is argued that models of health education which are polarized towards either voluntarism or collectivism are based on an inadequate understanding of human social action and that this polarization undermines the usefulness of these models of health education.",British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing),1996 Feb 8-21,England,1996,90
10155880,Reproductive health and AIDS prevention in sub-Saharan Africa: the case for increased male participation.,"Reproduction is a dual commitment, but so often in much of the world, it is seen as wholly the woman's responsibility. She bears the burden not only of pregnancy and childbirth but also the threats from excessive child bearing, some responsibility for contraception, infertility investigation and often undiagnosed sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including AIDS. Failure to target men in reproductive health interventions has weakened the impact of reproductive health care programmes. The paper proposes that sophisticated and dynamic strategies in Africa and elsewhere which target women's reproductive health and research (such as control of STDs including AIDS, family planning, infertility investigation) require complementary linkage to the study and education of men. Men's perceptions, as well as determinants of sexual behavioural change and the socioeconomic context in which STDs, including AIDS, become rife, should be reviewed. There is a need to study and foster change to reduce or prevent poor reproductive health outcomes; to identify behaviours which could be adversely affecting women's reproductive health. Issues of gender, identity and tolerance as expressed through sexuality and procreation need to be amplified in the context of present risks in reproductive health. Researchers and providers often ignore the social significance of men. This paper reviews the impact of male dominance, as manifested through reproductive health and sexual decisions, against the background of present reproductive health problems. A research agenda should define factors at both macro and micro levels that interact to adversely impinge on reproductive health outcomes. This should be followed up by well-developed causal models of the determinants of positive reproductive health-promoting behaviours. Behaviour specific influences in sexual partnership include the degree of interpersonal support towards prevention, for example, of STDs, unwanted pregnancy or maternal deaths. Perceived efficacy and situational variables influencing male compliance in, say, condom use, form part of the wider study that addresses men. Thus preventive reproductive health initiatives and information should move from the female alone to both sexes. Women need men as partners in reproductive health who understand the risks they might be exposed to and strategies for their prevention.",Health policy and planning,1996 Mar,England,1996,90
28568882,COMPLEX COLONY STRUCTURE IN SOCIAL INSECTS: I. ECOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS AND GENETIC CONSEQUENCES.,"For social insect species, intraspecific variation in colony social structure provides an opportunity to relate the evolution of social behavior to ecological factors. The species Myrmica punctiventris is a cavity-dwelling forest ant that exhibits very different colony structures in two populations in the northeastern United States. Combined data from seasonal censuses, allozyme electrophoresis, and worker hostility tests showed that a population of M. punctiventris in Vermont was strictly monogynous and seasonally polydomous. The same procedures showed that a population of M. punctiventris in New York was facultatively polygynous and predominantly monodomous. Genetic relatedness among colony-mates was not different from Hamilton's expected values in the Vermont population and was consistent with little exchange of ants between colonies and single-mating of queens. In contrast, relatedness was lower in New York, and examination of nest-mate genotypes revealed exchange of ants between colonies, high rates of colony loss and replacement of queens, or multiple-mating of queens. The genetic structure of the Vermont population was consistent with no inbreeding, but in New York, the population genetic structure reflected microgeographic subdivision and inbreeding. Previous study of the ant communities at these sites implicates nest-site limitation in New York as a primary constraint on social structure.",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,1996 Feb,United States,1996,90

In particular, the role of adults has not been clearly identified. This study investigated contemporary social cognitive variables, in combination with likely adult influence factors, in predicting intended and self-reported vigorous physical activity for young adolescents. A questionnaire was administered to 147 boys and girls ages 13-14. Questions assessed physical activity levels, including vigorous activity, intention to take part in sports or vigorous physical activity, social cognitive variables, and adult encouragement of physical activity. A structural equation modeling analysis showed a good fit for a model in which vigorous physical activity was predicted by direct paths from adult encouragement and intention, with adult encouragement also predicting vigorous activity indirectly through perceived competence. Intention itself was predicted by adult encouragement and a task achievement goal orientation.",The Journal of school health,1996 Feb,United States,1996,90
8837908,Community attitudes to mental illness.,"BACKGROUND: The baseline findings from a controlled study of the effect of a public education campaign on community attitudes to mental illness are presented. METHOD: A census of attitudes to mental illness was conducted in two areas, prior to the opening of supported houses for the mentally ill. Factor analysis of the Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) inventory revealed three components: Fear and Exclusion, Social Control and Goodwill. RESULTS: The only determinant of Fear and Exclusion was having children. The main determinants of Social Control were social class, ethnic origin, age, having suffered mental illness and having children. The main determinant of Goodwill was educational level. The attitude factors were predictive of respondents' behavioural intentions toward the mentally ill. Respondents with children and non-Caucasians were more likely to object to the mentally ill living in their neighbourhood. CONCLUSIONS: Any intervention aimed at changing attitudes to mentally ill people in the community should be targeted at people with children and non-Caucasians, as these groups are more likely to object.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1996 Feb,England,1996,90
8817181,Distribution and population determinants of gamma-glutamyltransferase in a random sample of Sardinian inhabitants. 'ATS-SARDEGNA' Research Group.,"The relation of a number of determinants to serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was studied in a random sample of Sardinian inhabitants of 2283 males and 2520 females aged 20-59 years. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of environmental, behavioural and biochemical factors on GGT levels. Mean values were higher in males than in females and increased with age in both sexes. In sex-specific multiple regression analysis, GGT showed a positive association with body mass index (BMI), alcohol use, total serum cholesterol (T-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and age, and a negative one with coffee consumption and physical activity in males, while in females the enzyme was positively associated with BMI, alcohol use, age, T-C, ApoB, TG and cigarette smoking. The negative association between coffee drinking and serum GGT observed in males suggests that coffee may inhibit the inducing effects of other factors, particularly alcohol use, on GGT in the liver. No biological mechanism has been suggested to explain the association of GGT with BMI, age or physical activity. This study confirms the importance of GGT as a strong marker for alcohol use; but a number of variables, ranging from life-style to biological characteristics, are also important determinants of its plasma values in the 'normal' population.",European journal of epidemiology,1996 Feb,Netherlands,1996,90
8712185,Physical characteristics of residential psychiatric and substance abuse programs: organizational determinants and patients outcomes.,"Described the Physical and Architectural Characteristics Inventory (PACI), which assesses the physical characteristics of hospital- and community-based psychiatric and substance abuse residential treatment programs for adults. Developed using data from 94 representative programs, the PACI has 7 dimensions that assess community accessibility, physical features that add convenience, aid recreation, and provide support for patients, and space for patient and staff functions. In comparison to community-based programs (n = 63), hospital programs (n = 31) had more social-recreational and prosthetic aids, safety features, staff facilities, and space. The PACI dimensions were also related to other organizational features, such as facility ownership and program size and staffing level. Programs with more physical amenities had patients who were more involved in self-initiated and community activities and were more likely to successfully complete the program and be discharged to independent living situations and paid jobs. Programs with more social-recreational and prosthetic aids, space, and access to community resources also had better patient outcomes. In addition, PACI dimensions were related to observers' ratings of facility attractiveness. Potential applications of the PACI and the full inventory of which it is a part are discussed.",American journal of community psychology,1996 Feb,England,1996,90

Competing-risks hazards models have been developed to model such situations. This paper describes the extension of the discrete-time competing-risks hazards model to a multilevel framework that allows for data at different levels of aggregation. The model is illustrated with data from the 1988 Chinese National Survey of Fertility and Contraceptive Prevalence, which collected complete contraceptive histories.

8664366,Coping and social support as determinants of quality of life in HIV/AIDS.,"Coping, social support and quality of life (QOL) were examined in 120 HIV+ people (mean age = 37). The sample came from ambulatory clinics and drop-in centres in Toronto: 29% had AIDS, 35% were HIV symptomatic, and 35% were asymptomatic. Information was gathered from self-administered questionnaires. Respondents had good levels of social support and used a variety of coping strategies. Their scores on the behavioural and subjective measures of QOL were somewhat below average. The illness-related measure indicated that their diagnosis had an almost neutral effect on QOL and showed several areas where QOL had been positively affected. Data from male subjects only (n = 107) were analysed using a hierarchical block regression for each QOL measure. Income, emotional social support, and problem-oriented and perception-oriented coping were positively related to QOL. Tangible social support and emotion-oriented coping were negatively related and symptom severity was not related at all. Close friends provided most types of support. Although respondents indicated high levels of satisfaction with support generally, they expressed a need for more emotional support. Unemployment was high despite participants being relatively healthy and well-educated.",AIDS care,1996 Feb,England,1996,90
8660087,Smoking and other health related behaviour in the social and environmental context.,"It seems clear that parental smoking is harmful, although the magnitude of its effect may be smaller than sometimes suggested. However, smoking and other behaviours detrimental to health must be seen within a social and historical context. Individuals are not 'free choosing actors' and their behaviour is determined, at least in part, by their social and environmental circumstances. Smoking might better be regarded as a 'proximal' cause. 'Proximal' causes such as infectious or toxic agents are themselves subject to 'causes of causes' which are the determinants of exposure to these agents. Smoking may act as the 'proximal' cause, directly harming the fetus, but is itself caused by factors in the social and environmental circumstances. The complexity of the relationship between social and environmental circumstances, health related behaviours, and adverse outcomes cannot be resolved by the search for single causative agents. As Rutter points out, in order to begin to understand causal complexity 'it is necessary to examine distal causal relationships in the form of chains and of linked sequences involving several different, relatively short-term effects or operations' (p 2). Health promotion programmes sensitive to social context avoid 'victim blaming' and acknowledge that it is not enough to exhort mothers to 'stop smoking before and during pregnancy because this will harm your baby' (p 99). Mothers know that smoking can harm themselves and their babies and the vast majority want to give up. Their choice is limited by their social circumstances, and failure to recognise this has ensured the failure of health promotion initiatives aimed at smoking reduction during pregnancy. There are limitations in the techniques available to control for confounding in multivariate analysis and results must be interpreted with caution. Misinterpretation can lead to overemphasis of the role of single factors, diverting attention from complex pathways. While health related behaviours may be a 'proximal' cause of ill health, there is a duty on researchers, health promoters, and health policy makers to take account of the complex causal pathways in which these 'proximal' causes lie.",Archives of disease in childhood,1996 Feb,England,1996,90
8636786,Outcomes of cancer treatment for technology assessment and cancer treatment guidelines. American Society of Clinical Oncology.,"In 1993, the Health Services Research Committee of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) charged an Outcomes Working Group with defining the outcomes of adult and pediatric cancer treatment to be used for technology assessment and development of cancer treatment guidelines. The Working Group defined by consensus outcomes for technology assessment and guideline development, focusing on cancer treatments. The Working Group considered a variety of perspectives on outcomes, including those of patients, physicians, clinical investigators, ASCO, and policy makers. Because ASCO's guidelines will define what constitutes the best treatment and not whether that treatment should be paid for, the Working Group gave higher priority to the clinical and clinical research perspectives than to the health policy perspective. Survival is the most important outcome of cancer treatment. An improvement in at least disease-free survival is a prerequisite for recommending adjuvant therapy. In the case of metastatic cancer, treatment can be recommended even without an improvement in survival, if it improves quality of life. Quality of life includes global quality of life, as well as its physical, psychologic, and social dimensions. To be an outcome of cancer treatment, quality-of-life measures must be sensitive to clinically meaningful changes produced by treatment; evaluations must control for placebo effects and determinants of quality of life not related to cancer or its treatment. Toxicity, both short and long term, is vitally important, with the latter being particularly critical in children. The value of cancer outcomes like tumor response (eg, complete or partial response) and biomarkers (eg, CA-125) for technology assessment and guideline development depends on their ability to predict patient outcomes (survival and quality of life) or to influence decisions about treatment. Complete response is an important outcome when it predicts survival. Progression is important because it signals the need to change or stop treatment. Cost-effectiveness is an especially important outcome to consider when the benefits of treatment are modest or the costs are high. Patient outcomes (eg, survival and quality of life) should receive higher priority than cancer outcomes (eg, response rate), but both types of outcomes are important in technology assessment and guideline development. Multiple outcomes should be considered because no single outcome adequately describes the results of cancer treatment. In general, there is no minimum benefit above which treatments are justified; rather, benefits should be balanced against toxicity and cost.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,1996 Feb,United States,1996,90
8606317,The evaluation of changes in functional health status in patients with abdominal complaints.,"Measuring functional status changes in various patient subgroups is important in stratifying risk, assessing disease severity, and predicting and defining clinically relevant outcomes. Data from a multi-centered study of 980 primary care patients presenting with nonspecific abdominal complaints were studied to demonstrate the importance of such an assessment procedure. Patients were prospectively followed for 6 months. Five diagnostic categories based on illness duration and seriousness were derived from the clinical course of these patients. The functional status of each patient was determined at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). Intraclass correlation coefficients accounted for two aspects of the reliability of the SIP regarding the measurement of change over time: differences between patients which are stable over time (reproducibility) and different effects of treatment between subsets (responsiveness). A priori formulated expectations about the degree of health status change in patient subgroups were evaluated with the help of effect-size calculations. Patient impairment only partially depended on the final diagnosis and was also influenced by the presence of co-morbidity, psycho-social determinants, and other complaints. The health status change in the patient subgroups agreed with a priori formulated expectations. Standardized effect-size calculations revealed that the degree of change over time in SIP scores was in accordance with these expectations. We conclude: (a) the SIP appeared to be a reliable clinimetric instrument in detecting change over time resulting from different clinical courses, (b) clinical studies that use clinimetric instruments to assess the effects of clinical interventions must adequately control for the influence of baseline ""functional status"" as well as traditional demographic features such as gender and age, and (c) evaluating a priori formulated clinical expectations concerning functional change with statistics such as intraclass correlation and effect sizes can lead to a clearer understanding of the clinical relevance of statistically significant changes.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,1996 Feb,United States,1996,90
8546553,Determinants of nontraditional therapy use in patients with HIV infection. A prospective study.,"BACKGROUND: The popularity and use of nontraditional therapies among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has grown enormously. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal cohort study of 56 patients aged 23 through 68 years with HIV infection followed up at the HIV clinic at a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center. OBJECTIVE: To assess the demographic and psychologic characteristics of patients who seek nontraditional remedies, and their impact on disease progression and mortality from HIV. METHODS: A standardized, self-administered questionnaire to assess the incidence and type of nontraditional therapies used by patients with HIV. Data on demographics, medical status, physical functioning (Karnofsky performance score), CD4 lymphocyte counts, depression (Beck Depression Inventory), coping (inventory of coping with illness scale), psychological and/or emotional stress (Profile of Mood States scores), and compliance with prescribed therapy were prospectively assessed on all patients at baseline and every 6 months. RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients reported using nontraditional therapies. Nontraditional therapy users were significantly older than patients who did not use such therapies (44 vs 38 years, P = .03); with 94% of patients who used nontraditional therapy being older than 35 years compared with 56% of conventional therapy users (P = .005). Alternative therapy use did not correlate with race, education, HIV-risk group affiliation, duration of HIV seropositivity, stage of HIV disease, CD4 cell count, or Karnofsky performance scores. Nontraditional therapy users reported greater community-based acquired immunodeficiency syndrome group support (P = .06), greater perceived social support (P = .08), and significantly higher recreational or ""street drugs"" use (P = .02). Depression, adaptive coping, and emotional stress were not different between nontraditional and conventional therapy users; however, nontraditional therapy users were significantly more assertive (P = .04). On follow-up, CD4 cell count, HIV disease progression, physical functioning, or mortality were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Recourse to nontraditional therapy is common among patients with HIV. Because of the possibility of untoward effects and potential adverse drug interactions associated with nontraditional therapy, HIV care givers should be aware of its use in their patients and take a history of nontraditional therapy first. Patients who choose nontraditional remedies do so not because they are depressed or emotionally disturbed, but rather because they seek greater control of the outcome of their disease. However, no beneficial effect on disease progression, CD4 cell count, or mortality was observed in these patients when compared with patients receiving only conventional medical therapy.",Archives of internal medicine,1996 Jan 22,United States,1996,90
8604175,Global climate change and emerging infectious diseases.,"Climatic factors influence the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases, in addition to multiple human, biological, and ecological determinants. Climatologists have identified upward trends in global temperatures and now estimate an unprecedented rise of 2.0 degrees C by the year 2100. Of major concern is that these changes can affect the introduction and dissemination of many serious infectious diseases. The incidence of mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria, dengue, and viral encephalitides, are among those diseases most sensitive to climate. Climate change would directly affect disease transmission by shifting the vector's geographic range and increasing reproductive and biting rates and by shortening the pathogen incubation period. Climate-related increases in sea surface temperature and sea level can lead to higher incidence of water-borne infectious and toxin-related illnesses, such as cholera and shellfish poisoning. Human migration and damage to health infrastructures from the projected increase in climate variability could indirectly contribute to disease transmission. Human susceptibility to infections might be further compounded by malnutrition due to climate stress on agriculture and potential alterations in the human immune system caused by increased flux of ultraviolet radiation. Analyzing the role of climate in the emergence of human infectious diseases will require interdisciplinary cooperation among physicians, climatologists, biologists, and social scientists. Increased disease surveillance, integrated modeling, and use of geographically based data systems will afford more anticipatory measures by the medical community. Understanding the linkages between climatological and ecological change as determinants of disease emergence and redistribution will ultimately help optimize preventive strategies.",JAMA,1996 Jan 17,United States,1996,90

Greater export orientation reduces such concentration. Finally, GDP per capita, population, and export orientation reduce primacy.

12291886,Employment after childbearing and women's subsequent labour force participation: evidence from the British 1958 birth cohort.,"""Data on women from the British 1958 Cohort Study is used as evidence on the determinants of their labour force participation at age 33. A conventional cross-sectional model of full or part-time employment makes use of some longitudinal material not normally included in such models. Whether the woman made the hitherto customary break from employment at the time of the first maternity is included in recognition that this cohort was among the first generation to be offered Statutory Maternity Leave. Results suggest that the presence of children (still) inhibits full-time employment and raises the probability of part-time employment; that income effects on participation have continued to weaken while wage elasticity for full-time employment is high. Continuity of employment straight after childbearing raises the chances of subsequent full-time employment, but by no means guarantees it. Gains from maternity leave and other family friendly employment policies have been far from uniform.""",Journal of population economics,1996,Germany,1996,90
12291885,Mothers in an insider-outsider economy: the puzzle of Spain.,"""There is growing evidence that social policies towards mothers have important effects on their labour market behaviour. This article argues that these effects are less important in a Male Breadwinner Regime if there is employment insecurity in the household or if women intend to participate in the long-run. I consider the case of Spain, where the workforce has become polarized between insiders and outsiders and where social policies closely resemble the Male Breadwinner Regime. The results show that Spanish mothers fall into two groups: those who do not withdraw from the labour force after childbirth and those who withdraw and do not re-enter after their children arrive at school age. Entry or re-entry appears related to the husband's employment uncertainty. Married women in an 'insider household' are less likely to be mobile than women in an 'outsider household'.""",Journal of population economics,1996,Germany,1996,90

Estimates of a parametric discrete-time competing risks duration model show that wives of retired husbands go into full-time work, children under 3 years have a disincentive effect on part-time work and that part-time work is a state that German women prefer to stay in and not a first step to full-time employment, whereas foreign women living in West Germany prefer full-time jobs.""",Journal of population economics,1996,Germany,1996,90

We find that German and British women have even higher full-time labor force participation than Swedish women 12 months before the birth of the first child. The difference is more pronounced for second and third births than for first births. We suggest that these differences are caused by different family policy regimes where Germany can be characterized as a breadwinner regime and Sweden a regime oriented towards equal role sharing of father and mother. Our results on determinants of being in the labor force both after and before the birth of a child as well as determinants of the tempo of entering the labor force after birth show that women's own human capital is important both in Germany and Great Britain, whereas in Sweden also less educated women have entered the labor force by the time the child is 2 years old.""",Journal of population economics,1996,Germany,1996,90

The focus is on the complete reproductive histories of single mothers and the life expectancies among infants born to women who at least once in their reproductive life history experienced the birth of an illegitimate child. In Sundsvall, industrialization only temporarily affected the illegitimacy ratio, but its effect was obvious even in agrarian parishes. The number of illegitimate children per woman remained relatively stable over time, with the exception of the town of Sundsvall. It was more common in the urban environment to give birth to several illegitimate children. Mortality was also higher among these infants, but the negative effects can be seen equally among both legitimate and illegitimate children.""",The history of the family : an international quarterly,1996,United States,1996,90
10162860,Georgia's harvesting healthy habits: a formative evaluation.,"Occupational safety and health researchers seek to conduct effective cancer awareness campaigns to increase agricultural workers' skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Georgia undertook such a project using a social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) conceptual model, with its objectives focusing on personal determinants of and environmental influences on farmers' behavior. One underused strategy to increase the success of health campaigns, formative evaluation, was undertaken during year one of the demonstration project, with four goals. These included an assessment of: (1) the availability of societal resources to support farmers' practices, (2) the affordability for farmers to follow through with behaviors being promoted, (3) the social support for behaving in ways that reduce farmers' skin cancer risk, and (4) farmers' current knowledge, outcome expectations, and self-efficacy in this regard. Formative evaluation revealed an absence of information, products, services, and social support for farmers' skin cancer prevention and detection. As a result, the Georgia project's plan was refined to include specific activities aimed at increasing the environmental support for health promotion activities relating to farmers' skin cancer prevention and detection. These include a seminar for rural primary care physicians and public health nurses to increase knowledge and skills relating to conducting clinical skin exams; programs for agricultural extension agents, cotton scouts, and 4-H groups to provide opportunities to learn more about and practice sun safety; and a feed and seed store campaign.",The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,1996,England,1996,90
10157065,Health care provider choice: the North West Province of Cameroon.,"Health care is provided in many developing countries free of any charge at the point of delivery. This is attributed to the fact that health care is one of the basic human rights. While modern health care in public health units is free, patients in rural areas continue to use either self-care, traditional healers or both. In Cameroon, the idea of integrating traditional and modern medical practices is discussed by both traditional and medical practitioners. However, it is not very clear what influences the household's choice of one or the other. Within a health district, where there are many providers, the question as to whether or not there is a possibility of choice open to all is posed. This article reports on a study undertaken in a rural health district that shows that there are many factors that influence the choice of health care. Among these factors is quality of care which is the most important factor influencing the choice of health care provider. As quality of care increases in governmental health centres, their choice probability also increases. Other factors include: the time spent seeking treatment; household income and size; distance; and, cost of health care. Those with higher incomes tend to choose private health units and those with larger families tend to choose government health units. Other socio-cultural factors, difficult to model, appear to also influence the choice of providers. It is concluded that since household income influences the choice of private health units, policies targeting poverty alleviation should be instituted in the rural areas to provide households with income. This will enable them widened access to private health care and enable government to redeploy its scarce resources to maintain and extend services to needy areas.",The International journal of health planning and management,1996 Jan-Mar,England,1996,90
9060780,Determinants of work satisfaction among Swedish dental hygienists.,"This study examines factors that contribute to work satisfaction among Swedish dental hygienists. A questionnaire was used to collect data on health, demographics, work-history, work characteristics, work satisfaction and social support at work. The questionnaire was mailed to 471 hygienists; 77.3% responded. 70% of the hygienists are highly or very satisfied with their work tasks. Active leisure and working in large cities were significantly related to high work satisfaction. The best linear regression model explained 48% of the variance in work satisfaction. Thirty percent of the variance was explained by work tasks perceived to be skills developing. Skills development in the profession appears low (median = 44%). After controlling work factors, work satisfaction increased with growing skills development for all hygienists, even for those less satisfied with their work. The findings suggest that the opportunities for developing professional skills should increase to improve satisfaction among dental hygienists. Measures should also be taken to improve the work climate, work stimulation, and job variation as well as reduce the collegial pressure at work.",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,1996,Sweden,1996,90
9050190,Double jeopardy: women and leprosy in India.,"This article presents evidence from two states of India, Bihar and Maharashtra, on the process of ""dehabilitation"" among male and female leprosy patients, and suggests gender-sensitive interventions to address existing problems in leprosy control. While the study investigated a wide range of gender differences in the impact of leprosy, this article focuses on only two-marriage and family reactions. Important gender differences were apparent in the impact of the disease. While both men and women were negatively affected in terms of their family and marital lives, women suffered more isolation and rejection. Psychologically, women appeared more vulnerable because they were deprived of personal contact with others in the domestic environment where they were accustomed to receiving their greatest emotional rewards. Women reported that indifference to them by other family members, or seeming negation of their presence, caused them the greatest suffering. This underscores the importance of providing information to both leprosy patients and their families about the disease and its treatment, including the possibility of cure with MDT (multi-drug therapy) and of counselling family members about their crucial role in helping patients cope and recover. This support is even more critical for women, who often lack access to the variety of outside advice and assistance available to men. The evidence presented in the article demonstrates the importance of analysing leprosy from a gender perspective, not only because this approach helps to inform our understanding of the determinants and consequences of the disease, but also because it provides new insights for improved disease control.",World health statistics quarterly.

9017281,Socioeconomic status and obesity.,"Two recent developments have thrown into bold relief the importance of environmental forces in determining the prevalence of human obesity. The first is genetic studies that estimate the heritability of human obesity at no more than 33%. The second is the 33% increase in the prevalence of obesity in the USA during the past decade. The importance of the environment in influencing obesity is matched only by the extent of our ignorance of how it exerts its effects and of how we may favourably alter them. The most thoroughly studied measure of environmental influences is socioeconomic status. Among women in developed societies socioeconomic status is strongly (negatively) correlated with the prevalence of obesity: the lower the social class the more the obesity. Prospective studies have shown that this correlation reflects, in part, causation: socioeconomic status helps to determine the prevalence of obesity and thinness. Likewise, the presence of obesity helps to determine socioeconomic status. In developing societies there is also a strong relationship between socioeconomic status and obesity, but it is a positive one: the higher the socioeconomic status the more the obesity. Unfortunately, we know of few other social determinants of obesity and studies on the social determinants of this disorder are desperately needed.",Ciba Foundation symposium,1996,Netherlands,1996,90
8982525,Adolescent alcohol use: social determinants and the case for early family-centered prevention. Family-focused prevention of adolescent drinking.,"The family plays a central role in the use of alcohol by children and adolescents, yet preventive interventions rarely focus on the family. Early drinking and much subsequent use of alcohol by children and adolescents is sanctioned and sometimes encouraged by their families. Unlike experimentation with alcohol, problem drinking is associated with low levels of family social support and with dysfunctional coping strategies of families that may lead children to use drinking as an adaptive behavior. While risk-factor research has advanced understanding of alcohol use by children and youth, the poor predictive power of individual risks has limited its contribution to successful interventions. On the other hand, protective factors, provided by relationships within and outside the family, can be preventive and health promoting. Parents influence their children's drinking through family interactions, modeling and reinforcing standards, and attitudes that children learn and use to guide their behavior in new situations. Thus, parental influences endure. This article argues that interventions to prevent alcohol abuse should be designed to help parents to carry out their parental functions. This can be accomplished by providing social support, resources, and education for parents, as well as developing extra-familial sources of social support and socialization for children and adolescents.",Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,1996 Winter,United States,1996,90
8909112,"Gender, family configuration, and the effect of family background on educational attainment.","A comprehensive model of family influences on educational resemblance of siblings expands the traditional sibling pair model to a full sibship model in order to investigate how gender, gender composition of sibships, and a measure of ordinal position moderate the effect of social origins on educational attainments of siblings. One common family factor is sufficient to explain the variation of educational attainment among brothers and sisters. Although effects of social origins variables on brothers are larger than on sisters, the relative effects of measured social origins are virtually the same among sisters and brothers. The disparity between educational attainments of brothers and sisters persists across sex composition and family size. Ordinal position does not alter the effects of social origins on educational attainment nor does it directly affect educational attainment. Father's and mother's education are equally important for all siblings regardless of birth order, gender composition, and family size.",Social biology,1996 Spring-Summer,United States,1996,90

Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find the mortality risk differs by gender, age, and type of widowhood. For nonelderly (< 65) widowers, there is an elevated risk when their wives died suddenly. For older (> or = 65) widows, the mortality risk is lower than that of comparably aged married women when their husbands died after a long-term illness.

Conditional logistic regression models were employed to estimate the effects of macro- and micro-level factors (such as socioeconomic conditions, familial relationships, as well as biosocial determinants) on the survivorship of neonatal and post-neonatal infants in China. The study yielded two findings: (1) Social changes in Chinese society had a strong positive effect on neonatal and post-neonatal survivorship; and (2) the magnitude of such social changes differed across regions which, in turn, led to the differential effects on neonatal and post-neonatal survivorship across provinces in China.",Social biology,1996 Spring-Summer,United States,1996,90

Results showed that most school districts are not offering recommended program elements related to sexual orientation issues. Districts within localities with gay rights protection are doing more than those without. Although compositional factors account for some of the differences in educational efforts, a politically engaged constituency also made a major difference in school district efforts. To the extent that gays and lesbians served in local public office and mobilized to influence school elections, they were able to affect school programs and policies.",The Journal of school health,1996 Jan,United States,1996,90

The program was tested in a trial that involved 36 people with diabetes; 20 received CAL lessons in diabetes management and 16 attended conventional diabetes classes conducted by diabetes educators. When measurements taken before and three months after the education were compared, both groups showed significant improvement in their knowledge; the blood glucose levels of the CAL group were significantly lower but those of the conventional education group were higher. This means that the CAL program was as effective as conventional education in imparting knowledge but it was more likely to motivate people to control their glucose levels. The CAL program allows diabetes educators to spend less time on education in basic knowledge and to concentrate more on motivational and social factors that are important determinants of patient compliance. It can also benefit people with diabetes whose access to health professionals and/or conventional diabetes education is restricted.",The Australian journal of advanced nursing : a quarterly publication of the Royal Australian Nursing Federation,1996 Winter,Australia,1996,90

We review available data on individual, socioeconomic, and health system determinants of access to standard breast cancer care, including screening, diagnostic, and treatment services. Based on this review, we discuss the combination of factors which result in underservice. We argue that a broad framework which considers health system and social class as well as individual factors is useful for analyzing how structures of health care delivery tend to provide less than standard care to women who are older, have less income, or are less educated, black, or Hispanic. Data collection efforts which do not include structural and socioeconomic variables may result in an incomplete or misleading understanding of the determinants of underservice. These factors also need to be considered in the design and evaluation of public health policies and interventions meant to ameliorate the effects of underservice.",Breast cancer research and treatment,1996,Netherlands,1996,90

A few metropolitan areas in California with relatively low levels of segregation are shown to have low black death rates and small black-white differences in mortality rates for infants and young adult males (15-44 years old).

8868380,"Trends in HIV-1 and HIV-2 prevalence and risk factors in pregnant women in Harare, Zimbabwe.","The spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the resulting morbidity and mortality are major public health challenges with adverse social and economic implications. The pregnant population serves as an important marker of the extent of the problem in the sexually active low risk categorized population. Furthermore, a high HIV prevalence among women of childbearing age contributes to neonatal and infant mortality through perinatal transmission and also a large number of uninfected children become orphans. The objective of the present study was to determine the HIV prevalence rate and the risk factors in pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics in the Greater Harare area of Zimbabwe. Women presenting for antenatal care in four maternity clinics between May 1994 and June 1995 were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies following informed consent, counselling and completion of a questionnaire. Of the 1.168 women, 30.4 pc tested HIV-1 positive, with prevalence rates ranging from 23.6 pc at a lower density clinic, 28.6 pc in a medium density clinic, 30.7 pc in a higher density clinic and 33.2 pc at the referral maternity hospital. HIV-2 was present in 7.6 pc of the women. The 20 to 29 years age group had the highest HIV prevalence of 35 pc, (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.4; 95 pc CI-1.33 to 4.32). Single pregnant women were more likely to test positive, (OR = 2.1; 95 pc CI = 1.2 to 3.7). Thirty five pc of the women reported previous use of condoms and in those where condom use was reported in casual relationships, there was a higher risk of HIV (OR 6.1; 95 pc CI = 2.1 to 17.3). Reported use of intravaginal herbs was associated with HIV risk (OR 1.4; 95 pc CI = 1.1 to 1.8; p < 0.03). History of genital ulcer (OR = 2.3), discharge (OR = 2.4), rash (OR = 2.7), genital ulcer with PID (OR = 5.8) was significantly associated with HIV infection. Present findings indicate a 30.4 pc HIV prevalence rate for a sample of 1,168 pregnant women in Harare. This rate is much higher than the 18 pc HIV prevalence rate reported for 1,008 pregnant women in the same Greater Harare area in 1990. We conclude that there is need for further innovative and aggressive community based as well as institutional interventions aimed at reducing HIV risk.

8862153,The use of theory based semistructured elicitation questionnaires: formative research for CDC's Prevention Marketing Initiative.,"Through one of its many HIV prevention programs, the Prevention Marketing Initiative, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention promotes a multifaceted strategy for preventing the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS among people less than 25 years of age. The Prevention Marketing Initiative is an application of marketing and consumer-oriented technologies that rely heavily on behavioral research and behavior change theories to bring the behavioral and social sciences to bear on practical program planning decisions. One objective of the Prevention Marketing Initiative is to encourage consistent and correct condom use among sexually active young adults. Qualitative formative research is being conducted in several segments of the population of heterosexually active, unmarried young adults between 18 and 25 using a semistructured elicitation procedure to identify and understand underlying behavioral determinants of consistent condom use. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the use of this type of qualitative research methodology in designing effective theory-based behavior change interventions. Issues of research design and data collection and analysis are discussed. To illustrate the methodology, results of content analyses of selected responses to open-ended questions on consistent condom use are presented by gender (male, female), ethnic group (white, African American), and consistency of condom use (always, sometimes). This type of formative research can be applied immediately to designing programs and is invaluable for valid and relevant larger-scale quantitative research.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",1996,United States,1996,90
8840201,Policy and ideology: the politics of post-reform health policy in the United Kingdom.,"While it is commonly accepted that the broader political and economic climate directly influences the nature of any major changes in the provision of health care (witness the 1991 National Health Service reforms in the United Kingdom), there is less consideration of the effect of paradigm changes in health care and health care management themselves on wider political and ideological strategies. This article examines the recent health policy initiatives presented by Britain's Labour Party. The author argues that while the Conservatives' market-oriented reforms reflected the perceived political and economic realities of the 1980s, the rapidly increasing credibility of strategies of prevention within the health care sector (including an emphasis on the social determinants of ill-health, the need to plan a shift from acute to community care, and the desire for greater lay participation in policy-making) allows Labour to highlight the limitations of a strongly market-oriented system in the health care sector more so than in any other policy area.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1996,United States,1996,90
8823347,Considerations of natural history and pathophysiology in the psychopharmacology of Tourette's syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: The increasing recognition of Tourette's syndrome is probably responsible for the broadening range of symptom severities seen in clinic patients. Greater clinical diversity also brings greater treatment challenges, particularly for children in whom the risks and benefits of medication for the developing central nervous system must be weighed against the long-term risks associated with the disorder itself. Knowledge of the natural history and pathophysiology of Tourette's syndrome is vitally important for informed clinical decision making. METHOD: A MEDLINE literature search was undertaken to identify studies of the natural history and pathophysiology of Tourette's syndrome that would be relevant to clinical psychopharmacology. RESULTS: Although impossible to predict with certainty for any given patient, the natural history of Tourette's syndrome is typically characterized by an early childhood onset, a prepubertal exacerbation, postpubertal attenuation, and an adult stabilization of symptoms. Symptoms fluctuate in all phases of the illness, often in response to stress. The natural history and clinical phenotype of Tourette's syndrome are thought to have both genetic and nongenetic determinants that are mediated through their effects on basal ganglia nuclei and related neural systems. Medications used in the treatment of Tourette's syndrome are thought to modulate the functioning of these neural systems. CONCLUSION: Although medication decisions must consider tic symptom severity, expectations of the disorder's natural history, and the child's adaptive capacities-his or her comorbid illnesses, coping mechanisms, interpersonal relatedness, impulse control, affect regulation, and family and social supports-are the most important determinants of well-being and outcome. These therefore are the most important considerations when making treatment decisions, as well.",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,1996,United States,1996,90

In addition, early sexual debut is eight times as likely among black boys as among non-Hispanic white boys. Children who use controlled substances at an early age are more than twice as likely to have sex before age 14 as those who do not, although the type of substance having an effect is different for girls (cigarettes) and boys (alcohol). Church attendance is an important determinant of delayed sexual activity, but only when a child's friends attend the same church.",Family planning perspectives,1996 Jan-Feb,United States,1996,90

Analyses are based on a representative sample of 730 physically disabled adults from ten countries of southwestern Ontario, Canada. Results indicate life-course related differences in the levels of both family support and family conflict, with the oldest group perceiving the greatest support and the least conflict from family members. While level of disability was not significantly related to perceived family support, findings indicate that individuals with greater functional limitations experience less frequent negative or conflictive interactions with family. A number of additional socio-demographic and psycho-social factors were also associated with perceived family support and conflict. However, the determinants of support and conflict were not equivalent and varied considerably by age group. In general, the results of this study support the notion that support and conflict represent independent dimensions of experience. Moreover, the factors that influence family support and conflict appear to change across the life course.",International journal of aging & human development,1996,United States,1996,90
8822021,Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco.,"The proceedings of the inaugural scientific meeting of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) are summarized. The primary objective of the meeting was to foster the exchange of information on the effects of nicotine and tobacco use, as well as factors which influence their use, drawing from biological, behavioral and social sciences. Much of this research can be viewed as a tale of ""two"" drugs--nicotine as a key to an important public health problem, and nicotine as a classical tool of physiological and pharmacological research. A historical overview of research on ""both"" drugs is provided first. Public policy alternatives for reducing the prevalence of tobacco use have been derived in part from basic and clinical research results and are briefly outlined. Evidence for genetic determinants on nicotine use and effects is presented using data from twin studies and from molecular genetic research with humans and animals. Consistent with this research, there is evidence of individual differences in pharmacokinetics and effects of nicotine, which could account for differences in smoking behavior and nicotine dependence. Finally, recent developments in the therapeutic uses of nicotine and novel nicotinic agonists with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome and ulcerative colitis are presented. Overall, the research presented at the meeting demonstrated the vast diversity of areas of study involving nicotine and tobacco, as well as the rich opportunities for cross-communication among researchers from different disciplines.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1996 Jan,England,1996,90
8747497,Familial resemblances in alcohol use: genetic or cultural transmission?,"OBJECTIVE: Resemblances between parents and children for alcohol use can be due both to cultural transmission and genetic inheritance. We examined the genetic and environmental determinants of the familial resemblances in alcohol use. METHOD: With a parent-twin design a distinction was made between the contribution of genetic effects, the environmental influences shared by siblings and the effects of cultural transmission from parents to offspring. By questionnaire data on whether subjects had ever used alcohol were obtained from 403 Dutch families with a twin aged 15-16 years old and from 805 families with a twin aged 17 years and older. RESULTS: For 15-16 year olds, the resemblance between parents and offspring could be explained either by genetic inheritance or cultural transmission. Shared environment explained between 58% and 88% of the individual differences in adolescent alcohol use. For twins aged 17 years and older, 43% of the individual differences in alcohol use could be attributed to genetic factors and 37% to shared environment. There was no evidence for cultural transmission in this age group. CONCLUSIONS: For adolescents aged 17 years and older parental alcohol use did not create an environment that stimulated alcohol use in children. The resemblance for alcohol use between parents and their children aged 17 years and older could be explained by their genetic relatedness. For 15-16 year old adolescents, shared environmental influences were more important than for older adolescents. Only 10% of this shared environmental variance might be influenced by parental alcohol use due to cultural transmission.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1996 Jan,United States,1996,90

The main reported disability is hearing speech in the presence of background noise. The degrees of speech-hearing disability in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome have been investigated with the use of the Social Hearing Handicap Index (SHHI), and the relationships between the SHHI scores and a number of physiological, psychoacoustical and psychological factors determined in 109 patients. The significantly higher (worse) SHHI scores in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome indicate that this group suffer a considerable degree of speech-hearing disability. In our study, the main findings are that some psychological factors, performance of the sentence in noise test and auditory thresholds are significantly correlated with the SHHI scores. We were unable to find any relationships between the SHHI and frequency resolution or EOAEs.

8729794,Economic activity and mortality of the 1981 Census cohort in the OPCS Longitudinal Study.,"This article presents mortality from 1981 to 1989 for men and women in England and Wales of working ages by their economic activity at the 1981 Census. Both men and women in employment had lower overall mortality compared with that of all men, while those seeking work had higher mortality. The social class distribution of the unemployed did not explain all their excess deaths. The overall mortality of both employed and unemployed men relative to all men in the 1980s was lower than that of employed and unemployed men in the 1970s (1971-79) relative to all men in the 1970s.",Population trends,1996 Spring,England,1996,90
8726903,Determinants of suicide ideation: a comparison of Chinese and American college students.,"A LISREL model that incorporates both social and psychological factors was used to explain Chinese and American college students' suicide ideation. Questionnaire data were obtained from one Chinese sample (N = 320) from four universities in Beijing and one American sample (N = 452) from one university in the Rocky Mountain area. As in the American sample, Chinese females score higher on the ideation scale than Chinese males, but the overall rate is lower for the Chinese than for the American college students. The findings in the American data support previous literature that family cohesion and religiosity are inversely related to suicide ideation, while the Chinese data suggest a positive correlation between religiosity and suicide ideation. This article offers a comparison of different cultural environments for Chinese and American adolescent development.",Adolescence,1996 Summer,United States,1996,90
8711958,[Psychosomatic determinants of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty].,"Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) has become one of the standard procedures in the therapy of coronary heart disease. One of the main issues is the 20-40% incidence of restenosis of the dilated vessel. Up to now, the subject of predictors of restenosis has not yet been sufficiently clarified. Our study is concerned with two questions; first, is it possible to prove any connections between the amount of restenosis and psychosocial factors? Second, is it possible to distinguish groups of patients with and without subsequent restenosis on the basis of psychosocial variables, even before the diagnostic coronary angiography? 138 (91m, 47f) patients were assessed before the diagnostic coronarangiography, the 25 PTCA-patients (20m, 5f) were furthermore reassessed three months after the PTCA (the time of the angiographic control). Somatic and social data were collected and a semistandardised interview was conducted. In addition, coping, stress-coping control over disease and health and life-contentment were determined. Highly significant correlations was found between the amount of restenosis and resignative stress-coping, self-pity, depressive coping and flight-tendency. With the help of stress-coping-subtests (which were given at the first examination) it was possible to separate the group of patients with restenosis from the group without it.",Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychoanalyse,1996,Germany,1996,90

Few, if any, systematic epidemiologic studies are available. In this pilot study we investigated one alternative way to collect data from relevant patient populations and formulated some hypotheses. Moreover, questions found unhelpful in this context were identified, e.g., whether the mother had bathed her dead child or not. Fruitful hypotheses found worthwhile testing were, among others: the risk of long-term anxiety-related symptoms is reduced if (1) the woman has seen her stillborn child, (2) she has an ultrasonic or photographic picture of the child, and (3) she has gone through a ritual, primarily burial of the child; moreover, (4) divorce may be a social consequence of the intrauterine loss of a child.",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,1996,Switzerland,1996,90
8690737,Determinants of contraceptive use in Morocco: stopping behaviour in traditional populations.,"The determinants of modern contraceptive use in traditional populations are analysed in married women aged 30-44 living in the province of Marrakech (Morocco). Women who have never used contraception have smaller family sizes than those who do: the number of live children (or live births) is the variable with maximum predictive power on contraceptive use, while child mortality is the main inhibiting factor. The probability of contraceptive use increases with female age at marriage and decreases with the woman's age, indicating a generational change in reproductive behaviour. The socioeconomic variables education, employment and residence, have no significant independent predictive character on contraceptive use, although the interaction between education and residence does. The paper evaluates the hypothesis that traditional populations in the initial phase of their demographic transition resort to modern contraception in order to stop childbearing, when they have reached a desired number of children, rather than to space births or reduce their fertility.",Journal of biosocial science,1996 Jan,England,1996,90
8658367,Determinants of health-related quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"BACKGROUND: The consequences of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on daily life, encapsulated by the term ""health-related quality of life"" (HRQL), are important in determining appropriate home care. There is a need to understand the relative contribution of respiratory impairment, physical disability, coping, age, and socioeconomic variables on HRQL. METHODS: Patients with COPD were recruited on admission to a pulmonary rehabilitation centre. Respiratory impairment was assessed by lung function tests and physical disability was evaluated by a 12 minute walking test. HRQL was assessed by means of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) measuring ""symptoms"", ""activity"", and ""impact"". Because the SGRQ does not include a measure of ""well being"", this was taken from the medical psychological questionnaire for lung diseases. The COPD coping questionnaire and a questionnaire covering basic socioeconomic variables were also used. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty six patients of mean (SD) age 65 (9) years and mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 39 (9)% predicted were included. The scores on the SGRQ indicated severe impairment. Correlations were found between lung function parameters, 12 minute walking test, and the HRQL ""activity"" and ""impact"" components. Coping strategies were correlated with the ""activity"", ""impact"", and ""well being"" components. No correlations were found between age, socioeconomic variables, and HRQL. FEV1, 12 minute walking test, and the coping strategies ""avoidance"" and ""emotional reaction"" were the best predictors of HRQL. CONCLUSION: In patients with COPD methods of improving physical performance and teaching adequate coping strategies should be considered in order to improve HRQL.",Thorax,1996 Jan,England,1996,90
8632735,Explaining reduced cancer survival among the disadvantaged.,"The fact that socially disadvantaged cancer patients face a greater risk of mortality than the advantaged is well recognized but poorly understood. Existing research and a newly completed 10-year survival study suggest that complex interrelations among biological factors, medical interventions, and specific dimensions of social differentiation determine survival differences. Patterns of interrelations among determinants of survival appear compatible with an ""economic"" model in some forms of cancer and a ""cognitive-behavioral"" model in others. Findings presented here suggest that improved access to health care will reduce mortality risk among the disadvantaged in at least some malignancies, but will not alone make their survival chances equal to those of the advantaged.",The Milbank quarterly,1996,United States,1996,90
8589535,Distribution of time of first birth in presence of social customs regulating physical separation and coital frequency.,"The interval between marriage and the first birth in India, particularly in rural areas, is much longer than what is observed in western countries. In eastern Uttar Pradesh, the mean interval is observed to be even longer, possibly due to traditional customs such as the female partner's visits to her parents in the early years of marriage and the smaller chance of coition because of the observance of rigid intercourse taboos. Thus the models to explain the length of the interval of marriage to first birth proposed by Western demographers, which assume that the period of cohabitation between marriage and first birth is uninterrupted, often do not describe the data satisfactorily when applied to rural India. In this paper a model to describe data on first birth interval is proposed that takes account of the distributions of timing and periods of physical separation and variation in fecundity with effective marriage duration.",Mathematical biosciences,1996 Jan 1,United States,1996,90
8567618,Impact of parent monitoring on initiation of drug use through late childhood.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether parental supervision and monitoring in middle childhood might have a sustained impact on risk of drug use later in childhood and adolescence. METHOD: An epidemiological sample of 926 urban-dwelling youths were individually interviewed annually, beginning in 1989 when the children were 8 to 10 years old, continuing through 1992. Standardized questions measured drug use, parenting behaviors, and other suspected determinants of drug use. RESULTS: Survival analysis estimates indicated that children in the lowest quartile of parent monitoring initiated drug use at earlier ages. The contrast in risk of initiating alcohol, tobacco, or other drug use across levels of parent monitoring was greatest when children were under 11 years old; at older ages there was no difference in risk. However, in analyses focused specifically on marijuana, cocaine, and inhalant drugs, we observed a sustained higher risk of starting to use these drugs among youths who had been monitored at the lowest levels in middle childhood. CONCLUSION: These results add to the chain of inference that effective supervision and monitoring in middle childhood by parents or guardians might induce a delay or prevent onset of drug use among youths living in urban areas, a hypothesis that now ought to be tested in rigorous field experiments.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1996 Jan,United States,1996,90
10163302,The effects of the child and adolescent trial for cardiovascular health intervention on psychosocial determinants of cardiovascular disease risk behavior among third-grade students.,"PURPOSE: The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health is a multi-site study of a school-based intervention designed to reduce or prevent the development of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The goal was to change (or prevent) related risk behaviors and the psychosocial variables that theoretically influence those behaviors. DESIGN: A nested design was used in which schools served as the primary unit of analysis. Twenty-four schools participated at each of four sites (Austin, San Diego, Minneapolis, and New Orleans). Each site had 10 control and 14 intervention schools. SETTING AND SUBJECT: Ninety-six schools (with more than 6000 students) in the four sites were randomized to three treatment conditions: control, school-based interventions, and school-plus-family interventions. The sample included approximately equal numbers of males and females and was 67.5% white, 13.9% African-American, 13.9% Hispanic, and 4.7% other. MEASURES: The psychosocial determinants included improvements in dietary knowledge, intentions, self-efficacy, usual behavior, perceived social reinforcement for healthy food choices, and perceived reinforcement and self-efficacy for physical activity. RESULTS: The findings indicated significant improvements in all the psychosocial determinants measured (p < .0001). The results revealed a greater impact in the school-plus-family intervention schools for two determinants, usual dietary behavior and intentions to eat heart-healthy foods. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support theory-based interventions for changing selected psychosocial determinants of cardiovascular disease risk behavior among children.",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,1996 Jan-Feb,United States,1996,90
24203602,The contribution of family cohesion and the pain-coping process to depressive symptoms in fibromyalgia.,"This research evaluated a model for examining the role of family cohesion and the pain-coping process in predicting depressive symptoms in fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder of unknown etiology. Depressive symptoms were highly prevalent in this patient group. Fifty-nine percent of the sample met or exceeded the cutoff score of 16 for depression on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), while slightly greater than 50% exceeded the cutoff score of 19, a figure that is suggested for evaluating depression in chronic pain populations. Multiple regression analyses, controlling for demographic factors and medication use, revealed that low family cohesion (either reported by the patient or the patient's spouse), high pain, high helplessness, and high passive coping contributed independently to greater CES-D scores. Pain also was related to higher depression scores indirectly through its association with greater helplessness and passive coping. In contrast, no indirect effects of family cohesion were found on depressive symptoms through pain, helplessness, and passive coping. Structural equation modeling procedures provided confirmatory evidence of the significance of these relationships, indicating a high degree of goodness-of-fit with the model examined. The data illustrate the import of a multidimensionalframeworkfor conceptualizing physical, psychological, and social determinants of depressive disturbance in fibromyalgia.",Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,1995 Dec,England,1995,90

Such methods enable a comparison of summary measures of mortality experience such as life expectancy and median age at death before and after adjustment for socio-economic variables. In the absence of comparable information on the survivor population an approximate life table method is investigated as a means of comparing mortality profiles and the effects of social factors. Such factors may pertain both to the individuals (e.g. their birthplace) or to their small area of residence (e.g. measures of area deprivation). These methods also permit a comparison of the impact of socio-economic factors on different causes of death. The application is to mortality in London over the period 1990-92 and to its constituent boroughs and electoral wards.""",European journal of population = Revue europeenne de demographie,1995 Dec,Netherlands,1995,90

DESIGN: Two age-stratified cohorts of Danish men and women were examined twice with five years interval. SETTING: The Glostrup Population Studies in the Copenhagen County, Denmark. SUBJECTS: A random population sample of 2009 men and women, aged 30, 40, 50, and 60 years. METHODS: At baseline all underwent a general health examination including measurement of height and weight, and they completed questionnaires regarding familial predisposition, cohabitation, school education, vocational training, social class, smoking habits, physical activity during work and leisure time, and parity. Dietary intake was evaluated by 7-day food records, allowing estimation of total energy intake and intake of fat and alcohol. At the follow-up examination height and weight were measured again and at each examination BMI was calculated. The statistical analysis was performed by graphical models based on multidimensional contingency tables defined by independence graphs, these may include several categorial or ordinal scale variables and include the assumed temporal relationship between the variables. RESULTS: BMI at entry depended on familial predisposition to obesity, and for women on cohabitation as well. At follow-up 5 years later, BMI in the male group was only related to former BMI, whereas in the female group it was influenced by parity as well. There were several significant associations between the dietary factors, other life style habits and social factors. However, no significant associations were found between total energy intake, percentage of energy from fat or from alcohol and weight changes. For neither gender was there any significant influence of other putative determining factors. CONCLUSION: No influence of dietary factors on weight changes were found when assessed in the context of many other putative determinants of weight change.",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,1995 Dec,England,1995,90
8865740,[Factors associated with increased diabetes burden in elderly diabetic patients].,"To define the factors that determine the increased burden of diabetes in elderly diabetic patients, we examined the relationship between the Elderly Diabetes Impact Scales (EDIS) and physical or social factors in 383 elderly outpatients aged over 60 years old who answered QOL questionnaires by professional interviewers. The EDIS consisted of 6 subscales (burden of symptoms, burden of daily life, burden of diet therapy, burden of drug therapy, satisfaction, worry) and total EDIS scores were calculated by summing up the 4-point scores of 37 questions. The EDIS scores were highest in patients who received insulin therapy. In univariate analysis, high EDIS scores were significantly associated with high HbA1c, low Roken ADL score, and the presence of retinopathy or neuropathy. Among social factors, leisure activities, housework or jobs, social network, and positive social support were significantly associated with low EDIS scores, while negative social support was associated with high EDIS scores in elderly diabetic patients. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age (younger), sex (women), low ADL (or diabetic complications), insulin therapy, low positive social support, high negative social support, economical dissatisfaction, and the low adaptative feeling of diabetes were significant and independent determinants of a high burden in diabetic patients indicated by EDIS scores in Japanese elderly diabetic patients.",Nihon Ronen Igakkai zasshi.

8850111,[Psychiatry and psychotherapy of aging].,"The competence model is fundamental for the understanding of the aging process. This model does not limit itself to a description of deficits but focusses on the existing skills and capabilities of the person, allowing for age related pecularities. All geropsychiatric interventions start from a geropsychiatric assessment which extends beyond medical diagnosis and an enumeration of findings. This requires interdisciplinary cooperation. Since psychiatric illness in old age has multiple determinants, interventions need to embrace multidimensional approaches on the somatic, psychological and social level. At present, a number of interventions are available for treatment, rehabilitation and nursing care of old people with psychiatric illness. This includes psychotherapeutic interventions, which have proven successful. A reductionists view is therefore not warranted. An appropriate level of care, including rehabilitation or skilled nursing care, for the elderly from a high risk group for psychiatric morbidity or with psychiatric illness already present requires coordination of regional care facilities.",Zeitschrift fur arztliche Fortbildung,1995 Dec,Germany,1995,90

In order to explore the sometimes subtle influence of racial determinants in decisions about resource allocation, we present the case of a 53-year-old Australian Aboriginal woman with end-stage renal failure. The epidemiology of renal failure in the Australian Aboriginal population and amongst other indigenous peoples is discussed. We show that the use of utilitarian outcome criteria for resource allocation may embody subtle racial discrimination where consideration is not given to issues of justice, race, culture and gender. It is only where the processes by which resources are allocated are transparent, clearly defined and based upon consultation with individual patients that issues and justice are likely to be adequately addressed.",Journal of medical ethics,1995 Dec,England,1995,90
8746967,Psychosocial determinants of fruit and vegetable consumption.,"Psychosocial correlates of fruit and vegetable consumption were studied in an adult Dutch population (n = 367) based on the ASE model of attitudes, social influence and self-efficacy. Attitudes were a summation of beliefs about taste, different health consequences, and costs in time and money. Social influences were measured through the social stimulation respondents expected to get from important others to consume adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables and by asking the subjects about the behaviour of important others. Self-efficacy reflected the respondents' ability to consume adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables in various situations. Self-efficacy and attitudes were consistently and significantly associated with consumption of boiled or otherwise heated vegetables, of salads, and of fruit. Furthermore, respondents reporting low consumption of these food groups had lower self-efficacy expectations and less positive attitudes than subjects with relatively high consumption of fruit and vegetables. It is concluded that nutrition education aimed at stimulating fruit and vegetable consumption should focus especially on changing attitudes and self efficacy expectations.",Appetite,1995 Dec,England,1995,90
8681517,Predictors of fixed orthodontic treatment in 15-year-old adolescents in South Australia.,"An understanding of the determinants of the provision of fixed orthodontic treatment would be beneficial in the planning of any system aimed at rationalising supply. The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine those factors which were predictive of the provision of fixed orthodontic treatment in adolescents. Baseline data, at age 13 years, on oral health, the history of orthodontic consultation and interceptive orthodontic care, a dental appearance score (DAI), socio-demographic characteristics and self and parental perceptions of both dental appearance and need for fixed orthodontic treatment were obtained from 2793 adolescents under the care of the South Australian School Dental Service who had not undergone fixed orthodontic treatment. Data on the orthodontic care provided to these adolescents in the ensuing 2 years were collected. At the end of the 24-month period 433 adolescents (15.5%) had undergone fixed orthodontic treatment. Significant bivariate associations were found between the provision of fixed orthodontic treatment and the DAI score, sex of the adolescent, familial history of fixed orthodontic treatment, income, private insurance, orthodontic consultation and interceptive orthodontic care before the age of 13 years and self and parental perceptions of both dental appearance and the need for fixed orthodontic treatment. Logistic regression was used to produce a predictive model of fixed orthodontic treatment. The model explained 30.2% of the variance, with a specificity of 0.94, a sensitivity of 0.49 and a hit rate of 0.84%. Odds ratios greater than one were found for the DAI score, private insurance, females, self and parental perception of need, higher incomes and orthodontic consultation and interceptive orthodontic care before the age of 13 years.",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,1995 Dec,Denmark,1995,90
8666100,Respiratory symptoms in elderly Chinese living in Hong Kong.,"Respiratory diseases can cause considerable disability in the elderly because of their limited respiratory reserve as a result of ageing. We have investigated the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and diseases in elderly Chinese in Hong Kong and compared these data with those in elderly Caucasian populations. Two thousand and thirty two (999 male and 1,033 female) subjects, selected by age-stratified random sampling from a register of Hong Kong residents aged 70 yrs and over were interviewed to complete a respiratory questionnaire. Total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) was measured in 195 subjects. At least one respiratory symptom was reported by 56% of subjects. The most frequently reported symptoms were morning phlegm (26%), chronic cough with phlegm (10%) and wheeze in the past 12 months (8%). Of the self-reported diseases, the commonest was chronic bronchitis (7%), followed by asthma (5%), pulmonary tuberculosis (3%) and emphysema (2%). Of the 218 subjects with obstructive airway diseases, 128 (59%) had sought medical advice in the past 12 months. The most important determinants for respiratory symptoms and diseases were smoking and social class. Total serum IgE was significantly higher in current smokers than nonsmokers and also in those with chronic cough and phlegm than those without these complaints. Our study shows that respiratory ailments in Hong Kong elderly are as common as those reported in Sweden and the USA but less than those in England.",The European respiratory journal,1995 Dec,England,1995,90
8596101,Interpreting the new illness question in the UK census for health research on small areas.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to identify the various factors that seem to influence the average response to the new census question on limiting, long standing illness at the small area level, to assess the extent to which the new questions adds to information already available in the census and elsewhere, and to discuss how useful the data are likely to be for those planning health and social services. DESIGN: This was a cross sectional analysis of the relationship between rates of limiting, long standing illness (standardised for age and sex) and a large number of indicators of health and socioeconomic status at the small area level. SETTING: The study used data relating to 4985 small areas covering the whole of England. The average population was about 10 000. PARTICIPANTS: The 1991 census of population was addressed to the entire population of England. MAIN RESULTS: There are wide variations in the levels of self reported long standing illness between small areas, 70% of which are explained by demographic factors. Variation in age/sex standardised responses to the new census question at the small area level can largely be explained by census data on self reported disability among those of working age, standardised mortality ratio, and by indicators of socioeconomic circumstances relating to social class, ethnicity, and the elderly living alone. These does not seem to be a significant reporting bias due to underemployment. CONCLUSION: Unlike the disability question in the census, the standardised, self reported long standing limiting illness ratio covers the entire population and it is not skewed towards men. Although the variable is a synthesis of the health and social determinants of perceived morbidity, it does not provide much information that was not already available. In addition, it is available every 10 years only and thus may be rather inaccurate as an indicator of relative need towards the end of the decade. Moreover, in future censuses, individuals' answers might be influenced by the knowledge that their responses will affect the volume of resources allocated to the area in which they live.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1995 Dec,England,1995,90
8556886,Parents' attributions for their children's behavior.,"Parents' attributions for children's behavior are of interest both as a form of adult social cognition and as possible contributors to children's development. This article reviews work on the determinants and the effects of parents' attributions. Included in the discussion of possible determinants are characteristics of the target (e.g., age and sex), characteristics of the judge (e.g., mothers vs. fathers), and characteristics of the behavior to be explained (e.g., positive or negative). Included in the discussion of possible effects are effects on parents' affect and behavior and on children's development. The evidence suggests that parents do form attributions for their children's behavior and that these attributions vary in predictable (although not perfectly consistent) ways across judges, targets, and outcomes. The evidence also suggests, although less certainly, that attributions affect both parents' behavior and children's development. The review concludes with suggestions for future research.",Child development,1995 Dec,United States,1995,90

Potential determinants of parenting practices were also addressed, including maternal age, marital status, education level, number of children living at home, and family socioeconomic status. Less positive parenting practices concerning nuturing and discipline were found among mothers who were younger, had more than one child living at home, were single, had a lower income level, and had lower educational attainment. These mothers also tended to perceive their children as demonstrating more difficult behavior problems. However, the negative influence of some determinants of parenting practices, such as low income, was found to be moderated by the presence of other determinants, such as more education. The present results provide evidence that multiple determinants influence parenting practices among parents of young children.",The Journal of genetic psychology,1995 Dec,United States,1995,90
8543297,Proximate determinants of fertility in eastern Uttar Pradesh.,"Our main objective here is to examine and discuss the effects of some sociocultural and economic factors on the proximate determinants of fertility in rural areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh (population more than 40 million persons). The region is known for its present demographic trends because the crude birth, death, and infant mortality rates are among the highest for India. The determinants considered are age at marriage of female, postpartum amenorrhea (PPA), fecundability and sterility, and menopause. The sociocultural and economic factors studied are caste, education, breast-feeding status, and social status of the currently married females in the reproductive age group. The study population is predominantly Hindu, among whom caste is a strong indicator of socioeconomic conditions. The average age of the female at return marriage (RM) is below 18 years in each religion or caste group but has been increasing over time. Median durations of breast feeding and PPA differ significantly among various socioeconomic and demographic subgroups. These are longest in scheduled castes and shortest in upper-caste Hindus. As the social status of the household increases, the median durations of breast feeding and PPA decrease. The estimates of fecundability consistently decrease with age, whereas those of sterility increase with age after 35 years. The smallest estimate of sterility is 4%, corresponding to the 25-30-year age group in each religion or caste group. Occurrence of menopause is rare before age 35, and it increases with the age of the female irrespective of religion or caste. However, the risk is minimum for females in upper castes and maximum for those in scheduled castes.",Human biology,1995 Dec,United States,1995,90

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A community survey involving a representative nationwide sample of 2011 French men aged between 50 and 80 years was performed and information collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Visiting a doctor for urinary symptoms was associated with the perceived bothersomeness of urinary symptoms, in addition to and independently of the level of symptom severity. It was also associated with higher socio-economic class. Many partners of men with urinary symptoms were unaware of their condition. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the importance of including the perception of bother associated with urinary symptoms in addition to urinary severity and provides information useful for inclusion in education programmes on urinary symptoms.",British journal of urology,1995 Dec,England,1995,90

7503131,Perspectives of public health and prevention.,"The average life expectancy at birth of Americans has increased 30 years since the turn of the century and is mostly attributable to public health measures. Although death rates for cardiovascular diseases have declined in the past two decades, cardiovascular diseases still cause more deaths in the United States than all other causes combined. The major etiologies of heart disease, atherosclerosis and hypertension, are associated with modifiable risk factors--high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diet, and inactivity. Social status and access to medical care are also important contributors. Consequently, the greatest potential for reducing heart disease mortality and morbidity rests with prevention and public health practice. Recent directions in health-care reform emphasize fiscal management, medical care, and clinical medicine, and not general health. This emphasis exacerbates policy and financing imbalances between preventive and curative medicine. Consequently, the concept of a health system needs to be designed more rationally to allocate resources that include prevention and health promotion. The Bogalusa Heart Study provides understanding of the early origin of cardiovascular problems and the environmental and lifestyle factors that contribute to development of adult heart disease. To apply this information, public health models of intervention, like the school Health Ahead/Heart Smart program, are needed to address heart disease in the population. Changes in the true determinants of poor health, such as environmental factors and unhealthy behaviors, are the directions for prevention and future improvement in quality of life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",The American journal of the medical sciences,1995 Dec,United States,1995,90

Low-income urban women from Brazil (n = 446, 2 maternity wards), Honduras (n = 1582, 3 maternity wards) and Mexico (n = 765, 3 maternity wards) were interviewed at birth and in their homes at 1 mo and 2-4 mo after delivery. Multivariate survival analyses (Cox model) indicated that planned duration of EBF (all 3 countries), having a female infant, and not being employed (Brazil and Honduras), lower socioeconomic status (Honduras and Mexico) and higher birth weight (control hospital in Brazil and Honduras) were positively associated (P < or = 0.10) with EBF. Women who delivered in the maternity wards that had more developed breast-feeding promotion programs were more successful with EBF. The association between maternal education and EBF was modified by the maternity ward in Mexico and Honduras. Being > or = 18 y and having a partner living (Brazil) or not (Mexico) living at home were positively associated with EBF. These findings can contribute toward the design of EBF promotion efforts in Latin America.",The Journal of nutrition,1995 Dec,United States,1995,90
7485065,Epidemiology of preterm delivery in two birth cohorts with an interval of 20 years.,"The occurrence and determinants of preterm delivery were studied in two population-based birth cohorts from northern Finland. In the first cohort of 1966 there were 11,475 singleton deliveries and in the later cohort of 1985-1986, 8,888. The overall incidence (percentage) of preterm deliveries fell from 9.1 to 4.8, including a reduction from 8.8 to 3.4 for spontaneous preterm deliveries. For iatrogenic ones, however, there was an increase from 0.3 to 1.4. The relative risks, associated with such known maternal determinants as unmarried status, smoking, low educational level, age over 34 years, unwantedness of the pregnancy, and poor earlier obstetric history, had about the same level in these two series. However, despite a favorable change in the distribution of most of these determinants over the 20 years, only a small part of the decrease of the total incidence of preterm delivery could be attributed to these changes, as a consistent and substantial reduction occurred in the incidence of spontaneous preterm birth in all categories of each single determinant. The increase in the proportion of iatrogenic preterm deliveries was accompanied by these being more common at lower than at higher socioeconomic levels in 1985-1986, whereas the social gradient appeared to be reversed in 1966.",American journal of epidemiology,1995 Dec 1,United States,1995,90
10154361,The determinants of infant and child mortality in Tanzania.,"This paper investigates the determinants of infant and child mortality in Tanzania using the 1991/92 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey. A hazards model is used to assess the relative effect of the variables hypothesized to influence under-five mortality. Short birth intervals, teenage pregnancies and previous child deaths are associated with increased risk of death. The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania should therefore maintain its commitment to encouraging women to space their births at least two years apart and delay childbearing beyond the teenage years. Further, this study shows that there is a remarkable lack of infant and child mortality differentials by socioeconomic subgroups of the population, which may reflect post-independence health policy and development strategies. Whilst lack of socioeconomic differentials can be considered an achievement of government policies, mortality remains high so there is still a long way to go before Tanzania achieves its stated goal of 'Health for All'.",Health policy and planning,1995 Dec,England,1995,90
12320114,Marital status and earnings in developed countries.,"""When estimating earnings equations for men in the United States, a dichotomous variable for whether or not the man is currently married is often included as a regressor. The coefficient estimate for this variable is most usually large and significant. However, there is rarely much discussion of the marriage effect. This effect is central to this study, which contributes to the understanding of this statistical association in two ways. First, it shows that the relationship exists in almost all of the fourteen developed countries examined and across several different time periods. Controlling for age, and, when available, education, race/ethnicity, hours worked, and location, marriage differences in annual earnings in favor of currently married males range from 0% to 30%. Second, it finds that there are important differences between those who are separated, divorced, widowed, and never married.""",Journal of population economics,1995 Nov,Germany,1995,90

Variations in the labour market assimilation of immigrants according to their gender and country of origin are also analysed. The results suggest that recent immigrant cohorts have had more difficulty being assimilated into the Canadian labour market than earlier ones, an apparent consequence of recent changes in Canadian immigration policy, labour market discrimination against visible minorities, and the prolonged recession of the early 1980s.""

8784533,"[From disease to health: the individual, society, environment and culture].","With the onset of science-based medicine in the mid-19th century, environmental factors were almost totally discarded as health determinants. This was a complete rupture with the medical thinking which had prevailed since the time of Hippocrates. Yet, for the vast majority of mankind, harmony with environmental reality remains the most important determinant of good or ill health. This scission explains to a great extent the differences between traditional and Western medicine, which are based on entirely different concepts and on distinct paradigms. Environment as a health determinant--in its broadest definition to include both physical and social environments--is again being considered of importance as a result of better understanding of causality factors, and because of the influence of disciplines such as ecology and epidemiology. Here we show that human societies can develop different methods of adjusting to their environments, some of which would increase the risks of disease and others which can be considered as resistance factors of a social nature. Societies and individuals alike are not equal in relation to health risks.","Sante (Montrouge, France)",1995 Nov-Dec,France,1995,90

The observational nature of epidemiological research rends difficult the proving of these relationships. Related to this, different models and causal criteria have been proposed in order to explain health and disease determinants, from pure determinism in Koch postulates, accepting unicausal explanation for diseases, to more realistic multicausal models. In occupational health it is necessary to formulate causal models and criteria to assess causality, and frequently causal assessment in this field has important social, economic and juridical relevance. This paper deal with evaluation of causal relationships in epidemiology and this evaluation is illustrated with a recent example of an occupational health problem in our milieu: the Ardystil case.",Gaceta sanitaria,1995 Nov-Dec,Spain,1995,90

Planning status is associated with the level of developmental resources the child receives at home: At ages one and older, mistimed and unwanted children score significantly lower on a scale measuring opportunity for skill development and on a scale measuring nonauthoritarian parenting style than their wanted peers; by preschool age, they also have significantly less-positive relationships with their mothers. Measures of the direct effects of planning status on development also indicate that mistimed and unwanted children are at a disadvantage: Those younger than two have higher mean scores for fearfulness than wanted infants and lower scores for positive affect; unintended preschoolers score lower on a measure of receptive vocabulary.",Family planning perspectives,1995 Nov-Dec,United States,1995,90

Information from 488 employees, recruited from two worksites, was obtained. From these employees the determinants of participation were studied. METHODS: A questionnaire based on two theoretical models was used. The Stages of Change model was used to measure the health behavior, consisting of precontemplation (no intention to participate), contemplation (considering participation), preparation (intending to participate within a short period), and action (participating in fitness). The possible determinants were measured according to the ASE model, including the attitude toward an employee fitness program, social influence, and self-efficacy expectations. RESULTS: Subjects in action stage were most convinced of the benefits of participation in the employee fitness program and of their own skills to participate in a fitness program. Subjects in precontemplation stage were least convinced of the advantages of participation and had the lowest self-efficacy scores. Subjects in action stage experienced the most social support to participate in the employee fitness program. CONCLUSIONS: Health education for employees within industrial fitness programs can be tailored toward their motivational stage. Promotional activities for industrial fitness programs should concentrate on persons in the precontemplation and contemplation stages, since people in these stages are insufficiently convinced of the advantages of a fitness program and expect many problems with regard to their ability to participate in the program.",Preventive medicine,1995 Nov,United States,1995,90
8582823,Life after a cardiac event: women's experience in healing.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of women's recovery after an acute cardiac event. DESIGN: Grounded theory provided the methodologic basis for qualitative data generation and analysis. SAMPLE: Thirteen women who had experienced an acute cardiac event. The participants' ages ranged from 42 to 78 with a mean age of 58 years. Four participants attended the group sessions after experiencing an acute myocardial infarction; five had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting; and two had undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Two participants had undergone exercise testing that indicated myocardial ischemia. The time after the cardiac event ranged from 8 weeks to 3 years at the initiation of the study, with a mean time after the cardiac event of 8 months. RESULTS: Healing, the basic social process identified from the data, explained women's struggle through the uncertainty surrounding the cardiac event as a way of creating new and positive health patterns. The process of healing consisted of three stages: surviving, originating, and patterning balance. These stages of healing illustrated determinants of individual motivation that guided the initiation and maintenance of risk factor modification efforts in women after the cardiac event. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study provide a basis for the development and evaluation of comprehensive rehabilitative interventions designed to enhance individual recovery after a cardiac event.",Heart & lung : the journal of critical care,1995 Nov-Dec,United States,1995,90

A sample of 68 adults aged 20 to 40 years participated in the study. Each respondent was shown a picture of the campaign. They then filled in a short questionnaire. The main objectives of the study were to measure recall rates and to assess attitude of the subjects. The study results show that recall rates were high (78%), 68% of respondents claimed that the campaign is likely to change their attitudes towards population control, and 87% of participants perceived the main idea of the campaign correctly. The study findings show that there are some significant associations between demographic variables (marital status, having child or not) and perception of the campaign. These may lead health educators and health promoters to communicate more effectively and efficiently in the context of family planning. In countries with a large number of young people, health education campaigns on population control with respect to social values of each society and moral considerations are recommended.",Public health,1995 Nov,Netherlands,1995,90
8563660,CAMCOG--a concise neuropsychological test to assist dementia diagnosis: socio-demographic determinants in an elderly population sample.,"The CAMCOG, which forms part of the CAMDEX interview (Roth et al., 1986, 1988), is a brief neuropsychological battery designed to assess the range of cognitive functions required for a diagnosis of dementia, and to detect mild degrees of cognitive impairment. It was administered to a population sample of 418 elderly people (aged 77 and above) in their place of residence. The data show that in contrast to the Mini-Mental State Examination, total CAMCOG scores are well distributed and there is no ceiling effect. Examination of the association between CAMCOG scores and socio-demographic variables (age, sex, education and social class) shows that each exerts a significant, and independent, effect upon performance. CAMCOG also includes a number of subscale which assess individual areas of cognitive function. Of the eight major subscales (orientation, language, memory, attention, praxis, calculation, abstract thinking, perception), age was significantly related to all but attention; sex with attention, praxis, calculation and perception; education with language and abstract thinking; and social class with language and perception. In all these analyses, the results were adjusted for the effects of the other socio-demographic variables using analysis of variance. However, education and social class are highly correlated variables and when the association with education is examined without adjusting for social class, attention and praxis are also found to be significantly related to education. Caution must therefore be taken when using the CAMCOG (or any other cognitive test) as a screening test for dementia, using a single, predetermined cutpoint. In general, the combination of brevity and breadth of the CAMCOG, along with its distributional properties, makes it an attractive neuropsychological test for use in the community or the clinic.",The British journal of clinical psychology,1995 Nov,England,1995,90

Results of this paper suggest that the standard aggregate QALY index imposes an ethical position on policy makers which may promote inequality in well-being associated with health. It is possible to rectify this problem in theory, but current data are insufficient to estimate such corrected indices. A QALY-based index, constructed using the best available data, indicates morbidity has a significant effect on Canadian health status (e.g. life expectancy figures alone overstate community health by about 10%), that the impact of morbidity is unequal across regions and gender, and that role (the ability to fulfil social functions) and mobility dysfunction are important determinants of ill-health in this population.",Social science & medicine (1982),1995 Nov,England,1995,90

The women were also asked about their knowledge of contraception methods, including postcoital contraception. METHODS: We interviewed 200 women applying for a legal abortion within the first trimester of pregnancy about contraception, the contraceptive methods used, and the possible reasons for failure of contraception. RESULTS: Of all the women interviewed, 93% claimed to have adequate knowledge of contraception. At the time of conception 11.5% used safe methods (OCs 8%, IUDs 3.5%), 63% used less safe methods, and 26% were without contraception. Only 25% of the pill users had no explanation for the failure. 76.7% of the condom users reported that the condom was broken, had slipped off or its use had been irregular. The concern about side effects was the most common reason for not using safe contraceptives (25%). CONCLUSIONS: The women claimed to have enough information about contraceptives, and postcoital contraception was also familiar, but the knowledge on how to use them in practice was inadequate. Irregular use and breaks in contraception were common. Despite the data based on Pearl indices, pills failed twice as often as IUDs. Counseling about the proper use of contraceptives is important, although the concern about the side effects appeared to be a big, unsolved problem.",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,1995 Nov,United States,1995,90
7583817,Transitions in functional status and active life expectancy among older people in Japan.,"This study analyzes the patterns and determinants of the transitions in functional status among elderly Japanese persons. Data for this research came from a two-wave national probability sample survey of persons aged 60 and over conducted between 1987 and 1990 in Japan. The study focuses on the transitions from two states of origin, ""not disable"" and ""disabled,"" to three states of destination, ""not disabled,"" ""disabled,"" and ""dead."" Through multinomial logit analyses, the effects of sociodemographic factors, social relationships, health, and health behavior on transitions in functional status were examined. To assess the impact of panel attrition, the risk of nonresponse was analyzed in conjunction with health transition within the same framework. Finally, an increment-decrement active life table for Japanese elderly people was derived on the basis of the multivariate analyses. According to the life table, a Japanese older person at age 60 is expected to spend about 18.7 years (81%) in functional independence and about 4.4 years (19%) in disability throughout his or her remaining lifetime.","The journals of gerontology.

METHODS: We analyzed information from 291 women (median age 33 years, range 17-69) observed for the first time with a single smear test showing mild dyskaryosis. All subjects underwent colposcopy, and histologic confirmation was obtained by biopsy. We compared the characteristics of women who had CIN I or no evidence of CIN with those of women with CIN II or III at biopsy. RESULTS: Twenty-eight women (10%) had CIN I at biopsy, 46 (15%) CIN II, and 23 (8%) CIN III. The frequency of CIN II or III tended to decrease with increasing education; compared with women reporting 11 or fewer years of education, the multivariate odds ratios (OR) of CIN II or III lesions was 0.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-0.9) in those reporting 11 years of education or more. Compared with nulliparas, the OR of CIN II or III was 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-3.5) for parous women. Furthermore, compared with never-smokers, the OR of CIN II or III was 2.3 (95% CI 1.0-5.4) for current smokers. Ex-smokers were at increased risk, too; the estimated multivariate OR was 3.8 (95% CI 1.9-7.6). Compared with women reporting one sexual partner, the multivariate ORs of CIN II or III were 1.4 and 2.3 for women reporting two to three or four or more sexual partners, respectively (chi 2(1) trend = 6.65, P < .05). CONCLUSION: Our results show that smoking is a risk indicator of CIN II or III in women with a single smear showing mild dyskaryosis.

7487339,Differential heritability of adult and juvenile antisocial traits.,"BACKGROUND: Studies of adult antisocial behavior or criminality usually find genetic factors to be more important than the family environment, whereas studies of delinquency find the family environment to be more important. We compared DSM-III-R antisocial personality disorder symptoms before vs after the age of 15 years within a sample of twins, rather than comparing across studies. METHODS: We administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version III-revised by telephone to 3226 pairs of male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Biometrical modeling was applied to each symptom of antisocial personality disorder and summary measures of juvenile and adult symptoms. RESULTS: Five juvenile symptoms were significantly heritable, and five were significantly influenced by the shared environment. Eight adult symptoms were significantly heritable, and one was significantly influenced by the shared environment. The shared environment explained about six times more variance in juvenile anti-social traits than in adult traits. Shared environmental influences on adult antisocial traits overlapped entirely with those on juvenile traits. Additive genetic factors explained about six times more variance in adult vs juvenile traits. The juvenile genetic determinants overlapped completely with genetic influences on adult traits. The unique environment (plus measurement error) explained the largest proportion of variance in both juvenile and adult antisocial traits. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics of the shared or family environment that promote antisocial behavior during childhood and early adolescence also promote later antisocial behavior, but to a much lesser extent. Genetic causal factors are much more prominent for adult than for juvenile antisocial traits.",Archives of general psychiatry,1995 Nov,United States,1995,90
7475433,"Oral health, health, and health-related quality of life.","Health-related quality of life is a multidimensional concept with five broad domains: opportunity/resilience, health perception, functional states, impairments/diseases, and duration of life. It addresses the tradeoff between how long and how well people live. The health-related quality of life approach has provided greater opportunity for investigation of the interrelations among oral health, health, and related outcomes. The inclusion of patient-driven measures, such as perceptions and functional status, is critical. Oral health-related quality of life measures are being developed and used in research on aging populations. Clinical measures of oral health, perceptions of general and oral well-being, and reported physical, social, and psychological functioning are independent, but correlated, components of overall oral health-related quality of life. An oral health-related quality of life approach benefits 1) clinical practitioners in selecting treatments and monitoring patient outcomes; 2) researchers in identifying determinants of health, tracking levels of health risk factors, and determining use of services in populations; and 3) policy-makers establishing program and institutional priorities, policies, and funding decisions. This overview indicates substantial value in pursuing several recommendations. A theoretical framework from which concepts, measures, and models can be derived must be developed to address oral health, oral health-related quality of life, health, and health-related quality of life. Oral health outcomes or states must be identified and classified along some continuum of impairment, function, disability, and opportunity.

In a strictly rational and disinterested world, CPGs would be assessed on the basis of the supporting evidence and applicability to practice. However, factors that have more to do with medical sociology play a key role in CPG acceptance and, in some cases, development. The entire concept of CPGs entails troubling paradoxes, many of which turn on the distinction between scientific evidence and the sociologic determinants of validation and implementation. At the root of the question of organizational roles is the issue of values: Whose values should be at the table? What values are legitimate? From what perspectives should the utility of a procedure or technology be addressed? The Canadian health care system is a largely public creature, and CPG development is part of the public policy process. In this context, decisions about organizational roles must be sensitive to conflict of interest and a diversity of values. A provisional model for participation in CPG processes would minimize the role of organizations per se, although individual participants would no doubt reflect the legitimate interests of their affiliations without representing them formally.",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,1995 Oct 15,Canada,1995,90

Specifically, the analysis compares core and periphery retirees on sociodemographic characteristics, work characteristics, income characteristics and pension arrangements. Models are then estimated to ascertain what factors influence the retirement incomes for those retirees who previously worked in the core or periphery of the economy. The findings suggest that Canadian pension policy has served to exacerbate the already precarious economic position of retired women, a known outcome of their unstable labour force histories and family responsibilities.

Participants (n = 557) were recruited from drug-free long-term treatment centres, a storefront agency and a syringe exchange bus. HIV seroprevalence was lowest (3.9%) at the treatment centres, and highest among IDUs at the storefront agency (20.7%). In logistic regression, independent risk factors for HIV infection were duration of injecting drug use, borrowing syringes in prison, sex with HIV-positive partners, and prostitution. Syringe sharing in prison was the most important independent determinant of HIV infection among all three subpopulations of IDUs. Participants entering long-term treatment were most likely, and IDUs at the syringe exchange bus were least likely to have borrowed and passed on syringes in the previous 6 months. In logistic regression, site of recruitment was independently associated with recent borrowing of syringes, but not with condom use. Injection of drugs other than heroin only, and injecting in prisons, were also independent predictors of recent borrowing. The results indicate that IDUs entering treatment form an important target group for health education. There is a need for AIDS prevention measures in prisons. The comparatively low levels of recent injection risk behaviour among IDUs at the syringe exchange bus suggest that this type of intervention may be effective in harm reduction.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1995 Oct,England,1995,90
8556442,Are adolescents who report prior sexual abuse at higher risk for pregnancy?,"Adolescents who report prior sexual abuse are at increased risk for adolescent pregnancy. This may result from earlier, more frequent, less well-protected sexual activity or from a greater desire to conceive. To determine the relative contribution of these two possible explanations to the reported association between sexual abuse and adolescent pregnancy, we studied the reproductive and sexual histories of 200 sexually active 13-18 year old females in relation to self-reported sexual abuse. Anonymous questionnaires revealed that 40 (20%) of the 200 subjects reported sexual abuse. Analyses revealed no group differences in the median age of first voluntary intercourse, the frequency of sexual intercourse, or the consistency of birth control use. Compared to their nonabused peers, however, teenagers reporting abuse were more likely to be trying to conceive (35% vs. 14% p < .01), to have boyfriends pressuring them to conceive (76% vs. 44% p < .01), and to have fears about infertility (38% vs. 16% p < .01). Our findings suggest that childhood sexual abuse may increase the risk of adolescent pregnancy by fostering the desire to conceive. Further study is needed to determine why a disproportionate number of sexually abused adolescents desire pregnancy. The efficacy of adolescent pregnancy prevention programs may be improved by identifying previously abused adolescents and by designing educational interventions that specifically address their desire to conceive.",Child abuse & neglect,1995 Oct,England,1995,90

Data were collected through a questionnaire mailed to 1990 randomly selected geriatric nurses. A participation rate of 77.6% was achieved. T-test, variance analysis and multiple regression analysis were conducted. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that 49% of the variance was explained by the study variables. Hardiness and work stressors were the most important predictors of burnout. The findings are discussed in relation to Kobasa's framework, focusing on resources that reduce negative effects of geriatric work stressors. Implications for nursing practice, management, education and research are proposed.",International journal of nursing studies,1995 Oct,England,1995,90
7676073,Healing determinants in older people with leg ulcers.,"A descriptive correlational design was used to identify the physiologic, therapeutic, and psychosocial determinants of leg ulcer healing in community-residing older people with venous and venous-arterial disease (N = 156). A regression model with healing rate as the dependent variable explained 49% of the variance. Increased pain when mobilizing, increased hours with limbs horizontal to the torso, and moderate and severe liposclerosis (hardening and induration of the skin) were associated with poorer healing rates. Higher wound status scores were associated with more rapid healing rates. Self-efficacy beliefs and social support were not significant factors. The findings suggest the need for early detection and management of limb pain that interferes with normal mobility. Limb position and edema assessment prior to the application of compression bandages is recommended, with bandages that provide clients with high compression when ambulant and low compression when resting being potentially beneficial.",Research in nursing & health,1995 Oct,United States,1995,90
7593054,Childbearing motivation and its measurement.,"This paper conceptualises the motive force behind human childbearing as originating in two broad traits which have biological bases, are shaped by experiences during early life and are expressed through their effect on desires and intentions. An instrument for measuring childbearing motivation, the Childbearing Questionnaire (CBQ), is presented. Using a sample of 401 married couples two main scales, nine subscales, and several independent items are described. Evidence for the reliability and validity of this instrument is presented. The versatility of the CBQ as a research instrument and the usefulness of the conceptualisation from which it is derived as a way of integrating social, behavioural, and biological science approaches to childbearing motivation are discussed.",Journal of biosocial science,1995 Oct,England,1995,90

7555215,Community level factors and child maltreatment rates.,"Using census and administrative agency data for 177 urban census tracts, variation in rates of officially reported child maltreatment is found to be related to structural determinants of community social organization: economic and family resources, residential instability, household and age structure, and geographic proximity of neighborhoods to concentrated poverty. Furthermore, child maltreatment rates are found to be intercorrelated with other indicators of the breakdown of community social control and organization. These other indicators are similarly affected by the structural dimensions of neighborhood context. Children who live in neighborhoods that are characterized by poverty, excessive numbers of children per adult resident, populations turnover, and the concentration of female-headed families are at highest risk of maltreatment. This analysis suggests that child maltreatment is but one manifestation of community social organization and that its occurrence is related to some of the same underlying macro-social conditions that foster other urban problems.",Child development,1995 Oct,United States,1995,90
7548664,[Consensus process in the field of health inequalities. The Delphi technique].,"OBJECTIVE: An approach to finding the determinants of the risk of health inequality among foreign immigrants living in the city of Barcelona. DESIGN: A descriptive study done by interviewing a group of key informers, using the Delphi technique. SETTING: Barcelona city Health Region. PARTICIPANTS: 20 professionals from different sectors and levels of care were selected because of the relationship of their work area to the immigrant population. Primary Care, specialist, hospital, Family Planning and Public Health professionals took part from the health field; Primary Care, planning and non-governmental organisations from the social field. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A series of mailed questionnaires were used to elicit the participants' opinions and perceptions of the determinants of foreign immigrants' health inequalities. The final reply figure was 90%. Of the overall points granted to the agreed situations, 52.4% concerned aspects relating to their general living situation, 25.1% to health care and 22.4% to socio-cultural questions. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that, in addition to the health-care field, general living situation and socio-cultural questions play a fundamental part in determining foreign immigrants' health inequalities. We considered that the Delphi was a useful and rapid technique for obtaining qualitative information on the determinants of health inequalities and that it permitted us to contribute information which was complementary to other studies of inequalities which used classical health indicators.",Atencion primaria,1995 Sep 15,Spain,1995,90

12291788,Immigration impacts on internal migration of the poor: 1990 census evidence for U.S. states.,"""This article presents newly-available migration data from the 1990 U.S. census to assess immigration and internal migration components as they affect state poverty populations. New immigrant waves are heavily focused on only a few 'port-of-entry' states. It is suggested that these immigrants have begun to impact upon internal migration into and out of these 'high immigration states', and have also altered the national system of internal migration patterns. This article addresses three questions: How do the magnitudes of poverty population out-migration from high immigration states compare with those of other states? Is this out-migration selective on particular social and demographic groups? Is immigration a significant determinant of internal migration of the poor population? The results of this analysis are consistent with the view that recent, focused immigration is associated with out-migration among a state's poor longer-term residents.""",International journal of population geography : IJPG,1995 Sep,England,1995,90

9522857,Knowledge about AIDS and follow-up compliance in patients attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic in the highlands of Papua New Guinea.,"In a survey of 300 consecutive new attenders at the Porgera Health Centre Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic information was obtained regarding knowledge about AIDS from male and female attenders. The differences between the sexes regarding a variety of socioeconomic variables, knowledge about AIDS and their compliance to follow-up appointments were studied as well as possible relationships between these social variables and the degrees of AIDS knowledge and compliance. Males tended to originate from further afield, be more educated, be either in salaried employment or not working at all, and be single as compared to females. They also admitted to more extramarital sexual contacts and received more adequate treatment. Knowledge about AIDS was also significantly higher amongst male attenders and in this group was correlated strongly with overall educational attainment and employment status but did not show any relationship with the number of extramarital contacts admitted to. Only 9% of the patients knew about condoms and their role in prevention. Follow-up compliance was generally poor, and not significantly higher in those with higher scores of knowledge about AIDS, but showed a relationship with the type of disease being treated and with the ultimate adequacy of treatment received.",Papua and New Guinea medical journal,1995 Sep,Papua New Guinea,1995,90
8744995,Determinants of variability among nations in child growth.,"This cross-national study aimed at understanding variability in growth among nations and its determinants. It examined the variability of growth among nations, the factors most important for explaining this variability, how these factors jointly determine growth, and the consistency of the patterns and relationships. A conceptual model was adapted from U. Jonsson. National data on height and weight of children, sex, ethnicity, and 15 social, economic, health, education, and political factors were combined from three secondary sources. A sequence of multiple linear regression models was used with three age groups: 1-2, 3-5, and 6-10 years. Substantial variability in growth among nations was seen in comparison to that within nations. Regression models with sex, ethnicity, food security, maternal and child care, and health services and environment explained a large percentage of this variability. Institutions, politics/ideology, economic structure, and potential resources contributed little additionally to the models. Ethnic differences among nations were observed and persisted even when models controlled for other factors, but should not necessarily be interpreted as genetic differences. Determinants for height, weight, and weight adjusted for height were somewhat different. Adjustment for only previous growth and sex explained about 90% of variability in growth, supporting the assumption that growth patterns are generally established early in life. As policy decisions and programmes addressing mild-to-moderate malnutrition are increasingly considered, the implications of cross-national variability in growth may assume greater importance. Future work should examine simultaneously the effects of national, community, family, and individual characteristics on growth using data from individuals in a number of nations.",Annals of human biology,1995 Sep-Oct,England,1995,90
8602490,Who is a successful quitter? One-year follow-up of a National Tobacco Quit and Win Contest in Sweden.,"The first nation-wide Quit and Win Contest in Sweden was held in 1988 with 12,840 participants. This corresponds to a participant rate of 6.4 per 1,000 daily tobacco users in Sweden. In order to follow up the long-term effects of cessation and to analyse the determinants for successful cessation, a panel (n = 946) of randomized participants were followed-up at 6 and 12 months with a mailed questionnaire. This gave a complete set of data for 557 (panel) respondents. Available baseline data from the participants' entry forms included sex, age, occupation, specific tobacco habits, quitting attempts during the previous year, and place of residence. At the 12-month follow-up 21% had been tobacco-free for the whole year. In addition 9% of the participants relapsed into tobacco-use, then quit again and were tobacco-free at the 12-month follow-up. The success rate for those participants (14%) who used smokeless tobacco (oral snuff) was similar to that of smokers. The logistic regression showed a significantly better prognosis for success among those without any earlier quitting attempts during the previous year (OR 2.35), if the subjects participated of their own volition rather than having been recruited by a non-tobacco user (OR 1.74), and if they were married/co-habiting (OR 1.92), the results were also significantly improved. The results also show that as a population-based method, Quit and Win produced many successful tobacco quitters, and one year after the contest one-fifth of the participants were still abstinent.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine,1995 Sep,Sweden,1995,90
8581792,Prevalence and secular trends in obesity in Pacific and Indian Ocean island populations.,"Surveys conducted in 10 Pacific island populations and in the multiethnic populations of Mauritius and Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean have provided data on the prevalence of obesity, potential etiological factors and medical hazards associated with obesity. The results indicate that the prevalence of obesity (by body mass index (BMI) in some of these populations is among the highest in the world. Obesity related to degree of modernization is more common in urban than in rural locations and tends to be found more often in women. In two populations where longitudinal data were available, there were dramatic increases in prevalence over relatively short time periods. Obesity contributed to the risk of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and was associated with other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in all populations, but no relationship could be found with total mortality in three ethnic groups for whom data were available. A genetic susceptibility to obesity combined with social pressures that favor high energy intakes and reduced physical activity are believed to be important in these populations. The challenge for the future lies in developing culturally appropriate programs for preventing obesity and thus reducing associated morbidity, while continuing to research its behavioral and genetic determinants.",Obesity research,1995 Sep,United States,1995,90
8571442,Determinants of induced abortion and their policy implications in four counties in north China.,"A retrospective survey conducted in four counties in North China in 1991-92 shows that the probability of aborting a pregnancy is strongly related to parity. No induced abortions are found prior to the first live birth, and almost universal abortion is shown after the second. Women had a high risk of undergoing abortion after their first live birth because most (82 percent) had become pregnant again without meeting official requirements for late second births with long spacing between births. The likelihood that a pregnancy will be aborted is strongly determined by official family planning policy and regulations. Individual and household socioeconomic status plays a relatively insignificant role. Great variation in the prevalence of induced abortion exists at the county and village levels. In recent years, the incidence of induced abortion has increased among women with one living child. Even a two-child policy, with late childbearing and spacing, can have high social and health costs in a country where childbearing is universal and begins relatively early.",Studies in family planning,1995 Sep-Oct,United States,1995,90
8571153,No real progress towards equity: health of migrants and ethnic minorities on the eve of the year 2000.,"The paper reviews the available evidence on access to health care and two health outcomes, perinatal mortality and accident/disability, for migrant and ethnic minorities in selected receiving industrialized countries. The health of these communities is analyzed using the entitlement approach, which considers health as the product of both the individual's private endowments and the social environment he or she faces. Migrants, especially first and second generations, and ethnic minorities often have reduced entitlements in receiving societies. Not only are they exposed to poor working and living conditions, which are per se determinants of poor health, but they also have reduced access to health care for a number of political, administrative and cultural reasons which are not necessarily present for the native population. The paper argues that the higher rates of perinatal mortality and accidents/disability observed in many migrant groups compared to the native population are linked to their lower entitlements in the receiving societies. Policies aimed at reducing such health gaps need to be accompanied by a more general effort to reduce inequalities and to promote full participation of these groups in the mainstream of society.",Social science & medicine (1982),1995 Sep,England,1995,90

However, the personal values or ""guiding principles"" of generalist physicians have not been identified scientifically. To establish a benchmark, we measured the personal values of exemplary family physicians because they serve as role models for current and future physicians. We also explored the relationship between personal values and practice satisfaction. METHODS: We obtained a list of 330 family physicians nominated for the American Academy of Family Physicians' (AAFP) Family Doctor of the Year award for the years 1988 through 1993. We asked them to complete the Schwartz Values Questionnaire, a 56-item instrument for measuring personal values. They also answered three questions concerning practice satisfaction. RESULTS: The return rate was 83%. The physicians' mean age was 63 years. They had been in practice an average of 34 years, 93% were male, and 52% practiced in rural areas. Honesty was rated as the most important of the 56 values, and social power as the least important. Of the 10 value types (groups of common values), the responding physicians rated ""Benevolence"" as most important and ""Power"" as least important. Practice satisfaction correlated positively with the Benevolence value type (r = .21, P = .001) and negatively with the Power value type (r = -.15, P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Of the 10 value types, Benevolence was rated the most important and Power the least important by exemplary family physicians, and both value types also correlated, positively and negatively, respectively, with their practice satisfaction. These results have implications for the selection, training, and career satisfaction of generalist physicians.",The Journal of family practice,1995 Sep,United States,1995,90
7577560,Cognitive and motivational determinants of academic achievement and behaviour in third and fourth grade disadvantaged children.,"While most studies on the determinants of learning deal with either cognition or motivation, there is a growing awareness that both should be considered. Our purpose was to examine the relative roles of cognitive and motivational factors for the scholastic achievement and behaviour of disadvantaged children. Cognition was conceptualised in terms of the psychosemantic theory that assesses cognitive processes by characteristics of the individual's meaning assignment (Kreitler & Kreitler, 1987a). Motivation was conceptualised in terms of the cognitive orientation (CO) theory which assumes that cognitive contents guide behaviour (Kreitler & Kreitler, 1982). Participants were 57 third and fourth graders of both genders, recommended for a remedial summer programme. They were administered the Meaning Test assessing cognitive abilities; the CO Questionnaire of Motivation for Learning assessing the disposition to learn; and the Metropolitan Achievement Test and the IOWA tests assessing verbal, mathematical and working skills. Teachers completed the Teacher-Child Rating Scale assessing six scholastic behaviours. Regression analyses showed that all dependent variables were predicted by the cognitive and motivational variables, better by specific than global predictors. Cognitive variables contributed more to the predictions, especially of academic achievements, and more in the case of verbal than mathematical abilities. In girls, motivational factors played a larger role than cognitive factors, absolutely and relative to boys. Implications for promoting scholastic achievements are discussed.",The British journal of educational psychology,1995 Sep,England,1995,90
7551771,Determinants of perceived consistency: the relationship between group entitativity and the meaningfulness of categories.,"The concept of entitativity was developed by Campbell (1958) to refer to the extent to which a group is perceived as a coherent whole or entity. This concept is relevant to research in both social perception (e.g. the categorization effects approach to the study of social stereotyping) and social influence (e.g. the consistency attributed to minority groups in theories of minority influence). On the basis of previous research, four variables were expected to play a role in group entitativity judgements. These were intra-group variability, group size, diversity (or variety) and extremity. In two empirical studies it was found that entitativity decreased as variability and diversity increased and that it increased with group size. These effects and interactions between group size and extremity, size and diversity, and variability and extremity are consistent with the idea that entitativity is a function of how meaningful a stimulus pattern is. This is in turn (in part) a function of how unlikely the pattern is.",The British journal of social psychology,1995 Sep,England,1995,90
7499711,Framing the debate: can prenatal care help to reduce the black-white disparity in infant mortality?,"Prenatal care has been identified as necessary to reducing the disparity in infant mortality between black and white infants. The purpose of this paper is to review determinants of the disparity and describe the contribution that prenatal care can make to modifying those determinants, biologic or social. When examined by birthweight categories, 25% of the disparity is due to excess deaths among normal birthweight infants (> or = 2500 g); 13% is due to excess deaths among moderate low birthweight infants (1500-2499g); and 62% of the disparity is due to excess deaths among very low birthweight infants. Normal birthweight black infants have higher rates of death due to infections, injuries, and sudden infant death syndrome. Very low birthweight black infants account for the increasing disparity in infant mortality. Social determinants of the disparity in infant mortality include the effects of poverty and the accompanying problems of limited access to health care services, preventive care, and good nutrition. Prenatal care may reduce the disparity by using both high-risk and population-based prevention strategies. This combination of strategies would identify and treat medically high-risk women before delivery and provide preventive care to all women, regardless of their risk status. Although both strategies have a potential for producing modest reductions, neither has proved to be effective.",Journal of the American Medical Women's Association (1972),1995 Sep-Oct,United States,1995,90

In this study the behavioral determinants of 18 parental safety measures were assessed. To select behavioral determinants, the Attitude-Social influence-Self-efficacy/barriers model was used with the inclusion of variables from the Health Belief Model and the Protection Motivation Theory. A written questionnaire was completed by 1129 Dutch mothers of pre-school children. Most safety measures were explained (rather) well by the same set of determinants. Main determinants for adopting or not adopting a safety measure were the mother's belief in the necessity of the safety measure according to the child's age, her belief about her partner's opinion on the necessity and her belief about the success of taking the measure. Subsequent important determinants were the mother's belief about the inconvenience and instrumentality of the safety measure; the perceived susceptibility had a minor or moderate influence on most measures. This study did not indicate that more highly educated mothers were more knowledgeable about safety-related subjects. The theoretical implications of this study are discussed.",Scandinavian journal of psychology,1995 Sep,England,1995,90

Comparing the transitions of the two Chinese populations brings out striking similarities in the changes in age patterns of fertility, but distinctive contrasts between the trends and speed of declines.... An overview of the history of population dynamics in the past 500 years reaffirms the assertion that fertility and mortality rates in ancient China were primarily reflections of biological responses to population pressure on resources. The results of the regression analysis of this study demonstrates that this density-dependent relationship has gradually vanished as the deliberate control of fertility prevails in contemporary China and Taiwan. The prevalence of fertility control is in large part attributable in Taiwan to the rational response of the population to changes in economic and social conditions that favor fewer children while the size of families in China is largely prescribed by the government there.""

8829970,The elderly who live alone in the United States: historical perspectives on household change.,"One of the most dramatic changes in the life of the elderly in the United States in the twentieth century is the rise in the proportion of elderly widows living alone. This paper examines this transformation by comparing the determinants of elderly widows' living alone at four points in time, in 1910, 1940, 1960, and 1990. Logistic regression models of the probability of living alone are estimated. The results of these models are used to calculate the expected proportion of elderly widows living alone in various hypothetical scenarios of social change. This analysis suggests that no single factor is responsible for the rise in living alone among the elderly. Value changes, as represented by a variable for time, are shown to have strong and direct effects on the increased probability of living alone in old age in the late twentieth century, independent of the effect of rising income levels. These results are discussed in light of previous research on living arrangements of the elderly, which articulates demographic, economic, and cultural explanations for change.",Demography,1995 Aug,United States,1995,90

METHODS: In Montreal, death certificates were obtained from Jewish funeral homes (where all Jewish deaths are believed to be handled) for 1986-1990 and coded. RESULTS: All-cause cumulative mortality for ages 35-74 (CM), was exceedingly low in Montreal Jews, both in males (CM = 0.312, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.274-0.350) and females (CM = 0.202, 95% CI: 0.172-0.232), compared to all Canadians (CM = 0.425; 95% CI: 0.414-0.435 and 0.251; 95% CI: 0.243-0.253) and Israeli Jews (CM = 0.406; 95% CI: 0.379-0.434, and 0.299; 95% CI: 0.276-0.322), for males and females. Sex ratios (male:female) were 1.36, 1.54, and 1.69 for Israeli Jews, Montreal Jews, and Canadians, respectively. Differences were due mainly to substantially lower cumulative mortality from circulatory diseases in Montreal Jews (CM = 0.139, 0.043 versus 0.203, 0.125 in Israeli Jews and 0.199, 0.081 in Canadians, in males and females, respectively); these differences were all highly significant. Sex ratios for circulatory deaths were lowest in Israel (1.63), highest in Montreal (3.23) and intermediate in Canadians (2.47). Among men, the circulatory diseases mortality ratio for Canadians versus Montreal Jews was 1.43, and 1.46 between Israeli and Montreal Jews; in women, these ratios were 1.87 and 2.90, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the mortality pattern characteristic of Israeli Jews is not a universal Jewish phenomenon and may be affected by modifiable environmental factors. Similar studies conducted in other Jewish communities would aid in confirming these observations.",International journal of epidemiology,1995 Aug,England,1995,90
7646747,What makes a tutor effective? A structural-equations modeling approach to learning in problem-based curricula.,"PURPOSE: To test and further develop a causal model of the influence of tutor behaviors on student achievement and interest in the context of problem-based learning. METHOD: Data from 524 tutorial groups involving students participating in the four-year undergraduate health sciences curriculum at the University of Limburg in 1992-93 were analyzed. The tutorial groups were guided by 261 tutors. Overall, 3,792 data records were studied, with each student participating in an average of 2.3 groups. Correlations among tutors' social-congruence, expertise-use, and cognitive-congruence behaviors, small-group functioning, and student' self-study time, intrinsic interest in subject matter, and level of achievement were analyzed using structural-equations modeling. This statistical technique allows the investigator to test causal hypotheses on correlational data by comparing the structure of data with a theoretical model. RESULTS: After minor adaptations, the hypothesized causal model of the effective tutor fitted the data extremely will. Each tutor's level of expertise use and social congruence not only directly affected his or her level of cognitive congruence but also affected other elements of the model. Level of social congruence influenced group functioning in a direct fashion, while expertise use had a slightly negative effect on the students' level of self-study time and a slightly positive effect on level of achievement. As hypothesized, the level of cognitive congruence influenced tutorial-group functioning. Level of group functioning affected self-study time and intrinsic interest. Finally, time spent on self-study influenced level of achievement. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that subject-matter expertise; a commitment to students' learning and their lives in a personal, authentic way; and the ability to express oneself in the language used by the student are all determinants of learning in problem-based curricula. The theory of the effective tutor, presented in this article, merges two different perspectives prevalent in the literature. One perspective emphasizes the personal qualities of the tutor: his or her ability to communicate with students in an informal way, coupled with an empathic attitude that enables the tutor to encourage student learning by creating an atmosphere in which open exchange of ideas is facilitated.

7579984,The use of anti-psychotic drugs with adults with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour.,"The use of anti-psychotic medication with an adult population of people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviours was investigated as part of an epidemiological study covering seven district health authorities and corresponding local authorities in North West England. The study found a high rate of prescription of anti-psychotic drugs (48.1%). Chlorpromazine was the most frequently prescribed drug, followed by Thioridazine and Haloperidol. Three variables, psychiatric diagnosis, where the person was resident (hospital disturbed ward, hospital non-disturbed ward, hostel or family home) and district of origin were found to be significant determinants of prescriptions when all other variables were controlled. Of the variables reflecting individual characteristics those significantly related to prescription suggested that the socially disruptive effects of challenging behaviour were determining prescription. The results are discussed in the context of differing prescription practices across residence and district in the context of the management of socially disruptive behaviour.",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,1995 Aug,England,1995,90
7561664,Organochlorine residues in human breast milk: analysis through a sentinel practice network.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess through a sentinel practice network the validity of data on levels of organochlorine residues in human milk along with personal, lifestyle, and exposure variables of breastfeeding women; to compare the results of this new approach with those of the Lower Saxony breast milk surveillance programme; and to test hypotheses on potential determinants of contamination levels. DESIGN: Eligible women were enrolled into this cross sectional study by a network of 51 paediatric practices when bringing their babies for a U3 infant screening examination (4th to 6th week after delivery). Lifestyle and exposure factors were obtained by questionnaire. All milk samples were analysed for hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachlorbenzole, DDT, dieldrin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and heptachlor; half the samples were also analysed for dioxin. Analytic statistics were computed using polychotomous logistic regression (PLR). SETTING: The study was conducted in Lower Saxony, Germany, from summer 1992 to summer 1993. PARTICIPANTS: Altogether 156 primiparous, breast feeding German women, aged 25-35 years, who had been born and had grown up in West Germany, were studied. MAIN RESULTS: Compared with the regular programme, participants in this study had their milk analysed sooner after delivery and were more likely to have grown up in rural areas, less likely to have been exposed to hazardous substances, less likely to have a diet of health food, and slightly less likely to be a smoker at the time of the study. Breast milk contamination levels were comparable in both studies, and in all but two cases well below the tolerable concentrations established by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Fellowship). After adjustment for potential confounders using polychotomous logistic regression, there were statistically significant positive associations between breast milk contamination and age (PCB, test for trend: p = 0.006), average dietary fat intake per week (dioxin, p = 0.01), and proximity of residence to hazardous sites (dioxin, p < 0.05), and negative associations between residue levels and relative body weight at the time of the study (PCB; p < 0.0001) and difference in body weight (weight minus weight before the pregnancy; PCB, p = 0.0002), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel practice networks are a feasible and low-biased approach to population based breast milk studies. The contamination levels and associations found are biologically plausible and comparable with the results of other studies. To reduce organochlorine residue levels in human milk in the short term, breast-feeding women should be advised not to try to reduce their weight until after lactation. Public promotion of a lower dietary fat intake may reduce the lifetime accumulation of organochlorine compounds in the human body fat tissue in the long term, resulting in lower concentrations in breast milk as well.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1995 Aug,England,1995,90
7492816,[Psychosocial aspects of cancer screening].,"Psychosocial reluctance is a major obstacle to the success of mass screening. In France, several opinion polls demonstrated that the fear of cancer as a disease, the fear of a positive result and the fear of the possible therapeutic consequences were the major determinants opposed to screening despite information often known to the public. The psychological obstacles appear less important in the US population, except for minorities. Age seems to be a discriminating factor, indeed after 50 years, reluctance to screening is increased probably due to a generation effect influencing the meaning of the disease and the interest of screening. Site specific constraints also exist, in colorectal cancer, 30% of the people feel as an embarrassment the manipulation of the stools. If false positives are responsible for a supplementary anxiety, it doesn't last long and it doesn't influence the observation of future campaign. These psychosocial obstacles as a whole justify the need of converging information that must take into account cultural problems. The favourable influence of the general practitioner explains his essential role for the success of mass screening.",Bulletin du cancer,1995 Aug,France,1995,90
7481932,"Potties, pits and pipes: explaining hygiene behaviour in Burkina Faso.","Stool disposal practices have been shown to be associated with childhood diarrhoea. However, efforts to promote improved hygiene behaviour are hampered by a lack of understanding of what determines those behaviours. Data from 2793 household interviews with mothers of children from the town of Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso were analyzed to examine what differentiated mothers who reported using safer stool disposal practices from those who did not. Three 'outcomes' were considered: where the child was reported to defaecate; where the mother reported disposing of the child stools; and whether excreta were observed in the compound. Regression models were developed to identify those factors with the strongest independent associations with the outcomes. There was a consistent association between the source of water and the outcomes. Mothers with access to a tap in the yard reported using safe hygiene practices three times more often than mothers using wells outside the compound and twice as often as mothers who used public standpipes or wells within the yard. The source of water showed a similar pattern of association with observations of faecal matter in the environment. Improved sources of water may contribute to safer stool hygiene by reducing the time spent on water collection or by encouraging mothers to conform to higher standards of hygiene. Other factors which played a role in predicting the hygiene behaviour of mothers were the husbands' occupation, the number of health education sessions that she had attended, her zone of residence and family ownership of certain valuable objects. These factors are likely to be related and to be, to some extent, proxies for the real determinants of her behaviour. A model of the cultural, psycho-social and infrastructural proximate determinants of hygiene behaviour is proposed. Data from focus group discussions suggested that the main purpose of hygienic behaviour is to conform to existing norms of social etiquette. Trials of interventions based on changing such norms are needed to test whether this is an effective means of promoting of safer hygiene practices.",Social science & medicine (1982),1995 Aug,England,1995,90
12973626,"[Information, attitudes, perceptions, and symbolic representations of AIDS risk and prevention among poor adolescents in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil].","Four hundred and sixteen poor adolescents of both sexes in Rio de Janeiro were interviewed to study both their level of information and symbolic representations concerning AIDS risk and prevention. The most common source of information on HIV/AIDS was the mass media, particularly television broadcasts. There were doubts and lack of trust regarding official government information on HIV/AIDS. Nearly 70% of the adolescents interviewed believe in HIV transmission through mosquito bites and some 40% through casual contact with wounds or scars or sharing of bathroom utensils. Men seemed to show a greater awareness and autonomy vis- -vis taking initiatives in sex encounters. Attitudes of segregation and exclusion of people with AIDS persist. Lack of prevention was attributed to the impossibility of predicting sexual encounters. The study of symbolic aspects concerning causes of HIV/AIDS displayed broad variability: 80% of the interviewees associated AIDS with excesses in sexual behavior and 40% with homosexual practices. Causal images vary from the predominant view of AIDS as unfair punishment to the less frequent stance considering AIDS as fair punishment (due to sinful behavior). An ambiguous attitude towards transgression (taking as its sterotype the figure of Rio's ""malandro"", or ""streetwise dude"") may influence perception of risk and prevention. The paper calls attention to the need for implementing clearer and more direct educational programs. This could be useful for the implementation of culturally sensitive control measures through a reshaping of AIDS symbols. The author recommends a better understanding of the social and economic determinants of disease and reinforcement of the kinds of discourse which empower and raise the self-esteem of poor adolescents by endorsing their civil rights.",Cadernos de saude publica,1995 Jul-Sep,Brazil,1995,90

High and rising bridewealth in Igboland is associated with the prevailing economic situation, socio-economic status of bride's parents, raising incidence of self-selection of marital partners in place of arranged marriages, and particularly increasing female education.... Rising age at marriage in Igboland cannot be understood only on the basis of increasing urbanization, female education and employment opportunities, but also on the basis of rising bridewealth which reduces the tempo of marriage....The study ends with an investigation of the determinants of marital fertility through the use of a causal model that includes bridewealth, age at marriage and other socio-economic variables.""

12346413,"Do you need to shop around? Age at marriage, spousal alternatives, and marital dissolution.","""This article attempts to shed light on the oft-observed relationship between age at marriage and marital dissolution by first deriving a hypothesis from marital search theory that relates both variables to the supply of spousal alternatives in the local marriage market. This hypothesis states that, relative to people who marry later in life, persons who marry at comparatively young ages will be especially susceptible to divorce when confronted with abundant alternatives to their current spouse. Marital history data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were then merged with aggregated data from the Public Use Microdata Samples of the 1980 U.S. census to test this hypothesis."" The author finds that ""discrete-time event history analyses offer no support for this hypothesis. Although the risk of marital dissolution is highest where either husbands or wives chance numerous spousal alternatives, the impact of age at marriage on divorce is significantly weaker in marriage markets containing abundant remarriage opportunities. Some of the effect of age at marriage on marital dissolution is attributable to the detrimental impact of early marriage on educational attainment.""",Journal of family issues,1995 Jul,United States,1995,90

For immigrants, the results show economic disadvantages are caused by the act of migration itself rather than by economic experiences in their new country. Occupational status is depressed at the beginning of the immigrants' Australian working career, and this in turn diminishes occupational status throughout the working lives of the immigrants and accounts for the economic disadvantages they face.""",The International migration review,1995 Summer,United States,1995,90

To the extent that NAFTA causes Mexican export agriculture to expand, migration to the United States will increase rather than decrease in the short run. Data collected in both California and the Mexican State of Baja California show that indigenous migrants from southern Mexico typically first undertake internal migration, which lowers the costs and risks of U.S. migration. Two features of employment in export agriculture were found to be specially significant in lowering the costs of U.S. migration: first, working in export agriculture exposes migrants to more diverse social networks and information about U.S. migration; second, agro-export employment in northern Mexico provides stable employment, albeit low-wage employment, for some members of the family close to the border (especially women and children) while allowing other members of the family to assume the risks of U.S. migration.""",The International migration review,1995 Summer,United States,1995,90

The data for the analysis were obtained from the 1983 Census of Population conducted by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics. The analysis focuses on men who immigrated to Israel between 1979 to 1983.... The data reveal that the likelihood of finding employment, the mode of labor market incorporation, and the size of the occupational cost are significantly affected by geocultural origin, occupation in the country of origin, and individual-level demographic and human capital resources. The meaning of the differentiated effects are discussed in detail. The findings point toward two central aspects that should be examined in the study of labor market incorporation of new immigrants: employment status and occupational cost.""",The International migration review,1995 Summer,United States,1995,90
12290730,The determinants and patterns of married women's labor force participation in Korea.,"The present study investigates the determinants and patterns of married women's labor force participation in Korea. Married women's employment in Korea is largely determined by age, urban residence, household characteristics of the husband's socioeconomic status, family income, fertility, and the lagged effect of work. Older age, rural residence, inferior household economic condition, and recent work experience are the major positive causes of married women's participation in the market work. On the other hand, younger women with preschool children, who currently reside in urban areas, enjoying better household economic conditions (due to higher socioeconomic status of husbands and/or higher family income) are the groups of women with the smallest probability of working in the market. Married women's employment pattern in Korea shows a pattern typical of less-developed and low-income countries in two aspects: married women working and characterized by a low level of education; the difference between urban and rural areas in terms of work participation pattern is remarkable. Although Korea belongs to the advanced group of currently industrializing countries, she lags behind with other developing countries in terms of married women's employment. Moreover, it is difficult to predict in advance that Korea would have similar experiences as those of contemporary advanced countries.",Korea journal of population and development,1995 Jul,Korea (South),1995,90
8690497,A cross-sectional study on factors including HIV testing and counselling determining unsafe injecting practices among injecting drug users of Manipur.,"In India, a steep increase in the prevalence of HIV (0% to 50% within six months) among the IDUs has been reported in Manipur, a north eastern state in 1990. In spite of large scale intervention program like educational campaign and widespread voluntary HIV testing in this state, the infection has quickly spread to the heterosexual population at large. The determinants of risk taking behaviors like sharing of unclean needle among the IDU population has been explored in this paper. A cross sectional study has been carried out among all of the 488 IDUs who attended any detoxification centers and prison during last two years at Imphal, the capital city of this state. Self reported behaviors based on the pre-scheduled interview were recorded and participation rate was satisfactory. The data was compared to a similar survey carried out by us in 1990. Although there has been decline in risk behavior among the IDUs, a logistic regression analysis reveals that unsafe needle sharing behavior is not influenced by the knowledge on HIV transmission, educational status or history of HIV testing or serostatus of the individual. The limitation of cross sectional nature of the study, bias due to collection of data in prison, self reported behavior, possible differences with street samples of the addict are discussed.",Indian journal of public health,1995 Jul-Sep,India,1995,90

A critical review of the negative priming literature considers various parameters of the task (e.g., time course, relation to interference, level of occurence, and susceptibility to changes in task context). It takes into account life span data and the performance of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. On these bases, the review suggests that negative priming can be produced by 2 mechanisms: memorial and inhibitory. With respect to inhibition, the review suggests that (a) there are 2 systems, one responsible for identity and the other for location information; and (b) inhibition is a flexible, postselection process operating to prevent recently rejected information from quickly regaining access to effectors, thus helping to establish coherence among selected thought and action streams.",Psychological bulletin,1995 Jul,United States,1995,90
7612128,Determinants of primary care specialty choice: a non-statistical meta-analysis of the literature.,"This paper analyzes and synthesizes the literature on primary care specialty choice from 1987 through 1993. To improve the validity and usefulness of the conclusions drawn from the literature, the authors developed a model of medical student specialty choice to guide the synthesis, and used only high-quality research (a final total of 73 articles). They found that students predominantly enter medical school with a preference for primary care careers, but that this preference diminishes over time (particularly over the clinical clerkship years). Student characteristics associated with primary care career choice are: being female, older, and married; having a broad undergraduate background; having non-physician parents; having relatively low income expectations; being interested in diverse patients and health problems; and having less interest in prestige, high technology, and surgery. Other traits, such as value orientation, personality, or life situation, yet to be reliably measured, may actually be responsible for some of these associations. Two curricular experiences are associated with increases in the numbers of students choosing primary care: required family practice clerkships and longitudinal primary care experiences. Overall, the number of required weeks in family practice shows the strongest association. Students are influenced by the cultures of the institutions in which they train, and an important factor in this influence is the relative representation of academically credible, full-time primary care faculty within each institution's governance and everyday operation. In turn, the institutional culture and faculty composition are largely determined by each school's mission and funding sources--explaining, perhaps, the strong and consistent association frequently found between public schools and a greater output of primary care physicians. Factors that do not influence primary care specialty choice include early exposure to family practice faculty or to family practitioners in their own clinics, having a high family medicine faculty-to-student ratio, and student debt level, unless exceptionally high. Also, students view a lack of understanding of the specialties as a major impediment to their career decisions, and it appears they acquire distorted images of the primary care specialties as they learn within major academic settings. Strikingly few schools produce a majority of primary care graduates who enter family practice, general internal medicine, or general practice residencies or who actually practice as generalists. Even specially designed tracks seldom produce more than 60% primary care graduates. Twelve recommendations for strategies to increase the proportion of primary care physicians are provided.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,1995 Jul,United States,1995,90

METHODS: 1078 tenth grade high school students, 15-16 years old answered an anonymous questionnaire including, perceived concerns and risk behaviors, (e.g., smoking, alcohol, drugs, and sexual activity). Concerns were grouped into six domains. RESULTS: The most frequently reported concerns related to school, weight, coping with aggression, fatigue, war, enlistment into army, and relationships with peers. Girls had more concerns in the domains of self-image, anxiety, and relationships with peers (p < .05). Adolescents with mothers who had less education had significantly more concerns in the domains of anxiety and relationships with peers and adults (p < .05). Forty-seven percent engaged in at least one risk behavior (boys 63% and girls 34%). The Guttman scalogram indicated the following sequence of risk behaviors: alcohol, cigarettes, sex, and drugs. There were statistically significant associations between concerns and risk behaviors in the domains of anxiety, sex, and relationships with adults and peers. CONCLUSION: Many adolescent concerns are universal, although the ranking and prevalence may vary based on different regional and population characteristics (e.g., in this population a high rate of concerns relating to aggression and war were identified). The results support the need to develop prevention and health promotion programs relating to the concerns and risk behaviors in the school and community, and individual counseling programs in primary care settings.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1995 Jul,United States,1995,90

In the context of middle-aged males and females, the present study attempted to integrate social cognitive and impression management perspectives with respect to anxiety associated with exercise. METHODS: Formerly sedentary subjects participated in a 5-month exercise program with assessments of physique anxiety, efficacy, outcome expectations, and anthropometric variables prior to and following the program. RESULTS: Both acute bouts and long-term participation in exercise resulted in significant increases in self-efficacy. In turn, these changes in efficacy and initial positive outcome expectations were significant predictors of reductions in physique anxiety, even when controlling for the influence of gender and reductions in body fat, weight, and circumferences. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are discussed in terms of the implications for structure and content of exercise environments and the utility of the proposed theoretical integration. Strategies for enhancing beliefs regarding health and fitness outcomes associated with exercise rather than appearance outcomes may be required to maximize reductions in negative body image.",Preventive medicine,1995 Jul,United States,1995,90

In the two studies presented here, we examined the influence of personality on the use of social support and other coping strategies in samples of undergraduate students. The first study surveyed a range of coping responses to naturally occurring stressors and found that Extraversion was related to social support seeking, optimism (identified as germane to coping in prior research) was related to problem solving, and both dispositions were negatively related to avoidance. The second study used an experimental approach and multiple personality measures to correct for possible methodological problems in the first. Extraversion again proved to be associated with help seeking; moreover, this relationship accounted for that of another disposition, self-esteem--a construct considered crucial in the literature.

IgG and IgA titres were measured by microimmunofluorescence, and associations with smoking and socio-demographic variables were assessed. IgG antibodies were found in 84.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 80.4-87.9) of men and 68.7% (95% CI: 61.6-75.0) of women (P < 0.0001 for sex difference), indicating a very high rate of exposure in this population. IgA antibodies, postulated to represent persistent infection, were present in 45.1% (95% CI: 40.1-50.2) of men and 23% (95% CI: 17.4-29.7) of women (P < 0.0001 for sex difference). Factors associated with IgG seropositivity included family size, education and social class. On the other hand age (in men) and smoking were associated with IgA seropositivity. These findings support the hypothesis that low socioeconomic status and household crowding may be predictive of exposure to or infection with this organism (IgG seropositivity), whereas they do not explain persistence of the infection putatively expressed as IgA seropositivity.",Epidemiology and infection,1995 Jun,England,1995,90

The goal of the present study is to clarify genetic v. environmental determinants of self-esteem. METHOD: Participants were Caucasian women sampled from the Virginia Twin Register: 363 pairs of MZ and 238 pairs of DZ twins were available from the first wave of the study, and 430 pairs of MZ and 308 pairs of DZ twins from the second. Self-esteem was assessed with the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale. RESULTS: Using univariate twin analyses of self-esteem and a repeated measurement twin model, we found that self-esteem is a moderately heritable trait (heritability = 52% in the repeated measurement model); environmental influences are also very important, and are probably mostly not shared by members of a twin pair.

In bivariate analyses, respondents who reported having had sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs were no less likely than respondents with no such experience to report consistent use of condoms, and having had sex under the influence of substances was positively related to lifetime condom use. Multivariate analyses that included gender and urban area as predictors yielded similar findings.

This hypothesis was not supported. Support was found, however, for a relationship between negative bias and the amount of negative mood assessed at the time the retrospective report was given. As has been previously found, the most frequent precipitant of relapses and crises in this study was negative emotional states.

A questionnaire developed to assess demographic characteristics, contextual factors, antecedents to symptom onset, and behavioral, affective, and cognitive responses was administered in the hospital to 501 patients with documented AMI. Patients who believed that their symptoms were cardiac in nature were more likely to be early responders, whereas patients who attributed their symptoms to indigestion, muscle pain, fatigue, or another cause responded later (p < 0.0009). Early responders believed their symptoms to be more serious (p < 0.0001), felt more comfortable seeking medical assistance (p < 0.0001), were more anxious or upset when they first noticed symptoms (p = 0.0118), and perceived that they had less control of their symptoms (p < 0.0001) than late responders. A stepwise multiple regression analysis further suggested that unmarried patients responded significantly later than married patients, and patients who first experienced their symptoms at work responded significantly later than those who first experienced their symptoms outside of the home but not at work. These results suggest that situational and psychological variables are important determinants of lengthy decision delays in responding to symptoms of AMI.",The American journal of cardiology,1995 May 15,United States,1995,90

The researcher can be an observer (as in cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies) or can determine who will be exposed in the experimental studies (clinical trials). Cross-sectional study is the easiest one to conduct, since exposure and outcome are assessed simultaneously in a well-defined population. In a cohort study, a group of people is assembled according to the exposure and followed over time to detect who will develop the outcome. In a case-control study,people are selected based on disease status. Then, they are investigated about previous exposures which could be associated with the development of the disease. The investigator allocates the exposure and then follows the participants to assess the outcome in clinical trials. Contrasting with the experiment developed in laboratory, the subjects are human beings.",Jornal de pediatria,1995 May-Jun,Brazil,1995,90
12319694,The desire for a son is the father of many daughters: a sex ratio paradox.,"""This paper investigates the impact of preferences for male offspring to female offspring upon the sex ratio of the population. Asymmetric procreation behaviour of this kind is modelled by assuming that a female's procreation ceases only after at least one son or n daughters are born. It is shown that such asymmetric procreation behaviour has no effect on the sex ratio of the society, but influences rather the growth rate of the population. Finally, problems concerning the interrelationship between the sex ratio, the pattern of procreation, and the marriage regime in stationary populations are investigated.""",Journal of population economics,1995 May,Germany,1995,90
7726177,Genetic and environmental sources of fibrinogen variability in Israeli families: the Kibbutzim Family Study.,"Genetic and environmental determinants of plasma fibrinogen were investigated in a sample of 82 kindreds residing in kibbutz settlements in Israel. The sample included 223 males and 229 females ages 15-97 years. Fibrinogen levels were first adjusted for variability in sex and age. There was a significant familial aggregation of adjusted fibrinogen levels, as indicated by inter- and intraclass correlation coefficients significantly different from zero. Commingling analysis implied that in this population a mixture of two normal distributions fit the adjusted fibrinogen levels better than did a single normal distribution. Complex segregation analysis was first applied to these sex- and age-adjusted data. Heterogeneous etiologies for individual differences were suggested. There was evidence for a nontransmitted environmental major factor in addition to polygenic genes that explained the mixture of distributions. In parallel, a single recessive locus with a major effect that explained the adjusted variation in fibrinogen could not be rejected. However, when the regression model for sex and age allowed coefficients to be ousiotype (class)-specific, the recessive genetic model was rejected and the mixed environmental one was not. These results suggested that particular ousiotypes determined by the major environmental factor are associated with a steeper increase of fibrinogen with age. While at the age of 20 years, the major environmental factor contributed 10% to fibrinogen variability, and 48% was explained by polygenic loci, at 80 years of age, the major factor explained 64% and only approximately 20% was explained by polygenic factors.",American journal of human genetics,1995 May,United States,1995,90
7664962,Racial and ethnic differences in birthweight: the role of income and financial assistance.,"This paper attempts to explain the differences in birthweight observed between blacks, white Anglos, Chicanos, and other racial and ethnic groups. The analysis focuses on the role of income and financial assistance from relatives and public programs. Using data from the NLS Youth Panel, I construct a casual model of birthweight containing exogenous social and demographic risk factors and intervening proximate determinants of birthweight. A substantial part of the gap in birthweight between white Anglos and other ethnic groups (especially blacks) can be explained by the unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the latter. On the other hand, blacks and other minorities smoke less and have other favorable proximate characteristics that depress differences in birthweight. When these proximate determinants are controlled, large ethic differences in birthweight remain unexplained by income and other sociodemographic factors.",Demography,1995 May,United States,1995,90
7664957,The determinants of the duration of postpartum sexual abstinence in West Africa: a multilevel analysis.,"The question of how postpartum sexual abstinence responds to social change in West Africa is important because declines in the practice could increase fertility levels and worsen child and maternal health. This study uses data from the late 1970s in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Cameroon to examine effects of modernization and women's status on the length of abstinence. The results show that modernization and female status should be associated with declines in abstinence, which could lead to an increase in fertility and deterioration in maternal and child health.",Demography,1995 May,United States,1995,90
7652124,Rethinking medicine: improving health outcomes with cost-effective psychosocial interventions.,"Thoughts, feelings, and moods can have a significant effect on the onset of some diseases, the course of many, and the management of nearly all. Many visits to the doctor are occasioned by psychosocial distress. Even in those patients with organic medical disorders, functional health status is strongly influenced by mood, coping skills, and social support, yet the predominant approach in medicine is to treat people with physical and chemical treatments that neglect the mental, emotional, and behavioral dimensions of illness. This critical mismatch between the psychosocial health needs of people and the usual medical response leads to frustration, ineffectiveness, and wasted health care resources. There is emerging evidence that empowering patients and addressing their psychosocial needs can be health and cost effective. By helping patients manage not just their disease but also common underlying needs for psychosocial support, coping skills, and sense of control, health outcomes can be significantly improved in a cost-effective manner. Rather than targeting specific diseases or behavioral risk factors, these psychosocial interventions may operate by influencing underlying, shared determinants of health such as attitudes, beliefs, and moods that predispose toward health in general. Although the health care system cannot be expected to address all the psychosocial needs of people, clinical interventions can be brought into better alignment with the emerging evidence on shared psychosocial determinants of health by providing services that address psychosocial needs and improve adaptation to illness.",Psychosomatic medicine,1995 May-Jun,United States,1995,90

Although there is a long history of community intervention to improve health, high quality research on these interventions has been conducted only recently. In evaluating the usefulness of a community intervention, the distinction between relative risk and population-attributable risk is not always made clear. These two distinct types of risk are reviewed considering their implications for what risk factors are targeted by community interventions and what criteria are reasonable to apply in evaluating the utility of these interventions. A role for linking root cause analysis with attributable risk and interventions to reduce risk is presented.",Psychosomatic medicine,1995 May-Jun,United States,1995,90
7652121,Where do shared pathways lead? Some reflections on a research agenda.,"A substantial body of research relates socioeconomic, behavioral, social, and psychological factors to the development and progression of a wide variety of diseases. The search for shared pathways that link these factors leads to the investigation of upstream determinants, as opposed to biologic pathways, but these have been little studied by biobehavioral researchers. Available data suggest that socioeconomic factors structure the development and maintenance of behavioral, social, and psychological factors; however, we know little of how this takes place. A consideration of the ways in which socioeconomic position influences the everyday texture of people's lives could advance our understanding of both macroeconomic and microeconomic influences on health, and lead to new, community-centric approaches to intervention. Such a research agenda would help to advance the scientific foundations for reducing the primary origins of disease, which are social and economic.",Psychosomatic medicine,1995 May-Jun,United States,1995,90
7643268,A contrast of mothering behaviors in women from Korea and the United States.,"In both the United States and Korea, culture heavily influences a mother's behavior toward her infant. Differences between these two cultures are explored, based on the author's experiences and work in both environments. This comparison includes a number of points of departure. The American culture encourages autonomous and independent behaviors from infants, whereas in the Korean culture, mothers tend to view infants as passive and dependent. American mothering is individually fashioned and relies on the expertise of health care providers. Conversely, the Korean culture is highly ritualistic, so mothering is molded more by societal rules than by individual design, and professional advice is less sought for guidance than is folklore information. American mothers tend to rear their infants in a nuclear family setting, whereas Korean mothers rear their infants in an extended family or at least in a highly social environment. Implications for American nurses who provide perinatal care for Korean immigrant women are discussed.","Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN",1995 May,United States,1995,90
7640680,The disablement experienced by traumatically brain-injured adults living in the community.,"The disablement that occurs following traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be extensive and severe and consequently has been difficult to report on in a comprehensive and thorough manner. We were able to address this difficulty by analysing a sub group of data from the Canadian Health and Activity Limitation Survey (HALS) using the theoretical framework of disablement developed by the World Health Organization, the International Classification of Impairment, Disability and Handicap (ICIDH). There were 454 survey respondents (representing 12,290 in the Canadian population) with disability resulting from a TBI and a mean time post-injury of 13 years. Three handicaps identified in the ICIDH were the focus of the study: physical independence, work, social integration. The prevalence of long term handicap was very high with 66% of the sample reporting the need for ongoing assistance with some activities of daily living, 75% not working, and 90% reporting some limitations or dissatisfaction with their social integration. Multivariate regression analysis was used to investigate the determinants of the handicaps. The determinants included: age, gender, level of education, living alone, physical environment, and specific disabilities. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to rehabilitation issues, the usefulness of the ICIDH as a model to investigate outcomes, and directions for future research.",Brain injury,1995 May-Jun,England,1995,90
7639977,The relational determinants of condom use with commercial sex partners in Thailand.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the extent and determinants of condom use with commercial sex partners among lower socioeconomic status groups in the Thai population. DESIGN: Respondents were sampled in Udon Thani, Saraburi and Bangkok in 1992. Completed sample size was 678 women in brothels, 330 male truck drivers and 1,075 men aged 17-45 years. Behavioral data and local sexual network information were collected using structured questionnaires (face-to-face interviews), focus groups and in-depth unstructured interviews. METHODS: Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Condom use with commercial partners remains inconsistent. Consistent use was reported by 61% of women in brothels, 25% of truck drivers, and 29% of men in the low-income population. The single strongest predictor of consistent condom use for all groups is type of partnership. Consistent use drops significantly with regular (multivisit) commercial sex partners compared with casual (single visit) commercial partners; adjusted odds of consistent use are 0.22 for women and 0.25 for men. Brothel women report that one in five of their commercial partners is a 'regular', and 20% of the young men who report a commercial partner report a 'regular'. DISCUSSION: The strongest determinant of consistent condom use is the nature of the relational bond between the partners, rather than their individual characteristics, knowledge or attitudes. To raise condom use further, programs will have to move beyond the standard knowledge-attitudes-practices paradigm focus on individual attributes to address the contextual determinants of behavior.","AIDS (London, England)",1995 May,England,1995,90
7622022,"Perfectionism, humor, and optimism as moderators of health outcomes and determinants of coping styles of women executives.","Previous research has indicated that humor, optimism, and perfectionism are ubiquitous human tendencies and traits affecting the performance and coping styles of women in the work place. The purpose of the present series of studies was to provide a more rigorous test of the hypothesis that certain personality attributes buffer the impact of daily hassles on health outcomes among female executives. Three studies were conducted to examine how perfectionism, humor, and optimism moderate the deleterious effects of daily hassles on self-esteem, burnout, and physical health. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that all attributes significantly moderated the relationship between daily hassles and self-esteem maintenance, emotional exhaustion, and physical illness. A fourth study examined the correlations between high levels of perfectionism, humor, and optimism and female executives' use of different coping strategies and orientations. The results provide implications for the early socialization and management training of female executives working in stressful environments.","Genetic, social, and general psychology monographs",1995 May,United States,1995,90
7610436,Social inequalities and health among children aged 10-11 in The Netherlands: causes and consequences.,"Socioeconomic health differences (SEHD) are relatively small in childhood. In adolescence they almost seem to disappear and among young adults they re-emerge. This article deals with mechanisms that contribute to the emergence of health differences by studying a group of 10-11 year old children in The Netherlands (n = 908). The role of determinants of health in the relation between socioeconomic status and health (causation) is studied, as well as the influence of health on school performance (selection). Both causation and selection mechanisms prove to exist. Life style and life circumstances are unequally distributed among the socioeconomic groups and can (partly) explain the relation between socioeconomic status and health. The health of the children is related with school performance, which can be seen as health selection. This relation however was only found in the lowest socioeconomic groups. In the lowest socioeconomic groups less healthy children perform worse at school than healthy children. The unequal distribution of determinants of health and health selection in the educational career among children probably contribute to SEHD in adult life.",Social science & medicine (1982),1995 May,England,1995,90
7602009,Implementation of community care policy in the United Kingdom: will it be achieved?,"In the United Kingdom, the provision of health and social care within the community is the subject of major reform. This reform is aimed at reducing the dominance of the state as provider of welfare services whilst encouraging the independent sector to provide the bulk of services through competition and market forces. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the implementation of government policy with respect to health and social care in the community. The policy recommended in the 1989 White Paper Caring for People, which is sanctioned in the National Health Service (NHS) and Community Care Act (1990), is the focus for discussion. Implementation theory is used as a framework to explore the modification and reshaping which inevitably accompanies the translation of government policy into reality. The nature of any actual or potential deficit between stated policy and community care reform in practice is examined against this theoretical background. An historical stance is taken in order to place current policy into the wider context and consider what determinants may have led to the radical proposals for community care, and indeed other sectors of public service. A consideration of predominating philosophies is prudent to an analysis of government policy-making and therefore the values and beliefs of 'new public management' are employed as a conceptual framework underpinning current reform. The feasibility of a quasi-market in the delivery of health and social care is considered and some of the main issues which may result in implementation deficit with respect to the implementation of Caring for People are examined.",Journal of advanced nursing,1995 May,England,1995,90
7550767,Infant mortality time series are random walks with drift: are they cointegrated with socioeconomic variables?,"Previous time series analyses of infant mortality have failed to provide evidence to support their implicit assumption that infant mortality data used behaved as a stationary time series. The present study applies the augmented Dickey Fuller Test to infant mortality time series for Sweden (1800-1989), United Kingdom (1839-1989) and United States (1915-1989). The null hypothesis that each of these series is non-stationary is accepted at standard levels of significance. A conceptual framework of infant mortality which uses a combination of physical and social overhead capital as factors in a production function is developed to explain the finding of non-stationarity as derivative from the non-stationarity of a stock of health-enhancing capital. Estimation of econometric models of the socioeconomic determinants of infant mortality using differenced data with ARIMA estimation is inconclusive. Estimation of a bivariate cointegration model supports the hypothesis that infant survival and GNP/Capita are cointegrated for 19th century Sweden but not for 19th century UK. Bivariate analysis of 20th century Sweden, UK, and US data demonstrated no cointegration. This may be due to the onset of disequilibrium in the economic determination of infant mortality in the present era as technological advances and demographic shifts began to play a larger role. Supplementing the bivariate analysis with measures of unemployment, and crude birth rate in the 20th century permitted the detection of cointegration in US and UK. The multivariate results may suggest that improvements in 20th century UK GNP/capita have had greater impact on infant survival relative to US GNP/capita.",Health economics,1995 May-Jun,England,1995,90

The cultural determinants affecting living arrangements in the 3 major ethnic groups differ. In addition, within each group, cultural norms were undergoing transitions, though at different paces. More interestingly, normative obligations, which in the past had a strong impact on patterns of living arrangements, were treated as only 1 consideration among other practical and emotional issues. External influences like government housing policies, modern lifestyles, and emigration also play a part in explaining the evolving patterns of living arrangements.",Journal of cross-cultural gerontology,1995 Apr,Netherlands,1995,90

This study aims to identify theoretical and methodological problems in the relationship between labor and women's health from a gender perspective. Characteristics of women's occupational placement are described and analyzed as resulting from their role in social reproduction. The study examines the development of several conciliatory strategies between paid work and housework which are discussed as potential determinants of health problems and support the need for a critical reappraisal of theoretical and methodological strategies to reach a better understanding of the complexity and specificities of women's living and working conditions. The author also stresses the role of women's recent participation in the trade union movements in defense of health, body rights, and women's issues in the workplace, as well as the need for a new framework embodied in the women's social movement. The study thus points to the challenge to produce knowledge on this subject in order to unveil the uniqueness of the national scenario marked by unemployment, informal jobs, low salaries, weak trade unions and other civil organizations, and traditional domestic and marriage relationships.",Cadernos de saude publica,1995 Apr-Jun,Brazil,1995,90

This data was used to characterize the clinical and epidemiological profiles of the endemic desease in the population, allowing for the determination of the efficacy of the potable water supply and the specific treatment of those infected with S. mansoni. The district contains three locations, Ravenopolis, Ravena and Lavapes, where the prevalence of the endemic disease was, 20.1%, 42.6% and 63.9%, respectively. The prevalence in the district was statistically higher in men. The age brackets that displayed differences by gender were 10-14 and 15-19 years. Severity of infection was statistically different among individuals within the 10-14 year bracket in ali three locations, and in the 15-19 year bracket among individuals from Ravenopolis and Ravena. The hepatointestinal form was associated with age, and individuals under 15 years of age presented risk of infection 8.85 times higher than adults. Multivariable analysis of the factors involved in transmission of the disease showed that Lavapes was independently associated with infection. In that area, poor sanitary conditions and the proximity of houses to streams infested with S. marsoni cercariae facilitated infection of neighborhood women while performing domestic activities, as well as men digging sand from the streams for construction. These results show the focal nature of transmission of the endemic requiring specific intervention for effective control of disease.",Cadernos de saude publica,1995 Apr-Jun,Brazil,1995,90

The article will supplement a state-centric approach with insights from the perspective of complex interdependence--the significance of transnational relations and the blurring of foreign and domestic politics. I will argue that the societal groups that influence the formation of U.S. immigration policy contain a transnational component, which contributes to the maintenance of relatively open legislation.... More specifically, I will argue that the transnationalization of the labor market...blurs the boundaries between foreign and domestic constituents for unions, causing unions to resist those restrictionist immigration measures that impede organization of foreign-born workers. Hence, the pressures for restrictionism are weaker than anticipated by the conventional wisdom that expects labor to lobby for closure.""",International organization,1995 Spring,United States,1995,90

According to the theory, a rural family engages in an implicit insurance-type contract with the potential migrant because both are averse to risk.... Results from testing the hypotheses are somewhat consistent with the proposition that, after a period of adjustment, migrants do begin to remit, thereby providing their families with an insurance against the uncertainties of life in the country of origin. However, the level of remittances does not appear to depend on the potential to inherit from a family's wealth. Moreover, families do not seem to invest in their migrants so as to improve their farm lands and to undertake risky agricultural techniques. The long-term remittance commitment of migrants to their residual families suggests that migrants' altruism may be a more significant motivating factor than self-interest.""

This study is based on a longitudinal project in which changes in fertility intentions and the importance of marriage and the family are examined among four subgroups--females who remained single, females who married, males who remained single, and males who married over a five-year period. Females, regardless of marital status, became less inclined to have children, males remaining single became more inclined and males who married over the interval changed little. When a control for value of marriage and the family was introduced, gender-based differences in fertility desires disappeared. There were substantial changes in the value domain according to sex and marital status--those who married over the five-year period displayed significant increases in the importance of the value of marriage and family. The implications of these findings are discussed.",International journal of sociology of the family,1995 Spring,India,1995,90

The article also finds that illegal immigrants and their own citizen children cost taxpayers an additional $12 to $16.2 billion annually for education, public services, and incarceration after deducting all local, state, and federal taxes paid in by them. In the private sector, illegal aliens are found to save their employers and owners of capital about $1.5 billion more than U.S. workers lose due to wage depression. The article also considers what legal and enforcement reforms would be necessary to dramatically slow the current flow of 300,000 illegals yearly and concludes that, although improvements in the system are now being proposed, the actual reforms will be insufficient to more than stem the currently rising tide of illegals due to economic instability in Mexico and the Third World.""",Current world leaders,1995 Apr,United States,1995,90

7872587,Health values of the seriously ill. SUPPORT investigators.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess 1) the health values and health ratings of seriously ill hospitalized patients, their surrogate decision makers, and their physicians; 2) the determinants of health values; and 3) whether health values change over time. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study. SETTING: 5 academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: 1438 seriously ill patients with at least one of nine diseases who had a projected overall 6-month mortality rate of 50%; their surrogates; and their physicians. MEASUREMENTS: Time-tradeoff utilities (reflecting preferences for a shorter but healthy life) and health ratings. RESULTS: At study day 3, patients had a mean time-tradeoff utility of 0.73 +/- 0.32 (median [25th, 75th percentile], 0.92 [0.63, 1.0]), indicating that they equated living 1 year in their current state of health with living 8.8 months in excellent health. However, scores varied widely; 34.8% of patients were unwilling to exchange any time in their current state of health for a shorter life in excellent health (utility, 1.0), and 9.0% were willing to live 2 weeks or less in excellent health rather than 1 year in their current state of health (utility, 0.04). Health rating scores averaged 57.8 +/- 24.0 (median [25th percentile, 75th percentile], 60 [50, 75]) on a scale of 0 (death) to 100 (perfect health). The patients' mean time-tradeoff score exceeded that of their paired surrogates (n = 1041) by 0.08 (P < 0.0001). Time-tradeoff scores were related to psychosocial well-being; health ratings; desire for resuscitation and extension of life rather than relief of pain and discomfort; degree of willingness to live with constant pain; and perceived prognosis for survival and independent functioning. Scores of surviving patients increased by an average of 0.06 after 2 months (P < 0.0001) and 0.08 after 6 months (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Health values of seriously ill patients vary widely, are higher than patients' surrogates believe, are related to few other preference and health status measures, and increase over time.",Annals of internal medicine,1995 Apr 1,United States,1995,90

DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial cross-sectional studies were conducted in 1987-1988 and 1990-1991 at a centralized STD clinic in Port of Spain. A case-control study was carried out to examine in greater detail the demographic and behavioral risk factors for HIV-1 among self-declared heterosexuals in this population. RESULTS: HIV-1 prevalence increased from 3.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3-3.9] in 1987-1988 to 13.6% (95% CI, 11.8-15.6) in 1990-1991. Age > or = 40 years [odds ratio (OR), 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8], urban residence (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.0), and human T-lymphotropic virus-I seropositivity (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.6-6.0) were significant risk factors for HIV-1 in 1990-1991. In the case-control analysis, significant independent risk factors for men included current genital ulcer disease (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.2-12.5), current genital warts (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.0), having ever had syphilis (OR, 3.2; 95% CI 1.6-6.1), and use of crack cocaine in the preceding 6 months (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.7-14.2). Corresponding risk factors for women were commercial sex work (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.3-25.7), initiation of sexual activity before age 14 years (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.5-16.0), and past non-gonococcal cervicitis (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.3-13.1). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 in this setting is primarily heterosexually transmitted in a milieu of unprotected sexual activity fuelled by a crack cocaine epidemic. Targeted interventions to prevent, detect and treat STD and crack cocaine addiction, as well as disrupt their adverse synergism, may substantially reduce HIV-1 transmission in this population.","AIDS (London, England)",1995 Apr,England,1995,90
7792628,Adolescent psychiatry as a product of contemporary Anglo-American society.,"Societies differ with respect to medical traditions. The kinds of healers and their emphases vary as a function of culture and social structure. In Western nations, a number of specialty disciplines have evolved. Psychiatry is a creation of the nineteenth century and linked to demographic and social changes of the period. Comparatively little attention has been given to the growth of Adolescent Psychiatry, a sub-discipline that has achieved definition in the last two decades. Its dependence on cultural and political economic transformations is unique insofar as it first required construction of its clientele, namely adolescence itself. The 'disorders' that are the focus of Adolescent Psychiatry appear to be very much linked symbolically and structurally to the unique social pressures impacting on this newly constructed group. The historical and cultural determinants of the developments that have culminated in the evolution of Adolescent Psychiatry are reviewed and discussed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1995 Apr,England,1995,90

The Quebec Committee on ICIDH contribution to the development of knowledge on the clarification of the relationship of disabled individual-environment and the understanding of the handicap creation process in relation with ICIDH experimentations is presented. Finally, on the basis of anthropological social research conducted in Quebec, the article illustrates a methodology for environmental analysis of the handicap situations of disabled clients in rehabilitation and social integration support programmes.",Disability and rehabilitation,1995 Apr-Jun,England,1995,90
7750377,Competence and memory: integrating psychosocial and cognitive correlates of child depression.,"Positive and negative peer nominations of multiple competencies and incidental recall of positive and negative self-referential adjectives were measured in relatively depressed and nondepressed fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-grade children (9 to 15 years old). Positive and negative peer evaluations related significantly to children's ability to recall positive and negative self-referential information (respectively), even after controlling for concurrent depressive symptoms. Positive and negative peer evaluations also related strongly to children's self-reported depressive symptoms. Incidental recall of positive and negative information significantly related to self-reported depression. In fact, the relation between recall of negative information and depression significantly increased in the eighth grade. Finally, preliminary support emerged that cognitive processes related to the incidental recall of negative self-descriptive information may mediate the relation between peer evaluations and depression. Implications for further research into the social determinants of cognitive processes and into the social and cognitive determinants of depression are discussed.",Child development,1995 Apr,United States,1995,90
7724268,An introduction to ethnic and cultural diversity.,"Ethnic and cultural diversity are important determinants of alcohol and drug use patterns and consequences. Cultural differences constitute proximal determinants of alcoholism and imply certain differences in attitudes, values, and perceptual constructs as a result of different culturally based experiences. Thus, all children and adolescents are not equal clinically; transcultural communication is necessary for effective identification, diagnosis, and management of substance use disorders. Health status antecedents to, and consequences of, substance use disorders in ethnic groups of color are examined. Drinking is explored in biological, cultural, and social contexts.",Pediatric clinics of North America,1995 Apr,United States,1995,90
7722690,Twenty-four-hour recall overestimates the dietary intake of malnourished children.,"Food intake and morbidity are the two main proximal determinants of childhood malnutrition. Intake is usually assessed through the 24-h recall method. Few studies, however, have evaluated the accuracy of this method; in particular, it is not known whether accuracy varies according to the child's nutritional status. The intake of 50 children (< 2 y old), of whom 25 were underweight (weight-for-age more than 2 SD below the National Center for Health Statistics reference), as evaluated through weighing of all foods (gold standard) and through recall. The overall intakes of energy, fat and protein were significantly greater according to the recall method than by weighing. The trend towards overestimation was more marked for malnourished children than for well-nourished children. The possibility of such bias should be taken into account in future studies.",The Journal of nutrition,1995 Apr,United States,1995,90

Of all 236 employees who started participating in the program the determinants of level of participation (high adherence, low adherence, and dropouts) during the program were studied by means of a pretest and posttest design. The questionnaire was based on different theoretical concepts. The determinants measured included the attitude toward an employee fitness program, self-efficacy expectation, and social support. The results show that there were no differences in determinants between the groups at the start of the program. During the second measurement the high- and low-adherence groups were most convinced of the benefits of participation in the program. The low-adherence group and the dropouts were least convinced of their ability to participate in a fitness program.

7613020,Antipsychotics in older patients. A safety perspective.,"Age is a major source of variation in drug response. Social, medical and physiological heterogeneity intertwines to complicate geriatric pharmacotherapy. Inappropriate and excessive use of medication may be the most significant treatable health problem in the elderly. Older people are especially sensitive to antipsychotics, which are disproportionately prescribed to them. Antipsychotic side effects and adverse reactions are intensified and protean in an older population, ranging from disabling to deadly. It is therefore essential that the use of antipsychotics be based on clear indications, guided by knowledge of both age-related and individual determinants of drug clearance and action. Prospective and frequent assessments for adverse effects are also essential.",Drugs & aging,1995 Apr,New Zealand,1995,90

Bivariate analysis is used to identify those factors that are significantly related to orientation toward help-seeking for mental disorders (use of biomedical vs traditional services), and multivariate analysis is utilized to determine the importance of each, and the effect of causal beliefs independent of sociodemographic factors. The results show that perceived cause of mental disorders, area of residence, age, ethnicity, membership in voluntary associations and prior contact with medical facilities or personnel are the most important determinants of the orientation toward help-seeking for mental disorders. The implications for an effective mental health care delivery system in Ghana are discussed. Also, suggestions for further research are made.",Social science & medicine (1982),1995 Apr,England,1995,90

Ratings of patients' behaviors and independent assessments of patients' symptomatology were used to predict the negativity of relatives in the videotaped interaction. The results indicated that severity of symptomatology was not related to relatives' negativity. Patients' social skill, as independently assessed by a role-play test, also was not associated with relatives' negativity. The regression results suggest that with both members of a patient-relative dyad, the quality of communication in a discussion is related to the other participant's level of negativity.",Psychiatry research,1995 Mar 27,Ireland,1995,90
10150529,"Early-age mortality, socio-economic development and the health system in Mongolia.","Since the 1920s Mongolia has developed an extensive and well-staffed health care system that has made modern health technologies accessible to most of its population. In addition, the country experienced rapid economic and social development whose benefits were equitably distributed among the population. In spite of this progress, infant and child mortality levels are high by contemporary standards and during the past 20 years these rates have remained virtually constant. The modern health care delivery system, externally imposed, failed to take into account the specific characteristics of the Mongolian culture; this fact is identified as one of the major determinants of the unexpected levels of early-age mortality. The excessive orientation toward curative medicine, the lack of health prevention and promotion activities and the lack of community participation have resulted in the people continuing to believe in traditional therapeutic patterns and self-care. They perceive the modern system exclusively in curative terms and not with regard to health preservation and disease prevention. Most Mongolians do not fully understand the health care system, and use its services mainly because they have no alternative, or because of coercion rather than conviction based on the learning and internalization of its basic principles. In practices and ideas of child care, preservation of health and disease prevention, people seem to identify more with the traditional health care system. Like other former socialist countries, Mongolia is experiencing deep economic and social transformations, whose implications for the health care system are discussed. An economic crisis whose end is nowhere in sight, emergent social inequalities, a vague health insurance model with unclear financing sources, and lack of concern by most policy-makers in strengthening the preventive component of the health system, are not positive factors for substantial infant and child mortality decline in the near future. A clear advantage is, however, the fact that there is a wide space for major improvements with existing internal and external resources.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1995 Apr,Australia,1995,90

Our research team has investigated several topics including: (a) conceptual models of self-management; (b) social learning factors associated with regimen adherence; (c) individual and group-based interventions to enhance diabetes self-management; (d) rates and determinants of participation in diabetes education; (e) determinants of glycemic control; and (f) patient models (beliefs) about diabetes and its treatment.We have employed a social learning theory approach to diabetes management, and over the past decade have come to adopt a broader public health perspective that addresses environmental influences on diabetes self-management at multiple levels (e.g. family, health care system, community). This approach has led us to conclude that increased attention should be devoted to the most prevalent types of diabetes, to the behavioral issues that create the most difficulty for the greatest number of patients, and to the social environment in which patients live and diabetes management education takes place. Our research focus has evolved over time and currently emphasizes: (a) assessment and tailoring of intervention based upon the patient's perspective; (b) patient-provider interactions; and (c) brief, low-cost, and system-wide interventions that can be implemented in medical office settings. Lessons learned from this research, the potential disseminability of our findings, and future directions are summarized.",Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,1995 Mar,England,1995,90

12179896,The socio-psychological factors of family planning with special reference to Iran: a theoretical appraisal.,"Iran's explosive population growth, which increases the country's population by about 1.9 million people annually, is causing a considerable strain on resources and the environment, and the coming generations will be facing a serious situation unless this trend is reversed. The strength of cultural values has not encouraged a declining population growth rate in parallel with the Iranian wave of modernization before and after the revolution. A special cultural revolution is the prerequisite for a demographic revolution. This study is placing main emphasis on the social and psychological factors involved in family planning. The general findings of surveys conducted so far demonstrate that few people know anything about family planning and methods of contraception. Social, cultural, and religious institutions seem to inhibit the expansion of family planning. Moreover, the lack of economic and social security promotes a large family size and prevents contraceptive use. However, social change in Iranian society will eventually be brought about by urbanization, industrialization, and education, and the ensuing modernization of values is expected to increase the use of contraceptives and lead to changes in the associated social and cultural institutions.",International sociology : journal of the International Sociological Association,1995 Mar,Wales,1995,90

A hierarchical discriminant function analysis was used to determine the extent to which selected variables could distinguish those who terminated their first pregnancy from those who decided to carry their first pregnancies to full term. Three individual factors (age at conception, contraceptive behavior pattern, degree of self-disclosure about the pregnancy), two family-level variables (family sexuality socialization, family income), and each of the selected social structure (access to sexual health care facilities) and sociocultural factors (religious affiliation and church attendance) were found to discriminate between the two groups. However, the discriminating power of these variables differed depending on race/ethnicity.",Youth & society,1995 Mar,United States,1995,90
8531650,Determination and control of schistosomiasis.,"The subject of this conference reflects the scientific community's interest in seeking to understand the complex causal web whose various social, economic, and biological components interact in the production and reproduction of schistosomiasis and its control in relation to community participation. From the onset, the author stresses the impossibility of dealing separately with community participation, as if social components were just one more ""weapon"" in the arsenal for schistosomiasis control. This study begins with a brief historical review of the 71 years of control activities with this endemic disease, stressing the enormous efforts and huge expenditures in this field vis-a-vis the limited results, despite the extraordinary technological development of specific, classical control inputs such as new treatment drugs and molluscicides. The article then discusses the various strategies used in control programs, emphasizing ideological consistencies and contradictions. Interactions at the macro and micro levels are discussed, as are the determinants and risk factors involved in producing the disease's endemicity. Unequal occupation of space leaves the segregated portion of the population exposed to extremely favorable conditions for transmission of the disease. This raises the issue of how to control an endemic disease which is so closely linked to the way of life imposed on the population. The study challenges the classical control model and suggests an alternative model now undergoing medium-term investigation in the States of Espirito Santo, and Pernambuco, Brazil. The author concludes that we do not need new strategies, but a new control model, contrary to the prevailing classical model in both concept and practice. From the conceptual point of view, the new model mentioned above is different from others in that schistosomiasis control is seen from a social perspective stressing the population's accumulated knowledge in addition to the building of shared knowledge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,1995 Mar-Apr,Brazil,1995,90
7853627,Determinants in Canadian health care workers of the decision to withdraw life support from the critically ill. Canadian Critical Care Trials Group.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the attitudes of health care workers regarding the withdrawal of life support. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: Attending staff, house staff, and intensive care unit (ICU) nurses in 37 Canadian university-affiliated hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health care workers' ratings of the importance of 17 factors considered in the decision to withdraw life support, and their ratings of five levels of care ranging from comfort measures to intensive care in two of 12 different clinical scenarios. RESULTS: We surveyed 1361 respondents (149 of 167 potentially eligible ICU attending staff, 142 of 173 ICU house staff, and 1070 of 1455 ICU nurses, with response rates of 89%, 82% and 74%, respectively). The most important factors were likelihood of surviving the current episode, likelihood of long-term survival, premorbid cognitive function, and age of the patient. In choosing the level of care for the patient scenarios, the same option was chosen by more than 50% of respondents in only one of 12 scenarios; opposite extremes of care were chosen by more than 10% of the respondents in eight of 12 scenarios. Respondent characteristics affecting choices included the number of years since graduation, the city and province in which they worked, the number of beds in their ICU, and their assessment of the likelihood that they would withdraw life support in comparison with their colleagues (P < .001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: While ICU health care workers consistently identify a number of patient factors as important in decisions to withdraw care, there is extreme variability, which may be explained in part by the values of individual health care providers.",JAMA,1995 Mar 1,United States,1995,90
7789476,Prospective study of risk factors for early and persistent wheezing in childhood.,"The object of this study was to determine the relative importance of low birth weight, preterm birth, low maternal age, household size, exposure to maternal smoking, personal smoking at 16 yrs of age, early termination of breastfeeding and socioeconomic status in the aetiology of wheezing illness in the first 5 yrs of life, and on the persistence of this illness at 16 yrs of age. In 15,712 children born in Britain during one week of April 1970, the occurrence of wheezing by 5 yrs of age, and of wheezing in the past year at 16 yrs of age within this group were analysed in multivariate logistic regression against each potential risk factor. The independent determinants of wheezing by 5 yrs of age were male sex, maternal smoking during pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) for 15+ cigarettes.day-1 = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.22-1.58) and low birthweight (OR for birthweight < 2.5 kg = 1.26; 95% Cl 1.07-1.50). Of children who had wheezed by 5 yrs of age, 15% reported wheezing in the past 12 months at 16 yrs of age. The persistence of symptoms at 16 yrs of age was independently related to low maternal age (OR for 20 vs 40 yrs of age = 1.96; 95% CI 1.08-3.45) and to high social status (OR for most vs least advantaged = 1.95; 95% CI 1.13-3.38). We conclude that low birth weight and maternal smoking in pregnancy are independent risk factors for early childhood wheezing, but in 85% of children with early wheezing it resolves by 16 yrs of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",The European respiratory journal,1995 Mar,England,1995,90
7787957,Prognostic factors for preoperative consultation of women desiring sterilization: findings of a retrospective analysis.,"In this exploratory study, 37 sterilized women applying for sterilization reversal were questioned thoroughly to establish why they had decided to undergo sterilization and why they now wished for it to be reversed. Taking an interactive behavioral model as our starting point, we concentrated on the psychosocial circumstances leading to the definitive decision to be sterilized. A relationship crisis at the time of sterilization was found to be a prognostically unfavorable factor. Furthermore, 20 of the 37 patients cited new partnerships as their main reason for seeking reversal. Those who felt pressurized by their gynecologist or partner into undergoing sterilization had significantly more problems in overcoming the psychological stress accompanying such an operation than those who, through a series of consultations on contraception, had had sufficient time and opportunity to make their own decisions. Sterilization performed for medical reasons was found to have particularly problematical consequences, especially where the doctor had made the decision largely on his own, failing to give an adequate explanation for the medical necessity of the operation. Regarding the time chosen for sterilization, the study revealed that the patient's postoperative psychological condition was significantly worse when sterilization was carried out immediately after a delivery, after abortion or after Caesarean section, rather than in the interval between pregnancies. The resulting increase in the incidence of psychosomatic complaints and depressive states is also confirmed in the literature. The findings of this study offer practical suggestions for improved preoperative consultation and should help to determine the course of action to be taken when a patient wishes to be sterilized.",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,1995 Mar,England,1995,90

7749646,[Health evaluation and promotion. State of the art across the international literature].,"UNLABELLED: Ten years after its emergence on the international scene, Health Promotion remains a marginal concept, even it its diffusion continues in practice. Resting on an ecological model of health that stresses the importance of interactions between the individual or group and the physical and social environment, health promotion aims to reduce the inequalities concerning health and access to care. The evaluation of health promotion actions suffers from a double handicap (or benefits from a double advantage?): the newness of the concept of health promotion and the relative novelty of using systematic evaluation practices for health actions. To carry out the inquiry of evaluation and health promotion, several public health data bases were consulted, both French and foreign, crossing evaluation and health promotion. It was noted that a degree of assimilation had occurred between health promotion and health education, and thus the research was enlarged by crossing evaluation with health education, community health and prevention. Only one article made specific reference to any of the five strategies delineated in the Ottawa Charter, and it appeared from the existing literature that health promotion in real life seems to have a meaning-confirmed by general practice--somehow reduced compared with the ambitions of the text to reduce inequalities in health and to allow the mastery and control by the population of the determinants of health.

7735729,Family support and coping with cancer: some determinants and adaptive correlates.,"This paper studies the interrelationships between the coping behaviours of cancer patients and perceived amount and adequacy of family support, as well as the issue of how these predict psychosocial adjustment to cancer. Based on questionnaire data from a sample of 169 patients with cancers of various sites, three questions were considered in detail: (1) How might cognitive and behavioural modes of coping with cancer affect perceptions of support provided by one's family in terms of the amount as well as adequacy of various supportive acts? (2) Are coping modes to be considered when explaining inter-individual differences in perceived support adequacy, or can these differences be reduced to differences in amount of support? (3) Can distinct patterns of family support and coping preferences be identified and, if so, how do these patterns differ in indicators of psychosocial adjustment to cancer? Results suggest that cognitive strategies of coping may be more effective in 'mobilizing' family support than behavioural strategies. Moreover, the perceived adequacy of various support modes proves to be influenced by cognitive coping preferences independent of perceived amounts of support. Finally, results from cluster analyses point to a particular coping-support pattern identified as 'highly risky'. This pattern is characterized by generalized support deficits, strong tendencies towards rumination, and weak tendencies towards minimizing disease-related threat. The findings are discussed from an interactional perspective on support processes and with regard to implications for psychological intervention in cancer patients.",The British journal of social psychology,1995 Mar,England,1995,90
7728557,Mass childhood immunization: some ethical doubts for primary health care workers.,"The mass childhood immunization programme has traditionally been viewed as a safe and effective preventative measure by health promoters, primary health care professionals and governments. This consensus has meant that immunization has rarely been viewed as ethically problematic. A number of recent changes in the context of the delivery of health care, particularly the emphasis on consumerism and the effect of the marketization of services, makes timely an examination of ethical, social and political issues. This article examines four main grounds for problematizing the mass childhood immunization programme. These are: clinical research evidence about the safety and efficacy of vaccines; the masking of wider social and political determinants of ill health; the contradictory strictures about collective and individual rights in relation to immunization; and the uniqueness of childhood immunization as a physical intrusion into a healthy body. The implications of these ethical issues are discussed in relation to informed consent and the need for a 'greenfield' review that includes the views of dissenting parents, lawyers and moral philosophers, as well as health professionals.",Nursing ethics,1995 Mar,England,1995,90

Results from a retrospective study].,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to investigate the possible clinical and symptomatological determinants of social outcome in schizophrenic patients. METHOD: 40 schizophrenic patients (DSMIII-R), 21 males and 19 females, mean age 4 +/- 5 years, have been evaluated in the present retrospective study. All of them had first undergone psychiatric hospitalization between 1978 and 1981. The following data have been collected: socio-anagraphic features and course of the illness (AMDP), contacts with community health centre and pharmacological compliance. Social disability has been investigated by means of a semi-structured interview developed from the ""Disability Assessment Schedule"" named ""Accertamento Disabilita e Carico Familiare"" (ADC), which has been administered to the main carer, usually a cohabitant relative. Presence and level of social support have also been evaluated. One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), ""t"" test with Bonferroni correction and Pearson Correlation test have been used for data analysis. RESULTS: Patients with less severe social disability (lower scores at ADC) were mainly those with recurrent course of illness without residual symptoms or remitted ones (p = 0.0001), better pharmacological compliance (p = 0.004), more frequent and regular contacts with community health centres (p = 0.0001) and better social support (p = 0.01).

Symptom frequency and symptom distress, and self-care agency were measured by the Transplant Symptom Frequency and Symptom Distress Scale, and the Appraisal for Self-Care Agency Scale, respectively. The Long-Term Medication Behavior Self-Efficacy Scale and a renal transplant knowledge questionnaire were developed as part of this study to measure perceived self-efficacy and knowledge of the therapeutic regimen. Demographic variables were also measured. The incidence of subclinical noncompliance with immunosuppressive therapy as assessed by interview was 22.3%. Compliers and noncompliers differed significantly on the variables of marital status (P = 0.03), situational-operational knowledge (P = 0.02), self-care agency (P = 0.03), and perceived self-efficacy related to long-term medication intake (P = 0.048). A logistic regression model using gender, marital status, perceived self-efficacy, self-care agency, knowledge about medication administration and signs of infection, and situational operational knowledge as predictor variables, revealed a 78.6% correct classification of compliers versus noncompliers and a sensitivity ratio of 95.9%. There were significantly more acute late rejection episodes (P = 0.003) in the noncompliant group. Graft survival at 5 years in this group was also significantly lower (P = 0.03) than the compliant patients. No significant difference was found in terms of the occurrence of chronic rejection episodes or in terms of patient survival at 5 years. Because noncompliance is a risk factor for negative clinical outcome in renal transplant recipients, it is of utmost importance to develop intervention strategies to enhance compliance in this population by using determinants identified in exploratory studies.",Transplantation,1995 Feb 15,United States,1995,90

Pattern, predictors, and impact on everyday life in a 4-year follow-up.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the evolution of cognitive dysfunction in early-onset multiple sclerosis, to identify clinical predictors of mental decline, and to determine its impact on a patient's everyday life. DESIGN: The cognitive performance of 50 patients with multiple sclerosis on a neuropsychological battery was compared with that of 70 control subjects initially and again after a 4-year interval. Clinical predictors of cognitive impairment and its effect on daily life were analyzed by stepwise linear regression. SETTING: The research clinic of a university department of neurology. PARTICIPANTS: A consecutive sample of 50 inpatients and outpatients with multiple sclerosis (mean disease duration, 1.58 years) and 70 demographically matched healthy control subjects selected from the patients' relatives and friends. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean psychometric test scores of both groups at the initial and follow-up testing. Regression coefficients measuring the relationship between clinical parameters and cognitive capacity and between mental decline and performance of common tasks measured by the Environmental and the Incapacity Status scales. RESULTS: Multiple sclerosis-related deficits in verbal memory and abstract reasoning on initial testing remained more or less stable on the retest, at which time linguistic disturbances on the Set and Token tests also emerged. A patient's initial disability level predicted decreased performance on only four of 13 cognitive variables, and disease duration did so on only two. Extent of intellectual decline on initial testing, initial disability level, and progressive course were independent determinants of handicap in a patient's work and social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and neurological deficits appear not to develop in parallel. Yet cognitive dysfunction proves to be a predictor of handicap in everyday life, even in patients in the incipient phase of multiple sclerosis.",Archives of neurology,1995 Feb,United States,1995,90

PARTICIPANTS: 417 community-dwelling subjects and 200 nursing home residents aged 62-98 years. MEASUREMENTS: Self-perceived physical function was assessed with the physical dimension summary score of the Sickness Impact Profile, which comprises three subscales: ambulation, mobility, and body care and movement. Physical performance was evaluated by self-selected gait speed, chair-stand time, maximal grip strength, and a balance score. RESULTS: Nursing home residents and community-dwellers were significantly different (P < .0001) in all variables except age and gender. Self-perceived and performance-based measures were moderately correlated, with a range from r = -.194 to r = -.625 (P < .05). Gait speed was the strongest independent predictor of self-perceived physical function in both groups. Symptoms of depression were also an independent predictor of self-perceived function in nursing home residents; subjects who had such symptoms report more self-perceived dysfunction than would be predicted based on performance tests. CONCLUSIONS: Self-selected gait speed is a global indicator of self-perceived physical function over a broad range of abilities. External determinants (depressive symptoms, cognitive function, marital status, etc.) affect self-perceived function in both groups, but gait speed is the greatest single predictor of self-perceived function. In nursing home residents depressive symptomatology is related to self-perceived.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,1995 Feb,United States,1995,90
7775670,Personal risk factors for generalized periodontitis.,"Periodontitis is generally considered to be a consequence of an unfavourable host-parasite interaction in which bacteria are the determinants of disease. An intense search continues for the bacteria, specific or non-specific, that are responsible for periodontitis and various forms of the periodontal diseases have been associated with, and are widely believed to be caused by, specific bacterial groups. However, the distribution of periodontopathic bacteria is far wider than the distribution of periodontitis, indicating that the association between bacteria and periodontitis is weak. This paper proposes a paradigm for the etiology of generalized periodontitis in which 'host' factors are not only those triggered by bacteria (the agent) but are also those personal factors that influence the outcome of the host/parasite relationship. The personal factors that diminish the efficiency of host defense may include psycho-social stress from the social environment, factors from the lifestyle such as diet, smoking and alcoholism and systemic factors such as intercurrent disease or deficiencies within the immune/inflammatory system. A model is described in which the interaction of personal factors with the social environment provides the potential for the initiation of periodontitis. Biological variation is significant and the combination of factors that cause generalized periodontitis or any other chronic disease in one individual may not result in dental or any other chronic disease in another.",Journal of clinical periodontology,1995 Feb,United States,1995,90
7738955,The natural history of juvenile chronic arthritis: a population based cohort study. II. Outcome.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcome in a population based cohort of patients with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) who were in the process of being transferred from pediatric to adult rheumatology care. METHODS: The cohort of patients born in 1968 through 1972, recruited from a population based epidemiological study in southwestern Sweden, were called to a followup after a median disease duration of 7.1 years. The study group consisted of 124 patients with a median age of 17.7 years. The disability and discomfort dimensions were evaluated using the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ). The impact of the disease on social life was evaluated by patients and parents. RESULTS: The median C-HAQ disability index was 0.19 with a range from 0 to 2.75 (maximum possible score = 3). Sixty percent of the patients indicated some difficulty in daily activities. Female sex and a polyarticular disease course were risk factors for disability. The strongest determinants for disability were continuing disease activity and a positive IgM rheumatoid factor. Social impact of the disease was strongly linked to a raised C-HAQ disability index. CONCLUSION: Even in a population based study of JCA, which includes many mild cases, the majority of patients experienced some difficulty in daily activities when judged by themselves. This underlines the necessity to use the patient's own values in outcome studies, rather than the physician's. Further development of internationally accepted, standardized instruments to evaluate the handicap dimension of childhood arthritis is called for.",The Journal of rheumatology,1995 Feb,Canada,1995,90
7722064,Three-year tooth loss among black and white older adults in North Carolina.,"The distribution and determinants of tooth loss in older adults are poorly defined, especially in Blacks, who have been underrepresented in previous studies. This study investigated, epidemiologically, the distribution and predictors of tooth loss in elder Blacks and Whites by following a random sample of older adults in North Carolina for three years. It was hypothesized that Blacks would be at greater risk of tooth loss and would have different risk factors for tooth loss. Data from 263 Blacks and 228 Whites were collected by dental examinations and interviews conducted in the participants' homes. During the three-year follow-up, 53% of Blacks and 29% of Whites lost at least one tooth. Blacks lost 13% of their remaining teeth compared with 4% for Whites. Logistic regression models showed that factors related to tooth loss for Blacks were: more S. mutans in stimulated saliva, deeper periodontal pockets, more P. intermedia in subgingival plaque, high blood pressure, limited help from others, and few symptoms of depression. For Whites, significant factors were: more lactobacilli in stimulated saliva, history of current oral pain at baseline, more alcohol consumption, no history of past use of calcium or xerostomic medications, higher income, lower occupational prestige, and increased numbers of negative life events. This study showed that older Blacks were at greater risk of tooth loss than older Whites. For both races, factors such as oral bacteria, periodontal conditions, oral symptoms, and psychosocial and economic factors are related to increased risk of tooth loss.",Journal of dental research,1995 Feb,United States,1995,90
7714297,Determinants of changes in nurses' behaviour after continuing education: a literature review.,"Nursing continuing-education programmes may differ in the extent to which they affect nursing practice. Differences may be explained by characteristics of the participants' background, the programme itself, teacher(s), relationship between participants, relationship between participants and teacher(s), physical environment during the programme, participants' social system, knowledge, skills and attitudes, and intention to change. In this literature review, a model is presented which integrates these variables and which may be used to explain why continuing-education programmes have no, little or considerable effect. On the basis of current scientific knowledge, colleagues' and superiors' support emerges as the most important determinant of behavioural changes in nursing practice.",Journal of advanced nursing,1995 Feb,England,1995,90
7703815,A comparison of the determinants of safe injecting and condom use among injecting drug users.,"A sample of 582 injecting drug users were interviewed as part of an evaluation of an AIDS prevention programme for drug users. This paper examines the biographic and predispositional determinants of five HIV preventive behaviours--equipment sharing (not receiving and not giving) and and condom use (with regular partners, casual partners and sex clients). A two-stage sequential approach was adopted for a logistic regression analysis. Initially, to model each of the five preventive behaviours, biographical and drug use variables were entered. In a second set of models, behavioural predisposition factors were included. Age, drug use and prison experience correlate with variables in both models, although not consistently in the same direction. While a predisposition to reject sharing correlates with safer rejecting and condom use, the predisposition to safer sex only correlates with condom use. Needle exchange programmes that only target the individual would seem to be inadequate. To enhance targeted interventions changes in public and agency policy that create a social environment conductive to behaviour change are required.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1995 Feb,England,1995,90
7825630,Androgens and sexuality.,"A review of the literature reveals that the endocrine determinants of female sexuality are complex and difficult to characterize. In adolescent males, free testosterone directly affects sexual motivation, with social factors exerting little or no effect. In adolescent girls, by contrast, societal and peer pressure play a pivotal role in the appearance of certain sexual behaviors. Throughout a woman's life, hormonal and psychosocial factors are critical influences. It is possible that cyclic patterns of testosterone are less important for female sexual behavior than the ""tonic"" effect of overall testosterone levels. Although the estrogen dependence of the vaginal epithelium--important for postmenopausal women--has been clearly established, the role of other hormonal factors and treatments, particularly those involving androgens, in human female sexual behavior remains enigmatic. The search for an understanding of these relationships is not merely an interesting academic exercise but is necessary to determine what role, if any, androgens may play in the treatment of sexual dysfunction during the female reproductive years.",The American journal of medicine,1995 Jan 16,United States,1995,90
10140222,Health care reform. Pan American Uni-Care Health Insurance Plan.,"Something is definitely wrong with the American health care system. Too many citizens are denied health care, and health care costs continue to rise at an uncomfortable and intolerable rate. Ensuring care for all is a paramount goal. There is no way to simultaneously cover everyone; leave the reimbursement of physicians unrestrained; ensure instantaneous access to every imaginable high-technology service; subsidize the world's costliest and least efficient health bureaucracy; and contain costs. Widespread dissatisfaction in all quarters--physicians, hospitals, third-party payers, regulators and consumers--has led to an avalanche of reform proposals. Rapidly changing social, political, and economic environments; rising fiscal pressure; and an evolving understanding of the major determinants of health have also created pressure for changes. There are some new and hopeful signs that America is facing up to the need for changes in the health care delivery system. The Pan American Uni-Care Health Plan that is described in this article may serve as a reasonable balance among these competing priorities.",Physician executive,1995 Feb,United States,1995,90

A specially designed questionnaire interview was completed, and a total number of 3475 stool samples were examined. The results revealed a prevalence rate of fascioliasis of 11% in the studied area which was only second to S. mansoni. The prevalence of infection was significantly higher among females in general and specifically in the age group 5 to less than 15 years and 25 to less than 35 years. Family aggregation of fasciola infection was noticed among the studied group. The prevalence and also the risk of infection were significantly higher among children whose mothers were infected. They were, however, insignificantly higher among illiterate, single males, and low social class group. In addition, the prevalence and risk of infection were significantly higher among individuals obtaining their raw green leafy vegetables from multiple sources. From the results it was concluded that human fascioliasis is an important public health problem in Abis area with increased risk of spread of infection to Alexandria city through raw green leafy vegetables which represent the main source of infection.",The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association,1995,England,1995,90

Due to the school's pivotal role in our society, an emphasis is placed on how our schools contribute to antisocial behavior, and what educators can do to prevent anti-social behavior and related attendance problems. A variety of contextual factors and setting events within our schools appear to be major contributors to antisocial behavior, and some of the same factors identified within the schools also have been identified within the home. These setting events, rather than quick restrictive fixes, must be given more attention if we are to provide safe school environments-environments that durably prevent antisocial behavior and related attendance problems.",Journal of applied behavior analysis,1995 Winter,United States,1995,90

12320572,Demographics and the pension system.,"""Italian demographic evolution closely resembles that of the other leading European countries, although with some distinctive features, such as a lower birth rate, more rapid population aging and fewer immigrants. Projections for the next two or three decades point to accelerating expansion of the aged population, especially of the very old, and a contraction of the working age population after the turn of the century. However, there are also unknowns involved in the demographic evolution of the aged population, turning on the speed of the decline in senile mortality in the decades to come and the possible effects on the health of the elderly population, hence on the demand for social services, considering among other things changing family patterns. There is broad agreement that the birth rate is now too low, that this could have serious long-run repercussions on relations between generations and on intergenerational transfers, and that there is room for social policy action to influence the reproductive choices of couples. This article examines several possible reproductive models and discusses the foundations for action and the potential policy contradictions.""",Review of economic conditions in Italy,1995 Jan-Jun,Italy,1995,90

Increasing flows of labor within the region, however, raise questions about three important issues: (1) the assumption that trade, investment and aid will eventually mitigate migration pressure in source countries and the effectiveness of migration policies based on that assumption; (2) whether increasing regional interdependence stimulates or deters migration; [and] (3) the effect of rising interdependence on the political and international relations aspects of migration. As a partial attempt to address these questions, this article examines the regional pattern of economic interdependence by utilizing information concerning trade, investment and migration flows.

This analysis, using an analytical model derived from the household utility framework, adds to previous research by presenting race- and residence-specific estimates of how individual characteristics, history of abortion, and the community-based factors determine women's choices of giving birth vs. aborting. The main data for estimating the model were drawn from the 1984 vital statistics of all induced abortions and live births in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The major findings indicate that low parental education, high maternal age, previous early abortions, and the availability of abortion providers all significantly reduce the probability of choosing the live birth option. Married status and the availability of family planning clinics significantly increase the probability of the live birth option. The findings also suggest that women's choices between abortion and live birth vary substantially with race (White vs. Black) and residential (urban vs. rural) location.",Journal of population economics,1995,Germany,1995,90

There has been a proliferation of studies, such as the determinants of individual competence or threat to self or others, the results of which are influencing policy and legislative decisions as well as buttressing holdings in court cases. In this article, I explore the issues of interpretation of epidemiological studies, particularly the role of ideological positions on the design and results of empirical findings, the importance of the way data are interpreted, and the role of ideologies in the way research findings are presented to provide support for policy positions. Two levels of analysis are involved in determining the validity of a study. The first addresses the questions of whether the study meets the statistical and epidemiological requirements for reliable results. These include considerations such as the appropriateness of the study design and methods for gathering and interpreting data. The second focuses on the underlying framework of the study. This involves factors such as the perspectives and values of those conducting the study, the explicit and implicit dominating ideologies where they operate, and the extent to which the study is constructed to reaffirm specific ideologies. This level of analysis is essential for disclosing the influences of ideologies on the results of studies and the way in which data are interpreted. In this article, I try to demonstrate through critiques of selected studies that the first stage of analysis is insufficient without an examination of underlying preconceived values to establish the meaningfulness of results.",Ethics & behavior,1995,United States,1995,90

Belief in the physical cause of epilepsy and the participation of social network in decision making were, on the other hand, closely associated with the choice of practitioners of modern medicine. The time-lag between onset of illness and first contact for treatment was short when indigenous healers were consulted first, however these patients usually took a long time to reach the referral centre when they passed through the indigenous healers.",The International journal of social psychiatry,1995 Autumn,England,1995,90
8847107,Physical workload and the aging worker: a review of the literature.,"In the coming decades, demographic, economic and social changes will result in an increased proportion of elderly persons in the workforce in most industrialized countries. This trend is causing growing interest in the problems of the aging worker in current employment. The objective of this particular paper is to provide more insight into the impact of aging on the balance between physical work capacity and physical workload. To this end, the scientific literature in the field is reviewed and ordered by means of a specific conceptual model of ""aging and physical workload"". A progressive decline in physical work capacity, characterized by diminished aerobic capacity and muscular capacity, has consistently been reported. However, inter-individual differences appear to be considerable. The question of whether there are systematic differences in physical work demands between younger and older workers within occupations has been answered vaguely. Conflicting results in this matter bring into discussion the role of the actual working method as one of the determinants of the physical workload. An age-related imbalance between physical workload and physical work capacity is suggested to result in a chronic overload, increasing the risk of long-term health effects such as musculoskeletal complaints and disorders. For many aging workers in physically demanding occupations, extreme physical workloads, increasing the risk of disease or disablement, are still reported. The multiconceptual study of aging and physical workload in the present paper reveals several possibilities for preventive measures. However, as information is still lacking, additional research is needed, in particular on the onset and development of long-term effects on health in relation to age and work demands.",International archives of occupational and environmental health,1995,Germany,1995,90

Male latex condoms offer substantial protection against HIV infection. Women at risk of sexual acquisition of HIV infection need one or more prophylactic methods that they can control. While the available spermicide products may serve this purpose, current data do not allow firm casual inferences. Large and well designed epidemiologic studies are required to examine the association between female use of barrier methods and HIV infection. These are difficult and costly to perform, however, and to date have yielded conflicting results. Finally, prospective studies in high-incidence cohorts are necessary, and the relationships between spermicide use, local irritation, the vaginal flora and HIV incidence rates must be clarified.","AIDS (London, England)",1995,England,1995,90

We synthesize recent empirical evidence on factors affecting trends in applications and awards for Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and duration on the rolls. Econometric analyses of pooled time-series, cross-sectional data for States provide strong evidence of business cycle effects on applications and, to a lesser extent, on awards. Substantial effects of cutbacks in State general assistance programs are also found, especially for SSI. Estimated effects of the aging of the baby boomers, growth in the share of women who are disability insured, the AIDS epidemic, and changes in family structure are also presented. Indirect evidence suggests the importance of programmatic factors, especially for awards, and especially in the mental and musculoskeletal impairment categories. The decline in the average age of new awardees has substantially increased duration, particularly for SSI. As a result, caseload growth would be expected to continue even in the absence of future award growth.",Social security bulletin,1995 Winter,United States,1995,90

Health education goals need to be matched to the different developmental stages of drug use behaviours of subgroups in the population. Employment perspectives for school leavers form an essential ingredient of policies which aim to reduce the demand for 'hard' drugs in order to divert (young) people from drug careers. Primary preventive strategies form the backbone of public policies focused on reduction of demand for hard drugs. Primary preventive strategies are population based and implemented by the public and private sector. Secondary preventive strategies are focused on specific high-risk groups and aim to prevent the development of drug dependence and/or to reduce harm for drug users. Tertiary preventive strategies are directed at individual hard drug users and emphasize harm reduction and rehabilitation of drug users and seek to reduce the side-effects of problematic hard drugs use for the general population. Innovative applied research is needed to improve field methods for timely detection of problematic hard drug use. More information about 'invisible' (hidden) populations of integrated drug users may offer new insights and ingredients for preventive policies on hard drugs.,Medicine and law,1995,United States,1995,90
7900432,Malnutrition of children in Sikasso (Mali): prevalence and socio-economic determinants.,"BACKGROUND: Malnutrition of children is a major public health problem in many African countries. Despite a relatively favourable geographical situation, the prevalence of malnutrition is high in the Sikasso region (Mali). METHODS: Survey repeated annually during 5 years, to a sample of 491 families living in Sikasso. The determinants of wasting and stunting were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of stunting was about 25%. Prevalence of wasting was about 12%, which is very high, and had been increasing in the past years. No strong associations with socio-economic factors were observed for wasting. Stunting was strongly associated with the education level of both parents, and with the family assets.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1995,Switzerland,1995,90
7892613,"Social skills in schizophrenia: assessing the relationship between social skills, psychopathology and community functioning.","Social skills training (SST) has been widely used in attempts to rehabilitate chronic schizophrenic patients. The key assumption underlying SST is that social skills deficits are important determinants of the social isolation, poor social role functioning, and low quality of life characteristic of schizophrenic patients. To test this assumption, 89 patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia were assessed on behavioural and self-report measures of social skills. A structured clinical interview, a self-report inventory of distress during social interaction, and self-monitoring of time in social interaction were used to assess social functioning. Positive psychotic symptoms were assessed in a standardised clinical interview. A structural equation modelling analysis showed that observed social skills predicted social functioning, and that this association was statistically independent of severity of psychotic symptoms. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that social skills are important in the social functioning of patients with schizophrenia.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1995 Jan,Germany,1995,90
7882876,Drinking and unemployment: contrasting patterns among men and women.,"Research on unemployment has paid only little attention to drinking and drinking problems. From the 1970s onwards the association of drinking and unemployment has come under systematic study. Contrasting tendencies emerge from this research. This paper distinguishes three instances of drinking and drinking problems and examines their association with employment status, i.e., (i) frequency of drinking, (ii) frequency of intoxication, and (iii) frequency of health problems due to drinking. A panel survey was conducted in 1983-1984, consisting of a sample of Finnish men and women, originally jobseekers in industry. Prevalence data and results of logistic regression analyses on the association of the three instances of drinking and drinking problems with employment status are presented. The frequency of drinking was unassociated with employment status for men and women at either of the two measurement points. Neither did the frequency of intoxication show any clear association with employment status. In contrast, the frequency of health problems due to drinking was associated in a statistically significant way with unemployment among men. Among women the association was rather the opposite, but it was not statistically significant. The paper concludes that it is important to distinguish between overall drinking and drinking problems, and between the determinants of male and female drinking problems. It is likely that selective processes at the labour market as well as social causation during unemployment lie behind the observed association of male unemployment and drinking problems.",Drug and alcohol dependence,1995 Jan,Ireland,1995,90

The logistic binomial analysis shows that socioeconomic factors are significant even during the neonatal period while the length of the preceding birth interval is significant in the post-neonatal period only. There is a strong familial correlation of mortality risks during both the neonatal and post-neonatal periods but the effect of geographical area of residence is stronger in the post-neonatal period.,Journal of biosocial science,1995 Jan,England,1995,90

Only seventeen of 239 (7.1%) nulliparae had ever used an FP method, compared with 170 of 434 (39.2%) parous subjects. Education of mother and of husband were independently and significantly associated with FP ever-use. Seventeen (4.9%) of 347 women who had a surviving child, had not breast-fed the child. The interval between the birth of the surviving child and the start of the index pregnancy was significantly associated with the duration of breast-feeding; the longer the duration of breast-feeding, the longer the inter birth interval.",Journal of biosocial science,1995 Jan,England,1995,90

Verbal protocols, multivariate analysis of survey data, and laboratory experimentation revealed that (1) people's theories of the causes of attitude importance pointed to all 3 hypothesized predictors, (2) the 3 predictors each had significant, unique statistical associations with importance, and (3) a manipulation of self-interest yielded a corresponding change in importance. These results help clarify the nature and origins of attitude importance, challenge the widely believed claim that self-interest has little or no impact on political cognition, and identify new likely consequences of social identification processes and values.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1995 Jan,United States,1995,90
7798578,Moderators and determinants of satisfaction with diet counseling for patients consuming a therapeutic diet.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify moderators and key determinants of patient satisfaction with diet counseling. DESIGN: Survey questionnaire. SETTING: A French-Canadian acute-care urban hospital. SUBJECTS: Population of eligible patients hospitalized for a minimum stay of 5 days. Patients excluded from the study were those with notable physical, cognitive, or emotional limitations; those receiving enteral and parenteral nutrition; and those from long-term-care units. Analyses were performed on 49 patients who consumed a therapeutic diet and who received diet counseling during their current hospital stay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall satisfaction with diet counseling, compliance intentions, and satisfaction with four components of diet counseling. Measures were taken on seven-point graphic scales and five-point semantic scales. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Reliability estimates with Cronbach's alpha correlation coefficient, stepwise multiple regression analyses, t tests, and one-way analyses of variance. RESULTS: Facilitation skills and knowledge components of diet counseling were the key determinants of patient satisfaction. Among the moderators of patient satisfaction with diet counseling, women and patients with a good appetite were more satisfied with the knowledge components and had stronger compliance intentions. Patients who spent more than 50% of the time at rest were less satisfied than more active patients. APPLICATIONS: Enhancing patient satisfaction implies having a good understanding of a patient's social and cultural context, developing problem-solving skills, and demonstrating greater flexibility and creativity about the means of providing diet counseling.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1995 Jan,United States,1995,90
7792367,Determinants of the help-seeking process: Goldberg and Huxley's first level and first filter.,"This paper discusses minor psychiatric morbidity in the community and its relation to help-seeking. The research is aimed at identifying the demographic and social characteristics that enhance the likelihood of minor psychiatric morbidity, as measured by the General Health Questionnaire, and to reveal how these determinants relate to health status. In the second stage of the study, the same characteristics are related to their effect on the decision to decision to consult a general practitioner and, specifically, on presenting psycho-social problems to the GP. At the population level, the likelihood of a high GHQ score was greater for women, divorced persons and the unemployed, other variables remaining equal. However, GHQ score was contaminated by poor subjective health perception, especially for unemployed persons. Chronic physical illness did not have an independent effect on the GHQ score. Chronic physical illness did influence help-seeking. In addition, several socio-demographic characteristics showed an independent effect on consulting behaviour for both GHQ-positive and GHQ-negative patients. Women, unemployed persons and publicly insured patients with a minor psychiatric disturbance were more apt to visit their GP, regardless of their physical health status. However, no socio-demographic characteristics increased the likelihood that a GHQ-positive patient would present unambiguous psycho-social complaints as a reason to see their doctor.",Psychological medicine,1995 Jan,England,1995,90
7785474,Evaluating multiple outcomes and gender differences in alcoholism treatment.,"This study followed 592 alcoholics (180 women and 412 men) after discharge from inpatient treatment. Multiple measures of treatment outcome were used to broaden our understanding of the process of recovery from alcohol abuse, and how that process differs for men and women. Patients were interviewed by telephone between 3 and 15 months after discharge to gather information about post-treatment experiences including: relationship with family, role performance, psychological impairment, and effort toward recovery. Additionally, if any alcohol use took place after treatment, information was collected about the pattern of alcohol consumption. Results indicated being married is consistently related to less drinking for men, while for women, being married contributes to relapse in the short term. The determinants of each measure of outcome were different for women and men, indicating that the process of recovery is not the same for both genders. The study confirms that drinking is related to other adverse outcomes for men, but not necessarily for women. It is evidence that women and men have different post-treatment functioning, and that different characteristics are predictive of these outcomes.",Addictive behaviors,1995 Jan-Feb,England,1995,90
7770318,Comparison of HIV+ and HIV- adolescents: risk factors and psychosocial determinants.,"According to the World Health Organization, half of the 14 million people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide were infected between the ages of 15 and 24 years. However, details about HIV-positive (HIV+) youths' risk-related behavior and social context have not been previously reported. OBJECTIVES. To outline detailed sexual and drug use practices, social and psychological status of HIV+ youth compared with a cohort of HIV-negative (HIV-) youth; and to examine the ability of the health belief and risk-taking models to predict sexual and drug use acts of HIV+ youth. METHODS. HIV testing was conducted on and a 207-item structured interview covering HIV risk-related acts, protective factors and background information was administered to 72 HIV+ and 1142 HIV- adolescents aged 13 through 21 years receiving care in an adolescent clinical care unit of a large medical center in New York City. Data were analyzed for adolescents reporting sexual intercourse (71 HIV+ and 722 HIV-) by logistic regression analysis of five domains to identify variables significantly associated with HIV seropositivity. RESULTS. Logistic regressions indicated significant differences in sexual risk acts based on serostatus and gender. Anonymous, blinded seroprevalence testing identified 11% more HIV+ adolescents than would have been identified by current counseling and testing practices. HIV+ adolescents were significantly more likely to be sexually abused (33 vs 21%, P < .05), engage in anal sex and survival sex (32 vs 4%, P < .01), unprotected sex with casual partners (42 vs 23%, P < .05), have had sex under the influence of drugs (52 vs 27%, P < .01), have a sexually transmitted disease (59 vs 28%, P < .01), use multiple drugs (43 vs 9%, P < .01) and engage in multiple problem behaviors (72 vs 30%, P < .01) than HIV- young people. HIV+ females reported more oral (69 vs 45%, P < .01) and/or anal (42 vs 12%, P < .01) intercourse compared to HIV- females. HIV+ males reported significantly higher rates of both insertive (82 vs 46%, P < .05) and receptive (51 vs 4%, P < .01) oral and anal (53 vs 13%, P < .01) intercourse than HIV- males. Protective factors were not significantly different for HIV+ and HIV- young people. CONCLUSIONS. Routine, confidential HIV counseling and testing should be considered for adolescents having unprotected sexual intercourse when age-specific services are available for HIV+ youth. Prevention programs should consider adolescents' history of abuse, homelessness, and other social as well as psychological dimensions in designing comprehensive care strategies to address HIV+ adolescents' multiple problem behaviors and living situations. Current theoretical models of health behaviors should be reconsidered, given the lack of their association to HIV risk acts of HIV+ youth. Age-specific services and interventions for HIV+ youth are urgently needed as HIV is spreading among youth worldwide.",Pediatrics,1995 Jan,United States,1995,90
7742341,Self-esteem and value of health as determinants of adolescent health behavior.,"PURPOSE: To study the relationship between personality attributes and health behaviors and practices during adolescence. DESIGN: We have studied a total of 100 subjects aged 12-13 and 16-17 years of both sexes. To examine self-esteem and the value of health in a series of habitual practices of health, a stepwise multiple regression analysis was undertaken. The instruments used were the Gordon Personal Profile (GPP) (1978) to evaluate self-esteem, the Costa et al.'s (1989) Value of Health Scale to estimate the value of health and, the Rivas Torres (1991) Health Behavior Questionnaire to measure health behavior. RESULTS: Self-esteem explains 39% of the mental health behavior and 5% of the social health behaviors. Meanwhile, the value of health, in the case of security behaviors, explains 13%, and in relation to personal health behaviors, 9%. CONCLUSIONS: The importance assigned to certain personality attributes in relation to adolescent health behavior shows the need for additional investigations that incorporate other variables and subject groups with different ages.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1995 Jan,United States,1995,90
7676866,Psychosocial variables associated with teenage pregnancy.,"This study investigated whether psychosocial factors differentiate sexually active teenagers who become pregnant from those who do not. Data were collected from 64 unmarried adolescents who attended a suburban health clinic for a pregnancy test or for contraceptive care. Thirty-nine percent of the sample had been or were now pregnant, and 61% had never been pregnant. Each teenager completed a questionnaire and three self-report measures (Life Events Checklist, Self-Worth, Health Locus of Control) prior to her medical visit. Information about family, medical, and psychosocial history was obtained from chart review. When girls who had positive pregnancy tests, and sexually active girls who had never been pregnant were compared, no significant differences emerged on socioeconomic status, race, religion, age or psychological variables. However, when adolescents with a previous or current history of pregnancy (N = 25) were compared with girls who had never been pregnant (N = 39), using the Mann Whitney test, two significant differences were found: adolescents with a history of pregnancy had first intercourse at the mean age of 15 rather than 16 (p < .02) and scored higher than never-pregnant teenagers on the ""Powerful Other"" Health Locus of Control subscale, a measure of strong belief in external control by others (p < .01). No significant differences were detected between the groups for self-worth or life events perceived as stressful during the past year. These data indicate that in a middle-class suburban population of sexually active teenagers, earlier age at first intercourse and the influence of powerful others are important variables associated with pregnancy.",Adolescence,1995 Summer,United States,1995,90

For both men and women the highest risk occupations are mostly in Social Class I or II. The occupations at highest risk, which include several medical-related professions, and the method of suicide they choose, suggest that easy access to means of suicide is an important factor.

7639909,"The population survey as a tool for assessing family health in the Keewatin region, NWT, Canada.","The population survey is an important tool in community health assessment, including the physical and psychological aspects of family health. It provides data on health status and health determinants not available from vital statistics and health service utilization. The Keewatin Health Assessment Study (KHAS), which was designed in collaboration with the Keewatin Regional Health Board (KRHB), surveyed a representative sample of the predominantly Inuit population in 8 communities in the central Canadian Arctic. The entire survey included 874 individuals in all age groups, of whom 440 were children and adolescents under 18 years of age, and consisted of questionnaires, clinical examination and laboratory tests. Of the large number of variables on which data were collected, some were of particular relevance to the health of children and the well-being of the family, including: (1) Child growth and development; (2) Nutrition and diet; (3) Social pathologies: suicide attempts and sexual abuse; (4) Oral health; and (5) Audiologic health. In addition to providing cross-sectional data, survey participants constitute a cohort which, if followed up longitudinally, can be used to determine the incidence of specific conditions and identify risk factors which promote or prevent their occurrence. An example of such a cohort study is one on acute respiratory infection. Surveys serve many functions--providing data for planning and evaluation, promoting community awareness of health issues, and addressing basic research questions. The KHAS is one of several surveys launched over the past several years which jointly will begin to provide a circumpolar perspective on the health of Inuit people.",Arctic medical research,1995,Finland,1995,90
7633858,The role of prenatal care in preventing low birth weight.,"Prenatal care has long been endorsed as a means to identify mothers at risk of delivering a preterm or growth-retarded infant and to provide an array of available medical, nutritional, and educational interventions intended to reduce the determinants and incidence of low birth weight and other adverse pregnancy conditions and outcomes. Although the general notion that prenatal care is of value to both mother and child became widely accepted in this century, the empirical evidence supporting the association between prenatal care and reduced rates of low birth weight emerged slowly and has been equivocal. Much of the controversy over the effectiveness of prenatal care in preventing low birth weight stems from difficulties in defining what constitutes prenatal care and adequate prenatal care use. While the collective evidence regarding the efficacy of prenatal care to prevent low birth weight continues to be mixed, the literature indicates that the most likely known targets for prenatal interventions to prevent low birth weight rates are (1) psychosocial (aimed at smoking); (2) nutritional (aimed at low prepregnancy weight and inadequate weight gain); and (3) medical (aimed at general morbidity). System level approaches to impact the accessibility and the appropriateness of prenatal health care services to entire groups of women and population-wide health promotion, social service, and case management approaches may also offer potential benefits. However, data on the effectiveness of these services are lacking, and whether interventions focused on building cohesive, functional communities can do as much or more to improve low birth weight rates as individualized treatments has yet to be explored. The ultimate success of prenatal care in substantially reducing current low birth weight percentages in the United States may hinge on the development of a much broader and more unified conception of prenatal care than currently prevails. Recommendations for actions to maximize the impact of prenatal care on reducing low birth weight are proposed both for the public and for the biomedical, public health, and research communities.",The Future of children,1995 Spring,United States,1995,90
7580231,Social settings and addiction relapse.,"Despite addiction theorists' acknowledgment of the impact of environmental factors on relapse, researchers have not adequately investigated these influences. Ninety-six substance users provided data regarding their perceived risk for relapse, exposure to substances, and involvement in reinforcing activities. These three setting attributes were assessed in their home, work, and community settings. Reuse was assessed 3 months later. When controlling for confounding variables, aspects of the home settings significantly distinguished abstainers from reusers; perceived risk for relapse was the strongest predictor of reuse. Exposure to substances and involvement in reinforcing activities were not robust reuse indicators. The work and community settings were not significant determinants of reuse. These findings offer some initial support for the utility of examining social settings to better understand addiction relapse and recovery. Identification of setting-based relapse determinants provides concrete targets for relapse prevention interventions.",Journal of substance abuse,1995,United States,1995,90
7560850,"Stress, coping, and social support processes: where are we? What next?","I review existing knowledge, unanswered questions, and new directions in research on stress, coping resource, coping strategies, and social support processes. New directions in research on stressors include examining the differing impacts of stress across a range of physical and mental health outcomes, the ""carry-overs"" of stress from one role domain or stage of life into another, the benefits derived from negative experiences, and the determinants of the meaning of stressors. Although a sense of personal control and perceived social support influence health and mental health both directly and as stress buffers, the theoretical mechanisms through which they do so still require elaboration and testing. New work suggests that coping flexibility and structural constraints on individuals' coping efforts may be important to pursue. Promising new directions in social support research include studies of the negative effects of social relationships and of support giving, mutual coping and support-giving dynamics, optimal ""matches"" between individuals' needs and support received, and properties of groups which can provide a sense of social support. Qualitative comparative analysis, optimal matching analysis, and event-structure analysis are new techniques which may help advance research in these broad topic areas. To enhance the effectiveness of coping and social support interventions, intervening mechanisms need to be better understood. Nevertheless, the policy implications of stress research are clear and are important given current interest in health care reform in the United States.",Journal of health and social behavior,1995,United States,1995,90

7721531,The determinants of excellent health: different from the determinants of ill-health?,"BACKGROUND: In the famous definition of the World Health Organization, health is 'a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity'. Until now, the distribution and determinants of the positive end of the health spectrum have not been studied extensively. In an exploratory analysis, we have compared the determinants of excellent health and of ill-health using data from a postal survey among 18,973 people in a region in the southeastern Netherlands. METHODS: Excellent health was defined as the presence of a very good self-assessment of health in the absence of any self-reported chronic condition or health complaint, and was present in 8.2% of the survey population. Ill-health was defined as the presence of two or more self-reported chronic conditions, four or more health complaints and a less-than-good self-assessment of health, and was present in 10.5% of the survey population. The remainder of the survey population was used as a reference group. Two sets of explanatory variables were available: a set of seven socio-demographic variables and a set of nine specific risk factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the strengths and patterns of the associations between the determinants and the two outcome variables, excellent health and ill-health, controlling for age and gender. RESULTS: Both the socio-demographic variables and the specific risk factors had largely similar (but mirrored) patterns of association with excellent health and with ill-health. Important socio-demographic determinants of excellent health (and of ill-health) were education, employment status and urbanization (as well as age and gender). Important specific risk factors were leisure exercise, housing problems, smoking, negative life events, obesity and alcohol intake. The percentage of deviance accounted for by each of these sets of determinants was two to three times as large in the case of ill-health as in the case of excellent health. CONCLUSION: The processes by which excellent health is generated probably have much in common with those which generate ill-health. At the same time it is obvious that our understanding of the determinants of ill-health is better than that of the determinants of excellent health, and further study of the latter is recommended.",International journal of epidemiology,1994 Dec,England,1994,90
7715461,"Reproductive health, use of estrogen and experience of symptoms in perimenopausal women: a population-based study.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine reproductive health, use of estrogen, lifestyle, experience of menopausal symptoms and work-role related issues in a population-based sample of perimenopausal women. METHODS: All women aged 48 years and residing in the catchment area of the Karolinska Hospital were recruited through the Swedish population register. They received a questionnaire covering sociodemographic background, reproductive health and gynaecological characteristics, social and work role related issues as well as a symptom rating scale. RESULTS: Seventy percent of the women returned the questionnaire. Of these, 73% were premenopausal, 21% were postmenopausal and 6% were perimenopausal. Hormone replacement therapy was used by 7.5% of the respondents and the rate of hysterectomy was 8.6%. Regular exercise was reported by 44.4%. Factor analysis of the symptom ratings yielded four independent dimensions: Negative Moods, Vasomotor symptoms, Decreased Sexual Desire and Well-being. Multiple regression analyses showed that only vasomotor symptoms were significantly related to menopausal status. Negative Mood and Reduced Sexual Interest were better explained by the presence of vasomotor symptoms and by reproductive health and lifestyle variables such as current or previous PMS, dysmenorrhea, smoking and lack of exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Only vasomotor symptoms were significantly related to menopausal status. Psychosocial and lifestyle variables as well as past or current reproductive health are more important determinants of women's psychological well-being during transition to menopause than menopausal status.",Maturitas,1994 Dec,Ireland,1994,90

Results were generated from paid, in-depth, face-to-face interviews about sexual behavior carried out first with 4 pilot respondents, then with 21 gay respondents aged 18-39, half of whom were HIV seropositive. Findings suggest that there is not a close match between what is epidemiologically accepted as risk behavior and what respondents regarded as risk behavior. The heuristic on which the men based their perceptions of sexual risk comprised a pattern of activities in which there are few absolutes, contrary to the distinctions of ""safe"", ""safer"", and ""unsafe"" categories used by health educators. The men used several categories as signifiers of risk: factors such as age, appearance, diction, and HIV knowledge together with variables reflecting epidemiological data, such as few partners, being the insertive partner in anal intercourse, and past history of infrequent unprotected anal intercourse, and situational determinants such as emotional needs, sexual arousal, and relationship status were constructed into a hierarchy of risk. These hierarchies or pseudo-epidemiological models of risk are similar to what Levine and Siegel (1992) term ""folk constructions"" of risk of HIV transmission.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,1994 Dec,United States,1994,90

METHODS: Unionized New York City health care workers (n = 1394) with comprehensive medical insurance were screened for hypertension. Union records documenting all physician visits and prescription medications for the year before screening provided the opportunity to relate patterns of treatment to blood pressure outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 409 employees found to have hypertension, 289 (71%) were aware of their condition and 201 (49%) had been treated, but only 51 (12%) had their blood pressure controlled at the recommended level (< 140/90 mm Hg). In a logistic regression model, the only variable of treatment associated with control was days of antihypertensive medication. The total number of physician visits was not associated with control. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that in conventional community settings, even in the absence of financial barriers, treatment for hypertension continues to be characterized by poor outcomes. Improving access to primary care, without changes in the nature of that care, may not substantially improve blood pressure control.",American journal of public health,1994 Nov,United States,1994,90
7945681,"The hidden curriculum, ethics teaching, and the structure of medical education.","The authors raise questions regarding the wide-spread calls emanating from lay and medical audiences alike to intensify the formal teaching of ethics within the medical school curriculum. In particular, they challenge a prevailing belief within the culture of medicine that while it may be possible to teach information about ethics (e.g., skills in recognizing the presence of common ethical problems, skills in ethical reasoning, or improved understanding of the language and concepts of ethics), course material or even an entire curriculum can in no way decisively influence a student's personality or ensure ethical conduct. To this end, several issues are explored, including whether medical ethics is best framed as a body of knowledge and skills or as part of one's professional identity. The authors argue that most of the critical determinants of physician identity operate not within the formal curriculum but in a more subtle, less officially recognized ""hidden curriculum."" The overall process of medical education is presented as a form of moral training of which formal instruction in ethics constitutes only one small piece. Finally, the authors maintain that any attempt to develop a comprehensive ethics curriculum must acknowledge the broader cultural milieu within which that curriculum must function. In conclusion, they offer recommendations on how an ethics curriculum might be more fruitfully structured to become a seamless part of the training process.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,1994 Nov,United States,1994,90

These studies, however, leave unidentified the effects of many neighborhood properties on the proximate determinants of nonmarital fertility. In this study I examine the effects of neighborhood characteristics on the risk of nonmarital first intercourse and on contraceptive use among black female adolescents. The results suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic status, female employment and marital dissolution rates, and peers' departure from mainstream lifecourse trajectories influence young black women's sexual and contraceptive behavior.

7867772,Maternal marital status as a risk factor for infant mortality.,"The increased risk of infant mortality associated with single motherhood is neither consistent among social and demographic subgroups nor inevitable, according to data from national linked birth and infant death files for 1983-1985. Maternal age is the only variable found to have a significant interaction with marital status among black mothers, and the risk associated with unmarried status increases with age. Among white mothers, age, educational level and receipt of prenatal care all show significant interactions with marital status; the increased risks of infant mortality attributed to unmarried motherhood are concentrated among subgroups usually thought to be at lower risk. For example, the risks of infant mortality among unmarried white women relative to married white women are highest among 25-29-year-olds. However, being unmarried did not affect the risk of infant mortality among babies born to college-educated white women.",Family planning perspectives,1994 Nov-Dec,United States,1994,90

We compared these families' demographic characteristics, religious values, and support resources and examined how these factors differentially affected caregiving burden for each group. Surveys and interviews were collected from 51 Hispanic and 195 non-Hispanic white families. Findings indicated that Hispanic families differed from the other families in SES, age of the person with mental retardation, religious values, and in their perceived burden of caring for a family member with mental retardation. Patterns of determinants of caregiving burden did not differ significantly for the two groups.",American journal of mental retardation : AJMR,1994 Nov,United States,1994,90

7837959,The measurement conundrum in exercise adherence research.,"This paper has two purposes. It first prefaces a symposium titled ""Exercise adherence and behavior change: prospects, problems, and future directions."" The symposium describes the progress made during the past 5 years toward understanding the adoption and maintenance of physical activity and exercise. Specifically, research is discussed that has tested the applicability to physical activity of four psychological models of behavior: Reasoned Action, Planned Behavior, Social-Cognitive Theory, and the Transtheoretical Model of stages of change. Recent exercise interventions in clinical/community settings also are discussed to illustrate how theoretical models can be implemented to increase and maintain exercise. The second purpose of this paper is to provide a brief summary of the contemporary literatures on the determinants of physical activity and interventions designed to increase and maintain physical activity. The summary focuses on the measurement problems that have limited the advances made in theory and application in these areas of research. Progress toward resolving the measurement problems during the past 5 years is contrasted with earlier scientific consensus.",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,1994 Nov,United States,1994,90
7801172,Social science education as a component of medical training.,"The broad view of health espoused by the World Health Organization is now generally accepted by medical educators. Implicit in the new paradigm is a recognition of multiple determinants of health and of shifting divisions of professional responsibilities among providers. As a consequence, the importance of social and behavioural science education as a foundation to medical training is increasingly appreciated. At the same time medical programmes are under pressure to contend with the explosion of knowledge in basic biomedical and life sciences and with technological innovation. Curricula are being submerged in facts, causing medical schools to look for innovative teaching models that feature more flexible approaches to the diverse body of knowledge supporting professional practice. Independent learning methods are being explored and revised teaching programs are being organized around coordinating themes, such as aging, human development and environmental health. Future programmes must be designed to encourage multiprofessional approaches while fostering awareness of the important interplay between health care (both curative and preventive) and social/behavioural science. Within the curriculum students should be offered options that include sociology, child growth and development, gerontology, medical anthropology, psychology, medical geography, health economics, political science and related subthemes. More important than the inclusion of any specific discipline is the creation of an environment in which future physicians may be exposed to critical thinking across a wide range of themes that characterize the social and cultural context for medical practice. Such enquiry is also likely to drive a closer relationship between medical schools and their parent universities within which the social science expertize resides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Social science & medicine (1982),1994 Nov,England,1994,90
7745169,The health care needs of ethnic minority groups: are nurses and individuals playing their part?,"The UKCC Code of Professional Conduct for nurses, midwives and health visitors stresses the need to have an understanding of the social and cultural determinants of health and illness. There is as yet little evidence of what might constitute good practice in this area and it is difficult to ascertain why this basic philosophy is not translated into action. Indeed, the nursing and midwifery professions' ability to deliver adequate and appropriate health care more generally to Britain's multiracial, multicultural population has been questioned. This literature review presents evidence which strongly suggests that although we are living in a multicultural society patients from minority ethnic groups are additionally disadvantaged because the initiatives by nurses, and others working in the National Health Service, to meet their health care needs are inadequate and often inappropriate.",Journal of advanced nursing,1994 Nov,England,1994,90
7755702,Incidence of psychotic illness in London: comparison of ethnic groups.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare annual incidences of psychosis in people from different ethnic groups as defined in the 1991 census. SETTING: Catchment area of district psychiatric hospital. DESIGN: All people aged 16 to 54 years who made contact with a wide range of community and hospital services between 1 July 1991 and 30 June 1992 were screened for psychotic symptoms. Patients with such symptoms were interviewed face to face to collect information on demography, ethnic group, psychiatric history and symptoms, drug use, and how care had been sought. A key informant, usually a close relative, was also interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age standardised incidence of schizophrenia and non-affective psychosis according to the ninth edition of the International Classification of Diseases in each ethnic group. RESULTS: Ninety three patients took part, of whom 38 were assigned a certain or very likely diagnosis of schizophrenia (15 in white population, 14 in black, seven in Asian, and two in others). The age standardised annual incidence of schizophrenia was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 2.9) per 10,000 of the population. The incidence ratio for schizophrenia in all ethnic minority groups compared with the white population was 3.6 (1.9 to 7.1); the corresponding figure for non-affective psychosis was 3.7 (2.2 to 6.2). CONCLUSIONS: Raised incidences of schizophrenia were not specific to the African Caribbeans, which suggests that the current focus on schizophrenia in this population is misleading. Members of all ethnic minority groups were more likely to develop a psychosis but not necessarily schizophrenia. The personal and social pressures of belonging to any ethnic minority group in Britain are important determinants in the excess of psychotic disorders found.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1994 Oct 29,England,1994,90
7950741,Attempt at deriving a formula for setting general practitioner fundholding budgets.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility of using routine Hospital Episode Statistics, census data, and vital statistics to derive weights for an equitable capitation formula for setting general practitioner fundholding budgets for buying acute hospital services. DESIGN: Analysis of a routine dataset of 9 million hospital episodes in 1991-2, extracting elective general practitioner fundholding procedures, combined with 1991 census variables, vital statistics, and data on supply of health care at ward level. Costs were attached to each procedure according to the average cost of the relevant ""Mersey"" band category. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Variation in age and sex adjusted expenditure per head on fundholding procedures across wards modelled for the impact of health and social needs variables after adjusting for variations in supply. RESULTS: No sensible simple model including determinants of use other than age and sex could be derived. The most parsimonious but statistically acceptable model showed that though standardised mortality ratio and self reported illness and several social class variables were associated with utilisation, the signs and the size of the coefficients were contradictory. The most important explanation of variation was provided by age and sex differences between wards. CONCLUSIONS: An equitable system of setting general practitioner fundholders' budgets is needed. In the short term age and sex weighted capitation should form the principal basis of fundholder budgets. Utilisation data at ward level are inadequate for developing a formula which adequately adjusts for the differences in the health care needs of populations. A capitation formula based on information derived from individual cohort data may be the only means of promoting equity and efficiency and of avoiding discriminating against patients with known high cost health problems.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1994 Oct 22,England,1994,90

The model for the psychiatric sector contains mortality, self reported morbidity, and social variables indicating deprivation and the level of care at home. The non-acute model contains mortality and several socioeconomic variables. The models lay less weight on age than the current formula, and a national formula based on these models would, in the acute sector, redistribute resources to poorer areas compared with the current formula.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1994 Oct 22,England,1994,90

A study of migration from rural Mali during the 1983-1985 drought.,"""Using data from a longitudinal panel study conducted in 1982 and 1989 in...Mali, this article demonstrates that the level of migration did not rise during the drought of 1983-1985. However, there was a dramatic increase in the migration of women and children during the severe 1983-1985 drought. Along with this increase in migration by women and children, there was a shift to short-cycle circulation, with 64 percent of the migrants adopting circular patterns. The study describes the characteristics of these migrants and recommends changes to development and migration policies that will facilitate such migrations in subsequent droughts.""",The International migration review,1994 Fall,United States,1994,90

This article proposes a broader analytical framework which incorporates immigrants' individual characteristics and larger social contexts in the country of origin and the country of destination to explain the likelihood of citizenship acquisition. The framework is tested for a cohort of recent immigrants, using the PUMS data from the 1980 U.S. census. The results show that economic, political, social, cultural and geographical conditions in the country of origin, and immigrants ethnic communities and urban concentration in the country of destination, to a large extent influence immigrants' propensity for naturalization and that, net of the contextual factors, many of the immigrants' adaptation and demographic characteristics are also significant predictors of citizenship acquisition.""",The International migration review,1994 Fall,United States,1994,90
12319653,"Internal migration, earnings, and the importance of self-selection.","This paper analyzes the impact of internal migration on earnings within the human capital model framework. Since migrants constitute a non-random sample of population, the endogenous nature of migration decision warrants necessary correction for the selectivity bias in their earnings function. The Mincer-type earnings model is thus augmented to determine the extent of this bias. Besides estimating the standard Mincerian earnings model, the paper also attempts to verify the learn-as-you-go proposition by introducing migration duration variables in the earnings model. Based on the household level Population, Labor Force, and Migration (1979-80) survey data, the analysis yields the following important conclusions: (i) the data allowed a meaningful estimation of Mincerian earnings function for migrants and non-migrants; (ii) the level of schooling was one of the important determinants of the distribution of income both for migrants and nonmigrants--the four categorical variables of education were in general statistically significant with expected signs, implying that the hypothesis of a positive relationship between income and education was accepted; (iii) the rates of return to education improved systematically with higher levels of education, thus confirming the notion that education serves as a signalling device; (iv) the age-income profile was almost linear for migrants but showed concavity for nonmigrants; (v) the presence of sample-selection was observed for migrants; and (vi) even after controlling for the influence of personal characteristics, i.e., education and experience, the long-standing migrants earned relatively more at the destination than the more recent migrants.",Pakistan development review,1994 Autumn,Pakistan,1994,90

Results from the 1988 Male Fertility Survey indicate that husband's education had a strong negative effect, and wife's education had a moderate negative effect on the number of children ever born. Contrary to the literature, wives who were not employed had significantly fewer children than those who work in agriculture, and fewer, but not significantly, than those in non-agricultural occupations. Findings show the importance of husband's education and the changing dynamics of wife's occupation in fertility decline.",Journal of biosocial science,1994 Oct,England,1994,90

Infant mortality rates declined in all regions between 1965 and 1979. Children born in modern health facilities, irrespective of their mothers' place of residence, experienced significantly lower rates of infant mortality than those born elsewhere.

7949275,[Development of a perceived social support scale: for a Japanese population].,"Social support is increasingly attracting interest in as a factor in epidemiological research of disease risks. However, at present, few methods for measuring social support that can be credited as having reliability and validity exist in Japan. Therefore a perceived social support scale was developed in relation to a population study of a town in Fukuoka prefecture. A method for measuring functional support from several external sources was designed consisting of a self-administered test provided with only two available response options--yes & no. Pretests were conducted twice in order to evaluate content validity and adjust the number of determinants and resulted in spouse, family members, and friends being selected to be primary sources of support. A factor analysis was applied to select 10 conditions with high internal consistency for each of the sources. Responses were scored 0 or 1, for 'no' or 'yes,' respectively. Subsequently each set of 10 variables was summed into an index ranking social support conditions for each of the three sources. The three highest ranking indicators from each of the respective sources were then integrated into a single comprehensive total social support score of the individuals. The inquiry method was applied on 277 adults, aged from 40 to 69 years, in the town. Intercorrelation between the indicators of support derived from the three sources was low and coefficients of reliability ranged from 0.892 to 0.978. The score of each set of the 10 variables were incorporated into a principal components analysis in order to determine factorial validity. All of the first factor loadings of the items measuring support from both spouse and family were greater than 0.7 and high eigenvalues were obtained. Therefore the methods applied to spouse and family were considered adequate to measure a given construct. The items measuring support from friends were divided into two factors, emotional support and tangible support.",[Nihon koshu eisei zasshi] Japanese journal of public health,1994 Oct,Japan,1994,90

7875782,Determinants of low birth weight: a community based prospective cohort study.,"The study aimed at identifying and quantifying determinants of low birth weight (LBW) by following a community based prospective cohort of pregnant women in 45 villages in Pune district. In the 1922 live births born to mothers without a chronic illness, in whom birth weight was available within 24 hours, the cumulative incidence of LBW (< 2500 g) was 29%. The unadjusted relative risks for LBW were significantly higher for lower socio-economic status (RR = 1.71), maternal age less than 20 years (RR = 1.27), primiparity (RR = 1.32), last pregnancy interval less than 6 months (RR = 1.48), non-pregnant weight less than 40 kg (RR = 1.3), height below 145 cm (RR = 1.51), hemoglobin less than 9 g/dl (RR = 1.53) and third trimester bleeding (RR = 1.87). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the adjusted odds ratio for LBW decreased with increasing gestational duration, non-pregnant weight, parity and rising education level of the mother. Socio-economic status, non-pregnant weight, maternal height, and severe anemia in pregnancy had substantial attributable risk per cent for LBW (41.4%, 22.9%, 29.5% and 34.5%, respectively). The findings suggest that selectively targetted interventions such as improving maternal education and nutrition, specifically anemia, wider availability of contraception to delay the first pregnancy and to increase pregnancy intervals may help in identifying and ensuring adequate care for those women at greatest risk of LBW.",Indian pediatrics,1994 Oct,India,1994,90

A multiethnic sample of 303 seventh-grade students in three schools in the greater New York area completed questionnaires assessing their basic demographic characteristics (gender and ethnicity), AIDS knowledge, substance use (cigarette smoking, alcohol use), and decision-making skills. AIDS knowledge, substance use, decision-making skills, gender, and ethnicity predicted intentions to engage in sexual behavior in the future. Relevant knowledge of AIDS was associated with lower intentions to engage in sexual behavior in the future. More frequent substance use, less frequent use of decision-making skills, and being male increased intentions to engage in sexual behavior in the future. Our findings are discussed in terms of their implications for education and prevention of adolescent sexual activity and AIDS-risk reduction.",Psychological reports,1994 Oct,United States,1994,90
7851280,Suspected determinants of enrollment into detoxification and methadone maintenance treatment among injecting drug users.,"Our primary aim in this study has been to evaluate selected conditions thought to influence the entry of injecting drug users (IDU) into detoxification and methadone maintenance programs, making use of a prospective study design to strengthen a cross-sectional investigation of these conditions. To begin our investigation, we analyzed cross-sectionally gathered data on 2879 IDUs who had been recruited through extensive community outreach efforts and who were interviewed at the time of recruitment. We then tested our hypotheses about suspected determinants of entry into treatment by analyzing prospectively gathered data on 1039 active drug users who had no recent history of being treated for drug problems. Among these 1039 IDUs (a subset of the initial cross-sectional sample), 144 entered a detoxification program between their recruitment interview and their next follow-up interview, conducted about six months after recruitment (range: 3.5-9.5 months) and 64 entered a methadone maintenance program during that observation interval. Using multiple logistic regression analyses, we found that a recent drug overdose, relatively higher frequency of injecting drugs, and a history of prior arrest or treatment were independent predictors of entry into detoxification. Being married or living with a partner, being female, a lengthy duration of drug use (> 10 years), and a history of prior treatment were independent predictors of entry into methadone maintenance. These findings shed light on what appears to be a different profile of suspected determinants of entry into a detoxification treatment versus methadone maintenance treatment, and help to clarify some potential differences between treated and untreated drug users that ought to be considered when evaluating results of investigations with IDU participants recruited solely from treatment settings.",Drug and alcohol dependence,1994 Oct,Ireland,1994,90
7821136,Frequency and determinants of screening for diabetes in the U.S.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of risk factors for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and the frequency of screening for NIDDM in U.S. adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A detailed questionnaire was administered to a representative sample of 19,680 adults > or = 18 years of age who reported no medical history of diabetes in the 1989 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Information was obtained on risk factors for diabetes, complications related to diabetes, and whether the subjects had been screened for diabetes in the past year. Women reporting pregnancy in the past year were excluded from analysis. The prevalence of undiagnosed NIDDM according to the frequency of risk factors for NIDDM was determined based on oral glucose tolerance data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II and Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). RESULTS: Prevalence of undiagnosed NIDDM based on the NHANES II and HHANES increased with age, obesity, and family history of diabetes, reaching 11.7% in people with all three risk factors. Based on the NHIS, 77.5% of U.S. adults with no medical history of diabetes (131 million people) had at least one risk factor for NIDDM or complication related to NIDDM, and 22.9% (38 million people) had three or more risk factors or complications. Approximately 31% of adults reported being screened for diabetes in the past year. Screening rates increased with an increasing number of risk factors, but even among those with three risk factors, only 38.6% were screened for NIDDM. CONCLUSIONS: More than 7 million U.S. adults have undiagnosed NIDDM. Nevertheless, screening for diabetes in high-risk groups occurs substantially less frequently than necessary to detect undiagnosed NIDDM and institute appropriate hypoglycemic treatment.",Diabetes care,1994 Oct,United States,1994,90

We find evidence that processes affecting condom use in HIV-infected individuals are similar to those found in HIV-negative individuals. Results suggest that partner-related factors are important to consistent condom use in HIV-infected women. Women are more likely to use condoms consistently if they have high perceived power to influence their partner's condom use, have partners who are HIV seronegative, and have partners who do not want more children. Conflicts with the partner decrease the probability of consistent condom use. Also negatively associated with condom use are the woman's use of drugs and/or alcohol and her belief that condoms reduce sexual enjoyment. Implications of these findings for designing interventions for HIV-infected women are considered.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,1994 Oct,United States,1994,90
7809663,"Psychosocial effects of PCB contamination and remediation: the case of Smithville, Ontario.","A cross-sectional study design was used to investigate psychosocial effects in the population exposed to PCB contamination and remediation in Smithville, Ontario, Canada. Psychosocial effects were defined as the complex of distress, dysfunction and disability manifested in a wide range of psychological, social and behavioural outcomes as a consequence of actual or perceived contamination. This paper describes the results of logistic regression analyses conducted to investigate the determinants of psychosocial effects of exposure. The data come from an epidemiologic survey of a sample (N = 272) of Smithville households within 3 km of the site, and a sample from a matched comparison community (N = 263). Two types of outcome variables were used as indicators of psychosocial effects. Scores on the general measures of psychosocial health and well-being (the GHQ-20 and the somatic complaints checklist of the SCL-90) for the Smithville sample did not differ from those expected in a 'normal' population, nor did they differ from those in the comparison community. Scores on these outcomes were associated with plausibly linked independent variables, but were not associated with exposure to the PCB site. Results for site-specific outcome measures (concern and health concern) showed that moderate levels of concern reported by Smithville respondents were explained by concern about another local hazardous waste issue and could not be explained by PCB site exposure. We conclude from these results that local community context exerts an important influence on psychosocial effects of environmental contamination. Furthermore, the types of outcome measures employed and the timing of the research in the context of the site history were important factors in our ability to detect psychosocial effects of the PCB contamination and remediation in Smithville.",Social science & medicine (1982),1994 Oct,England,1994,90

Birth weight, among a subgroup of 91 children where this information was available from the mothers' Road To Health cards, was the variable with which current weight-for-age Z scores was most strongly associated (r = 0.38). Associations of current weight-for-age with certain socio-economic variables, at or close to statistically significant levels, corresponded with similar or stronger associations of birth weight with these same socio-economic variables. Cross-sectional studies of young children, to identify associations and possible determinants of nutrition status, are more informative where there is a high Road To Health card coverage and where birth weights have been recorded on these cards.",Journal of tropical pediatrics,1994 Oct,England,1994,90
7660042,[Reliability of the declaration of underlying cause of infant deaths in the metropolitan region of southeastern Brazil].,"The quality of official information on underlying causes of infant deaths was studied on the basis of data collected for a population-based study of the surveillance of infant mortality in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, Brazil in 1989. The survey included the analysis of a sample of infant deaths carried out by comparing the underlying causes of death as coded on death certificates to those recorded by a group of doctors who abstracted information from hospital records. We verified that 11.7% of neonatal deaths did not have the underlying cause of death confirmed by the investigation (kappa = 0.61), and neither did 44.0% of post-neonatal deaths (kappa = 0.47). It is believed that this major disagreement among post-neonatal deaths is due to the close correlation observed among the major causes of death within this group (pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition). For example, associated malnutrition was observed in 76.9% of those cases in which diarrhoea was coded as the underlying cause of death. It was concluded that the quality of the death certificates is not satisfactory. However, the composition of the main groups of causes presented no significant alteration after investigation and may be used in public health surveillance, especially if we regard pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition as a group with the same determinants. Unfortunately, this group still accounts for a great number of otherwise avoidable deaths in Brazil.",Revista de saude publica,1994 Oct,Brazil,1994,90
7522432,Patient requests to hasten death. Evaluation and management in terminal care.,"Terminally ill patients often hope that death will come quickly. They may broach this wish with their physicians, and even request assistance in hastening death. Thoughts about accelerating death usually do not reflect a sustained desire for suicide or euthanasia, but have other important meanings that require exploration. When patients ask for death to be hastened, the following areas should be explored: the adequacy of symptom control; difficulties in the patient's relationships with family, friends, and health workers; psychological disturbances, especially grief, depression, anxiety, organic mental disorders, and personality disorders; and the patient's personal orientation to the meaning of life and suffering. Appreciation of the clinical determinants and meanings of requests to hasten death can broaden therapeutic options. In all cases, patient requests for accelerated death require ongoing discussion and active efforts to palliate physical and psychological distress. In those infrequent instances when a patient with persistent, irremediable suffering seeks a prompt and comfortable death, the physician must confront the moral, legal, and professional ramifications of his or her response.

DESIGN: Subjects in a prospectively followed up cohort (the national child development study) who had been admitted as adults to psychiatric hospitals were compared with the rest of the cohort on ratings of social behaviour made by teachers at the ages of 7 and 11 years. SUBJECTS: 40 adult patients with schizophrenic illnesses, 35 with affective psychoses, and 79 with neurotic illness who had been admitted for psychiatric reasons by the age of 28. 1914 randomly selected members of the cohort who had never been admitted for psychiatric treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall scores and scores for overreaction (externalising behaviour) and underreaction (internalising behaviour) with the Bristol social adjustment guide at ages 7 and 11. RESULTS: At the age of 7 children who developed schizophrenia were rated by their teachers as manifesting more social maladjustment than controls (overall score 4.3 (SD 2.4) v 3.1 (2.0); P < 0.01). This was more apparent in the boys (5 (2.6)) than the girls (3.4 (1.8)) and related to overreactive rather than underreactive behaviour. At both ages prepsychotic (affective) children differed little from normal controls. By the age of 11 preneurotic children, particularly the girls, had an increased rating of maladjustment (including overreactions and underreactions). CONCLUSION: Abnormalities of social adjustment are detectable in childhood in some people who develop psychotic illness. Sex and the rate of development of different components of the capacity for social interaction are important determinants of the risk of psychosis and other psychiatric disorders in adulthood.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1994 Sep 17,England,1994,90
8001728,Hand preferences for bimanual feeding in 140 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): rearing and ontogenetic determinants.,"Hand preference in bimanual feeding was assessed in 140 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Bimanual feeding was defined as the active use of one hand for feeding with the opposite hand holding other food items. In terms of strength of hand preference, adults were more lateralized than sub-adults. Additionally, mother-reared chimpanzees were more lateralized than nursery-reared chimpanzees. The number of subjects with no hand preference was more prevalent in sub-adults compared with young and older adults. Of those subjects with a significant hand preference, a larger proportion exhibited a right-hand preference. These results are discussed in relation to previous reports of handedness and bimanual feeding in gorillas and bonobos.",Developmental psychobiology,1994 Sep,United States,1994,90
7981848,Comparison of respondents and nonrespondents in an osteoporosis study.,"We attempted to enroll an age-stratified random sample of Rochester, Minnesota women > or = 30 years of age in a population-based prospective study of the determinants of bone loss. Using the resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, 541 women were contacted and 305 agreed to participate. Of 236 nonrespondents, 38 were ineligible and 198 refused to participate resulting in a 61% response rate for eligible subjects. We reviewed community medical records for respondents and nonrespondents (including ineligibles) to determine whether the two groups differed with regard to variables that might be important in osteoporosis research. There was little difference between respondents and nonrespondents for a history of cigarette smoking, hyperthyroidism, thyroidectomy, or age-related fractures. Respondents survived better, were less likely to be obese or have renal failure, and more likely to have had an oophorectomy and consume alcohol (P < 0.01). These data suggest that nonrespondents were less healthy than respondents.",Annals of epidemiology,1994 Sep,United States,1994,90
7953220,The influence of personal and collective self-esteem on strategies of social differentiation.,"The present study distinguished between personal self-esteem (PSE) and collective self-esteem (CSE) as determinants of in-group bias in an intergroup context. Subjects performed a group task, the product of which they subsequently evaluated ('own' group), along with solutions allegedly produced by another 'in-group' (similar nationality), and an 'out-group' (different nationality). This provided the opportunity for intragroup discrimination (own vs. in-group), and both direct (own vs. out-group) and indirect (in-group vs. out-group) strategies of intergroup discrimination. It was predicted that subjects high in CSE would differentiate more than subjects low in CSE, both directly and indirectly, but that intergroup discrimination would also result from high PSE. The relationship between the in-group and out-group was also manipulated by varying the salient out-group. It was predicted that subjects motivated to enhance social identity (high CSE) would differentiate more, directly and indirectly, when the out-group was seen as having a more competitive relationship with the in-group. Although this manipulation was unsuccessful, a follow-up suggested that the out-group predefined as less competitive was actually a more relevant comparison group in the context of the task, which is consistent with effects of this manipulation. Overall PSE and CSE were both found to influence differentiation at the intragroup and intergroup level, both independently and interactively. However, whereas high PSE led to greater positive differentiation, low CSE had this effect, and a combination of high PSE and low CSE produced the most consistent pattern of positive in-group differentiation across both out-group conditions. Possible mechanisms which account for this pattern are discussed and the relationship between dimensions of self-esteem and group differentiation is reappraised in the light of these findings.",The British journal of social psychology,1994 Sep,England,1994,90
7953094,[Representational analysis: a means to evaluate teacher training in health education].,"Research and evaluation of social representations as determinants of behaviour are fundamental components for health education and promotion programmes. The research presented in this article was funded as part of the ""Europe against Cancer"" programme, and follows the evolution over a five year period, of representations and behaviours of 1500 children from cities in France, Belgium, Spain, Greece, and Portugal. In each city, three different groups were followed and evaluated: Children in the first groups participated in a year-long tobacco prevention programme conducted by specially trained teachers; those in the second groups only participated in sporadic activities designed around World Tobacco Day; those in the third group did not participate in any particular tobacco prevention activities. The evaluation concentrated on analysing the changes in participants' social representations regarding tobacco and smoking related behaviour throughout the five year period. A variety of comparative analysis techniques were used to prepare, evaluate, and modify the content of the teacher training programmes in order to succeed in fulfilling one of the primary objectives of the programme--that of assisting teachers to develop educational attitudes for tobacco prevention in primary schools. The authors esteem that the type of training offered to the teachers had a marked influence on the length and type of programmes they offered to their students.",Promotion & education,1994 Sep,England,1994,90

The method's side effects were defined by 200 first-time users in Matlab district during lengthy, open-ended interviews. Women with many children used the method longer than did women of low parity. Those who experienced side effects had shorter use durations than those who did not, and those who cited heavy bleeding as their main problem discontinued use soonest. Women whose husbands approved of family planning had significantly longer use durations than those whose husbands disapproved. Respondents who adopted DMPA because of perceived positive aspects of the drug used it longer than those who chose it for other reasons. Results of the study underscore the importance of viewing side effects in a specific social and cultural context. Expanded side-effects counseling for women and their husbands is needed.",Studies in family planning,1994 Sep-Oct,United States,1994,90
7811684,Determinants of condom use by Australian secondary school students.,"PURPOSE: To identify factors that are associated with condom use to aid in the understanding of how to change the behavior of those young people who have sex without using condoms. METHODS: The article reports data from 932 sexually active grade 10-12 students from a sample of 72 public secondary schools in seven Australian states and territories. The data were collected using a cross-sectional, self-report questionnaire. RESULTS: Boys were more likely than girls to report that a condom was used the last time they had sex. For boys and girls, communication with a partner about avoiding infection with HIV/STDs, the belief that more peers use condoms, and a higher perceived risk of becoming infected with HIV/STDs were associated with using a condom, as was lower knowledge of STDs. The use of oral contraception and the unavailability of condoms were reported by the students as prominent reasons for non-use of condoms. Number of sexual partners in the past year and type of relationship with partner on the most recent occasion were not associated with condom use. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents are more concerned with unwanted pregnancy than with disease prevention. School students more at risk are not more likely to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from HIV/STDs.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1994 Sep,United States,1994,90
8062177,Early detection of cancer. Psychologic and social dimensions.,"Major strides in early detection research can be attributed to social and behavioral research. Social scientists have been involved in research determining the epidemiologic basis of and the cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic disease. The availability of well accepted screening tests has been a barrier to early detection research, especially in the area of men's health. Early detection research has focused on the individual and system levels. Theoretical models are being adapted for early detection from smoking research and are a strength of current work. These models explain why people participate in early detection and how behavior change can occur. In studying system barriers to early detection, intervention efforts have been focused in the community and in the medical care delivery system. Methodologic issues are beginning to emerge, including measuring of program outcomes, and the appropriate research designs for community studies. Except for immigrant populations, initial screening rates are high, and the periodicity of screening becomes the outcome of choice. Some of these problems are the direct result of the success of research and public education efforts to increase cancer screening. The following are priorities for the next decade: theory driven research on behavior change and on interventions; the social determinants of physicians' participation in screening; process evaluation to relate community efforts to outcomes; and reductions in the stage at which cancer is diagnosed as an outcome measure.",Cancer,1994 Aug 15,United States,1994,90
8044971,Determinants of coronary artery reactivity in premenopausal female cynomolgus monkeys with diet-induced atherosclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify determinants of coronary artery reactivity among premenopausal female monkeys. Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal females modulates reactivity of atherosclerotic coronary arteries. However, no studies have evaluated the factors that modulate coronary artery reactivity among premenopausal females. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five adult premenopausal female monkeys were fed an atherogenic diet for 32 months. During this time, monkeys were housed in small social groups and determined to be socially dominant (associated with normal ovarian function) or subordinate (associated with impaired ovarian function). After 32 months, coronary artery vasomotor responses to intracoronary acetylcholine, nitroglycerin, and serotonin were assessed by computer-assisted quantitative coronary angiography. Coronary arteries of dominant monkeys dilated (+9 +/- 2%), whereas those of subordinate monkeys constricted (-6 +/- 2%) in response to acetylcholine (P < .05). There was no effect of social status on vascular response to nitroglycerin or serotonin (P > .10). Vascular responses to acetylcholine were independent of social status effects on plasma lipids, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis extent. The correlation between acetylcholine responses and plasma estradiol concentration measured on the day of angiography was r = .7 (P = < .01). Furthermore, dilation occurred only if plasma estradiol concentrations were greater than 60 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial factors and endogenous estrogen production are important modulators of acetylcholine-mediated dilation of atherosclerotic coronary arteries among premenopausal female monkeys.",Circulation,1994 Aug,United States,1994,90
7985550,Developing health research capability in Tanzania: from a Swiss Tropical Institute Field Laboratory to the Ifakara Centre of the Tanzanian National Institute of Medical Research.,"The paper summarizes the evolution of a biomedical field research station in Tanzania, established by a European institute, into a national health research and resource centre. The Swiss Tropical Institute Field Laboratory was founded in Ifakara in the Kilombero District in southeastern Tanzania in 1957. It has evolved into the Ifakara Centre, a national but peripherally located research centre involved in applied, operational and health systems research, training, and direct health sector support activities. Since 1991, the centre has been an affiliate of the National Institute for Medical Research in Tanzania. It has achieved an autonomous status and attracts frontline priority research and high quality research teams; the ongoing phase 3 malaria vaccine trial is a recent major activity. Starting from biomedical priorities in research and training, the centre has broadened its spectrum to include social science disciplines including economics. The major determinants for this development were (i) the long-term partnership between the executing agency in the north and the partners in the south at the national level, (ii) the support of this partnership by a long-term commitment of the major funding partners, (iii) the concept that local priorities form the basis of all activities, and (iv) the linking of research and training to public health action. The last two elements are considered to be crucial for the centre's multidisciplinary approach to health research and the support of public health in Tanzania and in eastern and southern Africa.",Acta tropica,1994 Aug,Netherlands,1994,90
7964331,Coronary heart disease rates within a small urban area in Belgium.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To identify geographical differences in coronary heart disease (CHD) attack rates in a small urban area and to relate these to indicators of socioeconomic class. DESIGN: CHD attack rates were calculated from data of the Ghent MONICA myocardial infarct register for the period 1983-87. The city of Ghent is subdivided into 201 sectors based on morphological, and socioeconomic characteristics. During the national census of 1981, the main determinants of residential differentiation were measured. These sector variables were linked with the CHD attack rates. PATIENTS: All residents of the city aged 25-69 years are prospectively followed with regard to heart attacks. Between 1982 and 1987, 1728 suffered an acute heart attack according to MONICA criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Significant (p < 0.05) differences in age and sex standarised attack rates were observed between city sectors. These differences were related to an index of socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: Within a small urban area, significant geographical differences occur in CHD attack rates and these are related to socioeconomic status.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1994 Aug,England,1994,90

Path analysis was applied to survey data collected for this study. Seventeen percent of subjects were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Controlling for health and socioeconomic factors, the main determinant of readmission was the discharge placement; those placed back into the community for care in the home were more likely to be rehospitalized than those discharged to institutions. Contrary to predictions in the literature and the authors' expectations, patient involvement in discharge planning had no discernible effect on placement decisions and subsequent hospitalization. The implications of these findings for discharge planning by social workers are discussed.",Health & social work,1994 Aug,United States,1994,90
7937496,Community determinants of health for rural elderly.,"Although community health nursing practice supports community-level interventions, the influence of communities on the health of older members is not well known. Ethnographic design and methods were employed to study the health of older residents in a western plains farming community. Relationship was a key component for understanding life in this town. Reciprocal relationships in which older people and the community were mutual benefactors were crucial to the acceptability of help and support. Stressors were lack of privacy and isolation for those who did not conform to prevailing norms. Nurses in rural areas have to foster a sense of relationship and reciprocity within a community, since assistance is accepted most easily when older people can repay in kind. Advocating the use of government supports and programs may not be successful if the programs do not require such contributions. Close relationships can be stressful as well as supportive, and increasing social support and monitoring for an older person may inadvertently decrease privacy and promote stress.","Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)",1994 Aug,United States,1994,90

7898955,"From ""forest malaria"" to ""bromeliad malaria"": a case-study of scientific controversy and malaria control.","The article analyses the evolution of knowledge and rationale of control of a special case of malaria transmission based on Bromelia-Kerteszia complex. Since bromeliaceae function as a 'host of the carrier' and were previously associated with natural forests, the elucidation of bromeliad malaria historically elicited controversies concerning the imputation of Kertesziae as transmitters as well as over control strategies directed to bromelia eradication (manual removal, herbicides and deforestation), use of insecticides and chemoprophylaxis. Established authority, disciplinary traditions, conceptual premises and contemporary criteria for validating knowledge in the field partly explain the long time gap since Adolpho Lutz announced at the beginning of the century the existence of a new mosquito and breeding site as responsible for a 'forest malaria' epidemic occurring at a high altitude. The article brings attention to how economic, political and institutional determinants played an important role in redefining studies that led both in Trinidad and Brazil to the recognition of the importance of kerteszia transmission, including urban areas, and establishing new approaches to its study, most relevant of all the concurrence of broad ecological research. The article then describes the Brazilian campaign strategies which showed significant short-term results but had to wait four decades to achieve the goal of eradication due to the peculiar characteristics of this pathogenic complex. Finally, it brings attention to the importance of encompassing social values and discourses, in this case, environmental preservation, to understanding historical trends of malaria control programs.",Parassitologia,1994 Aug,Italy,1994,90
7833551,Maternal and pediatric AIDS in the United States: the current situation and future research directions.,"The epidemic of HIV infection and disease in women, adolescents and children represents a complexly intertwined biological and social challenge to health care workers and researchers alike. When considering various issues in confronting this epidemic, women must be viewed as individuals important in their own right, as the primary caretaker of their family members (both infected and uninfected), and as the sexual partners of men who may or may not be infected. Of the myriad of compelling biological questions facing AIDS researchers today, two of the most interesting involve the timing and determinants of vertical transmission and the natural history of HIV infection and disease in women. Scientifically, confronting this epidemic involves research into pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection. Primary emphasis in the research arena in HIV/AIDS in the United States is focused on therapeutic and prophylactic research. Other research issues are very important, including studies of early diagnostic techniques, behavioral research concerning reproductive choices, the role of breastfeeding in HIV transmission, HIV-specific adolescent issues, and surrogate markers of disease progression.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992).

Condom ""users"" (44% of this sample) were defined as those who reported using a condom in their last sexual encounter to ejaculation. ""Sexually active"" men were defined as those who reported some form of intercourse with a partner to ejaculation within the past 3 months. On the CPI, the condom users scored significantly higher than nonusers on the Achievement via Independence scale and marginally higher on the Socialization and the Social Presence scales. The mean CPI profile for the condom users yielded the Gamma personality type which denotes an externally-oriented, norm questioning personality. Gammas tended to be uninhibited, clever, witty, pleasure-seeking risk takers. Those men who did not use a condom in their last sexual encounter offered their reasons for not doing so. The most common reasons were not expecting intercourse to occur and they were not available. In terms of perceived risk for HIV-infection, only 12.3% of the men had taken the antibody test and 75% considered themselves to be at zero or low risk. Several suggestions were made for counseling strategies in promoting condom use in college-age populations.",Journal of sex education and therapy,1994 Summer,United States,1994,90
12320211,Continuity and change in Canada's unemployment-immigration linkage (1946-1993).,"""Between 1946 and 1976, variation in unemployment rates strongly affected the number of immigrants allowed into Canada. Implementation of the Immigration Act of 1976 should have weakened the effect of unemployment on immigration, for the Act requires that immigration levels be set after consideration of demographic as well as labour market conditions. Our analysis shows the unemployment-immigration linkage actually strengthened after 1978, and only weakened significantly after 1989. Since the government's annual immigration projections are excellent predictors of immigration landings, we conclude the Canadian state is highly capable of controlling immigration levels and thus the tightening of the unemployment-immigration linkage from 1978 to 1989 reflected the choice of regulators. Discussing future research in this area, we argue that if the immigration policymaking process was not restructured in the late 1980s, an adequate model of state-society relations in this area must account for both continuity and change. However, if the process was restructured, a revised or new theoretical framework is needed.""

The model is estimated using data from the [U.S.] National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Young adults who migrated while unemployed had longer durations of unemployment than those who did not migrate. The rate at which they found jobs was also linked to how long they had been unemployed, to being laid off, being African American, to going to college, having a mortgage and to national unemployment conditions.""",Papers in regional science : the journal of the Regional Science Association International,1994 Jul,United States,1994,90
12292532,Assimilation and attachment in the context of international migration: the case of guestworkers in Germany.,"""Immigrants' attachments to home and their assimilation into the host society have been identified as major factors influencing international return migration. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the determinants of attachment and assimilation, with a special focus on the impact of duration of stay. Using survey data on guestworkers in West Germany in 1984 and 1989, the study finds that assimilation increases at a decreasing rate as the duration of stay is extended. The relationship between attachment and length of stay is less strong, but shows a general trend of decreasing attachment levels as guestworkers prolong their stay in Germany. The resulting trends for return migration are characterized by an overall decline in the propensity to return as the duration of stay is extended. However, the rate of decline varies by gender, marital status, and nationality. Overall, the results allude to the importance of distinguishing between short term and long term immigrants.""",Papers in regional science : the journal of the Regional Science Association International,1994 Jul,United States,1994,90

Although depressive and anxiety disorders have a high prevalence and account for a large proportion of visits to primary health services there is little international health research in this field.

Other issues such as the avoidance of environmental determinism; the separation of macro-social and micro-social variables; the weakness of urban/rural comparisons of mental health; the role of rural to urban migration; the debates about cross-cultural psychiatry; and the policy-relevance of research, all need consideration in the development of research into this rapidly emerging, but relatively neglected problem.",Social science & medicine (1982),1994 Jul,England,1994,90
8066490,Self-rated health: biological continuum or social discontinuity?,"Correlates of self-rated health among a randomly selected sample of 1863 Australian-born women 45-55 years of age were examined in two logistic regression analyses: one comparing a self-rated health of worse than one's peers with a self-rated health the same as one's peers; and, one comparing a self-rated health of better than one's peers with a self-rated health the same as one's peers. The final model for worse health was largely a reflection of the physical experience of ill health while that for better health was a more complex construct including not only the absence of illness but also markers of sociodemographic advantage and self-image. The two models had only three variables in common. Notably, the relationship between the outcome measures and one common variable, body mass index, differed markedly. It is suggested that previous analyses of self-rated health have had their power to adequately describe correlates and determinants of health status constrained. By assuming that the various self-rated health states are part of a continuum and employing statistical methods consistent with that assumption, previous studies have been unable to demonstrate the discontinuity among such states. In particular, it is suggested that self-rated health is at least in part a reflection of social role and as there is no basis for assuming that such roles form a continuum as the use of correlation-based analyses imply, then such analyses are inappropriate.",Social science & medicine (1982),1994 Jul,England,1994,90
7993309,Educational and occupational achievements of brothers and sisters in adoptive and biologically related families.,"The study of brothers and sisters from adoptive and biologically related families permits unique analyses of the determinants of young adults' educational and occupational achievements. Brothers and sisters come from the same homes, neighborhoods, and usually schools. Many differences among families are controlled by the study of siblings. In addition, adoptive families influence their children only through the environment they provide, whereas biologically related parents transmit their intellectual and personal characteristics to their offspring genetically as well. Thus, the comparison of models of adult achievements for children from adoptive and biologically related families can inform us about the true effects of family environments, apart from genetic transmission (Scarr and Weinberg, 1978, 1980). In this follow-up study of 450 biologically related and adopted young adults (ages 22 to 30 years), we report on the family resemblances in educational and occupational achievements. Parents' reports were obtained on 97% of the original sample (N = 443), and 77% of the young adults participated in the follow-up study themselves; complete educational and occupational data were available on 303 young adults. Results show that biological sons are more influenced by their family backgrounds than daughters, regardless of genetic relatedness. A second finding is that young women's achievements are not as predictable from their own earlier achievements as are those of their brothers. A third finding is that parents invest in their sons' educational futures, regardless of sons' abilities and achievements, in ways they do not invest in their daughters' postsecondary educations. Sibling correlations and natural mother-adopted child correlations suggest that test scores, high school performance, postsecondary education, and even later occupational status can be influenced by genetic variability in personal characteristics that affect such achievements.",Behavior genetics,1994 Jul,United States,1994,90

METHOD: An exploratory factor analysis was used to group attitudinal, behavioural intention and change statements into five predisposing factors and the correlates with these were examined using general linear regression. RESULTS: The analysis demonstrates that many IDUs have responded to AIDS and highlights the characteristics of those who are predisposed to unsafe practices. Predispositions toward safer sex appear to be contextually determined, and needle-sharing determined by socio-behavioural history. CONCLUSIONS: The data emphasize the need for prevention programs in educational and correctional systems along with community-wide harm reduction and HIV prevention strategies, especially for younger persons. For older drug users, there may be a need for more intensive rehabilitation programs.

Hungarian Childhood Diabetes Epidemiology Study Group.,"Using the prospective Hungarian childhood diabetes register, a nationwide case-control study was carried out to investigate the possible role of various non-genetic factors as risk determinants for type 1 diabetes in childhood. A questionnaire (covering family characteristics, social status, fetal and perinatal events, breast-feeding habits, infectious diseases and stressful life events) was sent by mail to all incident diabetic children in 1990 (n = 163) and to two referent children (for each diabetic child), matched for age, sex and county. Diabetic children had a tendency to have mothers > 35 years of age (odds ratio (OR) = 3.52; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.74-16.79), a lower proportion of their mothers had higher education (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 0.95-3.0) and these children tended to move home more frequently (OR = 1.99; 95% CI 0.97-4.1). Although the duration of exclusive breast feeding was similar in both groups, the proportion of diabetic children who received no breast milk tended to be higher (OR = 1.76; 95% CI 0.91-3.4). A higher proportion of diabetic children reported non-specific infections (OR = 2.94; 95% CI 1.19-7.21) and the number of stressful life events was higher in diabetic children aged 10-14 years (OR = 3.9; 95% CI 1.14-13.27). As the risk determinants for childhood insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus identified in our low-risk population appear to be similar to those detected in the genetically different, high-risk Swedish population, our study strongly supports an etiological role for these non-genetic risk factors in IDDM.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1994 Jul,Norway,1994,90

Five-minute behavioral samples were observed randomly out of every hour from 8 a.m. through 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, for four 2-week phases (baseline, placebo, 50 mg, and 100 mg). During naltrexone administration, there were fewer days with frequent head-banging and self-biting, whereas there were more days on which blows to the head or self-biting were infrequent.

7929484,Factors affecting desired family size in Bangladesh.,"Factors affecting desired family size in rural Bangladesh are examined using data from contraceptive prevalence surveys conducted between 1983 and 1991. The analysis suggests that mothers having two sons and one daughter are more inclined to perceive their family as complete than those having three sons and no daughter. Logistic regression analysis indicates that important determinants of desire for more children are age of woman, current contraceptive use status, work status, and family planning worker's visit. The policy implications of these findings are discussed.",Journal of biosocial science,1994 Jul,England,1994,90
7920876,Determinants of body mass index: a study from northern Italy.,"Overweight and obesity are associated with increased mortality and morbidity, and human weight is influenced by multiple factors, both genetically and environmentally determined. We investigated the influence of some socioeconomic, behavioral, dietary and reproductive factors on body mass index (BMI). Data were obtained from a comparison group of a case-control study of gastrointestinal cancers from the four largest teaching and general hospitals in Milan, northern Italy. The subjects were 1,188 men and 832 women admitted between January 1985 and June 1992 to the hospitals under study for diseases other than malignant or digestive and not known or suspected to be related to alcohol or tobacco. The following were measured: BMI (Quetelet's index, weight, kg/height, m2) and the corresponding standard errors (s.e.) in strata of selected variables, linear regression coefficients (beta) and correlation coefficients between BMI and each variable. Mean BMI increased with age until 35-44 years in men and 45-54 years in women. In both sexes BMI was inversely associated with education and social class. Smokers tended to be leaner than non-smokers, but no consistent trend was observed with increasing numbers of cigarettes. Alcohol drinkers had mean BMI similar to non-drinkers, except heavy drinking women who were lighter. BMI was not significantly associated with coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea, bread, vegetable and fruit consumption. No relation was observed between total estimated caloric intake and BMI. In women BMI was directly associated with marriage and number of children, and inversely with oral contraceptive use.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,1994 Jul,England,1994,90

The study included 66 children. Eight of these children had at least one other chronic disease in addition to diabetes. 31 children used more than two insulin injections daily. The median value of HbA1c was 8.6%. HbA1c was positively correlated with duration of diabetes. However, for the children who were out of remission, HbA1c was positively correlated with age and negatively with number of meals per day. Children whose parents were divorced or single had higher HbA1c than children whose parents were married or lived together. HbA1c was also higher among children who received special lessons at school than among children who did not receive such lessons. Thus, age, duration of diabetes and psychosocial factors were the most important determinants for metabolic control in our study.","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",1994 Jun 30,Norway,1994,90
24227287,Optimism and coping as determinants of psychosocial adjustment to rheumatoid arthritis.,"Psychosocial adjustment in 66 patients with chronic rheumatoid arthritis, with a mean duration of 12 years with the disease, were evaluated in a prospective design, with 62% of the sample followed up 16 months later. It was predicted that dispositional optimism would predict adjustment over time and that perceived support and perceived control would be related to psychosocial adjustment at the time of concurrent measurement. At Time 1, psychosocial adjustment was associated with greater optimism and perceived support and less disability. Optimism at Time 1 was the only significant predictor of changes in adjustment at Time 2 controlling for Time 1 adjustment and Time 2 disability. It was found that optimism temporally precedes increases in psychosocial adjustment. In terms of coping strategies, wishful thinking was related to poorer social adjustment, whereas problem-focused coping was marginally related to positive adjustment. Neither coping strategy predicted adjustment across time. Optimism at Time 1 did predict problem-focused coping at Time 2. Perceived social support regarding a specific circumstance at a given point in time enables one to persist in solving a task. Interventions to enhance the quality of life of individuals coping with progressive deteriorative disease must look at the influence of their behavior and attitude on those who provide care for them.",Journal of clinical psychology in medical settings,1994 Jun,United States,1994,90

8203689,The size of mortality differences associated with educational level in nine industrialized countries.,"OBJECTIVES: This study addresses the question of whether inequalities in premature mortality related to educational level differ among countries. METHODS: Data on mortality by educational level were obtained from longitudinal studies from nine industrialized countries. The data referred to men between 35 and 64 years of age. The follow-up periods occurred between 1970 and 1982. The size of mortality differences associated with educational level was measured by means of two inequality indices, both based on Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: Inequalities in mortality are relatively small in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway and about two times as large in the United States, France, and Italy. Finland and England and Wales occupy intermediate positions. The large inequalities in mortality in the United States and France can be attributed in part to large inequalities in education in these countries. CONCLUSIONS: The international pattern found in this study was also observed in a comparison that used occupation as the socioeconomic indicator. Differences between countries in levels of inequality in mortality may be partially explained by the countries' different levels of egalitarian social and economic policies.",American journal of public health,1994 Jun,United States,1994,90
8201439,Prenatal predictors of performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale.,"The present study presents a prospective analysis of the interrelationships among prenatal medical, nutritional (dietary and biochemical) and behavioral determinants of Brazelton performance. Previous researchers (Scanlon 1984, Lester and Brazelton 1984) have raised questions regarding the relative roles of medical factors, nutrition, ponderal index and other behavioral factors in neonatal performance on the BNBAS. Four hundred sixty-seven predominantly Black nulliparous women and their neonates in Washington, D.C. who were enrolled in the study by the 20th week of gestation were subjects. Results of univariate tests of significant (P < 0.01) association between independent variables and Brazelton clusters from scores measured on day 2 are presented. The 26 behavioral items were summarized into 6 clusters as done in similar studies by linearizing measures made on a curvilinear scale and taking the mean. The 6 behavioral clusters are habituation, motor, orientation, range of states, regulation of states, and autonomic. Results of 16 reflex tests are used to define a seventh reflex cluster. Independent variables included demographic, lifestyle, nutritional, medical, ponderal index, and psychosocial measures. Several psychosocial variables, including stress, anxiety and partner interaction were associated with the behavioral clusters. Nutritional variables were associated with BNBAS habituation, motor, orientation, reflex score and autonomic responses. An analysis of co-variance was performed to determine the joint effect of the above variables on the variation in the Brazelton performance on the seven cluster scores. Five of the seven models (orientation, motor, range of states, autonomic, and reflex scores) were significant predictors of the outcome variables.",The Journal of nutrition,1994 Jun,United States,1994,90

A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out by mailing a parent-administered questionnaire (response rate 80.3%) to a random sample of children aged 1 to 6 years, in Espoo. The present analyses focused on the 1003 children at whom one or both parents or guardians were currently smokers. A total of 253 children (25.2%) of smoking parents were reported to be exposed to ETS at home at the time when the questionnaire was filled in, while 750 (74.8%) children were not. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for being exposed to ETS were assessed in the logistic regression. The risk of exposure to ETS was significantly higher when the parents had no professional education, compared to university or college education (OR 2.42, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.43-4.11), but socioeconomic status was not associated with exposure. The risk was higher with a single parent or guardian than in families with two parents (2.17, 1.36-3.44). The risk decreased significantly for atopic children (0.61, 0.38-0.98), indicating that knowledge of the child's illness affects the smoking behavior of the parents.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine,1994 Jun,Sweden,1994,90

8057633,The determinants of Australians' attitudes toward the Gulf War.,"Social identity theory was used to investigate the determinants of the current attitudes of 356 Australian (Melbournian) subjects toward the Gulf War. The dependent variables included a scale measuring belligerence, a scale measuring perceived justification for the Gulf War, and a short scale measuring how extensively the outcome of the war was perceived as an environmental issue. Independent variables included the concept ""Australia,"" measured by a semantic differential scale; conservatism and liberalism, measured by Kerlinger's (1984) Social Attitudes Scale; and gender. Multiple regression analysis provided some support for social identity theory. Conservatism and liberalism, however, were the strongest predictors of attitudes toward the war. Men expressed more support for the war than women did. Participants' conservatism and liberalism were predictive of how extensively they perceived the outcome of the war as an environmental issue.",The Journal of social psychology,1994 Jun,United States,1994,90

All burns other than those caused by electricity were commoner in females, more so between 15 and 19 years of age. Burns were more frequent in winter and 85 per cent of them were domestic. Nearly all burns took place during day time with a higher incidence between 06.00-09.00 h and 14.00-21.00 h. The patient fatality rate (41.1 per cent) was associated with total burn surface area. Referral time-lag was an important determinant of mortality especially in less severe burns.

8041010,[The quality of life in aged people].,"The quality of life (QOL) in aged people is an important issue that has been discussed for a long time and led to a number of studies. In this review article, the relationship between subjective QOL of the aged and various factors is summarized by referring to articles published in the United States of America. In the first chapter, representative methods for the quantitative analysis of subjective QOL are described. Among a variety of methods for measuring subjective QOL, the LSI-A and the PGC Morale Scales are commonly used. In the next chapter, based on the studies using these methods, various factors that determined subjective QOL are analyzed. These studies indicate that physical well-being and socio-economic status are significant determinants of the QOL for the aged people. In addition, employment and social activity are shown to be associated with subjective QOL. On the other hand, age, gender, race and marital status do not have an influence on subjective QOL for the aged as individual factors. QOL can not be measured with a unidimensional scale. Therefore, it is necessary for the investigator to carefully choose an appropriate analytical method by understanding the characteristics of the research subject and the purpose of the study. It is also essential to keep it in mind that any method has its own limitations in analyzing QOL.",Nihon eiseigaku zasshi. Japanese journal of hygiene,1994 Jun,Japan,1994,90
7933968,"Behavioral management of specific pathogen-free rhesus macaques: group formation, reproduction, and parental competence.","Breeding colonies of specific pathogen-free (SPF) rhesus macaques were established to eradicate the transmission of Herpesvirus simiae and several retroviruses in this species. Strategies to attain this goal included the combination of large numbers of monkeys into groups, the establishment of small unimale groups, and a program using animals that were temporarily socially restricted. All methods required the establishment of new social groups from unfamiliar animals. In using these methods, we encountered important behavioral questions related to the group formation process, as well as reproductive and parental competence. Age and prior social experience were important determinants of social and parental success. New multimale-multifemale SPF group formations were successful initially and involved the least aggression during the first breeding season when young females and older males were used. Formation of unimale groups was successful, even when males and females were of similar ages. Breeding competence did not seem to be affected by any of the SPF colony management procedures, but animals with restricted early social experience exhibited impaired parental competence when compared with animals with more social experience. Males were more sensitive to the effects of early social restriction than females. A variety of behavioral obstacles will be encountered when attempting to establish an SPF breeding colony by forming groups by use of these methods. Skilled behavioral management is necessary to surmount these obstacles and to achieve satisfactory social integration, reproduction, and parenting.",Laboratory animal science,1994 Jun,United States,1994,90

The objectives were to find out the knowledge of medical and social consequences as well as the factors responsible for sexual promiscuity among Nigerian youths. The study also assessed the discrepancies in societal concept of sex norms for males and females. The result was used as an index to determine the need for sex education for Nigerian youths. A total of 200 students (100 from each school) was assessed by random selection and use of a questionnaire. The result showed that students had a fair knowledge of sexual promiscuity, although in terms of medical consequences the knowledge was low for both groups. On social consequences, the knowledge was fair for both groups. Students agreed that lack of financial support and of supervision from parents and teachers were among the causes of sexual promiscuity. Recommendations were made for Health Education in these areas in institutions of higher learning. Also, recommendations were made for parental education on how to bring up, and care for, their adolescents to reduce the problems of sexual promiscuity. It was also recommended that a compulsory course on sexual promiscuity should be included in the syllabus in institutions of higher learning.",Journal of the Royal Society of Health,1994 Jun,England,1994,90

8172115,Vegetarian diets and colon cancer: the German experience.,"The study assessed mortality and morbidity risks as related to nutritional status of moderate and strict vegetarians in Germany. The total cohort of 1904 self-identified persons was followed up for 11 y. Compared with national mortality rates for Federal Republic of Germany, the observed deaths for all causes were below expectation by a factor of 0.44 for men and 0.53 for women. The mortality for colon cancer was reduced [standardized mortality ration (SMR 44.1 for men and 77.9 for women]. No deaths were observed from rectal cancer. A vegetarian lifestyle of long duration (> or = 20 y) was associated with decreased overall and cancer mortality. Other determinants of decreased cause-specific mortality were physical activity, body weight, and strictness of adherence to the life-style. The relationship between a vegetarian and fiber-rich diet and a decreased risk for colon cancer has been reported in many studies. In this study, the influence of other factors such as health-conscious behavior and a healthy lifestyle seem to indicate partly stronger effects than nutrition itself. This may explain the generally better health of moderate vegetarians.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1994 May,United States,1994,90

The major goal was to reduce four cancer-related risk behaviors: smoking, high fat consumption, excessive alcohol use, and exposure to artificial sunlight. A control community received no new intervention. Intervention methods included mass media messages, self-help materials, small group activities, lectures, and structural activities. Community organization principles such as a social network approach, community participation, and intersectoral cooperation were applied in the project. METHODS: Data were collected from both communities among cohort research samples on three occasions using telephone interviews. RESULTS: The results indicate a significant reduction in fat intake in the experimental community. No other significant behavioral effects were found. Further analysis among respondents in the experimental condition showed that those personally exposed to the project as indicated by familiarity with and discussion about the project, had a greater decrease in fat consumption between baseline survey and second post-test than those who were not. Also, the percentage of smokers who quit between baseline survey and second post-test was greater among those who knew about the project than among those who did not. Finally, discriminant analysis was used to further examine the determinants of project exposure. Community involvement, marital status, education, and sex were related to project exposure.

8075092,The impact of AIDS on an urban population of high-risk female minority adolescents: implications for intervention.,"PURPOSE: This study's purpose was to describe acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related concerns, risk behaviors, and psychosocial/situational determinants of condom use among an urban minority population of sexually active, adolescent girls. In addition we sought to define the accuracy of personal AIDS risk-assessment, the relative importance of AIDS in relation to other concerns, and the broader context of sexual experience and attitudes in this population. METHODS: A cross-sectional interview study was conducted involving sexually active female adolescents attending a pediatric clinic in an inner-city university-affiliated community hospital. Sixty-nine subjects (ages 13-19 yr, 90% African-American) were enrolled. While the goals of this study were primarily descriptive, subject characteristics felt to impact on condom use were identified prior to data collection and were examined against several measures of usage including: use at the time of last sexual intercourse, overall frequency of condom use, and reported behavior change to include initiation of or increased condom usage. RESULTS: Forty-one percent of participants reported knowing someone with AIDS. Global concern regarding this disease was high, although worry about poverty-related issues was often greater. Despite concern and high measures of AIDS risk (median number of sex partners, 3; past sexually transmitted disease, 55%; past pregnancy 77%), most participants perceived themselves to be at low personal risk owing to current monogamy, lack of intravenous drug use, and implicit trust in their partner's safety. Discussion with their partner about actual risk and awareness of the importance of past behaviors was generally lacking. Although 98% were aware that condoms may prevent AIDS, 64% used condoms half of the time or less when they had sex and use appeared to be primarily for contraception. Several intrinsic cognitive/psychological and extrinsic social/situational factors were found to correlate with measures of condom use. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' sexual histories and behavior emphasize the need for concern regarding AIDS risk in this population. Patterns of sexual behavior and beliefs regarding committed relationships raise challenging questions regarding how to motivate sexually active members of this population to use condoms more frequently. Programs aimed at AIDS prevention among urban minority adolescents need to be cognizant of the larger personal and sociocultural context in which these teenagers are making health-behavior choices.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1994 May,United States,1994,90

The relationships between the MCAS and gender, sexual experience, intentions to use a condom, and past condom use were assessed. The MCAS has five distinct factors: (a) Reliability and Effectiveness of condoms, (b) the sexual Pleasure associated with condom use, (c) the stigma attached to persons who use condoms (Identity Stigma), (d) the Embarrassment About Negotiation and Use of condoms, and (e) the Embarrassment About the Purchase of condoms. The results strongly suggest that condom attitudes are multidimensional and thus cannot meaningfully be summed to a single global score. Results further indicate that men and women hold very different attitudes toward condoms. Implications of scale multidimensionality and directions for future research are discussed.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1994 May,United States,1994,90

The acceptability of the two contraceptives proved to be high when measured by the rate of continuation at 12 months of injectable use, by method satisfaction, service satisfaction, rec recommending use to others, intent of future use, as well as willingness to pay for them when the injectables are marketed. The most important determinants of use discontinuation were young age, large family size, first time contraceptive use, previous experience with menstrual problems, dissatisfaction with clinic services, lack of counseling, lack of social support, as well as the husband's negative attitude towards contraceptive use. Side effects were more frequently reported by discontinuers; however, continuers appeared to be more tolerant of the same side effects. This study provided in-depth information about the social aspects affecting the acceptability of monthly injectable contraceptives in the different Egyptian localities, in addition to its being useful in monitoring activities in the clinical setting during these trials.",Contraception,1994 May,United States,1994,90
8041236,Acute respiratory infections (ARI) in rural Bangladesh: perceptions and practices.,"Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are a major cause of death in children under five in rural Bangladesh. A popular strategy for lowering ARI mortality in such settings includes detecting and managing pneumonia in children at the community level. The success of programs using this approach requires a well-trained community-based cadre of health workers and the appropriate utilization of services provided. Determinants of health care seeking behavior are clearly of interest in this regard. A qualitative study was conducted in Matlab, Bangladesh to describe community perceptions of signs and symptoms of ARI, case management behavior, and constraints to service utilization. Mothers recognized pneumonia and thought it to be caused by ""exposure to cold."" They were able to identify labored breathing, chest retractions, lethargy, and inability to feed as signs of severe disease needing treatment outside the home. Nevertheless, similar illnesses were sometimes believed to be due to attack by evil influences. In these cases, spiritual healers were sought and allopathic treatment was avoided or delayed. The mothers' observance of purdah and ""proper"" behavior were reported to play a role in prevention of child death from disease. Implications of this belief and its impact on service utilization are discussed.

At Time 1, measures of coping in response to a recent event (initial coping) and coping resources were obtained. At Time 2 (4 weeks later), Ss described an event (coded for event type) they were currently experiencing. Situational appraisals were also assessed. At Time 3 (2 weeks later), Ss' coping responses to the event were assessed. There was evidence that stable factors did influence coping behavior. Coping resources accounted for a significant proportion of variance in each of the measures of coping (except cautiousness), as did initial coping. There was evidence that the latter effects were dependent on cross-situational consistency in event type and levels of stress. After controlling for the stable influences, situational factors (situation type and situational appraisals) influenced the type of coping used.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1994 May,United States,1994,90

Results show that 309 (54.4%) of the respondents had ever had a Pap smear. The women who reported having had a smear were more likely to be below 45 years of age (prevalence ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.88), Chinese and of a higher socioeconomic status (1.68, 1.33 to 2.12). They were also more likely to have married at a later age (1.68, 1.21 to 2.31) than women who had not had a smear. Age and socioeconomic status remained independent predictors on multivariate analysis. The findings suggest that an important task of public health practitioners is to increase the uptake of screening among older and socially disadvantaged women who are known to be at the highest risk of cervical cancer. In addition, strategies to encourage younger women to continue regular attendance at screening clinics beyond their childbearing years will be important for the future.","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",1994 May,Singapore,1994,90

12287279,Correlates of welfare dependency among immigrants in Australia.,"""This article investigates some of the factors that are associated with welfare dependency among immigrants in Australia. It examines the role of factors such as gender, age, migration category, birthplace, period of arrival and educational background in explaining immigrants' dependence on government pensions and benefits as their main source of income."" The author finds that there are ""significant differences in welfare dependency...by birthplace and migration category even after controlling for age, education and employment status. Immigrants from Vietnam, Lebanon and Turkey were more likely than others to be dependent on welfare. Refugees were also more likely than other immigrants to be dependent on welfare; however the effect of refugee status on welfare dependency diminished with duration of residence in Australia.""",The International migration review,1994 Spring,United States,1994,90

The study determined that the occupational composition among those migrating from the island to the United States generally corresponds to the occupational distribution in Puerto Rico. The exception is that, after controlling for labor market conditions in Puerto Rico and in the United States and for other characteristics of the migrants, farm workers, laborers, and craft and kindred workers are overrepresented in the flow of migrants. The two most important factors contributing to the occupational distribution of migrants are whether or not they already have job offers in the United States and whether they are currently employed in Puerto Rico.""",The International migration review,1994 Spring,United States,1994,90

8193249,The effect of aging on fertility.,"In the developed world, deferment of marriage and postponement of child-bearing in marriage are resulting in unprecedented numbers of couples who desire pregnancy relatively late in life. These factors combine with a decline in fertility and an increase in pregnancy wastage with advancing age to present new challenges for the clinician treating infertility. Experience with young oocytes donated to older women indicates that the major responsibility for the decline in fertility with age can be attributed to aging oocytes. Oocyte donation offers new hope for infertile older woman, but important moral and social questions remain unanswered.",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,1994 Apr,England,1994,90
8189347,Self-stereotyping and social context: the effects of relative in-group size and in-group status.,"In 2 laboratory experiments, the tendency to stereotype oneself in terms of one's group membership as a function of the social context was examined. Experiment 1 examined the effects of relative in-group size on self-stereotyping. The results confirmed the prediction that minority members are more likely than majority members to stereotype themselves. Experiment 2 examined the interactive impact of relative in-group size and in-group status. As predicted, a high (relative to a low) status of the in-group increased self-stereotyping primarily for minority members, but not for majority members. Moreover, analyses of the differences in perceived in-group and out-group homogeneity suggest that the in-group homogeneity effect should also be interpreted in terms of self-stereotyping processes. Finally, the interplay between cognitive and motivational determinants of self-stereotyping is discussed as well as a possible distinction between self-stereotyping effects on individual level versus group level self-representations.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1994 Apr,United States,1994,90
8151324,"Evaluation of the neurobehavioral functioning of patients before, during, and after bone marrow transplantation.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the cognitive and emotional functioning of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in the protected environment (PE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were given tests of cognition and mood before their hospitalization in the PE, after 2 weeks, at discharge, and at 8 months post-BMT. Locus of control, degree of social support, previous biotherapy, and on-treatment psychiatric consultation were also analyzed. RESULTS: Before BMT, 20% of patients had mild cognitive dysfunction, and nearly 40% had significant anxiety. Although few patients developed problems with cognition or mood during the study, short-term memory deficits nearly doubled at follow-up compared with baseline. Anxiety decreased significantly during hospitalization and remained low at follow-up. In contrast, depression increased throughout hospitalization, but decreased at follow-up. Pre-BMT emotional status and cognitive functioning were highly related to long-term outcome. Type of BMT, locus of control, and degree of social support were related to psychologic distress and cognitive functioning, both during and after BMT. Patient age was not a predictor of neurobehavioral symptoms during or after BMT. CONCLUSION: Pretransplant emotional and cognitive functioning are important determinants of long-term outcome and quality of life (QOL) in BMT patients. In addition, a few patients undergoing BMT develop short-term memory difficulties and mood disturbance that may persist. Pretransplant identification of patients at risk for neurobehavioral difficulties may guide early interventions during hospitalization. Posttransplant assessment may then be used to develop rehabilitation programs and other interventions for individuals with persisting complaints.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,1994 Apr,United States,1994,90

Logistic regression showed independent positive statistically significant increased odds of having a perinatal death among mothers who lived in rural parishes, older mothers (aged 30 +), single parents, no other children in the household, large number of adults in the household, mother unemployed, the major wage earner of the household not being in a managerial, professional or skilled non-manual occupation, the household not having sole use of toilet facilities, smaller mothers and those classified as obese or undernourished. Variations were found for different categories of death. Intrapartum asphyxia deaths were not related to union (marital) status, occupation of major wage earner, number of adults nor to the use of the toilet. Antepartum fetal deaths did not vary significantly with occupation of major wage earner or maternal height, but did show a relationship with maternal education, mothers with lowest levels having reduced risk. Deaths from immaturity were significantly related only to occupation of major wage earner, number of children in the household, number of social amenities available (negative relationships) and maternal age (< 17 at highest risk). In conclusion there was little to indicate that social deprivation per se was related to perinatal death, although specific features of the environment showed strong relationships.",Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,1994 Apr,England,1994,90
8146138,Human ecology and behavior and sexually transmitted bacterial infections.,"The three direct determinants of the rate of spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are sexual behaviors, the mean duration of infectiousness, and the mean efficiency of sexual transmission of each STD. Underlying ecological and behavioral factors that operate through one or more of these direct determinants lie on a continuum, ranging from those most proximate back to those more remote (in time or mechanism) from the direct determinants. Most remote and least modifiable are the historical stages of economic development that even today conspicuously influence patterns of sexual behavior. Next are the distribution and changing patterns of climate, hygiene, and population density; the global population explosion and stages of the demographic transition; and ongoing changes in human physiology (e.g., menarche at younger age) and culture (e.g., later marriage). More proximate on the continuum are war, migration, and travel; and current policies for economic development and social welfare. Most recent or modifiable are technologic and commercial product development (e.g., oral contraceptives); circumcision, condom, spermicide, and contraception practices; patterns of illicit drug use that influence sexual behaviors; and the accessibility, quality, and use of STD health care. These underlying factors help explain why the curable bacterial STDs are epidemic in developing countries and why the United States is the only industrialized country that has failed to control bacterial STDs during the AIDS era.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1994 Mar 29,United States,1994,90
8122509,"Induced abortion. Effects of marital status, age and parity on choice of pregnancy termination.","OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of marital status, age and parity on the decision regarding pregnancy termination over time among pregnant Norwegian women. DESIGN: National surveillance data of induced abortions and births. MATERIAL: All women terminating their pregnancies (n = 174,590) as registered in the Abortion File in the Central Bureau of Statistics and all women giving birth (n = 639,551) as registered in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway between January 1, 1979 and December 31, 1990 were eligible for the study. Included in the analysis of pregnancy outcome were records with complete information on marital status, age and parity, which comprise 93.8% (n = 163,826) of all women having had an induced abortion and 99.0% (n = 633,542) of all women giving birth during the time period. OUTCOME MEASURE: The proportion of pregnancies terminated as induced abortions and the relative risk of pregnant women choosing abortion in strata of marital status, age and parity. STATISTICAL METHODS: Trend analysis of the proportion of pregnancies terminated as induced abortions in different time periods in categories of marital status, age and parity. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: From the first three-year period 1979-81 to the last three-year period 1988-90 there was a decreasing tendency to choose abortion among unmarried pregnant women above 20 years of age and married women with two or more children. In the other strata of marital status, age and parity there were no changes over the time period, except for married women 20-24 years of age which was the only group that showed an increasing abortion tendency over the time period. The prospect of single parenthood was the strongest determinant for choosing abortion independent of age and parity. Within all age groups of married women the abortion tendency increased more with parity than age. Cohabiting women chose abortion significantly more often than married women did. However, the true estimate of choosing abortion among cohabiting women was closer to married women than to single women. In order to find out the importance of other social factors and attitudes in the decision making process regarding pregnancy outcome, adjustments must be made for marital status, age and parity.",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,1994 Mar,United States,1994,90
8089452,"Mothers' hygiene behaviours and their determinants in Suphanburi, Thailand.","The aim of this study was to identify the predisposing and enabling factors affecting mothers' hygiene behaviour in relation to childhood diarrhoeal diseases. Qualitative data were gathered by naturalistic observation of 12 mothers and focus group discussions involving 32 mothers. Mothers with children less than 2 years of age in both urban and rural areas of Suphanburi, a central province of Thailand, were sampled. Twelve local terms describing five different types of diarrhoea were identified. Childhood diarrhoea was classified into two groups depending upon perceived causes: contagious and preventable, and not contagious and unpreventable. To prevent diarrhoea in children, mothers reported that they avoid ""taboo"" food, avoid breastfeeding with ""hot"" milk and visit local healers for a herbal paste treatment that is applied to the child's throat. Most mothers did not wash their hands before preparing milk or after disposal of children's faeces. However, they did wash their hands after cleaning the child following the child's defecation, and after their own defecation. Our findings suggest that health education programmes should utilize local terminology and work to counter common misunderstandings regarding childhood diarrhoeal disease and its prevention. Knowledge of the predisposing and enabling factors identified in this study will assist in the development of effective implementation programmes.",Journal of diarrhoeal diseases research,1994 Mar,Bangladesh,1994,90

The differential impact of environmental influences on the health of women in India is examined. The influences can be conceptualized as endemic stress that arises from social and physical environmental determinants of deprivation, inadequate resources, limited role opportunities, and oppressive cultural forces. It is suggested that there is a link between these factors and women's health status. The combined effort of Indian women and international support agencies is suggested as an approach to examining, evaluating, and remediating the problem.",Health care for women international,1994 Mar-Apr,England,1994,90
7906766,Childhood and adult socioeconomic status as predictors of mortality in Finland.,"Research has suggested that social-class differences in adult health may be at least partly determined by conditions earlier in life. In 2636 Finnish men, we assessed impact of childhood and adult socioeconomic conditions on adult mortality risk by examining whether differing socioeconomic life-courses from early childhood to adulthood were associated with different risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Compared with high-income adults, those with low income had increased relative risks of all-cause (2.54, 95% CI 1.83-3.53) and cardiovascular (2.37, 1.51-3.7) mortality, but these increased risks were not related in either adult group to childhood socioeconomic conditions. Men who went from low-income childhood to high-income adulthood had the same mortality risks as those whose socioeconomic circumstances were good in both childhood and adulthood (1.14, 0.56-2.31, all causes; 0.99, 0.39-2.51, cardiovascular). By contrast, men who experienced poor socioeconomic circumstances as both children and adults were about twice as likely to die as those whose position improved (2.39, 1.28-4.44, all causes; 2.02, 0.9-4.54, cardiovascular). Our findings suggest that socioeconomic conditions in childhood are not important determinants of adult health. We caution against this interpretation--a life-course approach to socioeconomic differences in adult health requires understanding of the social and economic context in which individual life-courses are determined.","Lancet (London, England)",1994 Feb 26,England,1994,90
8154737,"Determinants of adolescent fertility and its consequences for maternal health, with special reference to rural Bangladesh.","The second section of this paper set forth a theoretical model relating adolescent growth and development to family formation patterns and their implications for maternal and child health. Subsequent sections of the paper examine the evidence to support specific relationships hypothesized in the model, focusing on longitudinal data from Matlab, Bangladesh. Despite the emphasis on developing country populations, literature from developed countries was also reviewed. The weight of the evidence suggests that in the developed countries, while there is a positive relationship between reproductive maturation and subsequent reproductive behavior, the negative effects of young maternal age on pregnancy outcome is confounded with socioeconomic factors. Teenage pregnancy, or at least teenage birth, occurs disproportionately among the socially and economically disadvantaged. Moreover, teenage childbearing in the U.S., especially when it occurs outside of marriage, violates social norms, at least in the white population. Poor diet may be a problem in the U.S. but it does not appear to result in notable delays in physical growth and development, delayed or compromised adolescent growth, or late age at menarche. Limited evidence suggests that early menarche may be associated with more rapid onset of mature menstrual cycle activity but these findings have not been replicated elsewhere. In developing countries the situation is quite different. First, early marriage and childbearing are desired and common across most segments of society. Second, malnutrition is widespread, and is sufficiently severe to delay the adolescent growth spurt and raise average age at menarche by two to three years compared with developed country populations. This is certainly the case in Bangladesh. In this setting, several observations regarding the relationship of nutritional status, adolescent development and reproduction have been made. First, undernutrition delays growth and reproductive maturation, and women who mature early (i.e., women with young age at menarche) marry at younger ages than later maturers. In addition, body weight appears to have an independent effect on age at marriage, net of age at menarche, such that relatively heavy women marry at younger ages than their lighter counterparts. Explanations for this finding include correlation between body weight and development of secondary sex characteristics, and perhaps a cultural perception that heavier (i.e., normal body weight) women are more attractive, or healthier, mates. The effect of menarche and nutritional status on marriage gives rise to concern that an improvement in nutritional status, and an increase in the age at menarche, would lead to younger marriage and first birth, and higher lifetime fertility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,1994 Feb 18,United States,1994,90

Following family economics we postulate that for women a longer education decreases marriage rates both during education (institutional effect) and after the degree has been obtained (human capital effect). For men family economics predicts the delaying institutional effect, too, but the human capital effect is expected to increase marriage rates. Further considerations lead to the additional hypothesis that for younger birth cohorts these sex differences should attenuate.... For the United States and West Germany the observed marriage patterns confirm our hypotheses for the most part. For East Germany, however, we observe different marriage patterns. This was expected because the institutional context in this former socialist country was a very different one."" (SUMMARY IN ENG)",Zeitschrift fur Soziologie,1994 Feb,Germany,1994,90
8208900,Sex differences in lifetime depression rates: fact or artefact?,"To isolate determinants of any female preponderance in depressive disorder, we earlier selected a sample of young adults, then similar in terms of several potential social determinants of depression and with equivalent rates of lifetime depression. We now report a 10-year review, which initially suggested a female preponderance in DIS-generated RDC and DSM-III lifetime depressive categories. The presence of sex differences in rates of lifetime depression was influenced by the definition of caseness used and the vantage point from which rates were determined. The longitudinal design and earlier corroborative witness reports established, however, clear evidence of instability in prevalence estimates, together with a sex effect on stability. Men were more likely to 'forget' episodes, while women were more likely to 'remember' episodes that had generally not previously reached 'case' criteria. When correction was made for such artefactual influences, a sex difference in lifetime depression rates was no longer evident. Such findings require review in general community samples, and suggest modifications to 'case' definition in epidemiological enquiries.",Psychological medicine,1994 Feb,England,1994,90
8194930,Work satisfaction and health in the middle-aged and elderly.,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that occupational factors that cause psychological strain can affect physical and mental health, but findings are not consistent. METHODS: Work satisfaction was used as a convenient global index of job-related psychological strain. Relationships with general, physical and emotional health, appraised by the use of questions, were examined in workers aged > or = 50 years in a longitudinal community health study in Jerusalem. RESULTS: Positive associations were found both in 1975-1976 and in 1985-1987, with age, origin, education, sex and other variables controlled. The odds ratio in favour of poor general health was 2.8 times as high in dissatisfied workers as in very satisfied ones. Multivariate analyses suggested that the associations were not spurious ones attributable to a proneness to report both dissatisfaction and ill-health. Workers who expressed dissatisfaction in both 1975-1976 and 1985-1987 were particularly unhealthy in 1985-1987. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the impact of work satisfaction or its determinants on current health, and suggest that persistent dissatisfaction may be especially deleterious to health.",International journal of epidemiology,1994 Feb,England,1994,90

This study compares the distribution and the determinants of serum Lp(a) in Blacks and in Whites using large representative samples and the same methods in both populations. METHODS: The distribution and the correlates of serum Lp(a) were investigated in population-based samples of 701 Blacks in the Seychelles and 634 Whites in Switzerland, aged 25-64 years. Serum Lp(a) was quantified using a commercial immunoradiometric assay. RESULTS: The distribution of serum Lp(a) was similarly skewed in both ethnic groups, but median Lp(a) concentration was about twofold higher in Blacks (210 mg/l) compared to Whites (100 mg/l). The proportions of individuals with elevated serum Lp(a) (> 300 mg/l) was about 50% higher in Blacks (37.5%) than in Whites (25.2%). In both ethnic groups, serum Lp(a) was found to correlate with total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apoprotein B but not with HDL-cholesterol, alcohol intake, smoking, and body mass index. The variance in serum Lp(a) concentration explained by any combination of these factors was smaller than 5.3% in the two populations. CONCLUSIONS: The measured factors did not explain the higher levels of serum Lp(a) found in Blacks compared to Whites. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic factors account for much of the variation of serum Lp(a) in both populations.",International journal of epidemiology,1994 Feb,England,1994,90
8194905,Geographical differences and time trends in the seasonality of birth in Japan.,"Seasonal variations of births in six different prefectures in Japan are analysed using Vital Statistics from 1974 to 1983. First births show a bimodal pattern with two peaks, one in winter (December-February) and the other in summer to early autumn (August-September). The seasonality of first births is statistically significantly correlated with the seasonality of marriages with 9 + 12*n (n = 0, 1, 2, 3) lag months. For subsequent births, the seasonal pattern is unimodal and there is also a geographical trend in seasonality of these births with a late spring peak in the northernmost prefecture of Japan giving way to an early autumn peak in the southernmost prefecture. These findings suggest that seasonal variations in marriage play some role in the seasonality of first births, while other features such as environmental factors could be associated with the seasonal variations of subsequent births. Changes in the seasonality of both births and marriages over time suggest that the modernization of Japanese society after the second World War could be responsible for the drastic changes in the pattern and degree of seasonality of births.",International journal of epidemiology,1994 Feb,England,1994,90

8182637,Determinants of self-reported health status in ankylosing spondylitis.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative contributions of disability related variables, personality traits and social network characteristics to self-reported general health status in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: For 144 patients with AS (modified New York criteria; 112 men) the following variables were assessed cross sectionally: disability related variables (age, duration of disease, spinal mobility, physicians' global assessment), personality traits (neuroticism, social inadequacy, self-esteem, health locus of control) and loneliness. Health status was assessed by means of 3 self-administered instruments: Sickness Impact Profile, Health Assessment Questionnaire for the Spondyloarthropathies and Self-assessed Function. RESULTS: Factor analysis of the 3 health status instruments suggested one underlying health status score. This derived health status score correlated significantly with each of the disability related variables, the personality traits and loneliness (p < 0.05), but not with social inadequacy and physician oriented health control. In multiple regression analysis 4 variables contributed significantly, together explaining 44% of the total variance of the derived health status score: neuroticism 25%, physicians' global assessment 8%, internal oriented health control 6% and spinal mobility 5% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In AS, self-reported health status is more strongly related to personality traits than to the degree of disability.

In 1994 the WHO/MONICA Project will have completed its 10-year course. To develop a strategy of integrating cardiovascular disease indicators in an overall health indicator system, the problems and opportunities of cardiovascular disease monitoring have to be assessed now.

According to WHO estimations, chronic diseases in general will soon, as in the developing areas of the world, be the major health problem.

8043229,Evaluation of a targeted AIDS prevention intervention to increase condom use among prostitutes in Ghana.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the short- and long-term impact of a 6-month pilot intervention program on condom use among prostitutes in Accra, Ghana. DESIGN: The 4-year prospective study follows-up cohorts enrolled in the intervention in 1987 and 1988, comparing condom use in 1991 with that among a comparison group not enrolled in the intervention. SETTING: The community-based intervention was initiated in Accra, Ghana in 1987. PARTICIPANTS: Self-identified female prostitutes who volunteered participation. INTERVENTION: The educational intervention used local health workers to train and support selected prostitutes to be health educators and condom distributors to their peers. OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported condom use with clients. RESULTS: Reported condom use increased dramatically between 1987 and 1988 during the first 6 months of the intervention. In 1991, after 3 years of program relapse, 107 (43%) of the 248 women who had enrolled in 1987 or 1988 were still in prostitution and located for interview. Their level of condom use in 1991 was higher than pre-enrollment but similar to use among prostitutes never enrolled. Sixty-four per cent of those followed-up reported always using condoms with clients in 1991. These 'always users' were more likely to have maintained informal contact with project staff, know that HIV can be transmitted by healthy clients, and report that clients frequently initiate condom use. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the development of long-range educational strategies that recognize the career longevity of prostitutes, available channels for informal program diffusion, individual changes in condom use over time, and the role of clients in condom negotiation.","AIDS (London, England)",1994 Feb,England,1994,90

These countries experienced a substantial increase in contraceptive prevalence in the inter-survey period. Within countries, however, the increase was not equally shared by all social and demographic groups. The study found that relatively disadvantaged groups experienced greater gains in contraceptive use. Despite the prevailing tendency towards convergence, wide differentials in contraceptive behavior among social sectors still persist. A decomposition analysis based on logistic regression revealed that certain shifts in the population composition--i.e., increased proportion of urban and better educated women and a growing proportion of mothers who want to discontinue child-bearing--contributed substantially to the aggregate increase in contraceptive prevalence in most countries. Structural changes, understood as changes in the relations between the explanatory variables and the likelihood of using contraception, were also found to play a significant role in contraceptive use trends, particularly in Colombia.",Population bulletin of the United Nations,1994,United States,1994,90

Migration of family groups is essentially characteristic of international migrants, although all the members of the family do not always move to the same place. Besides pendular and incomplete migrations, settlement in Dakar can be observed, probably corresponding to a progressive [severance] from the village of origin.

8309360,Hepatic outflow obstruction (Budd-Chiari syndrome). Experience with 177 patients and a review of the literature.,"Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) may not be as uncommon as was once believed. Our study has substantiated the existence of 2 major clinical forms. The acute syndrome is invariably associated with extensive blockage of the major hepatic veins, resulting in congestive liver cell necrosis. In a small, but significant, number of patients the inferior vena cava (IVC) is also occluded. The important etiologic factors are related to hypercoagulability of blood. Immediate placement of a shunt improves survival. The chronic syndrome is characterized by portal hypertension and is associated with a variable abnormal vascular anatomy. The causes of the chronic syndrome are not clear, but a substantial number of cases are related to the presence of an IVC membrane. Shunt surgery is effective but procedures aimed at the primary pathology are likely to be even more so. The natural history of BCS should be viewed over a long period of time. The very long survival of several patients urges a more cautious approach to surgical remedies. Budd-Chiari syndrome probably represents a spectrum of disease caused primarily by a hypercoagulable state and having a varied presentation depending on the balance between rate of formation and the extent of the thrombosis and the body's own rate of thrombolysis and recanalization. The extent and efficacy of the individual's collateral circulation and the rate of development of liver fibrosis are other determinants. It is thus possible to view BCS as a continuum of a single pathogenetic spectrum. Pregnancy-related BCS in India probably has strong social determinants, and is usually acute and fulminant. We have, however, documented a chronic form not described earlier. Children usually do not have acute BCS, but chronic BCS in children and adolescents is similar to that in adults. Membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava (MOVC) is common and was found even at a young age. The association of MOVC with hepatocellular carcinoma, however, did not appear to be as clear as was previously believed. There has been a wide geographical variability in the causes and manifestations of BCS. Our study has clearly shown that--Kipling's categorical statement to the contrary--East and West do meet in India, in the Budd-Chiari syndrome.",Medicine,1994 Jan,United States,1994,90
8303014,A case study in the use of race and ethnicity in public health surveillance.,"Increased attention has been focused on the use of racial and ethnic categories in public health research and surveillance in recent years. This attention, however, has done more to increase the collective awareness of the difficulties inherent in these classification schemes than to resolve either the theoretical or practical problems. It has been recognized for many years that health outcomes for a particular ethnic population must be seen as an interaction between genetically determined factors and socially mediated exposures. The operational meaning of these concepts remains poorly defined, however. Although the general biologic construct of race and ethnicity appears straightforward, appearance is deceiving and the technical requirements that allow formulation of a rigorous and objective working definition have never been fully developed. The social factors that influence ethnic health differentials are perhaps better understood in practical terms; measurement of many of the relevant variables remains difficult, however. In this article an attempt is made to outline the implications of the new developments in molecular biology for the concept of race, and to provide an illustrative example of the continued evolution of the social determinants of ethnicity.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",1994 Jan-Feb,United States,1994,90

8189722,Environmental and genetic influences on alcohol use in a volunteer sample of older twins.,"A growing literature supports genetic contributions to familial resemblance for alcohol use characteristics, but few studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying alcohol use among older persons. We report patterns of alcohol use in a U.S. volunteer sample of 3,049 female and 1,070 male twins aged 50 to 96. Significant gender and age effects were found for self-report measures of current and lifetime alcohol use, with greater intake among males and current and lifetime abstinence more common among older participants. Comparisons with data obtained 4 years previously revealed high stability for quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption. Twin pairs with more frequent social contact tended to be more similar for lifetime and current alcohol use. Biometrical genetic modeling results indicate that use of alcohol is highly familial, with both genetic and shared environmental factors contributing to initiation of alcohol use among men and women. Among drinkers, however, the degree of twin resemblance for consumption behaviors is low to moderate and appears to be regulated by shared genes rather than shared environments. These data are consistent with a multidimensional process, suggesting that the determinants of whether one drinks in older age differ from those underlying how much or how often alcohol is consumed.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1994 Jan,United States,1994,90

Calculations of the number of Navajo women at risk of unintended pregnancy suggest that several hundred such pregnancies would have occurred as a result of the withdrawal of intrauterine devices from the United States' market. Analysis of birthrate data confirms this estimate: approximately four to five percent of Navajo births in 1988 may have been due to this market withdrawal. Available data are limited in their ability to assess impacts on small groups of health-policy decisions made for the population as a whole.

This community study of 72 such men, on average 4.9 years post-injury, had both quantitative (General Health Questionnaire [GHQ] and clinical interview) and qualitative (personal narrative) components. Most men were coping adaptively. However their overall GHQ scores were significantly higher than an ex-combatant control group, suggesting relative psychological vulnerability (P = 0.001). 13 (18 per cent) had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) though in only three was this clinically significant, two of whom were aggressive alcoholics. Social dysfunction was a better indicator of the minority who needed psychological help than a diagnosis of PTSD. The one in three with a severe physical disability were not at greater risk than the rest of the group. Personal narratives illuminated the ways subjects had registered and responded to their war experiences. Identification with the social ideals being defended by the war effort had been psychologically bolstering. Ten severely disabled ex-Contra guerrillas, who had fought on the other side, were also interviewed. The availability of appropriate training/work, and thus the economic fortunes of the whole society, are likely to be major determinants of long-term psychosocial outcomes.

Standard psychological tests were used as well as a detailed examination of at least 30 minutes. Results showed that the tinnitus patients statistically perceived less social support and more social distress compared to the control group.

In this study, a multi-level interactive model is used to assess whether the protective effect of maternal education on the risk of infant diarrhea is modified by three aspects of the mother's familial and community environment: household assets, community economic resources and the availability of mothers' clubs. 2484 study participants were interviewed in 1984 as part of the Cebu Longitudinal Infant Health and Nutrition Study. The findings suggest that the protective effect of maternal education on infant diarrhea varies according to the socio-economic environment in which the mother lives: maternal education protects against infant diarrhea in the more economically and socially advantaged communities but has no effect in the more disadvantaged communities. The results also indicate that the protective effect of maternal education is smaller in the wealthier households. These data suggest that improvement in maternal education level, alone, may not always have the expected beneficial effects on infant health. Corollary measures to improve access of mothers and children to basic community resources and efforts to help mothers be more effective in their various social roles may be necessary preconditions for higher levels of maternal education to result in improved infant health.",Social science & medicine (1982),1994 Jan,England,1994,90

Our ethnographic study of maternal perceptions of the barriers and incentives to immunization use in Haiti underscores the importance of 'hidden' social and psychological costs of utilization, such as embarrassment, fear, child care difficulties, and competing demands on maternal time. Findings from focus group interviews with mothers, individual interviews with health care providers, and observation at health posts identified five categories of maternal factors (competing priorities, low motivation, socioeconomic constraints, fears about health or social consequences, knowledge and folk beliefs) and five categories of system factors (accessibility, acceptability, availability, accommodation, affordability) which can deter immunization completion. The discussion focuses on how these factors influence maternal decision-making regarding use of preventive child health services.

It was hypothesized that the home behaviors of children starting day and inpatient hospital treatment would be rated as significantly more deviant than those of children beginning outpatient treatment, and there would be no significant differences in behavior ratings of children beginning day and inpatient hospital treatment. METHOD: A standardized behavior checklist was completed by the primary parent at the time treatment was begun. Scores on four factor scales were obtained, and a multivariate analysis of covariance was carried out. RESULTS: The hypotheses were partially supported. Children beginning day and inpatient hospitalization were seen as more disordered, anxious, and aggressive than were those starting outpatient treatment; children starting day treatment were reported as more learning disabled than were those in both outpatient and inpatient settings; and children entering the inpatient setting were perceived as more aggressive than were those in day treatment.

Individuals with developmental disabilities referred for assessment and/or treatment over an 11-year period were exposed to a series of conditions in which the effects of antecedent and consequent events on SIB were examined systematically by way of multielement, reversal, or combined designs. Data were collected during approximately 4,000 experimental sessions (1,000 hr), with the length of assessment for individuals ranging from 8 to 66 sessions (M = 26.2) conducted over 2 to 16.5 hr (M = 6.5). Differential or uniformly high responding was observed in 145 (95.4%) of the cases. Social-negative reinforcement (escape from task demands or other sources of aversive stimulation) accounted for 58 cases, which was the largest proportion of the sample (38.1%). Social-positive reinforcement (either attention or access to food or materials) accounted for 40 (26.3%) of the cases, automatic (sensory) reinforcement accounted for 39 (25.7%), and multiple controlling variables accounted for 8 (5.3%). Seven sets of data (4.6%) showed either cyclical or inconsistent patterns of responding that were uninterpretable. Overall results indicated that functional analysis methodologies are extremely effective in identifying the environmental determinants of SIB on an individual basis and, subsequently, in guiding the process of treatment selection.

8036985,Teenage motherhood: its relationship to undetected learning problems.,"This study describes characteristics of a group of 64 adolescent mothers and their infants who participated in a program for teenage mothers run by a local health department. A majority of the girls for whom California Achievement Test (CAT) scores were available scored one or more years below grade level in reading and in language skills. Relative delays in infant development (language and social domains) were also documented. High levels of self-esteem as well as general social acceptance (by adults and peers) of early out-of-wedlock parenting suggest that early motherhood may represent an alternative avenue to experiencing success for girls who are having academic difficulties. These findings, which suggest the likelihood of a high incidence of undetected learning problems in this population, indicate that these difficulties may have a significant relationship to the high rate of school dropout associated with adolescent motherhood.

METHOD: The sample included 79 gay men from Sydney recruited through flyers, press advertisements or personal contact at gay venues. Subjects were presented with 20 hypothetical situations graphically on a computer, which included different levels of attraction to partner, intoxication, attractiveness to partner, condom availability, desire for anal sex by subject, insistence of partner on using a condom and time constraints in each situation. Subjects used a computerized graphic rating scale to indicate the likelihood of unprotected anal sex in each situation, the frequency with which they had experienced the hypothetical situation in real life and satisfaction with their response. The probability of having unsafe anal sex in any given situation was the dependent variable. All other variables were predictors. RESULTS: A vector of predictors accounted for 30% of the variance (r = 0.54). Ratings of the probability of anal sex increased with the frequency that subjects had experienced hypothetical situations in real life, attraction to partner, attractiveness to partner and time elapsed since real life experience similar to the hypothetical one. Ratings of the probability of anal sex decreased with condom availability.

It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordancy between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.",Journal of sex & marital therapy,1994 Fall,England,1994,90

The constitutional framework made intergovernmental relations--local, state, federal--important determinants in shaping and transforming social policy in general and mental health policy in particular. The division of power among three levels of government created incentives to shift responsibilities, which in turn changed and distorted coverage patterns, thereby inadvertently transforming both costs and policy goals. It is thus critical to take into account the ways in which America's political structure mediates and recasts the context of mental health policy.",The Milbank quarterly,1994,United States,1994,90
7892792,"Inner-city youths and condom use: health beliefs, clinic care, welfare, and the HIV epidemic.","This paper examines questions concerning condom use and determinants of change in use by inner-city youths who appear to be in the direct path of the AIDS epidemic. Detailed information gathered in interviews with 548 youths in 1989-90 and 1991-92, provide a history of change in condom use and HIV-related high-risk behaviors. Condom use as a whole increased with time and age. Positive beliefs concerning condoms and awareness of HIV transmission were determinants of increases in use, and negative beliefs were determinants of decreases. Nevertheless, those youths who engaged in the highest HIV-risk behaviors (prostitution, IV drug use, and male homosexuality) were no more likely than lower-risk youths to increase their condom use. Financial need, indicated by receipt of welfare, appeared to be a significant barrier to increasing condom use. Also noteworthy was the negative association between using health clinics and condom use. Although youths with high-risk behaviors make more clinic visits, those visits do not result in condom use.",Adolescence,1994 Winter,United States,1994,90
7875917,Personality traits as determinants of burden and health complaints in caregiving.,"This study tested predictions specifying the influence of caregiver personality traits on negative outcomes of caregiving, health complaints and burden. Two-hundred and thirteen caregivers, who were caring for family members with dementia, were interviewed and their relatives were assessed on cognitive status and aggression. At follow-up conducted twenty-four months later, forty-five caregivers were still continuing to provide home care for their dependents. Caregivers who scored higher on a measure of neuroticism experienced higher levels of burden and health complaints both at initial and follow-up assessment. Caregiver extraversion-introversion did not influence the experience of caregiving. At both initial and final assessment, the ability to enjoy some aspects of caregiving, recreational activities, and satisfaction with social support from family and friends mitigated negative outcomes of caregiving, while appraising the dependent as more troublesome increased negative outcomes. Caring for more cognitively impaired and more aggressive dependents and being female increased negative outcomes initially. Personality traits and most other study variables demonstrated significant continuity across time for caregivers continuing home care.",International journal of aging & human development,1994,United States,1994,90

7826933,Structural and cultural determinants of child homicide: a cross-national analysis.,"Models of structural characteristics that may influence national infant and child homicide victim rates are derived from prior research. Expected effects of structural characteristics from a ""social control"" perspective are compared with expected effects from a ""guardians, suitable target"" perspective. Gartner's (1991) claim that structural factors influence victim rates only in nations with low social insurance expenditures is also evaluated. Statistical analysis of three infant and child age groups with homicide rates from 1965-1969, 1970-1974...1985-1988 fails to support the claim that high and low social insurance expenditure strata differ. Further, no independent effects of Gartner's (1991) three measures of family structure are found. Indicators of family stress/resources, female status, the culture of violence, and a proxy for unmeasured variables and measurement error all contribute to produce high levels of explained variance in each age group.",Violence and victims,1994 Spring,United States,1994,90
7780295,Determinants of early alcohol and drug use among young women in alcoholism treatment.,"Substance abuse experimentation may be one of several types of problem behaviors. Data from 99 Caucasian women interviewed in alcoholism treatment (19-29 years old) were used to test a developmental model of substance experimentation. Respondents were classified into three groups based on their use prior to age 15: nonusers, users of alcohol only, and users of alcohol and other drugs. Family history of alcoholism was not related to childhood anxiety and impulse control problems. Childhood anxiety and impulse control problems predicted adolescent emotional and impulse control problems but did not differentiate early experimenters. Whereas adolescent emotional problems were not related to early experimentation, early drug and alcohol users were significantly more likely to have engaged in other impulsive behaviors (e.g., running away from home, trouble with school authorities) than were nonusers or users of alcohol only. Alcoholism prevention programs, therefore, would do well to target youth who exhibit acting-out behaviors as a high-risk group for early alcohol and drug use.",Journal of substance abuse,1994,United States,1994,90

In Saudi Arabia, the total fertility rate (TFR) is 7.1, and the growth rate is 3.5 per cent per year, among the highest in the world. This research examines the structural determinants (indirect indicators) of fertility attitudes and behavior among Saudi Arabian students studying in American universities. Specifically, this study examined the relationship between fertility attitudes and behavior, and background characteristics which included age, religiosity, education, income, length of stay in the U.S., and wife's age and wife's education. Results indicate a highly significant effect of religiosity as a major positive determinant of fertility attitudes.

Breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhoea data collected from retrospective surveys usually exhibit digit preferences. Here, these heaping errors were smoothed by B-spline and used in multivariate models of risk of conception to investigate the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding. The data used come from a 1987 Indian survey. Results show that lactation, after mother's menses resume, reduces the risk of conception. Heaping in breastfeeding data attenuates this relationship. When adjustment is made, breastfeeding reduced the rate of conception by 47 per cent; the reduction, with adjusted data, was 63 per cent.",Social biology,1994 Fall-Winter,United States,1994,90

Analyses using an economic framework found that both rural and urban couples who intended to sign, or who had already signed, the one-child certificate reported wanting significantly fewer children. However, in rural areas (where 80 per cent of the provincial population lives), education level, living arrangements, participation in an arranged marriage, attitudes regarding the ideal age for marriage, and knowledge of the reasons for the government's fertility policies appear to play a relatively larger role in shaping fertility preferences.",Social biology,1994 Fall-Winter,United States,1994,90
7761046,Why do adolescents eat low nutrient snacks between meals? An analysis of behavioral determinants with the Fishbein and Ajzen model.,"This article presents determinants of eating sweet and fat snacks between meals by adolescents (12-15 years). A preliminary qualitative study focused on eliciting students' interpretation of the self-rated terminology 'low nutrient sweet and fat snacks' and the development of a written questionnaire following the principles of the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1980). In a quantitative study a questionnaire was administered to 560 students in the first and second grade of Dutch secondary education. In the data-analysis frequent and moderate users were compared. Frequent users had a more positive attitude towards the intake of sweet and fat snacks than moderate users. The intention to consume sweet snacks was more positive for frequent users. As opposed to frequent users, moderate users had a negative intention towards consuming fat snacks between meals. Moreover, moderate users experienced more social influence against the intake of both snacks than the frequent users. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the theory of reasoned action in relation to the self-rated consumption of sweet and fat snacks eaten between meals. In predicting intention to consume such snacks, attitude turned out to be more important than subjective norm. Finally, the correlation between actual eating behavior as reported by the students, and the behavioral intentions was relatively moderate which was probably caused by inconsistency between intention and behavior.",Nutrition and health,1994,England,1994,90
7740827,Scenarios for 21st-century health care in the United States of America: perspectives on time and change.,"Scenarios are a powerful way to bound the uncertainty of the future--to sketch the major pathways that the future might take. This article contains five scenarios depicting the United States health care system in the 21st century. These explore: an extrapolation of the current system; a single-payer driven system; a market-oriented system which forces more choice on the individual: a scenario which traces a transformation in health care; and a fifth scenario focuses on the healing role of health care. These scenarios acknowledge certain changes which relevant in all of them, e.g., by the early 21st century health care providers in the United States will have shifted to predicting likely health conditions, preventing what can be prevented and managing optimally those conditions which do arise (optimal in the sense of cost-effective treatment in light of the best practices of the day applied in ways which recognize and take advantage of the biochemically unique nature of each individual. Developed in 1991, these scenarios have been successful as a tool for identifying a range of likely paths which health care might take. The scenarios did not foresee the assertiveness of the President of the United States towards health care reform, although it did identify the difficulty which the President's and any other reform efforts would face. At their base, however, the scenarios trace the fundamental shift taking place in health care in spite of financing reforms. This fundamental shift is being driven largely by outcome measures; a commitment to accountability; better and more accessible health knowledge; enhanced technology; and a greater willingness on the part of some sectors of the health care system to deal with the broader determinants of health (e.g., community and economic factors).",World health statistics quarterly.

7713178,Definitions and determinants of handicap in people with disabilities.,"Researchers have made a distinction between disability and its social and psychological consequences, now known as handicap, both conceptually and in terms of intervention. More work is needed in standardizing and refining the assessment of handicap and in highlighting risk factors for its development. Epidemiology has major contributions to make in understanding handicap in both aging and young populations. Data on the prevalence and incidence of handicap are scarce and difficult to obtain. Efforts are needed in the following areas: 1) contributing to the methodology of handicap assessment through the provision of valid and reliable scales; 2) defining and identifying risk factors for handicap formation, which underscores the need for analytic studies in this regard; 3) understanding the dynamics of these factors in the production of disadvantage, which calls for more qualitative and in-depth interviews with persons with handicaps; and 4) formulating critical points of intervention at the personal and community levels for handicap prevention. Such efforts will assist policy-makers in formulating appropriate and acceptable policies for safeguarding the opportunities of people with disabilities, ensuring their optimal participation in society, and enabling them to lead independent and self-sufficient lives. Efforts to evaluate the effect of legislation, both existing and recent, on handicap development are also called for. These efforts may help to reduce the gap between disabled and nondisabled people and improve the quality of life for people with disabilities and their families.",Epidemiologic reviews,1994,United States,1994,90

On the base of above, it has been assumed that demographic transformations are result of two forces. First of them is formed by biological determinants, forcing human sociates to function in the environment in a way which would maximize both--ability to survive and multioly, and the result of these strifes in expressed by the guarantees of population existence.

However, the model's postulate--modernization and prosperity will lower fertility rates--has exacerbated rather than helped control worldwide population growth and the associated environmental degradation. Here we show that perceived economic opportunity leads to raising family size targets and to discarding elements of traditional cultures which formerly held fertility rates in check. Conversely, fertility rates fall when limits are recognized. These observations imply that a liberal immigration policy and large-scale foreign aid are counterproductive for restoring balance between population size and carrying capacity.""",Ecological economics : the journal of the International Society for Ecological Economics,1993 Dec,Netherlands,1993,90

Health status depends on the woman's age, her socioeconomic status, and the number of children she has borne. Her rating of the health of the members of her household is related to her age, her socioeconomic status, and her rating of her own health. Satisfaction with the physical health of the members of the household is a function her health, her rating of the health of her household, her age, her socioeconomic status and the number of children she has borne. The overall conclusion is that, in this study, it is socioeconomic and demographic factors that are important in determining the woman's health status, rather than the receipt of job-related benefits. That she reports good health is an important factor in her view of her family's health and her satisfaction with her own health and that of her family.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Dec,England,1993,90
8284696,Children's nutritional status in female-headed households in the Dominican Republic.,"A national representative household survey of food consumption, income, and expenditure was conducted in the Dominican Republic in 1986 by Tufts University School of Nutrition in cooperation with USAID Office of Nutrition [1: Rogers B. L. and Swindale A. Determinants of Food Consumption in the Dominican Republic. USAID/S & T/Nutrition, Washington, DC, 1988]. Out of 1440 families surveyed 706 had children under 6 years of age. Anthropometric indicators of height and weight were collected for all 1251 children in the sample in a follow-up study conducted from December 1986 to January 1987 by Tufts with USAID/Santo Domingo Mission funding. Anthropometric measurements were converted to standard deviation scores using NCHS standards; nutritional status was thus measured by height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ). Earnings in families with children having males as heads-of-household were roughly one-third greater than in those with females as household head; total income was also greater in these families, though not significantly. More calories and protein per adult equivalent were available in male-headed families as well. In spite of this superior economic and dietary situation, there was a trend throughout the entire sample for children of female-headed households to be taller and heavier for their age than those of two parent homes; all three anthropometric measures showed differences in the same direction. In the lowest expenditure quartile, WAZ and WHZ were significantly greater for children in female-headed households than their counterparts in male-headed households (WAZ: P = 0.01, WHZ: P = 0.00).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Dec,England,1993,90
8259803,Custody of cocaine-exposed newborns: determinants of discharge decisions.,"OBJECTIVES: Maternal cocaine use is a leading grounds for newborn foster placement. This study was initiated to investigate the factors that predict custody status of infants born to substance-abusing women. METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was used to study the correlates of discharge custody decisions for 99 consecutive infants testing positive for cocaine in a public hospital. RESULTS: The population was 49% Black, 40% Hispanic, and 11% other or unknown. Custody at discharge was to mothers (38%), other family members (25%), or agency foster care (36%). Placement outside the family was greater when mothers had prior child welfare records, in Blacks vs others, with no prenatal care, and when mothers were younger at their first delivery or older at the index birth. Denial of custody to the mother was higher with prior child welfare involvement, in Blacks, and when the mother did not live in her own home. Both models also controlled for parity, child sex, and birthweight. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier involvement with child welfare authorities, race, and other factors predict continued separation of mothers and children at newborn discharge, suggesting the need to reexamine current policies and practices.",American journal of public health,1993 Dec,United States,1993,90

Multiple regression procedure was used to analyze data collected from 162 nursing employees of a 327-bed Veterans Administration Medical Center. The major determinants of job satisfaction were found to be routinization, instrumental communication, and PA. The impact of participation, instrumental communication, integration, distributive justice on job satisfaction were found to be moderated by PA.

8242586,A clinician-driven home care delivery system.,"The financial, entrepreneurial, administrative, and legal forces acting within the home care arena make it difficult for clinicians to develop and operate home care initiatives within an academic setting. HomeMed is a clinician-initiated and -directed home care delivery system wholly owned by the University of Michigan. The advantages of a clinician-directed system include: Assurance that clinical and patient-based factors are the primary determinants of strategic and procedural decisions; Responsiveness of the system to clinician needs; Maintenance of an important role for the referring physician in home care; Economical clinical research by facilitation of protocol therapy in ambulatory and home settings; Reduction of lengths of hospital stays through clinician initiatives; Incorporation of outcome analysis and other research programs into the mission of the system; Clinician commitment to success of the system; and Clinician input on revenue use. Potential disadvantages of a clinician-based system include: Entrepreneurial, financial, and legal naivete; Disconnection from institutional administrative and data management resources; and Inadequate clinician interest and commitment. The University of Michigan HomeMed experience demonstrates a model of clinician-initiated and -directed home care delivery that has been innovative, profitable, and clinically excellent, has engendered broad physician, nurse, pharmacist, and social worker enthusiasm, and has supported individual investigator clinical protocols as well as broad outcomes research initiatives.

METHODS: The current study represents a secondary analysis of a data set originally gathered to identify the home health care needs of patients with cancer. The sample involved 87 patients with cancer who received home health care after hospitalization and 43 patients who did not receive such services. RESULTS: A logistic regression analysis indicated that home health care use was related to patient age, length of hospital stay, and level of symptom distress. Specifically, the likelihood of home health care use was found to increase among subjects older than 50 years of age, subjects with hospital stays of more than 7 days (apparently related to surgery), and those who experienced moderate to high levels of symptom distress. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a need for home health care nurses to be skilled in the management of cancer symptoms and in the complex problems commonly experienced by the postsurgical patient with cancer.",Cancer,1993 Dec 1,United States,1993,90

The findings, which were cross-validated in two samples, suggest that agreement is a function of four factors: which Big Five content domain the trait represents, how observable relevant behaviors are, how evaluative the trait is, and whether the self is one of the judges. Agreement was highest for traits related to Extraversion and lowest for traits related to Agreeableness. More observable and less evaluative traits elicited higher interjudge agreement. On average, self-peer agreement was lower than peer-peer agreement. However, this effect was limited to evaluative traits; for neutral traits, self-peer agreement was as high as peer-peer agreement. These findings suggest that self- and peer perception proceed through similar processes for neutral traits but not for highly evaluative traits, raising the possibility that self-perceptions become distorted when the trait is affectively charged.",Journal of personality,1993 Dec,United States,1993,90
8126717,"Effects of environmental demands, stress, and mood on health practices.","The present study examined how environmental demands, stress, and positive and negative affect were related to health practices. College undergraduates (N = 79) completed measures of stress, mood, and health practices during periods of low and high academic demands. Positive affect was positively related to exercise, nutrition, self-care practices, and overall health practices at two measurement points. Levels of stress (daily hassles, perceived stress, academic stress) increased over time, but increases in daily hassles and perceived stress were unrelated to health practices. Increases in academic demands completed in the previous week were associated with improvements in nutrition and self-care practices, greater drug avoidance, and greater overall health practices. This pattern indicates that a ""rebound effect"" may occur after high demand periods, during which individuals engage in more health-promoting activities. The results also suggest that the determinants of positive health practices may differ from those of negative health practices.",Journal of behavioral medicine,1993 Dec,United States,1993,90

The results indicate that the four types of risk behaviour are determined by several factors: the perceived behaviour of the social environment, individual's attitudes towards the risk behaviour and self-efficacy perceptions on changing the risk behaviour. High fat consumption differs from the other risk behaviours in that people tend not to be aware of their high fat consumption. No significant relationships were found among the risk behaviours apart from small correlations between smoking and heavy alcohol consumption, and between high fat consumption and heavy alcohol consumption. The implications of these results for the development of behaviour change programs are discussed.",Health education research,1993 Dec,England,1993,90

Unlike other leading causes of blindness, cataract can be treated effectively with surgery. Demographic, social, and economic factors are important determinants of surgical treatment of this disorder in the developing world, resulting in the accumulation of very large numbers of unoperated cases. Because of many factors, the problem is really out of hand. In this paper, we try to raise awareness among optometrists of this major challenge. At the same time, because many individuals do not achieve good vision after surgery and because in most developing countries only one eye is operated upon, we emphasize the use of improved prognostic techniques to make the surgical outcome more predictable, avoiding nonproductive surgery and resultant disappointment on the part of all concerned. We feel optometry can play important roles in diagnosis, visual correction, and management of these patients, hopefully in cooperation with ophthalmic surgeons.",Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,1993 Nov,United States,1993,90

The problem of drug addiction, which encompasses all aspects of the individual's life, is accompanied by the additional negative reinforcement of the permanent danger of a sudden fatal outcome. The causes for an accidental fatal intoxication originate from the different qualities of heroin, the reduced tolerance of the body and carelessness in consuming drugs. These determinants are influenced by several indirect phenomena, as for example psycho-social, therapeutic, legal and economic problems.

The study was cross-sectional based on the responses of a non-random community sample of 112 adolescents. The predictors of life satisfaction differed from the predictors of minor psychiatric symptoms. Parental alcohol dependency had no direct effect on minor psychiatric symptoms, with low family cohesiveness and intimacy being the major determinants of psychopathology. In contrast, parental alcohol dependency and family disharmony had an additive effect on level of life satisfaction. Family variables did not buffer children from the effects of alcohol once they recognized parental drinking as a problem. Nor did the survival roles protect children in any way. Indeed, the roles of the 'lost' child, the 'acting-out' child, and the 'clown' were detrimental to well-being.",The British journal of clinical psychology,1993 Nov,England,1993,90

8265756,Advertising health: the case for counter-ads.,"Public service advertisements have been used by many in hopes of ""selling"" good health behaviors. But selling good behavior--even if it could be done more effectively--is not the best goal for using mass media to prevent health problems. Personal behavior is only part of what determines health status. Social conditions and the physical environment are important determinants of health that are usually ignored by health promotion advertising. Public service advertising may be doing more harm than good if it is diverting attention from more effective socially based health promotion strategies. Counter-ads are one communications strategy that could be used to promote a broader responsibility for rectifying health problems. In the tradition of advocacy advertising directly promoting policy rather than products, counter-ads promote views consistent with a public health perspective. Counter-ads set the agenda for health issues, conferring status on policy-oriented strategies for addressing health problems. The primary purpose of counter-ads is to challenge the dominant view that public health problems reflect personal health habits. They are controversial because they place health issues in a social and political context. Advertising strategies for health promotion range over a spectrum from individually oriented public service advertising to socially oriented counter-advertising.

8240431,A Canadian study of the total medical costs for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and the predictors of costs.,"OBJECTIVE: We conducted a cost identification analysis on 164 consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who entered the Montreal General Hospital Lupus Registry between January 1977 and January 1990, compared their costs to the population of Quebec, and determined the predictors of cost. METHODS: In January 1990 and 1991, participants completed questionnaires on health services utilization and on employment history over the preceding 6 months, as well as on functional, psychological, and social well-being. The societal burden of SLE was determined in terms of direct costs (all resources consumed in patient care) and indirect costs (wages lost due to lack of work force participation because of morbidity). RESULTS: The mean total annual cost for 1989, as assessed in January 1990 and expressed in 1990 Canadian dollars, was $13,094. Although only 44% of the patients were fully employed, indirect costs were responsible for 54% of this total ($7,071). Ambulatory costs, primarily diagnostic procedures, medications, and visits to health care professionals, comprised 55% of direct costs ($3,331). The results of the 1990 cost determination were similar. On average, hospitalizations among SLE patients were 4 times more frequent than among the general population of Quebec (matched for age and sex), and the number of ambulatory visits to physicians was double that for the average resident of Quebec. Higher 1989 values of creatinine and a poorer level of physical functioning were the best predictors of higher 1990 direct costs (R2 = 0.29). A poorer SLE well-being score, a combination of education and employment status, and a weaker level of social support were the best predictors of higher indirect costs (R2 = 0.29). CONCLUSION: The direct and indirect costs for patients with SLE are substantial, and their respective predictors are distinct. Direct costs arise from organic complications which induce functional disability. Predictors of indirect costs are potentially amenable to psychological or social interventions and may be more easily modified than the determinants of direct costs, thereby improving patient outcome while simultaneously reducing disease costs.",Arthritis and rheumatism,1993 Nov,United States,1993,90
8115345,Determinants of exercise in children.,"BACKGROUND: The recognition that children are surprisingly inactive and that lifetime health beliefs and behavior patterns are formed in childhood has emphasized the need to examine the acquisition of exercise behavior in children. Although research has shown social learning theory variables to be relevant to the study of exercise determinants in an adult population, there has been little study done with child populations. The purpose of the present study was to explore the factors that may influence a child's level of physical activity. METHODS: Two hundred forty-two 5th- and 6th-grade children and their mothers were interviewed. It was hypothesized that several social learning variables would exert a particularly strong influence on level of physical activity of children. RESULTS: Regression analysis results indicated that salient predictor variables for boys included enjoyment of physical activity, friend and family support for physical activity, mother's perceived barriers to exercise, and mother's perceived family support for exercise. For girls, the salient predictor variables included enjoyment of physical activity, number of exercise-related items at home, mother's perceived family support for physical activity, mother's perceived barriers to exercise, and direct parental modeling of physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that social learning variables may be important correlates of physical activity in children.",Preventive medicine,1993 Nov,United States,1993,90
7903838,A synoptic inventory of needs for research on women and tropical parasitic diseases. II. Gender-related biases in the diagnosis and morbidity assessment of schistosomiasis in women.,"A synoptic inventory developed by us (Feldmeier and Krantz, 1993) was used for systematically reviewing existing data as to how and to what degree gender- and sex-related factors influence the validity of the diagnosis of schistosomiasis in women. Diagnostic sectors comprising survey methodology, parasitological methods, immunodiagnosis, detection of pathology and diagnosis of schistosomiasis in the female genital tract have thus been scrutinized. In this way we have identified important gaps in the scientific knowledge of diagnosis of an important parasitic infection. Socio-cultural and gender-related determinants have never been studied systematically, and it is mostly by circumstantial evidence that we can point out potential biases, sometimes for sex but more often for gender, in much of the published material concerning diagnostic categories suitable for schistosomiasis. These errors in diagnostic procedures and the ensuing lack of validity deserve attention from the fields of biomedicine and social science, preferably in a collaborative effort.",Acta tropica,1993 Nov,Netherlands,1993,90

12287570,"Circulatory mobility in post-Mao China: temporary migrants in Kaiping county, Pearl River Delta region.","""Since the 1980s, it has been possible for the Chinese peasant household to diversify its economic base by making use of its social networks to place members in a distant community as migrant workers. Through a microstudy of 50 such migrants in Kaiping County in the Pearl River Delta region, this article illustrates the interplay between macro, meso, and micro factors in the causes and processes of circulatory mobility in post-Mao China. It is found that Hong Kong's search for cheap labor, the PRC's household registration system, and Kaiping's strong localism provide the context in which migrants and their households have to adjust. The particular behavior pattern of these migrants also bears the stamp of their rational household decision-making processes as well as their feelings of moral obligation toward their kin in their community of origin.""",The International migration review,1993 Fall,United States,1993,90

In this study, we use the 1980 [U.S.] Census of Population to examine the importance of relative earnings and culture in the choice of destination. The main finding is the similar pattern of choice of location for immigrants from the Dominican Republic and Cuba. The more educated and more professional immigrants are found in either Puerto Rico or outside the enclave on the [U.S.] mainland. Within this group, those with less time remaining in the labor market and lower English ability are found in Puerto Rico. We find that not all differences in location decision are attributable to differences in reward structure by location.""",The International migration review,1993 Fall,United States,1993,90
8409134,Food preferences and food habits of patients with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine and compare the food preferences of patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with those of age- and sex-matched controls. DESIGN: We administered two questionnaires, one assessing preferences for 88 food items (according to a nine-point hedonic scale) and the other assessing factors influencing dietary habits. SUBJECTS: Thirty-three patients on HD, 17 patients on CAPD, and 30 control subjects with normal renal function. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 88 foods were grouped into 14 classes to compare preferences. Taste aversions, food preparation details, and psychological and social determinants of food intake were also compared. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The preference ratings of the HD, CAPD, and control groups were compared using analysis of variance. The dietary habits results were examined using a chi 2 analysis. RESULTS: Sweet foods (P = .002), vegetables (P = .003), red meats (P = .010), and fish and poultry (P = .015) were less pleasant for patients on HD than for control subjects. Red meats (P = .019), fish and poultry (P = .032), and eggs (P = .005) were less pleasant for patients on HD than for patients on CAPD. Red meat was the most unpopular food group for all dialysis patients. The most common factor affecting dietary intake was a loss of interest in food and/or cooking. CONCLUSION: We conclude that chronic renal failure influences patients' food preferences and food habits. Knowledge of these preferences will help dietitians plan more adequate and enjoyable diets for such patients.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1993 Oct,United States,1993,90
8363189,Cultural and psychosocial determinants of weight concerns.,"Several sociocultural and psychological factors underlie Western society's intense preoccupation with the body. These factors include the social value of attractiveness, the strong correlation between attractiveness and perceived fitness, the interrelation among attractiveness, a good body image, and feelings of self-worth, and the relation between pressures to succeed in both the appearance- and work-related domains. The strong societal emphasis on appearance and slimness has translated to both intense body preoccupation and a willingness to try almost any weight-loss strategy. Thus, dieting occurs across all weight categories in response to these powerful social and psychological motivators.",Annals of internal medicine,1993 Oct 1,United States,1993,90
8310241,[Psychosocial determinants of massive obesity].,"Subjected to the reversed relationship between corpulence and socio-cultural level, massive obesity is, in Western countries, more frequent in the lowest social classes, and particularly in women. The influence on bodyweight of restricted food intake, physical activity and relative proportion of fats in daily diet has been demonstrated, and these 3 interacting factors vary with the social class. Although they are unanimously blamed for their enormous weight, subjects with massive obesity do not have a higher psychopathological index than other obese subjects or people with normal weight. On the other hand, the search of these massively obese subjects for a hypernormal presentation to compensate for the ""abnormality"" of their physical appearance (partially dependent on genetic factors) leads them to deny a great deal of the emotional and nutritional reality. This denial, overlooked by health institutions, could have been full of consequences. By generating wrong evaluations it would have contributed to the inadequacy of therapeutic responses which in turn would have made the obesity worse. Taking into account this phenomenon should improve the adequacy of therapeutic strategies and hence the prognosis.",La Revue du praticien,1993 Oct 1,France,1993,90
8263246,The determinants of psychiatric nursing practice: a comparison of sociological perspectives.,"This paper commences by observing that psychiatric nurses tend not to interact with their clients in a therapeutic fashion. It is not clear, however, whether this is due to the nature of psychiatric institutions or to the attitudes of individual nurses. Contrasting social theories which posit either the importance of social structures, or of individual interpretations as determinants of behaviour, are outlined. These are then applied to the problem of psychiatric nursing practice. It is argued that while there are strengths in both theoretical positions, neither on their own can adequately characterize the complexity of the problem. Rather than attempting to explain influences upon psychiatric nursing practice in terms of either structure or action, we should appreciate the importance of, and relationship between, both factors. Given the rapid changes occurring in mental health nursing, research into factors influencing practice will become increasingly important. In order to explain developments adequately, researchers will need to take account of the duality of structure and action.",Journal of advanced nursing,1993 Oct,England,1993,90
8237314,"Association of overweight, trauma and workload with coxarthrosis. A health survey of 7,217 persons.","In a population sample health survey, body mass, previous trauma and physical stress were studied for associations with coxarthrosis. A sample of 8,000 persons representative of the Finnish population aged 30 or over was invited for examination, and 90 percent participated. On the basis of a standardized clinical examination, a physician diagnosed coxarthrosis in 6 percent of the women and 4 percent of the men. The prevalence rose with age. In persons with a past traumatic lower-limb injury, the odds ratio of unilateral coxarthrosis was 2.1 and of bilateral coxarthrosis 1.5, as adjusted for sex, age and other determinants using logistic regression. The sum index reflecting self-reported features of physical stress in present or previous occupations was directly proportional to the prevalence of coxarthrosis. Body mass index (kg/m2) was closely associated with bilateral coxarthrosis; the adjusted odds ratio (95 percent confidence intervals) for indices > 35, compared to those < 25, was 2.8 (1.4-5.7). In terms of the population attributable fraction, prior trauma, physical stress and body mass were estimated to explain 59 percent of the prevalence of coxarthrosis. The potential for primary prevention may be great, but longitudinal population studies are necessary to elucidate causal significance of the risk factors.",Acta orthopaedica Scandinavica,1993 Oct,England,1993,90
8235739,Determinants of lactation performance across time in an urban population from Mexico.,"We identified determinants of breastfeeding and full breastfeeding among 165 healthy mothers from Hermosillo, Mexico who planned to breastfeed and delivered vaginally a healthy term infant. Deliveries took place in either a nursery (n = 58) or a rooming-in (n = 107) public hospital where formula supplementation was not allowed. Multivariate analyses indicated that at 1 week full breastfeeding was associated (P < or = 0.05) with early milk arrival, social support for full breastfeeding and planned breastfeeding duration. At 2 months, full breastfeeding was associated with social support for full breastfeeding and early milk arrival. Breastfeeding was positively associated with early milk arrival and inversely associated with early introduction of supplementary bottles, maternal employment, maternal body mass index and infant age. At 4 months, full breastfeeding was positively associated with social support for full breastfeeding and inversely associated with infant age. Breastfeeding was positively associated with planned breastfeeding duration and inversely associated with early introduction of a bottle and urban background. Rooming-in mothers reported that their milk came in earlier (P < or = 0.05) than did the nursery group. Milk arrival was later when a bottle was introduced in the first week; both of these variables might be important in explaining a positive effect of rooming-in on lactation performance.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Oct,England,1993,90

8213661,Correlates of objective patient compliance with removable appliance wear.,"Patient compliance is considered a major problem in orthodontics. Yet, to date, few conclusive findings have been noted on determinants and consequences of failing adherence, probably because of method flaws and a lack of objective criteria. By following an outline of conceptual issues and selected research, we considered an investigation into correlates of patient compliance with removable appliance wear. We studied a sample of 77 university clinic patients ages 9 to 14 years over several months by means of psychologic inventories and electronic measurement of removable appliance wear. The actual compliance rate proved to be associated with many variables. Among those, characteristics of the patient and his family background, such as conformity and degree of consistent parental support and supervision are interpreted as determinants of satisfactory adherence, whereas treatment related and interactional correlates, such as duration of treatment, dominance of provider, and interpersonal perceptions, are conceived of in terms of mutually interdependent and/or consequent variables. The factors identified might be paralleled in the wearing of headgear and intraoral elastics that require a similar degree of active patient cooperation. After a critical discussion of our data in the light of previous findings, suggestions are provided for future research along with conclusions for clinical practice.","American journal of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics : official publication of the American Association of Orthodontists, its constituent societies, and the American Board of Orthodontics",1993 Oct,United States,1993,90
10146570,Intra-household differentials in women's status: household function and focus as determinants of children's illness management and care in rural Mali.,"In West Africa, health-seeking behaviour can be better understood by assessing how women differ from each other, rather than how they differ from men, in terms of their socioeconomic and political power within the domestic environment. Anthropological and demographic data were collected among rural Malian Fulani and Dogon populations who possess similar health beliefs and who live in the same ecological area. However, real differences between the two ethnic groups were reflected in variations in maternal status defined according to women's support and/or autonomy in their households. When a child becomes sick, status obligations result in limited degrees of co-operation between marital female relatives. By contrast, on a day-to-day basis such assistance is rarely forthcoming and women rely on their own unmarried daughters or on external kin networks for surrogate child care. It is concluded that variations in health behaviour and mortality outcomes within these populations reflect not simply 'ethnic' differences in beliefs or culture, but rather real differences in mothers' social positions within their family environments and in their access to household resources for children's treatment and care.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1993 Oct,Australia,1993,90

Data had been collected over 20 years ago from a sample representative of Finnish children. For this follow-up, 150 subjects responded to a questionnaire and attended a personal examination at the mean age of 37 yr. Hierarchical regression analyses were made for women and men. A split half procedure was applied for the control of possible chance associations. Work conditions and perceived health were not associated with BP. Social conditions in youth were powerful predictors of high adult BP for men. Poor living conditions in youth explained 16% of their diastolic BP and 9% of their systolic BP.

A comparative study of predictive factors was performed in 40 patients with histories of antiepileptic (AED)-drug-refractory epileptic seizures in the last 10 years of follow-up and compared with the other 138 cohort subjects. The two groups were cross-tabulated with 353 variables of family history, obstetric, developmental and seizure histories, and current medical and social status. Multivariate analyses were applied for control of confounding. Defined or probable remote symptomatic etiology of seizures, abnormal neurologic development/status, high initial seizure frequency, occurrence of status epilepticus, and poor short-term effects of AED therapy were significantly associated with long-term AED refractoriness. On logistic regression analyses, poor short-term outcome of AED therapy [odds ratio (OR) 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-10.4], occurrence of status epilepticus (OR 11.4; 95% CI 3.2-41.0), high initial seizure frequency (OR 4.6; 95% CI 1.1-19.3), and remote symptomatic seizure etiology (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.1-8.2) remained the only independent predictors of seizure intractability.

8403239,Alcoholic parents and their children.,"Some 211 male alcoholic in-patients were compared with a simple random sample of 200 men from Greater Stockholm. The group of male alcoholic in-patients and the random sample were subdivided with respect to alcohol consumption and use of hepatotoxic drugs: (IA) men from the random sample with low or moderate alcohol consumption and no use of drugs (n = 169); (IB) men from the random sample with low or moderate alcohol consumption with use of drugs (n = 31); (IIA) alcoholic in-patients with use of alcohol but no drugs (n = 171); (IIB) alcoholic in-patients with use of alcohol and drugs (n = 40). Earlier and more severe alcohol-related and anti-social problems were found among subjects with an alcoholic parent than among subjects without an alcoholic parent. The highest level of problems was noted for subjects with alcoholism in both parents and among the alcoholic in-patients. Groups which resembled each other were the drug users in the alcoholic group and in the general sample. Both inherited and environmental factors are important determinants and many of these individuals have psycho-social problems as children and adults. The children of those adults who used alcohol in combination with drugs (IIB) had most problems and the most severe problems. In the general population sample, those who used alcohol in combination with drugs (IB) had so many problems in the family and psycho-social problems themselves that they resembled the alcoholic in-patients and especially the group with high alcohol consumption in combination with drugs (IIB). A new finding is that the high-risk groups IB and IIB, who used both alcohol and drugs, had experienced a more disturbed school career and were more aggressive, had more nervous problems, and were more emotionally disturbed than the other groups. It is concluded that alcohol and drug use by parents may be predictive of future alcoholism in their children.","Child: care, health and development",1993 Sep-Oct,England,1993,90
8366679,Determinants of children's health care use: an investigation of psychosocial factors.,"Factors related to the amount of health care used by 5- to 11-year-old children in a health maintenance organization (HMO) were investigated using a comprehensive multivariate model that assessed the contribution of child health need, mental health, and social functioning; maternal mental health, social support and health care utilization; and family functioning and life events. Mothers reported on the 450 participating children. Health care visits for a two-year retrospective period were obtained from the computerized encounter system. Child health need and maternal patterns of health care use were powerful predictors of the overall amount of health care used, and these factors discriminated high users from low users of care. Family conflict was associated with a higher volume of care, while children's depressive symptoms and non-white race were related to lower use. Maternal social support, mental health, and life events were not predictive of use in either full multivariate model. Enabling factors were held relatively constant by participation of all families in a prepaid HMO. The multiple regression model explained 33% of the variance in use, slightly more than in previous studies of children's health care use. When included in a comprehensive analysis, child and family psychosocial characteristics help to explain children's health care use beyond what is possible using simple health and illness variables. The implications of these findings in the development of further research and to the practice of routine pediatric care are discussed.",Medical care,1993 Sep,United States,1993,90

In particular, it reports on a study of Australian secondary students who completed an 80-item questionnaire which captures the range of adolescent coping behaviour by assessing eighteen strategies and three coping styles. When the relationship between coping behaviour and the respondents' gender, age and ethnicity was investigated, it was found that older students use more Self-blame and Tension-reduction techniques than do younger students; and younger students use more work related strategies than do older students; males report using more Physical Recreation than do females whilst females use more Seeking Social Support, Wishful Thinking and Tension-reduction strategies. In general, the pattern of usage of different coping strategies, for the students participating in this investigation, indicates that adolescents' foremost response to their general concerns comprises attempts to deal directly with the causes of concerns while attending to both their own physical and social well-being.",Journal of adolescence,1993 Sep,England,1993,90

Women with only one partner are also more likely to be solely responsible for decision-making about the choice of contraceptive methods, and are not as likely to use drugs in conjunction with sex.

8211295,Modelling psychosocial effects of exposure to solid waste facilities.,"A parallel case study design was used to investigate psychosocial effects in populations exposed to solid waste facilities. Psychosocial effects were defined as a complex of distress, dysfunction and disability, manifested in a range of psychological, social and behavioural outcomes, as a consequence of actual or perceived environmental contamination. This paper presents the results of logistic regression analyses designed to identify determinants of psychosocial effects of exposure. The data come from an epidemiologic survey of residents (N = 696) living within a prescribed radius from each of three solid waste facilities in southern Ontario. The analytical model has three main components: external variables (e.g. individual and exposure-related variables); mediating variables (e.g. social network membership and involvement, general health status measures); and outcome variables (e.g. concern, effects and actions). Results for a series of site specific analyses show that outcome measures can be successfully explained by a combination of external and mediating factors. In general, variables from each of the three main components enter the concern-related models while the action models are clearly dominated by social network variables. Analyses using data from all three sites indicate the explanatory power of site-related characteristics. However, given the number and diversity of variables in the models, there is no support for a simple cause and effect relationship. The implication is that strategies aimed to address and alleviate psychosocial effects need to be specific to the characteristics of the populations in particular settings.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Sep,England,1993,90
8211289,Ambiocontrol as a primary factor of health.,"This paper is based upon the results of two research projects that took place in very dissimilar places and contexts, at different situations in the epidemiological transition process, but lead to some important common conclusions. In both studies, a geo-systemic or socio-spatial classificatory model was first constructed, comprising a series of environmental (independent) variables. Second, this model was used to reveal, measure, and try to explain the health disparities existing in the area under study, as measured by certain health indicators (dependent variables). Two socio-spatial models were constructed. The first used 26 environmental variables, measured in the 78 municipios of Puerto Rico. The dependent variables were mortality rates. The second employed 28 environmental variables, measured in the 32 community health department territories (DSCs) of Quebec. The dependent variables were physical and mental health indices. The most significant common conclusion of these studies is that the socio-economic level per se, or its classical principal defining elements (income, education level) are not the main determinants of the observed health disparities. A certain stability in the physical and social environment, the person's sense of understanding of his environment and of control over the course and setting of his own life (what is called ambiocontrol) that is induced by this stability appear to be the most important determinants of health. On the other hand, centrality, complexity and instability of the environment are the most pathogenic characteristics of the milieu.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Sep,England,1993,90
8211276,Determinants of regional differences in lung cancer mortality in The Netherlands.,"Although regional differences in lung cancer mortality are likely to be attributable to regional differences in tobacco smoking, studies in various countries found only weak relationships. This paper aimed at explaining regional differences in lung cancer mortality in the Netherlands. In a first step, clues for the role of smoking were obtained from a detailed description of regional mortality differences. These differences were found to be strongly determined by cohort effects: they vary between birth cohorts, and have been stable for over 30 years. Regional mortality differences reflect a diffusion of the lung cancer epidemic from high-income regions to low-income regions. These findings are suggestive of a relationship with regional differences in trends in cigarette smoking. In a second step, by means of multiple regression analysis, mortality differences in 1980-84 were related to available data on cigarette smoking and two other possible risk factors: work in transport and manufacturing industry, and air contamination. The independent variables referred to the 1970s. Positive associations with various smoking measures were found for women, but for men the associations were weak or non-existent. Mortality differences among men 45-64 years were associated with work in transport and manufacturing industry. Strong associations with air contamination were found for men and women 65 years and older. Additional analysis showed that regional differences in lung cancer among old men were strongly associated with smoking in 1930, i.e. half a century before. Changes in the regional pattern of tobacco consumption between 1930 and 1970 explain why smoking in 1970 is not associated with mortality differences in the 1980s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Sep,England,1993,90
7916171,The determinants of aggression and violence among psychiatric patients: a review.,"Aggression and violence are frequently experienced both in the community and the institutions. General attempts have been made to categorize research literature on aggressive behavior in animal as in man. Most of the studies are often deficient in the description and categorization of human aggressive behaviours and there is no well-defined status provided for these behaviors by modern nosography. The determinants of violence involve many levels and require psychological, dynamic and socio-environmental approaches but also extensive investigation into the underlying biological mechanisms.",Acta psychiatrica Belgica,1993 Sep-Oct,Belgium,1993,90

7689067,Determinants of parental satisfaction with disclosure of disability.,"Parental satisfaction with the process of disclosure of disability was investigated in interviews with 103 parents of children with severe physical disability. Only 37 per cent of parents were satisfied with disclosure. Parents were more likely to be satisfied if they felt that the professional carrying out the disclosure had a sympathetic, understanding and approachable manner, and was direct and communicated well; if they had been given sufficient information and opportunities to ask questions; and if they were from a manual social-class background. Factors in the procedure of the disclosure, such as the timing, were not significantly related to satisfaction. These results demonstrate the importance of the parent-professional interaction and point towards an increased emphasis on communication skills in medical training.",Developmental medicine and child neurology,1993 Sep,England,1993,90
8405611,"Race, intervening variables, and two components of low birth weight.","The low birth weight (LBW) gap between blacks and whites has remained largely unexplained in past research. Most previous research on the topic has focused on LBW as a single entity, and without using a causal framework for analysis. The present study examines the determinants of race differences in the two main components of LBW--preterm birth (PRETERM) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)-within a partially causal framework that includes social and proximate explanatory variables. The data come from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth. This study asks, first, through what intervening variables do race and other exogenous sociodemographic variables operate to raise the risk of these adverse pregnancy outcomes? Second, what are the determinants of the two components of LBW when all explanatory variables are included in the model? The findings reveal differences in how race (and other exogenous variables) act through downstream variables to affect PRETERM and IUGR, as well as differences in the net determinants of these pregnancy outcomes. The models are better able to account statistically for race differences in IUGR (which is explained by intervening sociodemographic, attitude, and behavior variables) than in PRETERM (which is explained partly by intervening health variables).",Demography,1993 Aug,United States,1993,90
8374223,Early determinants of cardiovascular risk factors in adults. A. Plasma lipids.,"The aim of the study was to examine the effect of birth weight, infant nutrition, body mass and social status from early childhood and adulthood on plasma lipid levels in 192 adult subjects examined in the first three years of life (mean age 1.4 years in males and 1.3 years in females) and again as adults (mean age 19.9 years in males and 19.6 in females). According to the results obtained, total cholesterol was significantly higher in adult male subjects breast fed for the shortest period of time (p < 0.05). Those males who were leanest in the first three years of life and fattest as adults had the highest levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.03) and LDL cholesterol (p = 0.02). Birth weight had no significant influence on plasma lipid levels in adults subjects. When data on nutrition, anthropometry and social status from both age periods were included in multivariate regression analyses, the most significant predictors of higher levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in males were lower adult height and poor social status in early childhood, while in females they were a shorter duration of breast feeding and earlier introduction of solids.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1993 Aug,Norway,1993,90
8334668,Community intervention. Creating opportunities and support for cancer control behaviors.,"Much of the potential for reducing cancer mortality is dependent on the adoption of new behavioral patterns. Such changes demand application of the behavioral-social sciences. A shift from univariate reductionist models of causation toward multivariate systems models is needed. Decisions (and behavior) are the focus of much of the behavioral-social sciences. Determinants of decisions are delimited by controlling systems. Health care is only one of many possible influences on controlling systems, and its influence is only marginal for the behavior of the general public. Thus, community interventions that address multiple determinants within controlling systems are needed to influence most behaviors. Belief saliency hierarchies appear to psychologically mediate controlling systems. Changes in these saliency hierarchies lead to changes in behaviors. Person-valued beliefs, social-valued beliefs, and feasibility beliefs serve as the informational basis for the hierarchies. Needs activation is a primary means by which hierarchies shift. Changing environmental cues and signals also impart such shifts. Experience, persuasive communication, and value extracted from the environment also change hierarchies. Needs activation, community presence, persuasive communication, facilitation, inhibition, and experience-based interventions are discussed for tobacco use control, dietary change, and breast and cervical cancer screening behavior. Emphasis is given to how the health care system can become a part of the controlling system that influences community behavior. Issues concerning successful implementation of community education programs are raised.",Cancer,1993 Aug 1,United States,1993,90
8219465,"Early child health in Lahore, Pakistan: I. Study design.","In this paper, details are given of a community based follow up study of four areas: a village, a periurban slum, an urban slum and an upper middle class control group living in and around Lahore, Pakistan. The aim was to characterize the determinants of child health in a rapidly urbanizing community. The study was undertaken in two steps. An initial cross-sectional survey collecting socio-economic and demographic background information was carried out between March to August 1984. This was followed by a longitudinal study of 1476 infants representing the outcome of the pregnancies registered continuously between September 1984 to March 1987 among the 3242 families in the study. These infants were followed monthly from birth to 3 years of age and thereafter less frequently. In this communication we describe the study design, the study population, the organization and the research methodology used, including the reasons for drop outs from birth to 24 months of age. The internal consistency of the data is also presented. After the initial examination of the newborns within between 0-7 days of birth, the infants were visited monthly for 24 months making a total of 20911 examinations. At 24 months of age 70% of the infants were still in the study, 11% had died before reaching this age, 13% had moved from the area and 6% had refused to participate in the study. The economic, conditions, social structure, and the quality of life were found, not surprisingly, to vary significantly among the four areas. This community-based project provides new, critical and reliable information for local health planners. The study highlights the importance of the development of a useful model for research collaboration between institutions in developed and developing countries.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992).

8192118,The contexts of adolescents' chronic life stressors.,"Proposed and tested a model of the determinants of adolescents' chronic life stressors, consisting of sociodemographic, personal, and contextual stress and coping factors, using baseline and 1-year follow-up data from 259 adolescents who varied in their psychological and physical health. Concurrent regression analyses at Time 1 and at Time 2, and longitudinal regressions that controlled for the levels of chronic stressors 1 year earlier, showed that sociodemographic, personal, and contextual factors each made a significant contribution to predicting adolescents' ongoing stressors with their mother, father, siblings friends and classmates and teachers at school. Personal factors of an emotional temperament and low perceived self-worth, and contextual factors of more negative life events and fewer social resources, were related to more chronic stressors. Suggestions for further development of the model are discussed.",American journal of community psychology,1993 Aug,England,1993,90
8319193,Determinants of cancer therapy in elderly patients.,"BACKGROUND: Older patients with cancer are less likely to receive definitive therapy, but the reasons for this are unclear. METHODS: All people aged 65 years or older living in six counties in New Mexico and diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer between May 15, 1984 and May 15, 1986 (N = 669) were interviewed to obtain information on demographics, socioeconomic status, functional status, social support, other medical conditions, and cognitive status. Cancer treatment information was obtained from the New Mexico Tumor Registry. RESULTS: In univariate analyses, the following variables were associated significantly with nonreceipt of definitive therapy for cancer: advanced age, impairment in activities of daily living, low physical activity, decreased mental status, impaired access to transportation, and poor social support. In a multivariate analysis with the above variables along with measures of comorbidity, only advanced age and decreased mental status remained significant predictors of nonreceipt of definitive surgery, whereas the effects of impaired access to transportation and low physical activity remained relatively large but no longer were statistically significant. When receipt of surgery and receipt of radiation therapy were considered separately, older age, limited access to transportation, impaired functional status, and impaired mental status all significantly predicted nonreceipt of radiation therapy, but not surgery. CONCLUSIONS: There is a decline with age in the percentage of adults with cancer who received definitive therapy independent of other potentially explanatory factors such as comorbidity. In addition, decisions about radiation may be influenced by nonmedical, potentially correctable factors such as impaired access to transportation.",Cancer,1993 Jul 15,United States,1993,90

12179757,Changes in the determinants of fertility in Korea: analyses of pregnancy intervals and outcomes.,"Korea completed the whole process of what is called the demographic transition to a low fertility and mortality level with the successful implementation of the national family planning program in 1962, and this has been accompanied by rapid socioeconomic development. Most of the fertility decline was due to a rising age at marriage and to lower marital fertility. The national family planning program, combined with the widespread practice of induced abortion, has placed an important role in reducing marital fertility, particularly among older women. This paper aims, therefore, to examine the determinants of fertility and their changes over time in an effort to suggest future population policy directions for Korea. The analysis is divided into 2 parts-estimation of pregnancy intervals by applying the proportional hazards model, and estimation of the determinants of fertility by adopting the logistic regression model to find out whether a pregnancy terminates in a live birth or in an abortion. In both analyses, the sex was included as the main explanatory variable. A woman's education has been shown to have a significant effect on delaying the timing or on the wife's age at first pregnancy, but its effect on the pace of subsequent pregnancies is much smaller and often positive. On the other hand, the woman's education has a consistently positive effect on the probability of a pregnancy ending in an abortion although the effect shows a steady decline over time. Form first parity, the sex composition of previous children stands out consistently as the most important factor in deciding both the pace of pregnancy and its outcome. The pregnancy risks of the women with sons are reduced by almost 50% at the second and third parities. The probability of a pregnancy ending in an abortion also increases substantially when parents already have a son. The decline of the desired family size but the sustained strong son preference has made the sex of children a more important factor in the determination of Korean fertility. The woman's education, on the other hand, has become a less important factor.","Pogon sahoe nonjip = Journal of population, health, and social welfare",1993 Jul,Korea (South),1993,90

Among black women, an unplanned teenage birth--represented by the secondborn twin--results in significantly lower rates of high school graduation and labor-force participation and significantly higher rates of poverty and welfare recipiency. Ten years after giving birth, black women who have an unplanned child are also significantly less likely than women who have not to be currently married, but are not less likely to have ever been married. Like black women, white women who have an unplanned teenage birth have significantly higher rates of poverty and welfare recipiency; they also have significantly lower family earnings and household income.",Family planning perspectives,1993 Jul-Aug,United States,1993,90
8399248,Weight gain attitudes among pregnant adolescents.,"Maternal weight gain is the most important, manageable determinant of infant birth weight among adolescents. Negative attitudes toward weight gain may adversely affect maternal weight gain. We hypothesized that (a) negative attitudes toward pregnancy weight gain are more common among younger pregnant adolescents, and (b) negative attitudes toward pregnancy weight gain adversely affect adolescent maternal weight gain. The study subjects, 99, radially diverse, pregnant 13 through 18 year olds, completed the 18-item, Likert-format, Pregnancy and Weight Gain Attitude Scale. Responses to the questionnaire indicated that most (83.8%) of the adolescents we interviewed had a positive attitude toward pregnancy weight gain when they entered prenatal care. Univariate analyses revealed that attitudes toward weight gain were unrelated to the respondents' ages but inversely related to their prepregnant weights (-0.16; p = 0.06) and the severity of their symptoms of depression (r = -0.26; p = 0.004). Attitudes toward weight gain were also directly related to their family support (r = 0.17; p = 0.06). Weight gain was significantly related to 4 of the 18 scale items but not to the total attitude scale score. We conclude that (a) the developmental task of formulating a positive body image does not foster more negative attitudes toward pregnancy weight gain among younger adolescents; (b) negative weight gain attitudes are most common among heavier adolescents, depressed adolescents, and adolescents who do not perceive their families as supportive; and (c) negative weight gain attitudes could adversely affect pregnancy weight gain.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1993 Jul,United States,1993,90
8398220,Predicting physical activity change in men and women in two New England communities.,"We describe the predictors of change in physical activity in a population-derived sample of residents of two New England communities. In 1986-1987 and again in 1990-1991, we assessed the self-reported physical activity of 1,081 survey respondents using a single question concerning the frequency of exercise-induced sweating. We measured and analyzed sociodemographic variables, cardiovascular disease risk factors, health knowledge and beliefs, social support variables, and exercise performance variables at baseline as potential predictors of physical activity change. We defined physical activity change in subjects as follows: maintainers (12.2%) persisted with > or = 3 times per week of activity, adopters (16.0%) increased activity to > or = 3 times per week, quitters (11.9%) decreased activity to < 3 times per week, and sedentary (59.9%) individuals persisted with < 3 times per week of activity. Using polychotomous multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that short-term success with exercise and weight loss, school children's recommendation of exercise, and work outside the home predicted adoption or maintenance of increased physical activity in women. For men, short-term success with exercise and weight loss and health beliefs regarding the role of exercise in preventing heart attacks and stroke were the major determinants of maintaining or adopting increased physical activity. This identification of the predictors of physical activity change provides the rationale for future sex-specific strategies aimed at increasing regular physical activity and long-term adherence to an active lifestyle.",American journal of preventive medicine,1993 Jul-Aug,Netherlands,1993,90

8351536,Social determinants of child health in Yemen.,"Much of child illness in developing countries can be explained by what have been called, 'proximate determinants,' principally infant feeding practices and preventive and curative care. During previous field research in a small village in Yemen the author observed that despite the uniformly unhealthy environment, a minority of the families carried most of the burden of child illness and death. This study was carried out to document that observation, and to suggest an explanation. The study used quantitative techniques to map child health in the community and identify a sub-sample for subsequent in-depth questioning and observation. What distinguished women with healthy and unhealthy children was the level of resources under their control and the way they managed them; their social support or lack of it; and their passive or active attitudes toward life. Detailed stories are presented for five of the women. Although biological explanations for ill health can lead to useful interventions, the social and economic problems of the 'multi-problem family'--well-recognized in industrialized countries--must also be addressed to improve child health.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Jul,England,1993,90
8351534,Determinants of pregnancy outcomes and targeting of maternal health services in Jamaica.,"Detailed nationally representative population level data were used to investigate the pre-natal care and delivery experiences of pregnant women in Jamaica. The results of this study show that: (a) demographic criteria (particularly first births) and self-reported clinical pregnancy complications are valid predictors of deleterious maternal health outcomes and can be used to stratify mothers into risk groups. (b) There appears to be a significant problem of under and inappropriate utilization of pre-natal care services by all women and in particular by demographically 'high risk' women, i.e. young, first time mothers. Significant proportions of the latter group report either no pre-natal care visits at all or visits which are later than the first trimester. The problems of delayed initiation of pre-natal care are specially exacerbated for poor, teenage mothers who happen to be living in the Kingston Metropolitan Area. (c) In terms of the content and quality of pre-natal care services the message is somewhat mixed. On the positive side the pre-natal care system is doing a moderately satisfactory job with regard to diagnostic tests and educational advice. On the negative side however, the fact that once women enter the health care system they all receive the same moderately adequate care (in terms of diagnostic evaluations and educational advice) with no attempt to focus particular attention on high risk mothers is troublesome. (d) With regard to appropriate delivery venues for pregnant women, pre-natal care visits do not appear to significantly influence the choice of delivery venues. Moreover, rich urban women are much more likely to deliver in a hospital than their rural peers. In conclusion, the study discusses the social and behavioral context of these results, addresses the policy implications and makes some recommendations to improve maternal health services.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Jul,England,1993,90
8240210,Familiality of female and male homosexuality.,"We examined data from a large cohort of homosexual and heterosexual females and males concerning their siblings' sexual orientations. As in previous studies, both male and female homosexuality were familial. Homosexual females had an excess of homosexual brothers compared to heterosexual subjects, thus providing evidence that similar familial factors influence both male and female homosexuality. Furthermore, despite the large sample size, homosexual females and males did not differ significantly from each other in their proportions of either homosexual sisters or homosexual brothers. Thus, results were most consistent with the possibility that similar familial factors influence male and female sexual orientation. However, because results conflicted with those of some other studies, and because siblings' sexual orientations were obtained in a manner likely to yield more errors than in these other, smaller studies, further work is needed using large samples and more careful methods before the degree of cofamiliality of male and female homosexuality can be resolved definitively. We also examined whether some parental influences comprised shared environmental effects on sexual orientation. Scales attempting to measure such influences failed to distinguish subjects with homosexual siblings from subjects with only heterosexual siblings and, thus, did not appear to measure shared environmental determinants of sexual orientation.",Behavior genetics,1993 Jul,United States,1993,90

8211537,Patterns of condom use and sexual behavior among never-married women.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Use of condoms is one of the main methods sexually active persons may choose to prevent infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Little is known about patterns of condom use among women in the United States. We provide a conceptualization of patterns of condom use and factors associated with these patterns. GOAL OF THIS STUDY: To examine patterns of condom use and associated characteristics among sexually active, never-married women in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of data from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth, which is a nationally representative sample of women in their childbearing years. RESULTS: Only a minority of sexually active, never-married women report using condoms, and even fewer report using them consistently. Women with characteristics traditionally associated with increased risk of infection with STD and HIV appear to be less likely to report using condoms and to report using them consistently. Women who report use of condoms to prevent STDs are more likely to report consistent condom use; less likely to cease using condoms; and more likely to initiate consistent condom use. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the need for innovative programming targeted for specific sexually active populations to promote both initiation and maintenance of use of condoms.",Sexually transmitted diseases,1993 Jul-Aug,United States,1993,90

Contact was made a minimum of 12 months and as many as 20 months after completion of treatment (mean 14.7 mos.). Telephone contact was made by an independent research organization with 427 of the patients (71.2%). Of these, 65.1% were totally abstinent for 1 year after treatment and 60.2% were abstinent until follow-up a mean of 14.7 months later. Fifty-two percent of the alcoholics were using or dependent on other drugs at admission. Seventy-five of these treated for cocaine dependence and 47 treated for marijuana dependence. The cocaine 12 month and ""total"" abstinence (mean 14.7 mos.) rates for the 49 contacted patients were 83.7% and 81.6%, respectively. The marijuana 12 month and ""total"" abstinence (mean 14.7 mos.) rates for the 30 contacted patients was 70.0% for both groups. Abstinence rates for alcohol and/or other drugs were also calculated including noncontacted patients who had chart documented evidence of relapse. The most powerful predictor of success was whether or not all urges to drink or use had been eliminated (presumably by aversion therapy). Of additional importance was the use of support groups and reinforcement treatments after completion of the initial hospitalization. The two most prominent factors initiating a relapse were ""intrapersonal determinants"" such as stress from work or marriage/family relationships and ""interpersonal determinants"" such as being around others who were drinking/using or being at a celebration or special event. The two factors were of equal importance in the alcoholics. However, interpersonal determinants were far more important in the cocaine and marijuana treated patients. Increased utilization of reinforcement treatments was associated with decreased urges to drink/use and increased abstinence rates. In contrast, increased frequency of support group utilization was associated with increased urges to drink/use and lower abstinence rates. This suggests the need to take seriously patient reports of ""urges"" in the first year after treatment and to carefully assess the cause and initiate or update an individualized plan of treatment. Such treatment may include increased reinforcement treatments, treatment of depression, and additional assistance in coping with intrapersonal and interpersonal determinants of relapse.",Journal of substance abuse treatment,1993 Jul-Aug,United States,1993,90
8501482,Musculoskeletal disorders as determinants of disability in Finns aged 30 years or more.,"The relationship between disability and various musculoskeletal disorders was investigated in 7217 men and women representative of the Finnish population aged 30 years or more. They participated in the Mini-Finland Health Survey and were first screened by interview and questionnaire about limitations in daily activities. The outcome variables were reduced working capacity, an occasional need for assistance in daily activities, and a regular need for assistance in daily activities. In a two-phase medical examination, all cases fulfilling predetermined diagnostic criteria of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory and mental disorders and diabetes were recorded independently. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, inflammatory arthritis was the strongest determinant of all forms of disability. Osteoarthritis, especially in the hip, was a strong determinant of both occasional and regular need for assistance, and chronic low back pain was a strong determinant of reduced working capacity and occasional need for assistance among those aged 30-64 years. Other musculoskeletal disorders also determined the prevalence disability, but these relationships were reduced by taking comorbidity into account. A low level of education and a low (less than 20 kg/m2) or very high (at least 35 kg/m2) body mass index represented independent determinants of all forms of disability, and a history of physically strenuous work an independent determinant of reduced working capacity, when disabling illness was adjusted for. The proportion of all forms of disability attributable to musculoskeletal disorders, in models including, age, sex, other disabling illness and significant non-medical determinants of disability, was close to 20%. The disorders with the highest community impact were chronic low back pain among those aged 30-64, osteoarthritis of the hips and knees and inflammatory arthritis.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,1993 Jun,United States,1993,90
8350037,"Diagnostic delay, clinical stage, and social class: a hospital based study.","STUDY OBJECTIVE: To measure delay in admission to a large hospital and to study the role of social class and other potential determinants of delay. DESIGN: Interview of a 10% sample of newly diagnosed patients admitted to medical or surgical wards, and all those admitted for external hernia or colon cancer between June 1989 and May 1990. SETTING: The largest hospital in an Italian region of five million inhabitants. SUBJECTS: The study population consisted of 330 patients with a range of different medical and surgical conditions, 83 patients with external hernias, and 97 patients with colon cancers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After patient interview and discharge from hospital, the clinical record was consulted for information on the length of stay and the diagnosis, and in particular for the staging of hernia or colon cancer (according to the protocol of the Jefferson Medical College). Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. There was an association between advanced disease at hospital admission and the patient's educational level. In each of the three groups of patients, those with the highest educational level had a 30% or lower probability of being admitted to hospital with advanced disease compared with those with the lowest education level (after allowance for sex, age, area of residence, and marital status). CONCLUSION: Lower social class was associated with a more advanced clinical stage of hernia or colon cancer, and with a higher probability of urgent admission to the hospital for a newly diagnosed disease. Delay in seeking care, did not however, seem to explain the social class differentials for disease stage.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1993 Jun,England,1993,90
7694219,Investigation of antigenic determinants in thyroid peroxidase by synthesis of possible sequential peptides.,"One way to locate antigenic determinants in thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is to evaluate the binding of chemically synthesized peptides to autoantibodies. A major epitope of TPO involved in thyroid autoimmunity has been reported to be at residues 590 to 675. Therefore, we synthesized three peptides (P1, residues 603-610; P2, 615-630; and P3, 654-665) in the most antigenic part of this range, as judged by antigenicity analysis, and measured their antigenicity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Amino groups protected with fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl were used in the synthesis. Sera from 42 untreated patients with Hashimoto's disease and 30 untreated patients with Graves' disease were tested for binding with each peptide. In addition, 6 sera with antibodies against denatured and reduced microsomal antigen were tested. Sera obtained from 22 normal subjects were used as a control. Binding of sera from the patients with autoimmune thyroid disease to the synthetic peptides was weak, about 1% of binding to thyroid microsomes prepared from Graves' thyroid. However, the ELISA index of a mixture of P1, P2, and P3 was significantly higher in the patients with Hashimoto's disease than in the healthy subjects. For both P2 and P3, the ELISA index of the sera with antibodies against denatured and reduced TPO was higher than that of the sera from normal subjects. These results suggested 1) that the antigenic epitopes of TPO recognized by autoantibodies may be conformational and discontinuous, and 2) that antibodies against these linear portions of TPO may exist in patients with Hashimoto's disease.",Osaka city medical journal,1993 Jun,Japan,1993,90
17806340,Phenotypic basis of reproductive success in a social insect: genetic and social determinants.,"Social insects live in societies that include both reproductive and nonreproductive adults. Understanding the factors that determine which individuals become successful reproductives is necessary to explain the evolution of these societies. The phenotypic effects of the gene Pgm-3 (or a closely linked gene) that may cause workers of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta to selectively execute all queens of a specific genotype were investigated. These effects, which involve differences in queen reproductive development, are expressed only in colonies exhibiting a particular type of social organization (multiple-queen colonies), and it is only in such colonies that selective execution on the basis of genotype occurs. This is an unusual example of genotype-environment interaction in gene expression in which the environmental component is the social environment. The queens executed are, surprisingly, those with the greatest reproductive development. Thus, there is a counterintuitive relation between the potential and realized reproductive success of queens in multiple-queen societies of this ant.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1993 May 21,United States,1993,90
8490895,Treatment compliance in childhood and adolescence.,"Experience reveals that there is significant noncompliance with self-administered medication, especially in chronic conditions such as cancer. Noncompliance transcends the boundary of disease categories and age group. However, this is most prevalent during the adolescent years when the process of transition from parental dependency to autonomy produces confusion as to who is responsible for administration of medication. Noncompliance can result in the misjudgment of efficacy of a drug or regimen that may necessitate additional tests, alteration of dose, treatment course, and hospitalization. Currently in the United States, a large percentage of pediatric cancer patients are treated according to research protocols. In a research setting, noncompliance can result in erroneous or inconsistent findings, potentially affecting investigational results. With the availability of venous access ports and sophisticated, yet easy-to-operate pumps, increasingly, it is possible to administer parenteral medications at home. This adds a new dimension to the self-administration of medication that previously concerned mainly oral therapy. Various factors concerning the patient, disease, health providers, and treatment characteristics determine how well a given regimen is adhered to. Because a significant number of determinants are involved, it is often not possible, with any degree of certainty, to identify noncompliers or to predict the level of patient adherence to the treatment. Major factors in any successful therapy include the availability of effective medications and compliance with therapy regimen. With the advent of more successful treatments for childhood and adolescent cancer, the compliance factor is gaining greater importance because therapy currently is given with curative, rather than palliative intent. The availability of questionnaires, tests, and devices can help, to some extent, examine the degree of patient compliance. Family and social support, individualized programs, reminders to reduce forgetfulness, personalized needs assessment, and education can reduce noncompliance. Compliance is a complex and multifaceted issue that is still poorly understood and requires further investigation.",Cancer,1993 May 15,United States,1993,90
10148832,In search of a psychology of safer-sex promotion; beyond beliefs and texts.,"Belief and attitudinal change are important to the promotion of safer sexual behaviour. However, the individual decision-making psychology implicit in belief-change models provides only a partial picture of the determinants of sexual behaviour. A broader psychological understanding emphasizing the complex social skills involved in regulating sexual interaction is advocated. A discourse analysis critique of the viability of characterizing individuals' psychology on the basis of verbal responses is discussed and it is noted that psychological models linking such responses to underlying beliefs and cognitions must be based on measures which accurately predict health behaviour. It is concluded that an interactive model incorporating personal, interpersonal and situational constraints on sexual behaviour could be used to design effective programmes addressing barriers to HIV protection. Such interventions would promote communication and sexual negotiating skills and could be included in school curricula. This would have radical implications for sex education, shifting its theoretical basis from biology to social psychology and its methods from information-giving to participation and practice.",Health education research,1993 Jun,England,1993,90
23529205,Applying Social Psychological Models to Predicting HIV-Related Sexual Risk Behaviors Among African Americans.,"Existing models of attitude-behavior relationships, including the Health Belief Model, the Theory of Reasoned Action, and the Self-Efficacy Theory, are increasingly being used by psychologists to predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related risk behaviors. The authors briefly highlight some of the difficulties that might arise in applying these models to predicting the risk behaviors of African Americans. These social psychological models tend to emphasize the importance of individualistic, direct control of behavioral choices and deemphasize factors, such as racism and poverty, particularly relevant to that segment of the African American population most at risk for HIV infection. Applications of these models without taking into account the unique issues associated with behavioral choices within the African American community may fail to capture the relevant determinants of risk behaviors.",The Journal of black psychology,1993 May,United States,1993,90

Apart from their direct influence on expected income and hence on migration, nominal wages affect migration indirectly by the unemployment they generate. Under reasonable assumptions the relation between nominal wages and migration is negative. The long-run influence of wages on capital accumulation and hence employment opportunities emphasizes that wage policy can be used either to control the long-run population stock or to stop migration immediately. That latter requires instantaneous wage-rate adjustments and initial wage-rate undershooting."" (SUMMARY IN ENG)",Jahrbucher fur Nationalokonomie und Statistik,1993 May,Germany,1993,90
8508852,The relationship between blood viscosity and blood pressure in a random sample of the population aged 55 to 74 years.,"Blood viscosity is elevated in hypertensive subjects, but the association of viscosity with arterial blood pressure in the general population, and the influence of social, lifestyle and disease characteristics on this association, are not established. In the Edinburgh Artery Study, 1592 men and women aged 55-74 years selected randomly from the general population attended a university clinic. A fasting blood sample was taken for the measurement of blood viscosity and its major determinants (haematocrit, plasma viscosity and fibrinogen). Systolic pressure was related univariately to blood viscosity (P < 0.001), plasma viscosity (P < 0.001) and plasma fibrinogen (P < 0.01), but the association with fibrinogen did not persist after adjusting for body mass index. Diastolic pressure was related univariately to blood viscosity (P < 0.001) and plasma viscosity (P < 0.001) and haematocrit (P < 0.001) but not to fibrinogen. The only difference between the sexes was that the association between blood viscosity and systolic pressure was confined to males. Blood viscosity was associated equally with systolic and diastolic pressures in males, and remained independently related on multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, social class, smoking, alcohol intake, exercise, angina, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, plasma viscosity, fibrinogen, and haematocrit.",European heart journal,1993 May,England,1993,90

8501991,Multiuse of medicines in Finland.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of multiuse of prescription drugs and its major determinants among Finnish adults. The data were based on three nationally representative and intercomparable health surveys in 1976, 1978-80, and 1987. The study populations were 16,413 in 1976, 13,138 in 1987, and 7,217 in 1978-80. The simultaneous use of at least five prescription drugs was the main outcome measure. In 1976, 4.7% of the study population, and 6.3% in 1987 were multiusers. Of all users of prescription drugs, the proportion of multiusers was 14% both in 1976 and 1987. In 1987, the elderly comprised 55% of all multiusers, whereas their share in 1976 was 44%. The strongest predictor of the multiuse was, as expected, chronic morbidity. Of the various diagnostic groups, the main determinants were cardiac insufficiency, hypertension, asthma, mental disorders, and coronary heart disease. Even allowing for chronic morbidity, age was significantly associated with multiuse, but sex was not. The number of visits to a primary care physician correlated also independently with the multiuse. These findings indicate that the elderly may in part get prescriptions indiscriminately.",Medical care,1993 May,United States,1993,90

Briefly stated, the model proposes job control to be a primary causal determinant of the stress outcomes. The effects of perceived demands, job content, and career/future concerns were hypothesized to influence the stress outcomes only to the extent of their influence on job control. This was tested in a population of government office employees in various clerical, professional, and managerial jobs all of which involve the use of computers. Results indicated that job control was not a crucial determinant of the stress outcomes, that job demands and career/future concerns were consistent determinants of the stress outcomes, and that job content, demands, and career/future concerns did not influence the stress outcomes through job control as described by the proposed model. The differentiation of job control levels to define specific relationships with stress outcomes and other job elements was shown to be useful because different levels of job control were associated with different stress outcomes and job elements.",Ergonomics,1993 May,England,1993,90

8354375,Exploring norms and beliefs related to AIDS prevention among California Hispanic men.,"A focus-group study gathered qualitative information from Hispanic males in California regarding ethnic factors that might enhance or interfere with AIDS prevention efforts. A predominantly working-class convenience sample of 75 men aged 18-40 participated in seven groups of 10-12 participants each. Three groups were composed of single men, three of married men and one was composed of homosexual and bisexual men. Four groups included only participants born outside the United States; and Spanish was the preferred language in five of the groups. Evaluation of the discussions indicates that while AIDS awareness is high among this population, condom use is sporadic. Few participants knew that someone infected with the human immunodeficiency virus could appear healthy; most believed they could easily determine if a woman is risky by her appearance or social standing. Although many participants thought HIV could be transmitted through casual contact, the homosexual and bisexual men were more likely to acknowledge that they were at some risk of infection; most of the heterosexual men did not perceive themselves as being at risk, even those who engaged in sex with prostitutes or women they met at bars. The participants had ambivalent attitudes toward women who suggested condom use and were often reluctant to initiate condom use themselves. Religion did not seem to play a major role in the men's attitudes about AIDS, sexuality and condom use.",Family planning perspectives,1993 May-Jun,United States,1993,90

Evaluation of the scheme showed that students and community interviewees found their participation valuable. Eighty per cent of interviewees were willing to take part in the scheme in the following year. The strongest predictor of willingness to participate was interviewees' rating of the extent to which they had enjoyed the experience. Students valued the opportunity to meet 'real people', to explore social and psychological determinants of health and illness and to develop communication skills. A significant positive change in perceived interviewing competence was observed. It is suggested that the scheme might be further developed by using feedback from interviewees to provide students with evidence of both their own skill development and the benefits of self-disclosure to the patients involved.",Medical education,1993 May,England,1993,90

11652120,Prisoners of progress or hostages to fortune?,"The new reproductive technologies, especially in vitro fertilization (IVF), have extended the possibilities of assisted reproduction to the benefit of the childless couples. At the same time these technologies and their added techniques, however, have fragmented reproduction and exposed the human egg to intervention yet unknown.... These possibilities have legal as well as ethical implications. The challenge is to obtain all the advantages of the reproduction revolution and avoid the disadvantages: to avoid becoming prisoners of progress, but to control the development and guide it in the directions we want. One of the problems is trying to foresee unwarranted consequences. Another is to agree upon which consequences are unwarranted and how they are best avoided or minimized. Although the questions that arise with respect to law, medicine and bioethics are similar all over the world, there are differences of a philosophical, economic, social, political, religious and even geographical nature which are not easily bridged. It is apparent, though, that core approaches are desirable. This article is an attempt to explore the ways in which these determinants have been manipulated in two European [Great Britain, Denmark] legal systems. We are interested in the ways in which those legal systems have been customized to provide temporary answers and marshalling points for regulating reproduction and we seek to make some observations on the ways in which laws, customs and values have been manipulated to produce pictures of the family and the way in which we want -- literally and figuratively -- to conceive of it in the 21st century.","The Journal of law, medicine & ethics : a journal of the American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics",1993 Spring,United States,1993,90
8480239,Child feeding practices in a rural area of Zimbabwe.,"This paper reports preliminary results from a study of child feeding practices in a rural area of Zimbabwe. Although Zimbabwe has relatively low infant mortality rates, it still has high child malnutrition rates. Several factors, including sex roles and relations between the sexes, access to resources, food costs and availability, time and energy costs of food production and preparation, and illness beliefs and practices, especially those concerning diarrhea and malnutrition, are examined as possible determinants of feeding practices and nutritional and health status. Results are compared to reports made by the World Bank and the Zimbabwe national nutrition survey. Whereas the World Bank report suggests a problem of late introduction of breastmilk supplements or solids, we found the opposite tendency of early introduction (by 3 months) of supplements. We suggest that mothers' pragmatic attitudes, interacting with certain social, cultural, and economic variables, are important factors influencing their child feeding decisions, especially resisting the use of commercial infant formula, at least in this rural area, and promoting prolonged breastfeeding.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Apr,England,1993,90
8480234,Societal and ecological determinants of urban health: a case study of pre-reproductive mortality in 19th century Gibraltar.,"A historical based enquiry of colonial Gibraltar at the turn of the 19th century was conducted in order to assess what factors gave rise to residential variation of pre-reproductive mortality. Gibraltar's unusual configuration of a port city, garrison town, and commercial centre at the tip of the Iberian peninsula offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay of ecology, demographic and socio-economic factors on childhood mortality. Communal living under the patio system and the sharing of essential resources were characteristic features of life on the Rock. Using the residential district as the focus of enquiry, stepwise regression results for the period 1879-81, designated as a period of 'low ecological stress', indicated that the number of gallons of potable water per person captured a significant amount of variability in mortality. During the year 1878, a serious shortfall in rainfall was associated with lower life expectancy, a change in the seasonal pattern of mortality, and elevated rates of death attributable to the diarrhea complex. Under this period of 'high ecological stress', the percentage of servants in the household, a proxy for wealth/status, proved to be the single most important factor accounting for 46.6% of the variation in the death rate under 15. Analysis of mortality at the patio level revealed that residents of buildings of two household units had lower mortality than residents living in smaller or larger dwellings, particularly in the period of high ecological stress. The complex pattern of mortality at the district and patio level is explained in terms of the development of residential preferences and decentralized nature of vital resources, such as the water support system and food supply.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Apr,England,1993,90
8475428,"Health needs, demand for health services and expenditure across social groups in Italy: an empirical investigation.","The shortage of empirical studies on socio-economic factors influencing demand for health care and inequalities across social groups is dramatic in the case of Italy. The present study aims at discussing these issues, although its results are to be considered mainly methodological, given the small dimension of the sample (n = 807). A survey was carried out in a 'qualitative' sample of 9 Local Health Units of different Italian regions. Attention was paid to report every 'illness episode', considered as a cause of demand for health services, within the reference period (4 weeks) in order to properly link health needs with utilization of health services and relative expenditure. The assessment of health status across social groups, using 4 different indicators, shows the weakest social groups as the most vulnerable. The same groups report higher per capita health services uses and expenditures than their morbidity conditions would require. Assuming equity to be defined as 'equal use for equal need' a particular use-need ratio is developed (i.e. health services used per illness episode) able to capture the 'intensity' of health services use and expenditure per need. The 'over-equity' towards the less favoured groups is interpreted as a possible accomplishment of the N.H.S. fundative goals. A structural model of determinants of health services utilization, carried out through the LISREL technique (R2 = 0.36), confirms the irrelevance of the social variables with respect to need variables.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Apr,England,1993,90
8465879,Psychiatric complications of family reunion after four decades of separation.,"OBJECTIVE: After four decades of separation due to civil war, many people who had migrated to Taiwan from mainland China had the unexpected opportunity to briefly visit their families in mainland China. A study was conducted to examine psychiatric complications associated with these family reunions following long involuntary separation. METHOD: Eighty subjects who made the journey were given semistructured interviews investigating their psychological experiences relating to the family reunion. The variables investigated were sociodemographic characteristics, the subject's previsit emotional condition, factors related to the family reunion experience, and stress encountered during the visit. RESULTS: The survey indicated that more than one-fifth of the subjects (22.5%) developed psychiatric complications, mainly depression, immediately after the visit. Determinants found to contribute significantly to the occurrence of emotional disorders were previous ways of expressing homesickness, family members seen during the reunion, family misfortunes that the subjects discovered, family conflict encountered at the reunion, and tactics for coping with such stressors. CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that family reunions after long-term separation can be trauma-repairing experiences for some but for others can lead to trauma reexperiencing and psychiatric complications requiring mental health intervention.",The American journal of psychiatry,1993 Apr,United States,1993,90
8460287,Perceived exertion. Antecedents and applications.,"The field of perceived exertion has largely concerned itself with the problem of identifying the primary antecedents to this psychophysiological phenomenon. A vast literature has evolved addressing this problem, but it is fraught with contradictions. At this stage a comprehensive theory of perceived exertion does not exist. It is generally accepted that perception of exertion is dominated by physiological determinants. Physiological sensory cues have been separated into 2 categories: local factors (sensations from the working muscles and joints), and central factors (sensations from the cardiopulmonary system). Major reviews in this area generally agree that local factors dominate perception of exertion. Recent work in perceived exertion has placed an emphasis on examining the contributing psychological factors. Research into the psychological factors affecting perceived exertion has been highly fragmented with no apparent theoretical framework as a base. At the same time it is clear that an integration of psychological and physiological variables is required to obtain theoretically meaningful knowledge of this multidimensional construct. The assumed dominance of physiological factors has been challenged by the contention that in field situations, in which a variety of social psychological influences operate, psychological determinants of perceived exertion may be vastly more influential than previously estimated. Identification of the primary determinants of perceived exertion and knowledge of how these factors are integrated is vital for a concrete theory of perceived exertion to evolve.","Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",1993 Apr,New Zealand,1993,90

8318806,Early determinants of cardiovascular risk factors in adults. B. Blood pressure.,"The aim of this follow-up study was to investigate the effect of birth weight, infant nutrition, past and contemporary social status and anthropometry on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adult subjects. There were 465 boys and girls, originating from three different regions of Croatia, examined in the first three years of life, and again approximately 18 years later. The analyses showed that birth weight was inversely related to systolic blood pressure in adult subjects. The highest systolic pressure was found in subjects with the lowest birth weight and the greatest current body mass index. Relative weight in the first three years of life was also inversely related to systolic blood pressure, but only in adult males. Neither the type of milk given, nor the duration of breast feeding and the time of weaning had any significant influence on blood pressure in adult subjects. According to multivariate regression analyses, the significant predictors of higher systolic and diastolic pressure in adult males were: lower father's height, greater current body mass index, lower birth weight and low original social status. In female subjects, the significant predictors were: lower birth weight, greater current body mass index and lower social class of origin. In conclusion, influences of poor environment acting in early childhood may be important determinants of blood pressure in adulthood.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1993 Apr,Norway,1993,90

While family planning efforts have been directed almost exclusively toward women, the lack of male involvement may also reflect the limited options available to men. Current methods for men are either coitus-dependent, such as the condom or withdrawal, or permanent, such as vasectomy. The 20-year history of social science research on male contraceptive methods is examined here in terms of the human and method factors related to the acceptability of hypothetical methods and the prevalence of use of existing methods. New male methods, particularly if reversible, may alter men's willingness to accept or share responsibility for the control of fertility.

Not only can it improve the timely detection and the quantitation of adverse reactions to botanical medicines, it can also help us to recognize beneficial effects of herbal preparations. Moreover, it can increase our social and economic knowledge about herbal drugs by correlating the utilization patterns of these preparations to socially relevant determinants and prices. Since such studies may require an internationally accepted herbal drug classification, a special set of herbal classification codes is proposed, which is fully compatible with the so-called ATC-classification.

8480219,Suicide and unemployment in Australia 1907-1990.,"Ever since Durkheim postulated a relationship between economic change and suicide there has been evidence of a general association between aggregate data on unemployment and the frequency of suicide. Quantitatively, however, the association has been variable and it is clear that due to differing cultural, social and individual determinants of suicide, the relationship is complex. Methodological difficulties abound with interpretation of aggregate data. Australian records for most of the present century are suitable for examining secular trends in suicide and unemployment by age group and gender to gain an indication of the extent to which both parameters may be causally related. An aggregate/ecological study was designed to incorporate quantitative and qualitative strategies. Annual age-adjusted male and female suicide rates and annual unemployment rates were derived for the period 1907-1990. Female suicide rates were generally stable throughout the period, whereas those for males demonstrated sharp fluctuations with the peaks coinciding with times of high unemployment. The association between suicide and unemployment for 15-24 year old males was comparatively high for the recent period, 1966-1990. The increasingly youthful contribution to male suicide was demonstrated by a rise in the loss of life years during 1973-1984. Despite the inability of any investigation based on aggregate data to establish an unequivocable causal relationship, no evidence was detected to suggest that relatively high population levels of unemployment were not related to the occurrence of suicide.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Mar,England,1993,90

This article attempts to provide a better understanding of the relative contributions of parents and adult children who live together through detailed analysis of data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). We find unmarried children tend to benefit more from and contribute less to extended households than married children. Similarly, unmarried parents benefit more from living with children than married parents. Results of logistic regression show that financial need and need for assistance with activities of daily living wre important determinants of coresidence for both unmarried children and unmarried parents.

The analyses were performed with regression models on a set of data from a comprehensive population study of 3533 men and 3578 women aged 40-42 in a county in Northern Norway. Among the various health status dimensions included, self-rated health was found to be the most important determinant, regardless of type of service. Factors, other than health status aspects affecting GP visits, were preoccupation with health and help seeking attitude. Volume of resources (GP per population), socio-demographic characteristics and social networks did not appear as important. Several inequitable effects were revealed on referrals: First, higher rate of referral of patients with higher educational achievement indicates a bias towards higher social status groups. Second, high GP/population ratio and residence in municipalities with referral care facilities were both found to be associated with higher probability of referral.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine,1993 Mar,Sweden,1993,90

8463634,Determinants of social support among gay men: the context of AIDS.,"In this study, the determinants of social support are examined among a probability sample of gay men residing in San Francisco. Using two waves of data (collected in 1985 and 1987), cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses focused on the effects of five sets of factors (demographic, community integration/network, AIDS-related loss, individual, and health) on satisfaction with three types of support (emotional, informational, and practical). Personal acceptance of one's gay identity and talking to family members about AIDS showed the strongest positive associations with concurrent measures of support and changes in support satisfaction over the two-year period. Conversely, depression and number of HIV symptoms were negatively associated with cross-sectional support and support changes. Family knowledge of respondents' homosexuality interacted with HIV symptoms, such that knowledge was negatively associated with support among those experiencing greater numbers of HIV symptoms. Findings suggest that those most in need of support may be the least satisfied with the support they receive. Family appear to have the potential to be particularly helpful or especially harmful to gay men trying to cope with the AIDS crisis.",Journal of health and social behavior,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90
8463204,Self-injurious behavior in Rett syndrome: interactions between features of Rett syndrome and operant conditioning.,"Operant and biological theories of the cause of self-injurious behavior (SIB) in people with a mental handicap are often viewed as mutually exclusive. In this single case study, interactions between features of Rett syndrome and operant conditioning as determinants of SIB are examined. Functional analysis by analog methodology indicated different functions for two forms of SIB shown by the subject: automatic reinforcement by sensory stimulation and escape from social interactions. It is suggested that features of Rett syndrome established conditions under which operant conditioning of self-injurious responding was maximized. The implications of this interaction between features of syndromes and operant conditioning for the conceptualization of the cause of SIB are discussed and it is proposed that the notion of a unitary cause of SIB is inappropriate. It is more productive to consider operant conditioning as the process that maintains responding against a background of predisposing and mediating factors which may be biologically determined.",Journal of autism and developmental disorders,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90
8459708,"Understanding U.S. alcohol consumption with social and economic factors: a multivariate time series analysis, 1950-1986.","The contribution of social and economic variables to changes in per capita alcohol consumption occurring between 1950 and 1986 is examined within a multivariate time series analysis framework. Specifically, we consider the net effects of family income, age structure of the population, marital instability, female labor force participation, real alcohol price and daily life routines on total alcohol consumption. Our findings indicate that changes in the population age structure and in daily life routines were associated with predicted changes in consumption over the period studied. They also indicate associations between marital instability and female labor force participation and consumption, although in the direction contrary to our prediction. Unlike a number of previous studies in which economic variables were found to be the major determinants of consumption trends, we find that family income and the price of alcohol play a minor role in the model we estimated. These results indicate that social structural factors have greater utility for our understanding of alcohol consumption patterns, and, by implication, for attempts to reduce alcohol-related social problems, than do economic factors.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90

A research approach frequently used in these studies has been to ask study physicians what led them to make specific career choices, labeled here as the introspective causal reports study design. This paper explores the validity of introspective causal reports and their usefulness in making health manpower policy recommendations. The accuracy of people's beliefs about the causes of their own behaviors is examined, and social psychology literature is drawn upon in this examination. Data are presented characterizing the use of introspective causal reports in recent family medicine literature. Recommendations are made for stronger research designs in future physician career choice determinant studies.",Family medicine,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90

Subjects were paid $0.02 contingent upon completion of eight presses, distributed in any combination across two push buttons; 256 different sequences were possible. Sequence emission was reinforced according to fixed- and variable-ratio schedules. Ratio requirements of 1, 2, 4 and 8 were presented in alternate components of a multiple schedule. The variability engendered by variable-ratio schedules was also compared to that engendered by fixed ratios. Variability increased with ratio size, irrespective of whether the schedule requirement was fixed or variable. The data demonstrate the similarity between the determinants of human and nonhuman variability, and they illustrate the role of ratio size in determining variability in operant behavior.",Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90

However, most reported applications in sport and physical activity have been limited to simple models involving variables measured at a single point in time. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to demonstrate the use of both cross-sectional and longitudinal latent variable modeling techniques by examining the relationships among efficacy cognitions, social support, and the exercise behaviors of sedentary adults. Results revealed a good fit for the re-specified model, suggesting the existence of a lagged feedback mechanism in which exercise behaviors influenced residual change in social support. In turn, efficacy cognitions appeared to serve a mediational function in the synchronous relationship between social support and exercise behavior. Findings are discussed in terms of the utility of structural equation modeling techniques for understanding the complex social and cognitive processes involved in exercise behavior.",Research quarterly for exercise and sport,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90

Twenty-three studies were reviewed, six of which were concerned with children and adolescents and the remaining 17 with adults. A meta-analysis of correlations for each study determinant was conducted using the Pandora System. Results indicated that self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of a health-promoting lifestyle, followed by social support, perceived benefits, self-concept, perceived barriers and health definition. The most frequently studied determinants were not the best predictors of a health-promoting lifestyle.",Journal of advanced nursing,1993 Mar,England,1993,90

Eighty patients with HD were assessed with the Huntington's Disease-Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (HD-ADL). Sixty-seven patients also completed a comprehensive assessment of cognitive and voluntary motor functioning and chorea. The latter measures were correlated with HD-ADL total score and with most HD-ADL items, but not with those items dealing with marital and family relationship adjustment. Findings suggest that psychomotor speed and the ability to regulate attention may be particularly important determinants of everyday functioning in mild HD. Consistent with previously reported observations, this appears to be true even after accounting for individual differences in the severity of chorea and voluntary motor impairment.",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90
8444436,Characteristics of emergency room patients that predict hospitalization or disposition to alternative treatments.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to identify variables that predicted three different dispositions of patients seen in a psychiatric emergency room: hospitalization, an emergency housing program, and an outpatient crisis program. METHODS: Social, psychiatric, demographic, and vocational characteristics of 50 patients in each disposition group were examined to learn whether they varied sufficiently to explain the different dispositions. RESULTS: Patients in the hospitalized group were most psychologically impaired and those in the crisis program group least impaired. Patients referred to emergency housing were more moderately impaired but not always significantly different in impairment from hospitalized patients. Discriminant analysis yielded a model of 11 variables whose combined effect accounted for 79 percent of the variance. Psychiatric determinants were the most important predictors, although social, vocational, and demographic variables were also significant. Using these predictors, 76 percent of the original sample and 63 percent of a cross-validation sample were correctly classified by disposition group. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed the importance of psychiatric determinants in the dispositional process. The similarity between hospitalized patients and those assigned to emergency housing suggests that some hospitalized patients would be good candidates for alternative treatment.",Hospital & community psychiatry,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90
8357893,A holosphere of healthy and sustainable communities.,"Public health practice is in a transitory state, expanding considerably beyond medical and behavioural models of health and disease to encompass physical and social environmental health determinants. A new public health practice is emerging, apparent in initiatives like the international healthy cities/communities projects. This new public health practice must integrate the challenge of sustainable development, as defined by the 1987 World Commission on Environment and Development. The holosphere framework locates health as its central metaphor, and defines six interacting environmental spheres: a viable natural environment, a sustainable economic environment, a sufficient economy, an equitable social environment, a convivial community, and a livable built environment. There are five functional roles for local government: policy, legislation, education, partnerships and advocacy. Representative actions from each of the six environmental spheres of the holosphere framework are identified and discussed, using the five functional roles of local government. There is a need for new intersectoral forums to act upon the knowledge generated by integrative models such as the holosphere. Canadian Round Tables on Environment and Economy are encouraging examples of such intersectoralism.",Australian journal of public health,1993 Mar,Australia,1993,90

8097476,Quantitative analysis of tuberoinfundibular tyrosine hydroxylase- and corticotropin-releasing factor-immunoreactive neurons in monkeys raised with differential rearing conditions.,"A major goal in assessing biological determinants of behavior lies in studying the effect(s) of rearing on the development of the central nervous system. Specifically, a series of neuroanatomic analyses have been undertaken to identify potential neuropathological changes seen in monkeys exposed to early social deprivation, which leads to profound psychopathology and inappropriate responses to stress. The animals used in this study were either raised with their mother and peers (socially reared) or raised without maternal/peer contact (socially deprived). Within this context, the distribution of tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and arcuate nucleus of rhesus monkeys was determined by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for dopamine-containing systems. Additionally, the distribution of corticotropin-releasing factor-containing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus was assessed immunohistochemically. The majority (97.5%) of dopaminergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus were parvicellular, with a small (2.5%), but consistently observed population of magnocellular neurons immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase. Within the arcuate nucleus, tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons were similar in morphology to the parvicellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus. Qualitative assessment of corticotropin-releasing factor-immunoreactive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus revealed a parvicellular population of neurons located in medial aspects of the nucleus, similar to what has been observed in the rat. Quantitative analysis revealed no differences in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase- and corticotropin-releasing factor-immunoreactive neurons between rearing conditions, suggesting that these neurons were not affected, in terms of overall cell counts, by the early environmental insult of social deprivation.",Experimental neurology,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90
8096106,Social and economic factors and the control of lymphatic filariasis: a review.,"Formal control programmes do not exist for lymphatic filariasis in much of the endemic world. The literature on the social, economic and clinical impacts of the disease is so sparse as to provide virtually no guidance on whether the disease should be accorded more importance in national or local public health programmes. This type of research is a major priority. Putting together what little is known about the socioeconomic determinants of filariasis with the fairly extensive experience in control leads to a finding that control programmes must be undertaken at the community level to be effective. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is a readily available and apparently safe drug that can be deployed successfully for community control. While research currently is exploring the potential for individuals to protect themselves with DEC or a newer drug, ivermectin, community-wide control is unlikely to be achieved in that way. Under some special circumstances, controlling the mosquito vectors may be sufficient to control the disease, and in other cases, it may complement chemotherapy, but in general, it cannot be relied upon as a primary measure. DEC may be used in a variety of regimens which vary in their cost, duration, incidence of side effects and degree of community participation. Some, including DEC-medicated salt, are particularly attractive alternatives for many filariasis-endemic areas. The search for less expensive, yet effective, control options must continue, and this requires research not only into the costs of the various options, but also into the determinants of community acceptance, compliance and participation.",Acta tropica,1993 Mar,Netherlands,1993,90
8429605,Probing the meaning of racial/ethnic group comparisons in crack cocaine smoking.,"OBJECTIVE: To probe the meaning of reported racial and ethnic group differences in the prevalence of crack cocaine smoking and to estimate the degree to which crack cocaine smoking is associated with personal factors specific to race/ethnicity. DESIGN: Through reanalysis of data from the 1988 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse (NHSDA), we compared racial/ethnic group differences in crack cocaine smoking. To hold constant social and environmental risk factors that might potentially confound racial comparisons, we used an epidemiologic strategy that involves poststratification of respondents into neighborhood risk sets. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the relative odds of crack use by race/ethnicity. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: The 1988 NHSDA interviewed 8814 individuals residing within households in the United States. Subjects were selected using a multistage area probability sampling of all residents aged 12 years and older. RESULTS: Once respondents were grouped into neighborhood clusters, the relative odds (RO) of crack use did not differ significantly for African Americans (RO, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.37 to 1.93) or for Hispanic Americans (RO, 0.88; 95% Cl, 0.47 to 1.67) compared with white Americans. CONCLUSION: Findings of race-associated differences are often presented as if a person's race has intrinsic explanatory power. This analysis provides evidence that, given similar social and environmental conditions, crack use does not strongly depend on race-specific (eg, biologic) personal factors. Although the study finding does not refute the previous analysis, it provides evidence that prevalence estimates unadjusted for social environmental risk factors may lead to misunderstanding about the role of race or ethnicity in the epidemiology of crack use. Future research should seek to identify which characteristics of the neighborhood social environment are important and potentially modifiable determinants of drug use.",JAMA,1993 Feb 24,United States,1993,90
8457983,"Determinants of participation in state-of-the-art cancer prevention, early detection/screening, and treatment trials among African-Americans.","It has been suggested that the greatest potential for reducing cancer mortality in high-risk populations may be realized through aggressive implementation of prevention, diagnostic, and state-of-the-art treatment programs and increasing participation in cancer trials. However, the national data suggest that African-Americans are most often underrepresented in such programs and/or trials. Multiple factors are assumed to contribute to this situation, but currently few studies have been conducted to validate their influence. A study focused on identifying factors that contribute to participation of African-Americans in investigational cancer programs and/or trials was therefore conducted. Two hundred twenty African-American men and women were recruited to participate in a regional survey. There was evidence to support the impact that perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs have on willingness to participate in investigational programs and/or trials. The factor having the greatest influence on willingness to participate in investigational programs and/or trials was perceived efficacy of the investigational programs and/or trials. Among this sample there was an apparent hesitancy of many to participate in research programs and/or trials. The prevailing belief that such programs and/or trials were only for those with the disease or condition under study appeared to influence their response. However, when provided information on the opportunities for participation in prevention, diagnostic, and treatment programs and/or projects for those within the general community (especially for those at higher risk) and on the benefits of participation, a much greater willingness to participate was expressed by participants.",Cancer nursing,1993 Feb,United States,1993,90

7680093,The child with developmental disabilities grown up: adult residua of childhood disorders.,"A clinic specializing in learning disabilities and willing to assess adults receives referrals that parallel the three major reasons for referral in the pediatric and adolescent school-aged population: (1) ""Is this patient dyslexic""; (2) ""Does this patient 'have' ADHD residual type""; (3) ""Does this patient have some kind of learning disability?"" The third is the most difficult and least well understood, the NVLD or so-called right-hemisphere group, most likely to be referred by mental health facilities and professionals. The first, dyslexia, has the most secure neuroscientific background and in some ways the most straightforward conceptualization yet is still controversial in terms of the subtle and well-masked ways in which its manifestations may be seen. Aptly placed in the second and hence middle position, straddling both dyslexia and NVLD, is that sprawling and emphatically heterogeneous collection of observations agglomerated under the title ADHD and affiliated with the pharmacotherapy of stimulants. Yet for all its sprawl, ADHD stands in relation to its cognitive overlap zone, executive dysfunction, as symptoms do to signs; and executive dysfunction, especially in adults, appears to be a cognitive-deficit cluster of special importance to the persistence of uncompensated or clinically significant learning disabilities. That is, the real question to be answered about adults with learning disabilities is why have they not compensated for cognitive deficits; or, if they have acquired basic academic skills, why have they not been able to use these skills? Unless linguistic or spatial deficits are extremely severe, academic skills can usually be acquired by compensatory strategies and, once acquired, can be used. Ability to compensate (and to generalize the compensation) are crucial determinants of adult learning disabilities outcome. Less is understood about nonacademic skills, of which the social domain seems least optional, i.e., most pervasively important. Spatially based skills are the least difficult to avoid or circumvent. Absent severe linguistic or spatial cognitive deficits, the most central neuropsychologic issues in adult learning-disability studies are executive dysfunction and social imperception/ineptitude. At present, executive dysfunction is the one of these two that can be evaluated in a behavioral neurology clinic.",Neurologic clinics,1993 Feb,United States,1993,90

This article compares 2 linked data sets to examine the effects of income level and membership in race/ethnic categories on whether teen pregnancies terminate in abortion and whether those carried to term are legitimated by marriage. One data set consists of ethnographic data from 3 neighborhoods in Brooklyn, New York, that are predominantly African-American, Hispanic (mostly Puerto Rican), and non-Latino White, respectively. The other consists of all birth and abortion records from the health areas of those neighborhoods. Both data sets show higher rates of abortion and lower rates of marriage for poorer people, along with distinctive race/ethnic patterns that cannot be reduced to income differences.

It will then be argued that international migration flows emerge as a complex set of links that connect individuals and communities to the national capital region and ultimately to places abroad. This approach acknowledges that structural imbalances provide conditions for potential movement, but that this potential is translated into movement flows only when links between various people, places and mediating structures are actually activated through social networks.

12317957,The demand for water in rural areas: determinants and policy implications.,"Improving the adequacy and quality of water supplies is a priority for rural development in developing countries. So far, the strategies of governments and international donors for tackling the problem have been supply-driven; the fundamental importance of demand in the selection of appropriate policies has been virtually ignored. The realization that effective policy and planning must take into account what the rural clients want and are prepared to pay for was the impetus for the World Bank's multicountry study of households' demand for improved water services. This article summarizes the findings of the 1987-90 investigation of determinants of rural demand in selected regions of Latin America, Africa, and South Asia. The research team used both direct (contingent valuation) surveys and indirect (revealed preference) methods to estimate households willingness to pay for different levels and types of improvement. The methodology produced some illuminating insights into how to decide what level of service is appropriate for a particular community and how the improved services should be paid for. The team identified 4 broad categories of village situations, with appropriate policies ranging from the provision of house connections at full cost of one extreme, to no improvement in traditional supplies at the other extreme.",The World Bank research observer,1993 Jan,United States,1993,90

12233625,Infant mortality and public policy.,"""Arguing that conventional indices of poverty (such as the head-count ratio) do not capture all aspects of deprivation that large segments of the population experience in developing countries, the present paper concentrates on progress in reducing infant and child mortality, and the underlying factors. The role of public policy in reducing infant and child mortality is emphasised. While income matters, (independently) aspects of maternal care and access to certain basic health services also have a significant role. In particular, female literacy (as a proxy for mother's literacy) has a substantial negative effect. In the context of the concern for cost-effectiveness of public expenditure during structural adjustment, a case is made for reordering of priorities in educational and health expenditure, and for specific policy interventions designed to promote female literacy.""",Public finance = Finances publiques,1993,Netherlands,1993,90

8500954,Higher education for public health leadership.,"The primary health care approach to public health stresses recognition of economic, political, and social determinants of health. In practice, briefly trained community health workers provide people with education and health care, but they require sound supervision. Such tasks of leadership require higher education. This demands more schools of public health of independent status, as well as stronger departments of community medicine within schools of medicine. Independent schools of public health throughout the world are much stronger than preventive medicine departments in medical schools, as measured by full-time faculty, scope of teaching and research, and candidates enrolled. To train properly for leadership, such independent schools in the developing world should be multiplied by 12 times to meet the needs. Leadership requires basic preparation in the full scope of public health knowledge, along with skills of effective management.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1993,United States,1993,90

In this study, the authors analyze birth and death rates as calculated from the sample of 9,940 households (57,665 persons), with respect to other variables such as region, religion, and socioeconomic status. In order to study the effect of socioeconomic factors on birth and death rates, a socioeconomic status rating (SES rating) was developed, taking into account such factors as income, education, housing conditions, and land ownership. Socioeconomic status was found to have a definite influence on birth and death rates, with higher socioeconomic status resulting in lower birth and death rates. This effect was independent of such confounding variables as age structure of the population, religion, and region. The higher risk of mortality among the poorer households can partly be explained by the material deprivation: the higher birth rates could be the result of poorer educational attainments.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1993,United States,1993,90

This study examines a model of the social determinants of HIV-associated sexual risk behaviors. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the data for 207 female sexual partners who had never injected drugs. The findings show that crack cocaine use is the strongest contributor to the model, which explains fourteen percent of the variance of sexual risk behavior. The findings suggest that the risks associated with sexual practices are much greater for crack cocaine users than among non users of crack.",Women & health,1993,United States,1993,90

However links between these variables were not taken into account. In this paper we use a regression model to the study of the determinants of suicide in prison in order to isolate the individual effect of each variable. We confirmed previous observations such as the increase in suicides with the increase in length of imprisonment. The sex of the individual and the nature of the crime did not correlate with suicide rate. The major risk factors for suicide were high social status and a high degree of social and family integration. These results contrast with observations on suicide outside the prison environment, for which the contrary was found.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1993,France,1993,90

Identification of neuropsychiatric and psychosocial outcomes and their determinants will help the military minimize the impact of the HIV epidemic on military readiness and function. Neuropsychiatric and psychosocial findings are among the most common complications seen in early HIV disease and among the most likely to have an adverse impact on military readiness and function. The study has demonstrated that the average HIV-infected service person experiences at least transient military occupational difficulty following notification of HIV status. More than 15% at any given time have levels of clinical or subclinical anxiety or depression that are referrable for mental health intervention. Ten per cent of study subjects have a current major mood disorder and 5% have a psychoactive substance use disorder. Finally, 17% of study subjects have experienced serious suicidal ideation or behaviours at least once since notification of seropositivity. Fortunately, however, data also indicate at least partial effectiveness of current primary, secondary and tertiary preventive efforts. Only about 1% of Air Force HIV-infected persons are discharged for psychiatric reasons prior to eventual medical discharge. Further, a large majority of active-duty patients demonstrate solid military occupational and social performance. Though military HIV neurobehavioural research is still in progress, preliminary data identify social support and pre-HIV psychiatric predisposition as important factors associated with current neuropsychiatric status.",Vaccine,1993,Netherlands,1993,90
8488633,[Ethologic determinants of maternal behavior in swine].,"Care giving behaviour was investigated in pigs as a form of maternal behaviour and its effects on the youngs. The objective of observation was to compare the identified phenomena in their biological, social and experience variables of the behaviour of the investigated animals. The observations included 40 sows and 280 youngs of the Landrace x Large White breed, of the female sex. They took place in semi-natural conditions while the standard criteria of management were maintained. Two categories of sows and their youngs were investigated. The first group included 20 sows (first-litter gilts) and their youngs: A (1-20). A study unit comprised one sow and seven youngs. The other category, B (1-20), had analogical numbers of individuals but the sows were after their third parturitions. As an indicator of maternal behaviour the average index of sociability (IS) had the value mean = 1.7 for the first category and the value mean = 2.0 for the second category. Evaluation of these differences enables to determine a significant difference between the average IS for both groups (Fig. 1). This fact, which spoke in favour of B (1-20) group, made us follow the different litters. That means we wanted to know how the maternal behaviour determined piglet sociogenesis. IS was calculated from the average values of IS determined in both categories within their adequate litters. The value mean A (a-g) = 1.8 was determined for the first category (Tab. II) while for the second category B (1-20) the value mean B (a-g) made 2.0 (Tab. III).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Veterinarni medicina,1993,Czech Republic,1993,90
8488075,Urbanization and human health.,"Urbanization involves a physical change in which increasing proportions of populations live in urban settings, however defined. It also implies considerable changes in the ways in which these people live, how they earn their livelihoods, the food which they eat, and the wide range of environmental factors to which they are exposed. There is another underlying assumption that, increasingly, urban populations will be more healthy than their rural counterparts and that higher levels of urbanization will equate with better health status. This paper discusses some of the assumptions underlying this contention. It takes issue with certain of them, particularly the assumption that urbanization affects the health of all residents equally. It is manifestly evident that in many cities, particularly in the developing world, the poor are exposed to greater risks and have much lower health status than their richer neighbours. In addition, whilst urban residents may theoretically have a better access to health care and services than do residents in many rural areas, and whilst many indicators of health do appear better in more highly urbanized societies than ones less so, there are caveats. The paper introduces the concept of epidemiological transition, which suggests that, whilst life expectancy might be higher in many urbanized countries and in certain cities, the inhabitants are often merely suffering from different forms of ill-health, often chronic or degenerative, rather than infective. In certain cities in middle-income countries, residents, particularly the poor, are exposed to a double risk of both infection and chronic degenerative ailments. The paper concludes with a consideration of more general recent statements from the World Health Organization among others, on the impact of urbanization on health. The 'Healthy Cities' project is also discussed. WHO identifies a range of general determinants of urban health: physical, social, cultural and environmental. Many represent the by-products of modernization and especially industrialization. It is emphasized that urbanization, and the concentration of human beings into new areas in particular, can bring exposure to new risk factors for large numbers of people. The growth of infectious and parasitic disease in some urban settings must therefore be recognized, as must the emergence of chronic diseases, with the concomitant need for investment in new types of health and social care. However, a number of constraints militate against the achievement of improved urban health, especially in developing countries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Parasitology,1993,England,1993,90

Overall females had more difficulty with friends, and scored higher on both psychological and physical symptoms. The older children had more complaints about life in Japan, difficulty with friends and physical and psychological problems. The differences between the returnee and control group were less in the age range between 7 and 9, but the overseas experience seemed to have positive effects between the ages of 10 to 15. The longer the children stayed overseas, the more they had complaints about life in Japan and difficulty with friends, and less negative attitudes towards overseas life. Children who had multiple overseas experiences had more problems such as anxiety, depression and mental complaints. Children's developmental stages and the amount of exposure to the foreign culture are therefore important determinants of their readjustment. The expectations of parents and the home culture to the returnee children, gender, and emphasis on academic achievement, must also be taken into account.",The International journal of social psychiatry,1993 Spring,England,1993,90

ERT use was strongly related to social class and level of education. The odds ratio of ""ever"" use was 3.0 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.8-5.1) for women with 12 or more years of education, compared with those with less than 7 years. No relationship emerged between marital status and ERT use, but parous women tended to be less frequently ever users than nulliparous, and ERT use decreased with increasing number of births (chi 2 1 trend = 10.51, p. = 0.001). Post-menopausal women reported more frequent ERT use than peri-menopausal ones, and among post-menopausal subjects the use was more frequent in those reporting earlier age at menopausal (chi 2 1 trend = 5.33, p = 0.02). There was no association between smoking habits and ERT use, but Quetelet's index was inversely related to the use of ERT.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1993,France,1993,90
8454215,[Detection of psychosocial dysfunction in ob-gyn patients].,"The human behavior and its social determinants are critical variables for understanding the etiology, treatment, and prevention of many disorders previously attributed to biological substrates. Among the many categories of human behavior to receive special attention from health researchers and practitioners are life events, coping responses and emotional state. The relation between these categories constituted a particular field of investigation. This relationship rather than forcing to focus on disease, distress, disability, and other failures in human functioning, permits to address health, abilities, resources, and other positive aspects of human functioning. On the other hand, the re-organization of health services considers interdisciplinary work as an objective, as it is necessary to care for the patient in an integral manner, with the consequent benefit of a more efficient service. In addition it is known that patients with psychosocial dysfunctions who use general practice care facilities overutilize these services in an unnecessary manner. With this in mind it is clear that is necessary to balance the service's cost-benefit for a more efficient clinical attention. In this paper we present the results of the categories mentioned above: life events, coping responses and its relationship with emotional state in a representative sample of 399 female patients who in 1986 received services at the National Institute of Perinatology-INPer-. Of these patients, 297 were obstetrical patients -OBS- and 102 gynaecological ones -GINE-.

The analysis examined the relationship between the average effectiveness level of the contraceptive methods that a woman used over a three-and-a-half-year period and community characteristics such as employment opportunities, the availability of contraceptive and abortion information and services, and the level of religious adherence in communities. Community characteristics associated with higher levels of contraceptive effectiveness were rapid population growth, high rates of unemployment, elevated levels of religious affiliation, high socioeconomic status, and ready access to family planning information and services. Community liberality was negatively associated with effective contraceptive use. The results support arguments that various community characteristics affect a woman's contraceptive choices by increasing or decreasing the costs of an unintended pregnancy.",Family planning perspectives,1993 Jan-Feb,United States,1993,90

New associations were found for men employed in shoemaking and shoe repair, porcelain and earthenware industries, education, and other white collar occupations. Several findings supported associations found in other countries, including excesses among woodworkers, furniture makers, electric power plant workers, farmers, dairy workers, lorry drivers, and other land transport workers. Risks were not increased among chemists, chemical or rubber manufacturing workers, or petrochemical refinery workers. Caution must be used in drawing causal inferences from these linked registry data because information on exposure and duration of employment is not available.

Using a structured form to abstract data, information was obtained on demographics, precipitating problems, past mental health services, substance use, family problems, and disposition. While suicidal behavior was not a predictor of acute hospitalization, the interaction of assaultive and suicidal behavior was predictive. Other contributory factors identified in the multivariate analysis included: child's substance use, family member's substance use, and initial emergency screening site.

8422295,Regional lung cancer death rates unrelated to smoking? The case of The Netherlands.,"It has been observed in various countries that regional variation in lung cancer mortality can hardly be explained by differences in current smoking. This paper addresses the question of whether mortality variation within. The Netherlands in 1980-1984 is due to differences in past instead of current smoking. A first indication of the role of past smoking is that, within male birth cohorts, regional mortality patterns have been very stable for over 30 years. Reliable data on smoking in 1972 explain 40% of the mortality variation among women, but only 2% of that among men. A crude indicator on smoking in 1930 explained 43% of the mortality variation among men aged 75+ years (correlation = 0.66). The lack of a relationship with smoking in 1972 appears to be due to a radical change in regional smoking differences, which caused smoking in 1972 to be unrelated to smoking in 1930; long time lags, so that these changes were not yet followed by changes in regional mortality differences. It is concluded that the explanation of regional lung cancer death rates sometimes has to go far back in time. Studying determinants of lung cancer by means of regional analyses requires a more detailed control for smoking history than has been usual.","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",1993,England,1993,90

8420583,AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa: the epidemiology of heterosexual transmission and the prospects for prevention.,"As the epidemic of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in sub-Saharan Africa enters its second decade, much has been learned about the distribution and determinants of the disease and its causative agent, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Over 6 million people, or 2.5% of the adult population, are thought to be infected with HIV. The distribution of HIV is largely determined by sexual behavior; as for other sexually transmitted diseases, the characteristics of sexual networks determine the extent and rate of spread of HIV. Female sex workers and their male clients are at high risk for HIV and have been important in initiating the epidemic in many African countries. The dynamics of HIV in the rest of the population are complex; men with multiple sexual partners are largely responsible for transmission of HIV to women in the general population. Other sexually transmitted diseases and lack of male circumcision may increase the probability of transmission of HIV during sexual intercourse and probably are partially responsible for the rapid diffusion of HIV in Africa. Interventions among high-risk groups are needed, but they must be accompanied by attempts to induce behavior change among men and women in the general population. Epidemiologic studies of the determinants of sexual behavior and sexual contact patterns, as well the design and evaluation of interventions, are urgently needed. Key areas for development are the study of behavioral exposures and outcomes, the evaluation of interventions, developing new methods for conducting interventions in resource-poor environments, and increasing the number of African scientists with the skills and resources to conduct epidemiologic studies.","Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",1993 Jan,United States,1993,90

During the acquisition phase, which consisted of five nightly sessions lasting 14-16 h, individually caged rats responded for more sufentanil aerosol than did pair-caged animals when the fixed ratio (FR) requirement was gradually increased from FR 1 to FR 5 over the five sessions. During the maintenance phase, which consisted of daytime 2-h sessions at an FR 5 schedule of reinforcement, there were no differences between individually and pair-caged animals responding for sufentanil or for water vapor. Both groups responded significantly more for sufentanil than for water vapor. Based upon present evidence, it is suggested that environmental and biologic determinants may change psychomotor behavior in a way that could influence the rate by which animals acquire drug-seeking behavior.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",1993 Jan,United States,1993,90
8372490,[The effect of education and professional position on changes in cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption: results of the MONIKA Augsberg cohort study].,"This study examined the influence of educational achievement and occupational position on changes in risk behavior. Study population were 3753 men and women aged 25-64 years who were sampled by the first MONICA Augsburg Survey (Monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease). The subjects were sampled in 1984-85, were followed up for three years, and were reexamined in 1987-88. The baseline findings showed for both men and women a statistically significant inverse association between current cigarette smoking and educational level. During the follow-up period the differences between highest and lowest educational levels increased significantly among men. In 1987-88 only 21% of the best educated men were smokers compared to 38% of those with the lowest educational level. Men with low educational levels also drank more alcohol than better educated men, whereas among women those with lowest educational level drank less alcohol than the better educated. Statistically independent of education and age it was found that male civil servants and farmers had the lowest proportion of smokers in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal analyses. Among women, smoking was and remained most prevalent in simple white-collar occupations. In general, the findings indicate that the type of occupation and the actual working conditions have effects on life-style related risk factors which are in part independent of a social gradient. The results also suggest that the tendency to change unhealthy behavior is less pronounced in ""high risk"" groups.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1993,Switzerland,1993,90
8372248,[A new strategy for the classification of mental disorders: an example of a multi-dimensional model for psychopathology].,"Present diagnostic classification systems stand in the way of a concurrence between events in our social lives and the biological substrates of common mental disorders. A two dimensional model is presented for common mental disorders, defined by symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although anxiety symptoms are often related to threat and depressive symptoms to loss, the two types of symptoms are not independent and often co-exist. The data from two independent studies with general practice patients in which a common standardized research interview was used were analyzed using latent trait modeling. The results obtained for the symptoms of anxiety and depression, as for the diagnoses (ICD-9 or DSM-III) confirm the robustness of this model. The strength of this conceptual model is based on its potential simultaneously to illustrate the relationship between biological and social determinants of these common symptoms. These two types of symptoms are related to the physiological reactions in response to punishment and reward. They also illustrate how certain events in our social environment are specifically associated with the constitution of anxiety and depression. Conversely, genetic vulnerability appears to be non-specific and may determine an increased overall likelihood to develop symptoms under stress, but the nature of those symptoms (anxiety or depression) depend on other factors. Moreover, other variables (i.e. personality, social relations) modify the effect of these relationships. Our knowledge of inter-relationships between common psychiatric symptoms and events from the social environment thus appears sound, and is likely to withstand future developments in biological psychiatry.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1993,France,1993,90

Such outcomes may result from a failure to isolate the variable maintaining SIB, or they may reflect multiple sources of control over SIB. In order to identify more clearly the determinants of SIB, each subject was exposed to a series of treatments appropriate to one or both of the apparent functions of SIB. These treatments, applied sequentially on baselines appropriate to each behavioral function, identified the maintaining variables for SIB through differential outcomes across baselines. Results indicated that the SIB of 2 subjects was multiply controlled, confirming the outcomes of the functional analysis. However, the SIB of the 3rd subject was eliminated using a treatment designed for a single function, suggesting spurious results of the original assessment. Alternative interpretations of undifferentiated assessment data are discussed, as are analysis and treatment issues related to multiply determined behavior disorders.",Journal of applied behavior analysis,1993 Summer,United States,1993,90
8319504,Experimental studies of ongoing conscious experience.,"A research programme designed to find ways of applying a variety of methods in psychological science to studying the seemingly ephemeral phenomena of the human stream of consciousness and its manifestations in daydreams, interior monologues, imagery and related private experiences is described. Approaches include psychometric studies to establish normative information on daydreaming and experimental studies using signal-detection paradigms to capture the ongoing stream of thought. Recent experiments involve thought-sampling methods for identifying the determinants of the content of the stream of thought in adolescents or the ways in which self-beliefs and emotions are manifested in a group of cocaine and heroin abusers. Children's pretend play is studied as a possible forerunner of adult consciousness. It is proposed that the human condition involves a continuing tension between processing information generated from the physical and social milieu and the continuous operation of centrally generated material from long-term memory in the form of reminiscences, wishes, current concerns, expectancies and fantasies. This concept has implications for personality variation, affective arousal and adaptive behaviour.",Ciba Foundation symposium,1993,Netherlands,1993,90

8288432,Assessing technology assessment. Early results of the Quebec experience.,"The Quebec Council on Health Care Technology Assessment was created in 1988. Its functions are to promote, support, and produce health care technology assessments and to advise the Minister of Health. An independent review of the council's first four years of operation was commissioned. The evaluation team concluded that the council showed very good results in terms of the scope, quality, and impact of its production and succeeded in establishing its credibility. However, the evaluation team suggested that the council adopt a more active strategy toward the promotion and diffusion of its reports. Some critical determinants of success of the Quebec experience in technology assessment are discussed.",International journal of technology assessment in health care,1993 Fall,England,1993,90
8266845,Psychosocial correlates of adolescent drug involvement.,"This study evaluates the ability of a four-factor psychosocial model to explain adolescent drug involvement. Subjects are a representative sample of seventh- and eighth-grade public school students. A cross-sectional sample of data was extracted from a multiyear longitudinal assessment of a statewide drug education program. Data were collected through administration of the Youth Life-Styles Inventory, a specially designed drug-involvement assessment instrument. The belief that substance use has both external (sociological) and internal (psychological) causes guided the selection of independent variables. Factor analysis was used to disclose the interrelated structures of the psychosocial variables. A four-factor model was produced offering a concise theoretical paradigm of the underlying psychosocial determinants of adolescent drug use. This model was regressed on two indexes of drug involvement. Findings should prove useful in policy formulation and design of adolescent drug education and treatment programs. The explanatory potency of the four-factor model should aid in the investigation of adolescent drug use. The results indicate the need for children to bond with peers, parents, and others who have drug-resistant attitudes, and with conventional institutions such as schools.",Adolescence,1993 Winter,United States,1993,90
8266705,"The health of women in paid employment: effects of quality of work role, social support and cynicism on psychological and physical well-being.","The possible benefits of the workplace experience for women were examined in terms of four determinants; rewards and concerns intrinsic to the job, rewards and concerns extrinsic to the job, social support and cynicism as a measure of attitude. Benefits were identified in terms of three psychological well-being measures: self-esteem, depression and quality of life and in terms of one physical well-being measure: symptomatology. Data were obtained from one hundred and twenty Canadian women in managerial or professional occupations and in clerical-type occupations. Analyses consisted of correlations and hierarchical multiple regression. Intrinsic factors were generally related to psychological well-being while extrinsic factors were more closely associated with physical health. Findings with regard to the beneficial effects of social support in the workplace were not specific, however a cynical attitude can influence the value of the work role, with effects being particularly marked in the clerical group. Because of its relationship with health, it is recommended that cynicism is included in future women's studies.",Women & health,1993,United States,1993,90
8256533,Reported disease and psychological well-being in Swiss adults.,"In Switzerland, and in many other countries as well, the distribution of morbidity and perceived health in the general population and their determining factors have not been systematically studied so far. This article reports on exploratory study of prevalence of two complex health indicators, long-standing disease (Disease) and psychological well-being (Well-being) and of their environmental, person-specific and behavioural determinants. Data from a health survey conducted in five cantons and three language regions as part of the Swiss Intercantonal Health Indicators Project were used. Whereas distributions of prevalence of Disease according to gender, age, level of education and place of living confirm results of other studies, unexpected prevalence patterns were found for Well-being, especially with regard to gender differences. Multivariate analyses by general linear models (independent sub-samples of the study population were used to develop and validate models) showed different sets of environmental, person-specific and behavioural factors to explain inter-individual differences of Disease and Well-being, both in the total validation sample and in sub-samples of women and men. The results are discussed with regard to implications for socioepidemiological health research.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1993,Switzerland,1993,90

Postal questionnaires were completed by 502 of West German company doctors. About one third of those who responded, reported that they carried out the requirements of the German Work Safety Law with regard to workplace-related prevention. Multivariate analysis was applied to discover the factors that influenced compliance. We conclude that investment in supply-side factors (doctors' qualifications, experiences and recourses) are not enough to bring about compliance. More important are the demand-side regulations which directly address the health and safety culture of the companies.","Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)",1993,England,1993,90
8237543,"Cognitive, psychosocial, and reported sexual behavior differences between pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents.","A wide variety of variables have been related to the occurrence of adolescent pregnancy. However, many previous studies have produced conflicting results and are univariate in nature. The purpose of this study was to assess differences in pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents on variables from three domains: cognitive, psychosocial, and reported sexual behavior. Sixty-nine pregnant adolescents and 58 comparison adolescents filled out nine questionnaires presented on microcomputers. Significant differences were found on 10 of 24 univariate tests. The strongest differences concerned areas of scholastic functioning and reported sexual behavior; pregnant teenagers were more likely than nonpregnant peers to be doing poorly in school and less likely to use contraceptives. In addition, pregnant teenagers were more likely to have a relative or friend who was an adolescent mother and to expect child rearing to be easier than did the nonpregnant adolescents. A discriminant analysis was computed which correctly classified 83% of the sample, based on variables from each of the three domains. This study has served to replicate, refute, and expand on previous findings concerning the antecedents of teenage pregnancy. More importantly, this study has empirically demonstrated the multivariate and interrelated nature of variables associated with teenage pregnancy.",Adolescence,1993 Fall,United States,1993,90

In this study, members of a self-help group for the relatives of schizophrenia sufferers provided information through a mail survey, using standardized measures of psychological distress and burden, and severity of the sufferer's illness. Caregiver psychological distress was high compared with test norms, and the level of behavioral disturbance in the sufferer was found to contribute to caregiver distress after controlling for the caregiver's age, sex, and social supports. An unexpected finding was that those caring for female sufferers reported greater distress than those caring for males.",Schizophrenia bulletin,1993,United States,1993,90
8222993,Global epidemiology.,"Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in human populations. Epidemiology on a global scale is severely constrained by the lack of data. In many countries, there are no comprehensive data on mortality or basic demographic data. Where data are available, findings on the relationship of environment to health across countries need to be interpreted with caution. For example, there is well-known variation in standards of medical practice and diagnosis, and in certification and coding, but there are also large differences in diet, the social environment and lifestyle--all of which strongly predict disease incidence. Inappropriate inference concerning aetiology made from such broad-scale studies may result in what has been termed the 'ecological fallacy'. A complementary approach is to collect and analyse data in standardized fashion as part of international collaborative studies. These can offer some important advantages over the more conventional single-centre design. Recent advances have meant that studies of environment and health can now--in some countries--be carried out using routine data at the small area level. Although problems of interpretation remain, they are generally less severe than in broad-scale studies. Examples of this approach are given.",Ciba Foundation symposium,1993,Netherlands,1993,90

Two groups of DSM-III-R schizophrenics, one with PPD and the other without PPD (30 subjects in each group) were compared. Significantly more patients in PPD group belonged to nuclear families, had longer duration of psychotic phase of the illness, were hospitalised more frequently and had more sadness and anxiety-somatisation during florid illness phase. The PPD group also had more past history of depression. Although PPD patients had better premorbid personal-social adjustment in comparison with non-PPD group, they perceived themselves to be lacking in social support and had experienced more stressful life events. For patients in the PPD group, stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed age of onset, sadness during florid psychotic state, premorbid adjustment, social support and life events as significant determinants of severity of depression in the post-psychotic phase.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,1993,Germany,1993,90

The subjects were distributed across the nine cells of a two-factorial design, factor 1 representing the degree of organic, factor 2 the degree of psychosocial risk. At age 3 months mother-child interaction was videotaped and evaluated with microanalytic technique. The quality of MCI could be demonstrated to be as predictive for later cognitive development as early developmental tests. Social-emotional problems of the toddler and preschool child was predicted better by parameters of early MCI than by temperament. Disturbed interactions were associated with later cognitive retardation and enhanced behavior problems. MCI is significantly determined by neglect and rejection, which showed typical behavioral patterns. The early separation of mother and high risk newborn itself did not lead to alterations in maternal attachment.

8171295,Quality of Life--rationale and methods for developing a disease-specific instrument for inflammatory bowel disease.,"Quality of Life (QOL) is a composite descriptor applied to an unlimited spectrum of tangible and intangible parameters of life satisfaction and capacity. Because of the breadth of determinants of QOL, most researchers prefer to focus on a specific segment of it, such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Generally, HRQOL indices incorporate physical, emotional and social aspects of both health perception and function. Most instruments are also subjective and quantitative. As in clinical trials, several elements are critical to the development of a HRQOL measure. Most importantly, the putative application of the instrument should be determined beforehand. The clinical setting and disease-specific population of interest must be identified. The questionnaire must be as simple as possible and easy to administer. The final instrument must be shown to be a valid measure of HRQOL, which is reproducible, with limited variability and observer bias on repeated administrations, when no clinical change has occurred. If applicable, the instrument should demonstrate responsiveness to important changes in clinical status. Finally, the value of the instrument in relevant clinical studies should be demonstrated. The critical phases of development of the McMaster IBDQ are outlined. The IBDQ is a quantitative index of HRQOL intended as a measure of therapeutic outcome for clinical trials in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology.

8146695,Breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea in a traditional society: a hazards model analysis.,"There is considerable variation in the length of the postpartum amenorrhea during which breastfeeding suppresses fertility, both within and between societies. In this paper, we investigate the association between breastfeeding and the resumption of menses and the impact of various biological and social covariates thereon, using data from two retrospective surveys in India. We use both univariate life table and multivariate time-dependent hazards techniques to analyze the data. Most prior investigations related the impact of breastfeeding to postpartum amenorrhea by taking duration of breastfeeding as a fixed covariate. However, breastfeeding beyond the resumption of menstruation cannot affect the duration of menses. Accordingly, the present study has a methodological focus in the sense that breastfeeding is treated as a time-dependent covariate. We found that breastfeeding, age of mother at child's birth, social status, level of income, religion and caste (subcaste), and residential status have significant effects on return of menses in Indian traditional society.",Social biology,1993 Spring-Summer,United States,1993,90

This paper describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of the elderly treated for ESRD in Canada using the Canadian Organ Replacement Register data. Comparisons with younger age groups are also presented. Analyses of data for the period 1981-1991 indicated that the elderly (65+) represent an expanding portion of all new ESRD patients in Canada. Distributions of dialysis modalities showed no major differences by age groups (45-54, 55-64, 65-75, 75+). However, the overall usage of intermittent peritoneal dialysis has decreased over time (from 17% of patients in 1981-83 to 7% in 1990-91). Deaths from social causes were slightly more frequent among the elderly (15.9% of all deaths among those aged 65+ vs 10% among those aged 45-64). Moreover, deaths from infections were more common among patients on dialysis for a longer period of time and more common among patients on peritoneal dialysis than among those on hemodialysis. Discontinuations of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) because of the inability to cope increased with age. Patients with comorbid conditions were more likely to receive hemodialysis, and, as expected, the presence of these conditions increased with age and significantly reduced survival. Other determinants of survival included calendar period of registration, renal center size, and treatment modality. This paper illustrates the many changes over time in the elderly population treated for ESRD. Also of importance, however, is the elderly Canadian population with ESRD which is not presently treated.",Advances in peritoneal dialysis. Conference on Peritoneal Dialysis,1993,Canada,1993,90
7953876,[Health promotion. Planning process of health promotion programs for individuals with arthritis].,"Based on the health conception viewed from the literature on nursing and by the clients, health is defined as a living experience, or as a perception of wellness in this study. That is, it is the perceived wellness that the individual obtains by wholistically integrating all dimensions of health where ever the individual stands in the health continuum. Thus health exists independently, regardless of illness or disability, because the individual is able to perceive the wellness within limitations imposed to him/her. Also, based on the health conception defined in this study and the literature review on health promotion, health promotion is defined as the process of enhancing the perception of wellness (i.e., living experience), where ever the individual stands in the health continuum. Therefore, health promotive care represents the process of making client help himself to improve health experience/perception of wellness by selecting and/or integrating the individual or social health parameters (determinants) based on his reality. After analyzing the data which is provided from the related literature and the results from the descriptive/exploratory research on this group of clients, and then applying those analysis results to the PRECEDE model, planning process for health promotion program is established. However, as planning process is only based on data from literature in the first stage, it will be modified appropriately according to the assessment feedback from the direct participation of client in the following study. Based on the planning model refined through this assessment process, health promotion program is to be developed, implemented and evaluated. Planning process of health promotion for clients with arthritis is begun from the assessment of health outcome as the first phase. It is analyzed from this study that clients with arthritis indicates lower quality of life/satisfaction than the other groups from the several research findings indicate. In the second phase, according to the analysis results in the first phase, clients' health problems (perceived seriousness about illness, uncertainty in illness, helplessness, difficulty of movement), which affect the low quality of life, are identified and then program objective for each problem is demonstrated. As an objective for the perceived seriousness about illness, relief of the mistrust on the general effects of treatment for illness is determined through appropriate data analysis. And clients' accumulation of accurate knowledge on the nature of illness is determined as an objective, for reducing uncertainty in the illness. Also enhancement of distraction ability and self-efficacy perception is defined as objectives for reducing physical, psychological and social helplessness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Kanhohak t'amgu,1993,Korea (South),1993,90
10186847,Bearing the costs of our eldercare policies: work constraints among employed caregivers.,"For many caregivers, rendering aid to frail parents, grandparents, siblings, and spouses comes at a high price: compromised physical and mental health, disturbed relationships with spouse and children, truncated opportunities for social life, and, for caregivers who are employed, declining job performance. Using the 1982 National Long Term Care Survey's ""Survey of Informal Care-givers,"" this study investigates how the sociodemographic characteristics of caregivers, care requirements, the availability of backup caregivers, and conditions of employment affect the likelihood that caregivers will suffer work constraints. Estimations of both the probability of work constraints and hours of work reveal that proxies for work conditions figure prominently, as do care requirements. In the model of constrained work, ill health, financial burdens, and primary responsibility for care are significant determinants; the estimation of hours of work revealed that low income and competing care demands wielded major influence. Women and white caregivers are employed fewer hours, while spouses are more likely than other informal caregivers to face constrained work. Occupation, as an indicator of work conditions, is shown to be an important addition to the factors considered in investigations of circumstances that affect caregivers' experiencing work constraints.",Journal of aging & social policy,1993,England,1993,90
10130406,Community health assessment. The first step in community health planning.,"Hospitals face a paradigm shift: from planning service delivery to population-based community health planning. Comprehensive community health planning is a two-step process: assessment and action, in that order. Assessment identifies community problems and resources; action follows planning, which determines which of those problems should be addressed with which resources. This paper provides an overview of the community assessment process. The first challenge in launching a community health initiative is to identify and recruit partners drawn from the ranks of prominent community organizations, such as school boards, public health agencies, and elected officials. The best enlistment strategies are those that empower persons outside the hospital to take visible control. Defining the community is the first step in analyzing the community. It is important that everyone involved in the assessment process agree on the definition, which should take in those characteristics that make the community unique, including its social systems, environmental factors, and demographics. The next step in the process is developing a community health profile, a set of key community indicators or measures that will help you set priorities, document successes and failures, and monitor trends. There are a number of models available to consult in developing indicators, whether traditional, medically oriented determinants of health or broader parameters, such as housing and public safety. Criteria for selecting indicators include validity, stability and reliability, and responsiveness. Most indicators will be developed using secondary, or already existing, sources of data, such as census data, Medicare and Medicaid files, police records, and hospital admission and exit records. Conducting the community assessment involves putting together a list of problems to be solved and a list of available resources, both of which can be compiled using the same four-step process of gathering and analyzing data: obtaining community input, identifying problems already being addressed, consulting with professional experts, and analyzing existing data. Demographics are one way of analyzing data; another is using a ""community scoreboard"" that groups causal factors into four categories: lifestyle, environment, human biology, and health services. Once the community assessment is complete, planning and implementation of programs can begin. At the same time, it is essential to mobilize the community to support your initiative. Again, you must look beyond the hospital walls to build a constituency for change, to community leaders in education, employment, transportation and recreation, housing, and the physical environment, as well as health education and preventive services.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Hospital technology series,1993,United States,1993,90

24264173,Moderating effects of self-esteem on the use of ethnicity and academic standing as determinants of interpersonal acceptance.,"The influence of self-esteem on the use of status considerations as determinants of interpersonal acceptance was studied in a sample of 722 Israeli students from integrated junior high schools. The students completed a self-esteem questionnaire as well as the Interpersonal Relation Assessment Technique, a measure assessing willingness to engage in activities of increasing intimacy with classmates. Data analysis indicated a general preference for targets of higher educational level and high-status ethnic origin. These categorical preferences were more pronounced among high rather than low self-esteem students, irregardless of their own educational standing or ethnic origin. The findings were consistent with the thrust of cost-benefit analyses suggested by social exchange theories, in which self-esteem is viewed as one's globalized perception of social worth. The results suggest that individuals with high self-esteem may be more likely to see themselves as equals to higher status others and seek out their company than would their low self-esteem counterparts. Alternately, those with high self-esteem may be more motivated by social ambition and less by fear of rejection.",Journal of youth and adolescence,1992 Dec,United States,1992,90

A focus on dramatic but rare risk factors has distracted attention away from the primary determinants of these indicators. An analytic model to assess these indicators identifies three interacting determinates: (a) social well-being, (b) our technical capacity to reduce the risk that low social status conveys, and (c) our performance in providing access to this technical capacity. These three determinants can move independently and can, therefore, mask important trends in social status and the impact of programs and policies.",Mental retardation,1992 Dec,United States,1992,90
1469676,Zimbabwe's success story in education and health: will it weather economic structural adjustment?,"The beginning of the 1980s saw the birth of Zimbabwe as a result of a protracted liberation war. It coincided with global interest in primary health care, the concept of universal primary school education and, unfortunately, moves towards economic stabilization and structural adjustment programmes. Economic structural adjustment was adopted by several sub Saharan African countries with dire consequences for the poor and vulnerable. Zimbabwe's commitment to social justice and to equitable distribution of resources demonstrated a practical move away from the culture of rhetoric so characteristic of many governments and non-governmental organisations and agencies. This commitment has been translated into impressive improvements in health and education. Current evidence shows that education has had a positive impact on health and related areas like contraceptive use, child mortality and the nutrition status of children. Conversely nutrition and health conditions among school children are important determinants of educational outcomes. Hitherto Zimbabwe's economy has been sufficiently strong to avoid excessive dependence on the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other foreign financial institutions. Unfortunately, however, the current economic recession together with economic structural adjustment programmes are beginning to have a negative impact on health and education. Will true synergism between health and education weather these structural problems? It seems that the people and government of Zimbabwe have the capacity and resolve to weather such a storm.",Journal of the Royal Society of Health,1992 Dec,England,1992,90

Based on interviews with 76 triads composed of physicians, terminally ill patients, and primary caregivers, this study uses the socialization perspective to identify the actors and actions that most strongly affect the patient's death acknowledgment and receipt of exclusively palliative care (i.e., socialization to the dying role). Whereas patient preferences and sociodemographic characteristics do not influence significantly the patient's odds of death acknowledgment, these odds are increased if their primary caregivers accept death, their physicians are not affiliated with a teaching hospital, and the terminal prognosis is disclosed to them and disclosed ""matter-of-factly."" Patients who acknowledge death, whose agents value pain alleviation over life-prolongation, and whose physicians are not affiliated with a teaching hospital, are substantially more likely to receive exclusively palliative rather than curative terminal treatment.",Journal of health and social behavior,1992 Dec,United States,1992,90
1463089,Longitudinal analysis of adolescent growth of ladino and Mayan school children in Guatemala: effects of environment and sex.,"The rate of growth in height and the timing of adolescent growth events are analyzed for two samples of Guatemalan children. One sample includes Mayan school children, 33 boys and 12 girls between the ages of 5.00 to 17.99 years, living under poor conditions for growth and development. The second sample includes ladino children, 78 boys and 85 girls of the same age range, living under favorable conditions for growth. The Preece-Baines model I function is used to estimate mean values for rates and timing of childhood and adolescent growth events for the two groups. Significant statistical contrasts (t-tests) of these means show Mayan boys reach the age of ""take-off"" (TO; the onset of the adolescent growth spurt) 1.45 years later, achieve peak height velocity (PHV) 1.68 years later, and continue growing for about 2.0 years longer than do the ladino boys. Despite the Mayan boys' increased duration for growth they grow significantly more slowly than the ladinos. Mayan boys are 6.60 cm shorter than ladinos at the age of TO and are estimated to be 7.71 cm shorter than the ladinos at adulthood. Mayan girls reach the age of TO 0.93 years later than do the ladina girls, but the two groups do not differ in the age at PHV or the age at adulthood. The mean height of Mayan girls is significantly less than that of ladinas at the age of TO (6.5 cm), and this difference increases to an estimated 11.14 cm at adulthood. Possible causes of these ethnic and sex-related differences in amounts and rates of growth are discussed in relation to hypotheses about the genetic and environmental determinants of human development.",American journal of physical anthropology,1992 Dec,United States,1992,90
1458861,The chronic disease data bank model: a conceptual framework for the computer-based medical record.,"The principles underlying the chronic disease data bank model are straight-forward: (1) the purpose of medical care is to improve patient outcomes; (2) patient outcomes in contemporary developed societies are overwhelmingly linked to chronic illnesses and degenerative processes and will become increasingly so; (3) such outcomes have multiple determinants including the psychological and social, as well as the biologic; (4) outcome antecedents (risk factors) may precede clinical illness by years or decades; and (5) these complex characteristics require for their study (a) computer aid and (b) longitudinal data. The chronic disease data bank provides an important resource, available to many investigators, for examination of the complex set of clinical and policy questions arising with long-term illness and addressing the questions of lifetime health. The chronic disease data bank consecutively enrolls eligible subjects, follows them for life, and amasses time-oriented, multidisciplinary data including clinical findings, medical history, demographics, treatments, resource utilization and disease outcomes, and assessing both the quality of life and its duration. Analyses are longitudinal and time-series in type, examining changes in trends and tempo of the disease, and are focused upon long-term outcomes. Outcomes are regularly and carefully assessed, and include the outcome dimensions of death, disability, discomfort, iatrogenic toxicity, and dollar cost. Specific studies address the description of the disease from biologic, demographic, economic, and social viewpoints, identify the factors associated with good and bad outcomes, and assess the effects of treatment, both good and ill. The clinical and policy goals are focused upon delaying transitions from more benign disease states to more serious ones, thus improving both longevity and the quality of life. The time is appropriate to consider generalization of the chronic disease data bank model to the usual clinical care situation, with large rewards in improvement of the quality of care. The traditional medical record lacks systematic documentation of end results and of important covariates related to health risks. As such, it cannot readily be used to assess the ultimate quality of care and to establish a feedback loop to change behaviors and thereby improve outcomes. It is weak where the chronic disease data bank is strong. The technology is transferable.","Computers and biomedical research, an international journal",1992 Dec,United States,1992,90
1427741,Causes and consequences of increase in child survival rates: ethnoepidemiology among the Hmong of Thailand.,"The Hmong ""hill tribe"" minority in Thailand has much higher exposure to factors usually associated with risk of child mortality (high fertility, low status of women, low education, less use of modern medical care for births, exposure to warfare, economic and physical disruption, and poor hygienic conditions) than the rural ethnic Thai population. Nonetheless, infant mortality has declined from over 120 per 1000 to under 50 per 1000 live births among both these populations in the past 30 years. The reason for the rapid increase in child survival among the Hmong appears to be better access to and more use of modern curative and preventive medical care associated with road construction rather than major changes in social or hygienic conditions. Conventional wisdom suggests that high fertility is both a cause and a consequence of high infant and child mortality and that parents will not reduce fertility until they see that mortality has declined. Most Hmong parents recognize the decline in child mortality and attribute it to better access to modern medical care. Most Hmong parents also say that, if they were starting to have children now, they would want to have fewer children. Fear of child death is infrequently mentioned as a motive for having more children, and the perceived decline in child mortality is rarely mentioned as a reason for reduced fertility. Most Hmong parents explain their desired family size in terms of economic conditions rather than perceived risk of child mortality. Results of this study suggest that fertility and child mortality can vary independently of one another and that major reductions in child mortality can be accomplished without waiting for major social changes (e.g., improved education or status of women) or major reductions in fertility.",Human biology,1992 Dec,United States,1992,90

At follow-up, men in the shortest fifth of the height distribution had experienced twice as many incident IHD events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction) as was the case for men from the tallest fifth. Adjustment for age, social class and smoking habit failed to alter these relationships significantly. In the data from South Wales, determinants of height were examined; birth rank and number of siblings showed a trend with height. This trend was found only in men whose fathers were manual workers and may be related to inadequate nutrition in the higher birth ranks and larger families. These results support the suggestion that early childhood factors may be relevant to IHD in middle age and possible mechanisms are discussed.",European heart journal,1992 Dec,England,1992,90

Among the socio-cultural factors examined were religion, education, labour force participation, age, age at marriage, duration of marriage, birth and marriage cohorts etc. We found sufficient evidence to support the contention that childbearing is a fundamentally social behaviour. On the whole, families tend to be large in the township. The higher a woman's socio-economic status, the smaller the size of her family.

It argues that the large scale migration likely played an important role in reducing the North-South fertility differential by homogenizing regional environments and influencing labor markets. The paper suggests that regional fertility theories need to become more sensitive to the effects of internal migration.""",Southeastern geographer,1992 Nov,United States,1992,90
1464272,Determinants of IQ profile in children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.,"To determine the IQ profile of children with epilepsy and the influence of various epilepsy-related variables on IQ scores, we studied 50 children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy of > 1-year duration, 25 of their siblings, and 30 healthy controls. IQ assessments were made with Malin's Indian modification of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. The mean +/- SD IQ scores of children with epilepsy (85.6 +/- 12) and their siblings (93.2 +/- 11) were significantly lower than those of the controls (101.6 +/- 9). The IQ scores of the children with epilepsy were also significantly lower than those of their siblings (p < 0.05). The IQ scores showed a significant correlation with socioeconomic status (SES) score (r = 0.33), a history of status epilepticus (r = -0.38), duration of seizure disorder (r = -0.31), and total number of seizures (r = -0.31). On multiple regression analysis, status epilepticus emerged as the most significant variable, accounting for 14% variance, followed by SES score (9% variance), duration of seizure disorder (6% variance), and sex of the child (5% variance). Genetic or environmental factors that probably lead to cognitive deficit in children with epilepsy and their siblings require further study.",Epilepsia,1992 Nov-Dec,United States,1992,90
1430859,Determinants of change in perceived health in a longitudinal study of older adults.,"To determine the factors that are predictive of a negative decline in perceived health in a longitudinal study of 251 men and women aged 62 and older, we developed a ""synthetic"" cohort of individuals who experienced a decline in perceived health between two time points and a control cohort of those who did not. The longitudinal design of the study made it possible to evaluate the effects of ""baseline"" predictors, gathered prior to the time interval during which the reported change in perceived health occurred, in addition to measures assessed at the two time points between which the change in health was reported. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of demographic, psychosocial, and illness measures on change in perceived health. These analyses revealed that increases in new illnesses, increased physician visits, and worsening of preexisting conditions (in subjects who had higher feelings of self-efficacy) were all associated with a decline in perceived health, after controlling for the effects of baseline illnesses and medication use. After accounting for these effects of changes in objective illness indicators, we found that changed psychosocial factors also predicted a decline in perceived health. Lower life satisfaction and higher depression at baseline were predictive of a later decline in perceived health. In addition, data collected at the third consecutive time point were evaluated to assess determinants of a sustained vs transient decline in perceived health. A sustained decline in perceived health was associated with increased depression and decreased self-efficacy.",Journal of gerontology,1992 Nov,United States,1992,90
1430719,Determinants of weight gain in pregnant adolescents.,"Maternal weight gain is the most important modifiable determinant of infant birth weight. Effective intervention requires an understanding of the factors that influence the amount of weight women gain during pregnancy. We studied the dietary, health, and social habits of 141 poor, black, 12- to 19-year-old prenatal patients to learn more about the determinants of weight gain among pregnant adolescents. The patients were divided into three weight gain groups: slow (n = 23): less than 0.28 kg/week; average (n = 87): 0.28-0.45 kg/week; and rapid (n = 31): more than 0.45 kg/week. The results of logistic regression analysis revealed two statistically significant predictors of slow weight gain: the consumption of fewer than three snacks per day and delayed (third trimester) enrollment in the Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. By contrast, rapid gainers were more compliant with prenatal visits and reported more depressive symptoms and alcohol consumption than did other study subjects. We conclude that attention to these modifiable correlates of inadequate and excessive weight gain may enable dietitians and other health care providers to develop more effective strategies for promoting optimal weight gain among pregnant adolescents.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1992 Nov,United States,1992,90

The report also considers whether women are consciously replacing breastfeeding with modern contraceptive methods. Data from the 1976 Malaysian Family Life Survey are analyzed, and the author concludes that Malaysian women do perceive that breastfeeding has a contraceptive effect, but that this perception is not universal. Ethnicity and desire for a particular family size are the most significant determinants of this perception. Finally, Malaysian women's recognition of the contraceptive effect of nursing does not influence either the duration of their breastfeeding or their adoption of contraception. Malaysian women may not be abandoning breastfeeding to adopt contraception. More probably, breastfeeding declines and contraceptive prevalence increases with modernization.",Studies in family planning,1992 Nov-Dec,United States,1992,90

Using linked data from population and economic censuses, government agencies, and health surveys on twenty-four Peruvian provinces, I explore how economic development and institutional contexts influence health outcomes. Regional inequities based on rural population, subsistence activity, women's illiteracy, monthly income, Gross Domestic Product, medical care, and health facilities are compared. Then a cluster analysis identifies institutional contexts that have internal similarities.... My conclusion is that understanding regional inequities--defined in terms of economic development, social institutions, and health services--leads to enhanced explanations of disparities in health outcomes.""",Sociological focus,1992 Oct,United States,1992,90

It was found that the headship rate for the young in the United States depends on income, the cost of housing, the number of families receiving AFDC payments, the age at first marriage for females and for males, and the percentage of males enrolled in college. Household formation by the young is much more sensitive to changes in income and the price of housing than household formation by the entire adult population. The estimated results are used to examine the change in the headship rate from 1961 to 1979 and from 1979 to 1987.""",Applied economics,1992 Oct,England,1992,90

A total of 29 early childhood deaths were recorded (cumulative mortality risk of approximately 6 per 1000), 17 of which (59%) were due to infectious diseases. The death rate was highest in the second year. Deaths were highly concentrated in children from low income (< US $50/month) families, where the cumulative risk of early childhood death was about 10 per 1000; on the other hand, there were no deaths among the 616 children from families with a monthly income of US $300 or more. Birthweight was also associated with mortality: the cumulative risk of children weighing less than 2000 g at birth was 21 per 1000, compared to 4 per 1000 among those with birthweights of 3500 g or more. Simultaneous adjustment for income and birthweight did not substantially change these differentials.

In it, we describe the results of a census, and our estimation of age structure, survivorship, mean age of women at childbearing, number of live children, total population size and density, and rate of change since 1967. We show that relevant measures fit closely the stable population model North 6 chosen by Dyson to represent Hadza demography in the 1960s. We compare aspects of Hadza demography with surrounding non-Hadza and with the !Kung. Among other things, we find that the Hadza have a higher population density, higher fertility, and a faster population growth rate than do the !Kung. These demographic differences are consistent with our expectations, which were based on differences in the costs and benefits of foraging in the two regions. We also show that Hadza demographic parameters display remarkable consistency over the past 20 years. Since neighboring populations have been encroaching on the area used by the Hadza, and Hadza foragers have been subject to interludes of externally imposed settlement, this consistency is surprising. We discuss some of the implications.",American journal of physical anthropology,1992 Oct,United States,1992,90

1428217,Time trends of smoking cessation: a micro-population computer simulation model.,"The Micro-population model of Risk-group Dynamics (MRD) approaches smoking behavior at the level of the individual and integrates physiological and social factors to describe the evolution of behavior change in the population. MRD is innovative in several ways: (1) the model describes mathematically the interactions among these behavioral factors; (2) the model accounts for both the variability of these factors among different persons and the universality of basic rules describing these factors in all individuals; and (3) the model can be applied to various types of populations and a wide range of intervention strategies. MRD combines the physiological, psychological and social determinants into a hazard function for relapse to smoking. This hazard function is then organized into a three term expression incorporating: a baseline hazard characteristic to each individual, a decreasing term for the diminishing aspect of the initial hazard and an effect of external interventions. The model gives promising results when applied to the Multiple Risk Factors Intervention Trial (MRFIT) data using the assumptions of a Weibull distribution for the baseline hazard, a negative exponential for the decrease in the initial hazard and a constant intensity for the external intervention.",International journal of bio-medical computing,1992 Oct,Ireland,1992,90

1411704,Maternal health and the measurement trap.,"This paper focuses on the contribution of measurement-related factors to the neglect of maternal health in resource allocation for programmes and in public health research. As the recent interest in maternal health has now progressed beyond the need for information primarily for the purpose of advocacy, measurement-related factors have emerged as powerful constraints on programme action. Three outstanding needs for information can be identified: first, to establish the levels and trends of specific maternal health outcomes; secondly, to identify the characteristics and determinants of health outcomes; and thirdly, to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of programmes designed to influence health outcomes. In order to meet these needs, the emphasis placed on operational research by the current major initiatives in maternal health must be complemented by an equivalent emphasis on methodological studies. The call for improved information by international and national agencies should be made in unison with the call for action. Inadequate information is a reality that has to be faced throughout the world, but particularly in developing countries. The quality, quantity and scope of health-related data are the elements of this inadequacy and may be discussed in terms of four factors: the indicators, the data sources, the measurement techniques, and the conceptual framework. In this paper, the neglect of maternal health and the lack of information are shown to be self-reinforcing and constitute a measurement trap sprung by these four factors. Dismantling this trap has revealed a weak conceptual framework to lie at the very centre. Maternal health has tended to be conceptualized as a discrete, negative state, characterized by physical rather than social or mental manifestations, and by a narrow time-perspective focusing on pregnancy, delivery and the puerperium. The need to broaden this perspective and to develop equally broad operational definitions represent important steps forward that must be taken.",Social science & medicine (1982),1992 Oct,England,1992,90
1401234,Utilization of pediatric health services in Jerusalem.,"The high rate of utilization of health services and rising health care costs in Israel, have prompted the need for reform of the health care system. Preventive and curative aspects of mother and child health care in Israel have traditionally been addressed by independent but parallel health systems. Prior to the pilot integration of these services, current patterns of utilization of health services by children during their first year of life, and determinants of use, were analyzed. Mothers of 651 children from five neighborhoods, representing the middle-low, middle and upper social class Jewish population were interviewed. Overall, a high degree of compliance with recommended visits to the preventive family health centers was found, with an average of eleven visits to the public health physician or nurse. The children also made an average of 12 visits to curative practitioners. Combined with all other health care consultations, these children averaged 26 health care visits in the first year of life. This pattern of frequent visitations, and its determinants, is discussed in context of the current framework of parallel health care systems. Multivariate analysis revealed that the birth order of the child was the key factor in determining the number of preventive visits, while the mother's perception of her child's health status held the major influence on the number of curative visits. No association between utilization of services and social class was discovered. Comparison of utilization patterns arising from this study with subsequent investigation of the planned integrated services allows for the assessment of the effects of a major change in the structure and delivery of pediatric services.",Journal of community health,1992 Oct,Netherlands,1992,90

Our empirical results suggest that interstate differences in the returns to skills are a major determinant of both the size and skill composition of internal migration flows. Persons whose skills are most mismatched with the reward structure offered by their current state of residence are the persons most likely to leave that state, and these persons tend to relocate in states which offer higher rewards for their particular skills.""",Journal of urban economics,1992 Sep,United States,1992,90

METHODS: Saliva specimens from a random sample of 734 7-year-old schoolchildren in Edinburgh, Scotland, were analyzed for cotinine. Their parents completed a questionnaire covering smoking habits and conditions in the home. RESULTS: A number of independent predictors of cotinine were identified in addition to the main one of smoking by household members. These predictors included home ownership, social class, day of the week, season of the year, number of parents present, crowding in the home, the number of children in the household, and sex. Cotinine was higher in children from less advantaged backgrounds, during winter, on Mondays, in girls, and when fewer other children were present. The effects were similar between children from nonsmoking and smoking homes. CONCLUSIONS: Questionnaire measures of parental smoking are insufficient to fully characterize young children's exposure to passive smoking. Because socioeconomic variables contribute to measured exposure, passive-smoking studies that treat class as a confounder and control for it may be overcontrolling.",American journal of public health,1992 Sep,United States,1992,90

A cross-sectional survey was done among 1,113 randomly selected urban women aged 20-49. Social roles did not emerge as a major risk factor for exercise participation. Statistical modelling indicated that whether women exercise was only related to role overload in the presence of the non-role-related determinants. For women exercising, parenthood as well as role overload were related to the amount of exercise in the presence of the non-role-related determinants. These findings have important implications for exercise promotion for women.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1992 Sep-Oct,Switzerland,1992,90

Regressions of each health-risk behavior (dependent variable) were performed on the predicted correlates. Although knowledge was not associated with participation in physical activity or smoking, the study found that students who knew more about the harmful effects of alcohol drank less, and those with greater knowledge of health risks practiced fewer risky behaviors. Students living independently were more likely to smoke, and those living in residence halls were less like to do so. Drinking, however, was more common among students living in residence halls or independently than among those living at home. Hall residents engaged in more group physical activity than other students did, but their physical activity was unrelated to health-risk behaviors. Stress was associated with smoking but not with other health practices. The findings suggest that smoking may be less influenced by health knowledge and more associated than drinking is with a response to stress. Drinking appears to be a social activity associated with living among peers and is potentially modifiable by increased knowledge about the effects of alcohol on health.",Journal of American college health : J of ACH,1992 Sep,United States,1992,90

About 2/3 of the deaths were in infants, and 90% in first 3 years. Most of the deaths (94%) occurred in the village itself, 58.4% did not seek any medical care during the terminal illness, 80-90% did not receive even a single dose of BCG, DPT or O.P.V., and 36.7% died in the first attack of illness.

1444596,Impact of environmental cadmium pollution on cadmium exposure and body burden.,"The body burden of cadmium, as estimated from 24-h urine cadmium levels, was determined in 1,523 subjects who were not occupationally exposed and who lived in five areas of Belgium. Urinary cadmium levels differed significantly with place of residence. These differences persisted after standardization for the other significant determinants (i.e., age, body mass index, smoking habits, social class, alcohol consumption, and menopause). The highest 24-h urine cadmium levels were found in subjects who lived in areas that contained cadmium-polluted soils. The body burden overload has been attributed mainly to the consumption of locally grown vegetables and the use of contaminated well water for cooking and drinking. Blood cadmium levels were also dependent on place of residence. However, the geographical differences in blood cadmium did not parallel those of urine cadmium. Blood cadmium is more influenced by recent exposure; therefore, this latter observation might reflect the recent implementation of preventive measures in some areas.",Archives of environmental health,1992 Sep-Oct,United States,1992,90
1442721,Maternal nutrition and spontaneous preterm birth.,"Previous studies suggesting that maternal undernutrition increases the risk of preterm birth have suffered from several methodological shortcomings, including use of total gestational weight gain rather than net rate of gain in maternal tissue, inclusion of induced preterm deliveries, and error-prone gestational age measurements based solely on menstrual dates. The authors have attempted to overcome these shortcomings by investigating the potential etiologic roles of prepregnancy body mass index, net rate of maternal weight gain, height, and a number of other potential biological and sociodemographic determinants of spontaneous (i.e., noninduced) preterm birth in a cohort of 13,102 women with early ultrasound-confirmed gestational age who delivered at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, between January 1, 1980 and March 31, 1989. Total weight gain, but not body mass index, was highly significantly associated with spontaneous preterm birth, averaging 14.6, 12.5, 9.9, and 9.1 kg, in women delivering at 37 or more, less than 37, less than 34, and less than 32 completed weeks, respectively. Although the relation persisted when weight gain was expressed as an overall rate, it disappeared when the analysis was based on net rate; mean net rates of gain were 0.28, 0.29, 0.27, and 0.27 kg/week, respectively. On the basis of multiple logistic regression analyses, significant determinants of birth at less than 37 weeks included maternal short stature; noncompletion of high school; unmarried status; smoking; diabetes; urinary tract infection within 2 weeks of delivery; prepregnancy hypertension; severe pregnancy-induced hypertension; and previous history of preterm delivery, low birth weight, or neonatal death. Most of these factors retained their significance for birth at less than 34 and less than 32 weeks. In fact, the effect of low maternal education was even stronger at these more severe ""levels"" of preterm birth. The authors conclude that prepregnancy weight-for-height and gestational weight gain are not important determinants of spontaneous preterm birth and that some previous studies have mistaken an effect of shortened gestation for its cause. Other biologic and social determinants, however, indicate priorities for future research and intervention.",American journal of epidemiology,1992 Sep 1,United States,1992,90

Drawing on an attributional model of expressed emotion it was predicted that high EE relatives would have less knowledge of the illness and would attribute negative symptoms to the personality, rather than the illness, of the sufferer. Thirty-one caregivers of schizophrenic patients were interviewed. Results indicated that EE status was related to knowledge, coping and causal attributions of negative symptoms. Low EEs, as compared with High EEs, tended to have more knowledge of the illness and to cope better with the patient, and were less likely to attribute the cause of negative symptoms to the sufferer's personality. Support was therefore obtained for the utility of an attributional model in attempting to understand the determinants of levels of EE.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,1992 Sep,England,1992,90

The first examines optimal measurement strategies for assessing individual differences in cardiovascular reactivity, and the second investigates the effects of the social environment as a moderator of cardiovascular responding during psychological challenge. Models and evidence from related behavioral sciences (Psychometric Theory and Social Psychology, respectively) have provided useful guidance for this work. Relevant background and current data examining the measurement and determinants of cardiovascular reactivity are reviewed, with a focus on these multidisciplinary contributions. The implications of the work for the construct of reactivity and its possible role as a marker of disease risk are discussed.",Psychophysiology,1992 Sep,United States,1992,90

The largest effect on labor supply is caused by changes in pensionable age. Giving a lump-sum pension to part-time workers seems an interesting policy to withdraw individuals from the labor market at a relatively low cost. Introducing flexible retirement also is beneficial for the government budget and has, especially for women, a relatively large positive effect on labor supply.""",Journal of population economics,1992 Aug,Germany,1992,90
1636832,Lower respiratory illness in infants and low socioeconomic status.,"OBJECTIVES: Infants from families of low socioeconomic status are said to suffer higher rates of lower respiratory illness, but this assertion has not been carefully examined. METHODS: We studied the frequency and determinants of lower respiratory illness in infants of different socioeconomic status (n = 393) by analyzing data from a community-based cohort study of respiratory illness during the first year of life in central North Carolina. RESULTS: The incidence of lower respiratory illness was 1.41 in the low socioeconomic group, 1.26 in the middle group, and 0.67 in the high group. The prevalence of persistent respiratory symptoms was 39% in infants in the low socioeconomic group, 24% in infants in the middle group, and 14% in infants in the high group. The odds of persistent respiratory symptoms in infants of low and middle socioeconomic status were reduced after controlling for environmental risk factors for lower respiratory illness. Enrollment in day care was associated with an increased risk of persistent symptoms among infants of high but not low socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Infants of low socioeconomic status are at increased risk of persistent respiratory symptoms. This risk can be partly attributed to environmental exposures, most of which could be changed.",American journal of public health,1992 Aug,United States,1992,90
1525438,An evaluation of hospital-based specialized staffed housing for people with seriously challenging behaviours.,"Resident and staff activity was observed in two hospital-based staffed houses for adults with severe or profound mental handicap, and seriously challenging behaviours. The results indicated that: (1) staffing resources were inefficiently deployed, leading to low levels of support being provided to service users; (2) staff attention was inequitably distributed across users, individuals showing the highest levels of seriously challenging behaviours received disproportionately more staff attention; (3) users spent little of the time they were observed engaged in constructive activities. Comparisons with data collected previously on four of the users in institutional settings indicated that: (4) no overall changes occurred in either user participation in constructive activities or (5) duration of challenging behaviours; and (6) overall, more staff contact was provided in the specialized housing projects compared to previous institutional settings. The results are discussed in terms of the determinants of quality in residential provision for people with seriously challenging behaviour.",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,1992 Aug,England,1992,90
1519090,Changes in disease patterns and related social trends.,"Both the material and non-material aspects of social life are viewed as determinants of major transformations in the patterns of fatal disease and injury. A 'worst case' scenario for the burden of fatal disease is taken as a poor agrarian society precariously dependent on starchy staples and a narrow range of other foods. In such a society life expectancy may be as low as 20. However in many 'pre-modern' societies the regime of roughly matching fertility and mortality levels was set at a 'submaximal' level, with completed fertility rates moderated by marriage conventions. The relative importance of the factors contributing to the historical decline in fatal infection continues to be debated. Evidence on the central role of maternal literacy in the recent decline in Third World mortality suggests the importance of changes in the body of civil society as well as the activities of professionals and public agencies. The decline in fatal infections has been offset to varying extents by an increase in non-communicable disease (NCD): the Mediterranean and East Asia having smaller epidemics of NCDs and Eastern Europe having sustained rises of NCDs. Most industrialised countries have experienced declines in overall NCD mortality in the last 2 decades. Both the fall in fatal infection and the rise and early fall of NCDs can usefully be viewed against the baseline of hunter gatherer cultures. When this is done, the relationship between economic development and disease is seen to be complex. Much 'progress' has been achieved by countering (and then doing better than countering) the adverse effects of earlier developments. Although most members of the generation now alive have experienced marked health benefits from economic and technical advance, it is unclear whether these gains can be both sustained and generalised. It is possible that adverse lagged effects of current industrial (and military) activities will disrupt the habitat of future generations of our species through processes such as stratospheric ozone depletion, global warming and others as yet unpredicted. Modern hygienists have dealt successively with influences on survival mainly operating in early life (infection) and influences operating across the lifespan (determinants of chronic disease). They have now to deal with even greater separations in time and space between potential health determinants and their ultimate effects. To a high level of scientific uncertainty is added the ethical problem of equity between generations.",Social science & medicine (1982),1992 Aug,England,1992,90
1519079,Determinants and dimensions involved in self-evaluation of health.,"This study explores mechanisms involved in self-evaluation of health by making specifications of linkages among various dimensions of health status, physiological measures, social and behavioral factors or characteristics. The proposed structural equation model is tested by using data from a comprehensive health survey of the population of Finnmark county, Norway (1987-88), including 4549 men and 4360 women aged 30-62. The findings suggest the burden of physical distress and reliance on permanent disablement benefit to play the key role in reducing self-evaluated health. The seemingly strong labelling impact of permanent work disability, contrasted the modest effect of diagnoses of chronic disease. Moreover, the impact of both these key factors and other important determinants is strongly socially patterned. Positive health related life-style appeared to have a positive impact on self-rated health, while preoccupation with health had a negative impact. This finding adds some credibility to the suggestion that the growing occupation and fascination with health have some negative health outcomes.",Social science & medicine (1982),1992 Aug,England,1992,90

The objective of this study is to evaluate the frequency of this habit and its possible determinants in the adult population of the city of Pelotas, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, using a simplified methodology. With the use of a cross-sectional design, a probabilistic sample of 1,401 adults was studied; the no-response rate was 11%. Of those interviewed, 54% had never smoked, 14% were former smokers, and 33% were smokers at the time of the study; 16% smoked 20 or more cigarettes daily. Smoking was more frequent in men (44%) than in women (23%). In relation to educational level, the highest prevalence of smoking was among individuals with five to eight years of schooling (39.7%). The study showed that it is possible with a limited investment of time and resources, to evaluate the frequency of smoking in a representative sample of a medium-sized city, yielding data that will be highly useful for preventive campaigns.",Boletin de la Oficina Sanitaria Panamericana.

1500290,Determinants of need and unmet need among cancer patients residing at home.,"De-hospitalization of cancer treatment, particularly for those with advanced disease, can complicate adjustment and strain the capacity of caregiver networks to meet patients' daily needs. Outpatient staff should be able to recognize patients who need help to meet their daily needs as well as those who are not getting enough help. This study describes the physiological and social determinants of need and unmet need for assistance among 629 cancer patients with advanced disease initiating a course of outpatient chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Areas of needs examined through telephone interviews with participating patients were: personal care, instrumental tasks (housework, shopping, and cooking), and transportation. Physiological factors (metastases, disease stage, and functional status) were associated with need for assistance in all three areas. Also, older age (over 65) and low income predicted need for help with personal care, and women were more likely than men to report illness-related need for assistance with instrumental tasks and transportation. Unmet need was primarily associated with patients' social support system (e.g., children living nearby and perceived resiliency of network helpers). These findings highlight the need for outpatient staff to evaluate patients' informal care resources as well as patients' symptoms and impairments in deciding who should be referred for home care services.",Health services research,1992 Aug,United States,1992,90

Cultural and behavioural factors influence community prevalence of sexually transmitted disease (STD), illegal abortion, puerperal sepsis and contraceptive usage--all of which influence risk of PID. The relative importance of these factors will vary by region. Individual risk factors for the ascent of a lower genital tract infection are still poorly understood but are thought to be behavioural and immunological. Prevention of PID must be undertaken at several levels. At primary level, it requires a reduction in community risk. At secondary level, individual risk can be modified by ensuring diagnosis and treatment of STD before damage of the upper genital tract occurs. More attention to cultural factors should increase the potential for prevention at both levels.",Annals of tropical medicine and parasitology,1992 Aug,England,1992,90
1380106,Hemoglobin-acetaldehyde adducts in human alcohol abusers.,"BACKGROUND: Previous observations have indicated that acetaldehyde can bind irreversibly to proteins in vitro, yielding immunogenic determinants, which can stimulate production of antibodies against the acetaldehyde adducts. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have developed sensitive two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for measurement of hemoglobin-acetaldehyde adducts. These adducts were measured from the red blood cells of 169 alcohol abusers, 66 social drinkers, 18 abstainers, and 73 hospitalized control patients. RESULTS: While the immunoreactive acetaldehyde adducts were found to be increased in 50% of the alcohol abusers (p less than 0.01), 24% of the social drinkers (p less than 0.05) also exceeded the reference interval obtained from the abstaining controls. Adducts were also increased in 17 (23%) hospitalized controls, seven of whom could retrospectively be verified as heavy drinkers. Upon abstinence from ethanol, the adducts decreased during a period of 1-3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The studies indicate that acetaldehyde adducts are frequently elevated in the erythrocytes of human alcohol consumers. Measurements of such adducts may prove to be valuable in the early identification of excessive alcohol consumption and of hazardous social drinking and in the comprehensive assessment and treatment of patients with alcohol-related diseases.",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,1992 Aug,United States,1992,90

Our regression results indicated that a 10 per cent increase in female literacy rate is associated with approximately one-year increase in female age at marriage. However, neither the increase in female literacy nor the changes in the sex ratio of the population could explain all the increase in female age at marriage during 1971-81.

12317659,Motivation and fertility control behaviour in Pakistan.,"Using data from the Population, Labor Force, and Migration (PLM) Survey of 1979-80, this paper examines the component of potential motivation for fertility limitation among Pakistani married women and then determines what factor are important in explaining the contraceptive use differentials among the potentially motivated subgroup of women. The analysis is conducted using logit regression models. The findings show that, among women wanting no additional children, a substantial proportion is reluctant to adopt fertility control behavior, confirming the existence of latent demand for contraception in all strata. A majority of those women report no exposure to the program or no contact with a family planning worker, and a large majority of those who have had exposure or have been contacted do not report contraceptive use, indicating a considerable shortfall of the program. Among the urban women wanting no more children, the important factors affecting contracepting use positively are education (both primary and secondary), household income, living in a nuclear family, exposure to the program, and contact with a family planning worker, for rural women, only nuclear family living and the program factors are significant in promoting contraceptive use. The suggestions likely to increase contraceptive prevalence are, first, to reach those women who have the potential motivation for contraception, and, second, to increase the quality and sources of the motivation efforts of the program to crystallize the latent demand among those who need it.",Pakistan development review,1992 Summer,Pakistan,1992,90

We have analysed the life histories of a sample of Italian women from different cohorts, collected on the occasion of the National Survey on Family Structures and Behaviours carried on by the National Institute of Statistics.... The effect of level of education is negative. That is, it increases the age of entry into marriage. However, the size of the effect is small and seems limited to the passage from youth to adulthood, because the longer time the woman spends in the educational system increases the age at which she feels herself ready to marry. As far as the timing of the first child, it is almost independent of educational attainment, once marital status is taken into account."" (SUMMARY IN FRE AND ITA)",Genus,1992 Jul-Dec,Germany,1992,90

1530097,Form and structure and their function in psychotherapy.,"Psychotherapy is a creative process with the same types of effects and determinants as other creative activities in fields such as literature, visual arts, and science. In all of these activities, a focus on form and structure serves to generate new and valuable resultants or creations. As shown in the example of the poet Richard Wilbur's creation of a poem, his focus on rhyme and other formal features generated a new and valuable emotional tension in the poem. In psychotherapy, the creation consists of new and valuable aspects or structural features of personality. This creative result in therapy is produced in part by therapists' focus on form in terms of sequences, style of verbal and non-verbal presentation, and the phases of encounter, growth, and separation. As shown in the psychotherapy session excerpted, the therapist's lack of attention to the critical theme initiated by the patient at the beginning of the session (encounter) as well as to the meanings of connections between sequences in the following interactions (growth) led to a non-creative or destructive suicidal threat at the end (separation). The overall creative result arises also from therapists' attention to patients' approaches to the overall structure of psychotherapy as a regularly occurring timed experience in which the therapist does not directly intervene in the patient's life. This structural organization provides a trial domain for the patient in which creative growth and personal welfare can be facilitated. Both patient and therapist need to focus on any attempts to undermine the structural organization and its meaning. Similarly, in creative activities in other fields, writers, artists, and scientists characteristically focus on form, in a detailed as well as general way, in order to facilitate both aesthetic and social growth and welfare.",American journal of psychotherapy,1992 Jul,United States,1992,90

Educational associations and work experiences were the most important determinants of postdoctoral career attainments. The quality of the doctoral program attended and predoctoral work experiences significantly influenced initial institutional quality, which in turn influenced current institutional quality. The current institutional quality, then, had direct effects on current attainments in the areas of professorial rank, publication productivity, and income. Graduate school quality was the most important factor in first institutional quality, as it tracked faculty into certain strata of the higher educational hierarchy. Consistent with the academic stratification system in higher education, those in high quality programs attained lower professorial ranks but higher publication productivity and higher recognition than those who gained employment in unranked schools.",Nursing research,1992 Jul-Aug,United States,1992,90
1390784,Changing patterns of adolescent sexual behavior: consequences for health and development.,"Sexuality is a fundamental quality of human life, important for health, happiness, individual development, and indeed for the preservation of the human race. During the dynamic period of adolescence in which the passage from childhood to maturity takes place, sexuality takes on new dimensions; feelings become more intense, relationships become more complex, and the consequences of sexual behavior are radically altered. This not only affects the behavior of young people but also of those who interact with them, their families and peers, and those who work in the health, education, youth, social welfare, and other sectors. In the contemporary world the conditions of life for many young people have also changed, and with it patterns of sexual behavior. In general, earlier puberty, later marriage, a decline in the family leading to less control and more autonomy, and intense exposure to sexual stimuli via the mass media and travel across cultural boundaries have made pre-marital adolescent sexual activity more common. This has added to traditional problems of early marriage, newer problems of early pregnancy, childbirth, and induced abortion outside of marriage, sexually transmitted diseases, and human immunodeficiency syndrome infection leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. But the work of the World Health Organization (WHO), along with many others in the field, strongly suggests that given appropriate information and services, trust and equity between the sexes, young people will behave responsibly and well. In this paper some of the findings from methods developed by WHO for research, training, advocacy, and evaluation, and findings in relation to patterns and determinants of sexual and reproductive health and development will be described, and future directions suggested.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1992 Jul,United States,1992,90

Each subject identified three best friends. Logistic and least-square regression analyses indicated that children's perceptions of friends' use, perceptions of family use, and actual use of classmates were better predictors of substance use than friends' actual use. The pattern of predictors suggested that peer behaviors and attitudes are more influential for children's socially censured behaviors such as using alcohol without parental permission than for more socially approved behaviors such as using alcohol with parental permission. The importance of perceived friends' use vs. friends' actual use supports Behavioral Intention Theory and Cognitive Developmental Theory, while the importance of classroom use supports Social Learning Theory or may reflect social and environmental conditions including neighborhood availability of drugs and neighborhood values regarding substance use.",Journal of youth and adolescence,1992 Jun,United States,1992,90

The current investigation sought to examine the relation between beliefs about chronic pain and adjustment in a group of chronic pain patients. Patients' belief in themselves as disabled was found to be inversely related to activity level for patients reporting low and medium levels of pain severity. This same belief correlated with professional services utilization and was negatively related to psychological functioning. Believing in a medical cure for pain was also positively related to professional services utilization. Finally, an expressed belief in the appropriateness of solicitous responses from family members was negatively related to psychological functioning for patients reporting relatively low levels of pain. Although these findings support the broad-based hypothesis that the illness-relevant beliefs of chronic pain patients are associated with their multidimensional pain adjustment, they emphasize the importance of beliefs concerning whether or not one is disabled by pain. The findings also highlight the fact that the belief/functioning relation is not always direct and can be moderated by perceived pain severity.",The Clinical journal of pain,1992 Jun,United States,1992,90

Ninety seven patients with complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin were administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory (WPSI), and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) both before and six to eight months after anterior temporal lobectomy. The data were subjected to a nonparametric rank sum technique (O'Brien's procedure) which combined the test scores to form a single outcome index (TOTAL PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOME) that was analysed by multiple regression procedures. Results indicated that the most powerful predictors of patients' overall postoperative psychosocial outcome were: 1) The adequacy of their preoperative psychosocial adjustment, and 2) A totally seizure-free outcome. Additional analyses were carried out separately on the MMPI, WPSI, and GHQ to determine whether findings varied as a function of the specific outcome measure.

Three groups were identified: Group 1 was sexually active and using contraception reliably, Group 2 was not using contraception reliably, and Group 3 had not been sexually active. Group 1 adolescents had higher scores on the vocabulary subtest of the WISC-R (F = 3.4, p less than .05) than did Group 2 adolescents, over and above the effect of socioeconomic status (SES). Group 1 subjects had higher scores on knowledge of sex and contraception than did Group 2 (F = 3.3, p less than .05). Group 1 had more internal locus of control (F = 7.0, p less than .005) than did Group 2 over and above the effect of SES. Mean scores for Group 3 adolescents were intermediate and not significantly different. The findings suggest that cognitive factors may influence contraceptive behavior in adolescent females.",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,1992 Jun,United States,1992,90
1611863,Social networks of residents in supportive housing.,One goal of supportive housing is to enlarge and improve the functioning of the social support networks of residents. The networks of a convenience sample of 42 residents were assessed using scales developed by Barrera. The size of the networks (11.5) was no larger than that reported for similar clients living in other types of community settings but the composition differed. Staff and co-residents appear to partially replace rather than add to family and friends. This is of concern because friends are uniquely important determinants of satisfaction. An association between perceived need for support and network size was also found. These findings suggest some positive influences but also raise questions about unintended negative consequences of living in artificially constructed social environments.,Community mental health journal,1992 Jun,United States,1992,90
1607184,Patterns of demographic change in the Americas.,"Considerable scholarly debate has focused on the nature of demographic change in the Americas before and after 1492. Recent research on human skeletal samples and related archeological materials suggests that morbidity and mortality were increasing throughout much of the Western Hemisphere before 1492 in response to increased population density, increased sedentism, and changing subsistence. The evidence suggests that after 1492 population reduction was caused not by continental pandemics but by localized or regional epidemics augmented by social and economic disruption. The twentieth century has witnessed remarkable Native American population recovery, fueled both by improvements in health care and changing definitions of ""being Indian.""",Human biology,1992 Jun,United States,1992,90
1600823,Determinants of disciplinary practices in low-income black mothers.,"Disciplinary attitudes and practices of low-income black mothers were examined. Mothers were interviewed about their parenting attitudes and control practices, and their responses were coded in terms of the degree to which they took a parent-versus a child-oriented approach to discipline. Mothers in the sample varied widely in their attitudes toward physical punishment, and mothers who used power-assertive techniques were as likely to take the child's perspective and give input into the socialization process as those who did not. Factors associated with maternal disciplinary styles included: maternal education, father absence, maternal age, and self-reported religious beliefs. Findings are discussed in terms of the variability in disciplinary practices in this population, as well as the factors contributing to these individual differences.",Child development,1992 Jun,United States,1992,90
1529379,The effect of the social organization of work on the voluntary turnover rate of hospital nurses in the United States.,"In light of current concerns over nursing shortages and productivity, voluntary turnover among hospital nurses in the United States has assumed renewed importance as a managerial issue. This study examines the thesis that the social organization of work in hospitals is an important determinant of the voluntary turnover rate among registered nurses. This perspective differs from previous work in this area in that both turnover and its determinants are conceptualized at the organizational rather than individual level, thus opening the way for administrative intervention to reduce turnover. The conceptual model is tested using multiple regression techniques on a sample of 435 hospitals. Results suggest that organizational characteristics and environmental conditions are important contributors to turnover. Organizational characteristics are stronger predictors of turnover than are economic factors.",Social science & medicine (1982),1992 Jun,England,1992,90
1342501,[Gender and health in Brazil: considerations based on the National Household Sampling Survey].,"As in the principal industrial countries, Brazilian women have lived longer than men. However, paradoxically, women present higher morbidity indicators than men. Knowledge of the Brazilian pattern regarding this matter could be a useful contribution to an understanding of their determinants in our specific reality, as well as enabling us to foresee future trends that would make it possible to plan adjustment in the health system. A morbidity study based on data from the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD/IBGE), was undertaken in ten Brazilian states in 1986 with this in view. Coefficients of the prevalence of perceived morbidity, demand for and utilization of health services according to sex, standardized by age and using the direct method, were built up. As a measurement of the differentials, sex ratios were calculated. The excess of perceived morbidity in women was constant in all the regions. The sex differential in the utilization of health services showed regional variations, suggesting a relationship with the health services supply. Sex differentials were not observed in childhood; the highest values were found during the woman's reproductive period, decreasing sharply after 60 years of age. The pattern is very similar in all regions. In the present study, the findings could be partially explained by the methodology adopted, but they are similar to the findings reported in other countries. The intense transformations in the reproductive pattern and in the social status of Brazilian women probably have a considerable impact on the health status and on the recourse to health services, not as yet evaluated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Revista de saude publica,1992 Jun,Brazil,1992,90

The author notes that Italian society still largely conforms to traditional conjugal models and attitudes toward cohabitation and divorce. ""Women most exposed to the risk of marital disruption seem to be those who married very young, who have had no more than one child, who are better educated, who have full-time jobs and who reside in large towns in the north-west of Italy.

A critical analysis of this argument, however, reveals three related aspects: 1) A changed regenerative behaviour is often less the result of inefficient inter-family decisions; rather it results from an efficient reaction to changed economic and political conditions. 2) Optimal inter-family decisions can be prevented by imperfect capital markets and interventionism of the welfare state. 3) A receding rate of fertility leads probably not only to a more even inter- and intra-family distribution of income, but also influences the inter-generational distribution in a positive way.""

1632854,"Low serum cholesterol, cancer and other noncardiovascular disorders.","There has been much concern and discussion whether reduction of serum cholesterol by diet or drugs, while preventing coronary heart disease, might cause an increase in the risk of dying from noncardiovascular disorders, in particular cancer. A review of the evidence from ecological, cross-cultural comparisons, prospective epidemiological cohort studies and intervention trials provides no indication for a cause-and-effect association between low serum cholesterol or serum cholesterol lowering and the risk of cancer, except possibly at very low levels. An inverse relationship between noncardiovascular-noncancer mortality and serum cholesterol level does exist but the link is unlikely to be causal; for better understanding, there is a need for studying the biological, lifestyle and social correlates of this association. Continuing observations should pay attention to the accuracy of information on specific causes of noncardiovascular deaths, especially mortality not due to disease. Further research needs to include investigations into the determinants of low serum cholesterol levels and their possible influence on biological functions. It is concluded that the current recommendations for coronary heart disease prevention, aimed at lowering elevated serum cholesterol levels in individuals (the 'high-risk strategy') and in populations at high risk (the 'population strategy') require no basic modification in the light of present knowledge on the relationships between cholesterol and noncardiovascular disease mortality.",Atherosclerosis,1992 May,Ireland,1992,90
1628712,"A comparison of the fertility of Dominican, Puerto Rican and mainland Puerto Rican adolescents.","Data from three fertility surveys are used to examined the probabilities and determinants of adolescent births among Dominican and Puerto Rican women. Young women in the Dominican Republic are the most likely to have had a child by each year of age from 14 through 24, followed by young women on the Island of Puerto Rico; the probability of an early birth is lowest for Puerto Rican women on the U.S. mainland. Eighteen percent of Dominican women have had a child before their 18th birthday, compared with 13% of women living in Puerto Rico, and 10% of Puerto Rican women in metropolitan New York. The cumulative probabilities that Puerto Rican women will have borne a child before their 20th birthday are almost identical, whether the women live on the island or the U.S. mainland, but the difference between Puerto Rican and Dominican women widens. The order is reversed, however, in the analysis of premarital births: The probability of a premarital birth during adolescence is highest for Puerto Rican women in New York, and lowest for Dominican women. In a separate logistic regression analysis, education and age at first sexual intercourse are shown to be important determinants of adolescent fertility in all three populations.",Family planning perspectives,1992 May-Jun,United States,1992,90

High-frequency poker machine players.,"Persistent gambling was studied as a function of the reinforcement of arousal and winning during normal poker machine playing sessions. Play rate, heart rate, winnings, subjective excitement and expectations of winning were recorded for five male and five female high-frequency players. Autoregressive regression analysis indicated that wins affect play rate for up to three minutes, while effects of the other variables were inconsistent. Markov chain analysis confirmed that wins smaller than 50 credits tend to elevate play rate, while larger wins cause a breakdown in the otherwise very regular rate of play. Results are discussed in relation to the development of impaired control of gambling behaviour.","British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)",1992 May,England,1992,90
1607053,Living and dying in the U.S.A.: sociodemographic determinants of death among blacks and whites.,"This paper examines the demographic and social factors associated with differences in length of life by race. The results demonstrate that sociodemographic factors--age, sex, marital status, family size, and income--profoundly affect black and white mortality. Indeed, the racial gap in overall mortality could close completely with increased standards of living and improved lifestyles. Moreover, examining cause-specific mortality while adjusting for social factors shows that compared to whites, blacks have a lower mortality risk from respiratory diseases, accidents, and suicide; the same risk from circulatory diseases and cancer; and higher risks from infectious diseases, homicide, and diabetes. These results underscore the importance of examining social characteristics to understand more clearly the race differences in overall and cause-specific mortality.",Demography,1992 May,United States,1992,90

Musicians were designated as ""high-anxious"" if they reported at least one episode of performance-related tremor and as ""low-anxious"" if they never had experienced tremor while performing in public. All musicians performed privately and publicly while measurements of subjective, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular functions were made. Ratings of effort and distress were made prior to performance. Heart rate was monitored telemetrically before, during and after performance. Urinary epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol were sampled after public and private performance, respectively. Situational factors influenced most measures. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, heart rate and ratings of distress but not effort increased from private to public performance. Heart rate was higher in high- than in low-anxious musicians during public performance but similar during private performance. The increase in neuroendocrine activation from private to public performance was similar in the high- and low-anxious groups. It is concluded that heart rate is a sensitive measure of both situational and individual determinants of performance-related distress.",Biological psychology,1992 May,Netherlands,1992,90
1562983,A collaborative study of differences in the survival rates of black patients and white patients with cancer.,"In 1983, the National Cancer Institute began a social-epidemiologic study of possible behavioral and biologic determinants of black/white racial disparities in cancer survival. The design, methodology, underlying hypotheses, and patient accrual of this study are discussed. Survival differences in four organ sites are investigated: cancers of the uterine corpus, breast, bladder, and colon. The first three sites were chosen because of significant observed black/white differentials in survival. Although racial disparities in survival from colon cancer are less prominent, this site was included because it is a leading cause of deaths attributable to cancer, because regional variations have been observed in black/white survival disparities, and because colon data permit cross-gender comparisons. Data collection centers for the study included the Georgia Center for Cancer Statistics, the Louisiana Tumor Registry, and the California Tumor Registry. Probability samples of patients newly diagnosed with these cancers were drawn from the areas served by these registries. Diagnostic years of eligibility were 1985 to 1986 for breast and colon cancer, and 1985 to 1987 for bladder and uterine corpus cancer.

However, decisive issues of quality, course and determinants cannot be answered sufficiently due to shortcomings of research (e.g. lack of representative samples and adequate measures, reliance on cross-sectional study designs). Grief reactions and their determinants are differentiated in relation to depressiveness and anxiety in 86 patients from a longitudinal study, employing the Perinatal Grief Scale (Thoedter et al. 1988) and standardized symptom checklists. For the majority of the women, around the 10th week of gestation, the embryo is psychologically represented in fantasies, dreams and concrete arrangements in reality. Immediately after the abortion, these women react with painful feelings of ""active grief"" and ""despair"". Additional stresses in the pregnancy and lack of social support predict ""self-reproachful coping"". Women with recurrent abortions who have no children show depressive reactions. Retrospectively, these also present more anxiety and depressive moods during pregnancy. Results support reliability and validity of the grief scale. Implications for counselling and psychotherapy of women after a spontaneous abortion are discussed with respect to these risk constellations.","Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie",1992 May,Germany,1992,90

The main occupational variables were employment status, reasons for not working, and satisfaction with work. Sex and age were controlled in all comparisons. Workers were clearly healthier than nonworkers with respect to general, physical and emotional health, and people who had given up work were less healthy than those still working, whether they had stopped for health reasons, only because of their age, or only for extrinsic reasons (retrenchment or dismissal). Workers who expressed satisfaction with their work were healthier than others, the odds ratio in favour of good general health being 2.4 at 50-64 and 2.5 at greater than or equal to 65 years of age. The associations between job satisfaction and health remained apparent when education and origin were controlled. Multivariate analyses suggested that the associations were not spurious ones attributable to proneness to report both dissatisfaction and ill-health. Job dissatisfaction was not significantly associated with angina pectoris, possible myocardial infarction, or hypertension. Taken at their face value, the findings support the impact of job satisfaction or its determinants on the health of middle-aged and elderly men and women. The associations will be re-appraised in the longitudinal analysis of the study data.",Social science & medicine (1982),1992 Apr,England,1992,90

Future child-bearing intentions are strongly related to current parity level regardless of marital status, race/ethnicity or economic status. Psychological motivating factors predict child-bearing intentions of nulliparous women, but not those of parous women. Multivariate analyses showed that motivation for parenthood and life circumstances combined predicted women's child-bearing intentions 88.6% of the time for nulliparous women, but 73.7% for parous women. These findings suggest that, in a low-income population, the onset of parenthood reduces the relationship between specific motivations for child-bearing and actual child-bearing intentions, and diminishes the ability to predict child-bearing intentions based on both attitudinal and social/structural factors.",Journal of biosocial science,1992 Apr,England,1992,90

1506998,Preventing relapse in the treatment of nicotine addiction: current issues and future directions.,"Although smoking-cessation rates have continued to increase, the vast majority of smokers who quit eventually relapse. Between 1974 and 1985, over 1.3 million smokers quit during each of those years. However, 75% to 80% of those individuals resumed smoking within six months. This article describes the dynamic phenomenon of smoking relapse within the context of cyclical episodes of smoking and quitting during an individual's lifetime. Theories of the determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed and methods designed to prevent relapse are described. Smoking relapse is discussed in terms of three aspects of tobacco addiction: (1) biological-addiction mechanisms, (2) conditioning processes, and (3) cognitive-social learning factors. The major determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed, including nicotine withdrawal, stress, weight gain, social influences, conditioning factors, causal attributions, and environmental variables. A transtheoretical-developmental model is explored in the longitudinal investigation of the natural history of slips (lapses) and relapse episodes. Relapse prevention interventions are described that emphasize self-awareness, self-regulation, self-efficacy, affect regulation, social support, and lifestyle balance. Recent developments in pharmacological adjuncts to treatment are also examined. It is concluded that innovative relapse prevention methods need to be designed for hard-core smokers with histories of cessation failures, substance abuse and/or psychiatric impairment. These and other recommendations for future research on smoking relapse and relapse prevention are discussed.",Journal of psychoactive drugs,1992 Apr-Jun,United States,1992,90

1347337,Risk of Kaposi's sarcoma and sexual practices associated with faecal contact in homosexual or bisexual men with AIDS.,"The causal agent of Kaposi's sarcoma is unknown. That the disorder is ten times more common in homosexual or bisexual men with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) than in other human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission groups suggests that a certain aspect of their behaviour exposes them to the agent or facilitates its spread. We therefore assessed social and demographic characteristics, including sexual behaviour, of 65 homosexual or bisexual men with AIDS from London. Sexual practices in which there was contact with partner's faeces before AIDS developed were the main determinants of Kaposi's sarcoma risk. Risk increased with frequency of insertive ""rimming"" (oral-anal contact): Kaposi's sarcoma developed in 18% of the men with AIDS who reported never having practised insertive rimming compared with 50% who practised it less than once a month, 73% between once a week and once a month, and 75% or more once a week (two-sided exact p-value for trend less than 0.001). 45 men had been interviewed about their sexual practices before AIDS developed, and 20 were interviewed at the time the syndrome developed. The findings were similar and statistically significant when each group was analysed separately. The men with Kaposi's sarcoma also tended to be more sexually active and were more likely to engage in other sexual activities that entailed contact with faeces than were the men who had other features of AIDS only. Other behaviours and exposures, including the use of ""poppers"" (nitrite inhalants), were not related to Kaposi's sarcoma risk, after taking into account whether the subjects had practised insertive rimming. The data suggest that faecal-oral contact is the main route of transmission of the agent of Kaposi's sarcoma in homosexual or bisexual men with AIDS.","Lancet (London, England)",1992 Mar 14,England,1992,90

From the National Seroepidemiology Survey, 5,232 blood samples of children between 12 and 59 months of age, were analyzed, their blood samples were considered positive when the antibody titers were greater or equal to 1:4, tested by hemagglutination inhibition using sensitized erythrocytes. The National seroprevalence was 76.2 per cent. By age group, an increment in positive level was observed age increased. The seroprevalence was 56 per cent in children of 12 to 24 month and 82 per cent for children 48 to 59 month of age.

1619258,Predicting continued use of marijuana among adolescents: the relative influence of drug-specific and social context factors.,"Most research on the determinants of adolescent drug use has focused on predictors of either initiation or current use. Little attention has been given to the determinants of continued use of drugs after initiation, even though some researchers have found that the consequences of continued use are more serious than those associated with experimental or occasional use. In this study, a longitudinal sample of 456 secondary and high school students who had already tried marijuana was used to examine the determinants of continued use of marijuana. Nearly 38 percent of those who had tried marijuana continued using, according to the definition operationalized in this study. Potential predictor measures were grouped in a drug-specific domain and a social context domain, and their effects on continued use, controlling for background characteristics, were examined in logistic regression models. Results showed that only the drug-specific domain had a statistically significant effect on the likelihood of continued use. Students who felt that the adverse physical and psychological effects of marijuana were not very important reasons for discontinuing use and those who had gotten stoned during their experimental stage of use were the most likely to continue use after initiation. The results suggest that the perceived physical and psychological effects of the drug are more important determinants of continued use than are social factors or benefits related to use. Any relationships between social factors and continued use are mediated by the perceived effects and risks of the drug.",Journal of health and social behavior,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90

1574737,"HIV in the U.K.: problems of prevalence, sociological response and health education.","It is argued that the prevalence of AIDS is substantially under-represented in existing national AIDS data. Thus although official statistics demonstrate significant recent shifts in transmission routes for HIV, health educators are faced with a problem because it is difficult to develop preventive strategies against a syndrome whose prevalence can only be estimated. Problems of the true extent of the prevalence of HIV are compounded when there is a lack of knowledge about the specifics of heterosexual behaviour. It is unwise to assume that the protective strategies developed by gay men in the face of HIV are routinely available for adoption by heterosexuals, who are characterised by social divisions of age, gender and relative amounts of social power. These concerns represent a problem for health educators. To date, sociological work may not have made the most effective contribution in its support of intervention strategies against HIV/AIDS. Examination of the empirical literature on lay concepts of health and illness reveals a pessimistic stance on the part of some researchers about the ability of individuals to modify behaviour. More positive readings of their own data are possible. The traditional concerns to emphasise the socio-economic determinants of health and behaviour, now also shared by some health educators, should not obscure a concern for the fate of individuals. The most effective contribution that health promotion may be able to make to the control of HIV in the heterosexual population is to assist in the development of strategies of empowerment and 'horizontal intervention'.",Social science & medicine (1982),1992 Mar,England,1992,90

After medication, both ADHD groups had a significant decrease in inattention, whereas impulsivity remained unchanged. Activity level decreased only in the nonaggressive ADHD group. Unmedicated normal controls showed no change on any measure. These results support the hypothesis that aggressive and nonaggressive ADHD children have somewhat different underlying determinants for some of their symptoms. In addition, they suggest that inattention, impulsivity, and overactivity may be mediated by partially distinct neural mechanisms.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90

They may be interpreted as entering into a complex approach-avoidance conflict where the net approach tendency determines overall alcohol consumption. Personality characteristics and presumably their biological correlates, as well as set and setting, or attitudes, beliefs and environmental influences contribute to the approach-avoidance conflict that determines abstinence or varying amounts of alcohol consumption.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90
1558711,Gender influences on age cognitions and preferences: sociocultural or sociobiological?,"The present article reviews research concerned with gender effects on cognitions and evaluations of people varying in age. Sontag's (1979) article on the double standard of aging--the purportedly more negative consequences of aging in women in contrast to men--serves as a point of departure for the review. Research using attitude-scale, semantic differential, and person-perception methodology points to sex-of-target, sex-of-subject, and target-subject interaction effects in response to a diversity of age-relevant stimuli. Though the reported studies are not completely consistent, there is much suggestive evidence that age is a more salient dimension for men than for women when judging others. Furthermore, men exhibit a stronger youth bias. The overall evidence is consistent with an evolutionary hypothesis, but further research that focuses on the proximal determinants of the observed effects is urged.",Psychology and aging,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90
1558698,Framing the construct of life satisfaction in terms of older adults' personal goals.,"Older adults' life satisfaction can be better understood in light of their personal goals. This study of 179 elders examined (a) how goals correlate with satisfaction, (b) whether elders maintain satisfaction by accommodating goals to past losses, and (c) how correlations between satisfaction and key predictors differ among groups with different goals. Satisfaction was related positively to social maintenance and energetic life-style goals and negatively to concerns for improvement, disengagement, stability, and reduced activity. Past losses were correlated with current goals but not with satisfaction, consistent with the notion of accommodation. A cluster analysis identified 5 patterns of goals: high demand, age prescribed, self-focused, socially engaged, and low demand. Correlations between satisfaction and other predictors differed by cluster, suggesting that the determinants of elders' satisfaction depend on personal goals.",Psychology and aging,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90
1558650,Determinants of breastfeeding in a rural WIC population.,"The purpose of the current research was to identify demographic and psychosocial factors important in the decision to breastfeed among a sample of WIC participants in a rural area. One hundred and ninety-eight women completed both a prenatal interview during their third trimester of pregnancy and a second interview within one to three weeks postpartum. Twenty-seven percent of these WIC participants initiated breastfeeding. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that prenatal behavioral beliefs about the consequences of breastfeeding and formula feeding were the strongest predictors of breastfeeding initiation. The results suggest that education to improve the current low rates of breastfeeding among WIC participants should emphasize that formula feeding is neither more convenient nor easier than breastfeeding, and that breastfeeding need not limit mothers in public or social settings.",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90

All patients had diabetes for longer than two years and a daily insulin dose greater than 0.5 IU/kg body weight. Low body mass index, high social class, high number of daily eating occasions, high day-to-day variation in energy intake, high number of urine tests and a long interval between insulin injection and eating were associated with good metabolic control. Many of these determinants reflect also the general compliance with the diabetic regimen. The results stress the importance of good coordination between insulin injections and eating habits.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1992 Mar,Norway,1992,90
1423121,Learning to 'walk our talk': the implications of sociological theory for research methodologies in health promotion.,"In recent formulations of the concept of health promotion, such as Achieving Health for All and the Ottawa Charter, emphasis is clearly placed on comprehensivity and the integration of individual and social determinants of health, broadly defined. This paper is premised on the observation that despite evidence of a paradigm shift in the way we talk about health promotion at a conceptual level, we have yet to properly articulate a 'new' research methodology to accompany the 'new' health promotion. The paper has three main sections. First, some of the limitations and contradictions that separate the rhetoric of health promotion from its current operationalization in research practice are discussed. In asserting the inherent links between theory, methodology and method, the need for a new research paradigm is demonstrated. In the second section, seven key issues derived from the literature on sociological theory are identified and discussed in terms of their implications for choosing a new research methodology for health promotion. In the third section it is suggested that using these issue areas as a 'decision map' leads to the selection of a preferred strategy which brings together both interpretive and critical perspectives to bear on our understanding of social reality as it affects health. Elements of both of these approaches and the nature of their potential complimentarity are considered. Throughout these deliberations the reader is encouraged to consider the potentially conservative or activist orientations that alternate methodologies imply, and to critically evaluate how these mesh with the emerging rhetoric of fostering empowerment that is the cornerstone of the 'new' health promotion.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1992 Mar-Apr,Switzerland,1992,90
1374257,[Determinants of lead concentration in the umbilical cord blood of 9189 newborns of a birth cohort in the government district of Braunschweig].,"From September 1985 until August 1986 the possibility of lead concentration determination in umbilical cord blood was offered to all neonates in the district of Braunschweig by the Ministry of Social Affairs of Lower Saxony. A geometric mean concentration of 3.76 +/- 1.69 micrograms Pb/dl was found in 9189 neonates, being 64% of the total birth cohort. The median concentration was 3.59 micrograms/dl. 4.7% of the children showed concentrations of above 10 micrograms/dl. Lead concentrations of twins showed a strong linear correlation (r = + 0.94). They were higher than those of singleton births (p = 0.02). Lead concentrations in neonates were significantly associated with the age of the mother and with the birthweight of the newborn. Seasonal differentials were significant with higher values in summer (4.39 +/- 1.8 micrograms Pb/dl) compared to winter (3.25 +/- 1.5 micrograms/dl). Duration of daily participation in road traffic was independent of blood lead concentrations. Potential occupational lead exposure of a member of the household was also no significant risk factor for higher lead concentration in the newborn. Family homes constructed before 1955 and those with lead water pipes were associated with significant increases of lead concentrations in neonates. Neighborhood was also significantly associated, with higher values in those living by main roads. In the southern part of the district lead concentrations were about 10% higher than in the northern part. Concentrations in neonates coming from cities were the same as in those coming from rural areas. Newborns from old lead mining and processing areas in the Harz mountains, in particular those coming from Oker-Harlingerode, had low lead concentrations in umbilical cord blood.",Zentralblatt fur Hygiene und Umweltmedizin = International journal of hygiene and environmental medicine,1992 Mar,Germany,1992,90

Clinical characteristics and patients' disposition.,"The clinical characteristics of patients seen at the psychiatric emergency facilities in a Canadian city and the determinants of decisions regarding their treatment were investigated. A total of 544 patients who sought psychiatric emergency services from the three hospitals in Saskatoon during a three month period were studied. Cognitive disturbance, past psychiatric history, previous psychiatric hospitalization and diagnoses of substance use disorders, affective disorders, anxiety disorders and schizophrenic disorders were associated with psychiatric emergencies. Psychiatric diagnoses and availability of social support were significantly associated with disposition.

1348238,Quality of life of schizophrenic patients on medications and implications for new drug trials.,"The quality of life of schizophrenic patients participating in clinical trials of new neuroleptics is rarely systematically assessed. Factors that may have contributed to the neglect of such assessments include the difficulty of measuring changes affecting quality of life during short-term trials and the continued belief that schizophrenic patients' self-reports about inner states are unreliable. A model of determinants specifically related to the quality of life of schizophrenic patients in such trials would include symptoms, side effects of neuroleptics, and psychosocial performance. In view of the importance of assessing the quality of life of patients on medications, the author recommends that regulatory agencies require such assessments in clinical trials of new neuroleptics.",Hospital & community psychiatry,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90
10116946,"Residential attitudes and knowledge, use, and future use of home support agencies.","Critical review of the health and social service use literature reveals a need to elaborate on the dynamics of factors identified in the behavioral models applied to this field. In particular, research has tended to omit direct measures of attitudes and awareness of social services, including their interrelationships. This study examines determinants of knowledge, use, and future use of local home support agencies among a sample of community-dwelling elderly over the age of 74 living in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario. Measures of domestic self-reliance, independent living and perceptions of futurity are incorporated into the analysis. Logistic regression is used to test the models. The results show that attitudes regarding domestic self-reliance and independent living influence use of home support agencies largely through their impact on service awareness. Interestingly, these relationships are opposite to those hypothesized. Education is also found to be a predictor of knowledge of home support, and living arrangement, health status measures, and knowledge arise as important predictors of use and future use. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the underlying behavioral models, and for service providers and policymakers.",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90
1540736,Correlates of asthma morbidity in primary care.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the morbidity of patients diagnosed as asthmatic in general practice, to examine the determinants of this morbidity, and to derive a simple morbidity screening tool for use in primary care. DESIGN: Patient interviews, lung function measurements, and data extraction from general practice case notes. SUBJECTS: 300 asthmatic patients aged 5 to 65 years randomly selected from the repeat prescribing registers of three general practices in the Southampton area. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reported morbidity using a calculated index based on three questions (Are you in a wheezy or asthmatic condition at least once per week; Have you had time off work or school in the past year because of your asthma; Do you suffer from attacks of wheezing during the night?); mean forced expiratory volume in one second and mean peak expiratory flow (over a seven day period); diurnal variation in peak flow; and the relation of the morbidity index to lung function. RESULTS: Mean forced expiratory volume in one second was 67% predicted (SD 18.4), mean peak expiratory flow was 80% predicted (SD 18.9), and mean diurnal variation was 10% (SD 7.7). 76 subjects were classified as having low morbidity, 95 medium, and 125 high. The morbidity index was significantly associated with forced expiratory volume in one second, mean peak expiratory flow rate, and diurnal variation (p less than 0.05); it was not significantly associated with inhaler technique or use of prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: There was a large burden of persisting morbidity across all ages of patients diagnosed as asthmatic in the three well resourced practices studied. The use of the morbidity index may help to target the asthmatic patients needing more attention by concentrating on those reporting medium to high morbidity.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1992 Feb 8,England,1992,90

As predicted, future outlook had a powerful association with dyadic conflict. Other strong predictors of conflict for care receivers were current state of happiness and changes in the relationship over a 3-year period. For caregivers, conflict was associated with care receivers' lack of social participation with family and friends, and changes in dyadic relationship.",The Gerontologist,1992 Feb,United States,1992,90
1736023,Measuring physician mental workload: reliability and validity assessment of a brief instrument.,"This study examined the reliability and validity of a brief six-item instrument to measure the mental workload experienced by residents for specific patient visits to an ambulatory care clinic. Participating in the study were twenty-two residents in postgraduate years 1 through 3 who were working in the general outpatient clinic of an inner city, private, nonprofit community hospital. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the instrument was 0.80. Findings supported several theory-based hypotheses on determinants and performance consequences of mental workload. Mental workload was positively correlated with fatigue (r = 0.42, P = 0.03) and inversely correlated with residents' self-rated experience with patients' problems (r = -0.65, P less than 0.001). Residents' performance was measured through self-ratings and faculty physicians' ratings. Mental workload was inversely correlated with self-rated performance (r = -0.67, P less than 0.001). The correlation of mental workload with faculty physician ratings that reflected the technical dimension of patient care (physician examination, medications, and procedures) was r = -0.38 (P = 0.04). With mental workload squared, the correlation was r = -0.45 (P = 0.02) and the form of the relationship, consistent with the hypothesis, was a slightly downward sloping curve. Limitations of this research are discussed as well as suggestions for further research.",Medical care,1992 Feb,United States,1992,90
1558810,The educational antecedents of teen fatherhood.,"In attempting to identify the determinants of teen pregnancy, researchers have focused on risk factors for young women, largely ignoring teen fathers. This study examines the educational antecedents of teen fatherhood using the 1958 National Child Development Study. Results suggest that those less than 20 years old at onset of fatherhood are much more likely than those who had not fathered a child by age 23 to have experienced academic difficulties and that such difficulties antedate teen fatherhood by as much as a decade. Variables measuring parents' lack of interest in their sons' education were strongly associated with the risk of teen fatherhood as were teachers' negative assessment of boys' academic ability, and the boys' own desire to terminate education as early as possible. Social class was modestly important in explaining differences in educational experiences for teen fathers and non-fathers.",The British journal of educational psychology,1992 Feb,England,1992,90
1556279,Jamaican and American adult perspectives on child psychopathology: further exploration of the threshold model.,"Although several factors determine whether children receive psychological intervention, cultural determinants may be particularly influential. Cultural factors may influence adults' levels of concern over child psychopathology. This possibility was explored by comparing adult attitudes in two socioculturally different societies. Jamaican and American parents, teachers, and clinicians (total N = 382) judged vignettes of two children, one with overcontrolled (e.g., fearfulness) and one with undercontrolled (e.g., fighting) problems. Regression analyses revealed that although years of education affected some adult ratings, culture had the most profound effect.",Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,1992 Feb,United States,1992,90
1550464,Major depression in a nonclinical sample. Demographic and clinical risk factors for first onset.,"The relatives, controls, and spouses of affectively ill probands underwent diagnostic examinations on two occasions, 6 years apart. Of 965 subjects who had never been mentally ill when first examined, 11.8% had development of at least one episode of major depression as defined by the Research Diagnostic Criteria during the ensuing 6 years. Subjects younger than 40 years were three times more likely than older subjects to develop depression and women were approximately twice as likely as men to develop depression regardless of age. Marital disruption, a farm setting, and high educational achievement substantially increased the risk of depression among female subjects. Of 214 never-depressed subjects with a history of nonaffective mental disorder, 62 (29.0%) developed major depression. Age and sex were again powerful determinants. The course of prospectively observed secondary depression was more severe than that for primary depression.",Archives of general psychiatry,1992 Feb,United States,1992,90

Notwithstanding the substantial public health threat posed by Borrelia burgdorferi infection, there is reason to suspect that the diagnosis of Lyme disease is made more frequently than justified. On the other hand, the current dissatisfaction with serologic assays for B. burgdorferi infection may lead some physicians to inappropriately abandon consideration of the diagnosis entirely. Either of these outcomes of the patient-physician encounter is to be regretted.

1473867,Time costs and informal social support as determinants of differences between black and white families in the provision of long-term care.,"This paper presents an economic model that predicts the observed racial difference in the mix of informal home and nursing home services used for long-term care by black versus white families. A cause of this difference in services used is a difference between black and white families in the relative prices they pay for particular services. Each group uses relatively more of the relatively less expensive (for that group) form of long-term care. The model indicates three specific hypotheses. The empirical analysis focuses on the Differential Opportunity Cost of Informal Caregiver Time hypothesis. Based on data from the 1982 and 1984 National Long-Term Care Surveys, two sets of results consistent with though not direct tests of this hypothesis are presented.","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",1992 Winter,United States,1992,90

1740227,Contextual determinants of auditory learning in bobwhite quail embryos and hatchlings.,"This study examined the ability of bobwhite quail embryos and hatchlings to learn an individual bobwhite maternal call. Results revealed that embryos could learn an individual maternal call and remember that call for at least 24 hr following exposure. In contrast, hatchlings reared socially in groups of same-age chicks during postnatal exposure to a maternal call did not demonstrate a preference for that familiar call at 24 hr following exposure. However, individual auditory recognition was exhibited by hatchlings reared in social isolation, suggesting that the perceptual and social complexity of the postnatal situation can disrupt or interfere with early auditory learning. Additional support for this view was the finding that embryos exposed to unusually early visual stimulation during prenatal exposure to a maternal call also failed to prefer that familiar maternal call in subsequent choice tests. The idea that early auditory learning capacity is determined more by context and experience rather than the organism's specific age or stage of development is discussed.",Developmental psychobiology,1992 Jan,United States,1992,90
1738853,Explanation of vigorous physical activity during two years using social learning variables.,"This study examined determinants of vigorous physical activity in a community sample of adults over a 24-month period. Social learning theory predicts that causal relationships between determinants and behavior are bidirectional, and both the behavior and its influences are subject to change over time. Thus, dynamic variables were expected to account for more variance in exercise change than static baseline variables. Over 86% of respondents to the baseline mail survey completed follow-up surveys 24 months later, yielding a final sample of 1739. Two physical activity change indices were constructed that were adjusted for baseline exercise and demographic variables, so that the effects of social learning variables could be isolated. In a two-step hierarchical regression analysis, physical activity measures were regressed onto 21 static and six dynamic independent variables. Baseline self-efficacy was a significant predictor of exercise change for both dependent variables. Four dynamic social learning variables were significantly associated with both exercise change measures: self-efficacy, perceived barriers, family support, and friend support. Social learning variables accounted for 12.3-15.5% of the variance in exercise change over 24 months. The results provide strong support for bidirectional causation between behavior and determinants and suggest hypotheses to be tested in experimental studies.",Social science & medicine (1982),1992 Jan,England,1992,90

However, a more specific analysis furnishes evidence that this decline has occurred at varying rates within different social groups, reflecting an increase in social inequalities. The analytical strategy used in this article leads to three basic conclusions: (1) the impact of the economic crisis on infant mortality is reflected not in a reversal of the declining trend but an increase in social inequalities; (2) certain variables universally accepted as determinants of infant mortality, such as mother's education, seem nonsignificant for some social sectors; and (3) certain biodemographic characteristics assumed to have a uniform mortality-related behavior vary among sectors, suggesting that even these constants are determined by social factors.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1992,United States,1992,90
1644512,"Freidson then and now: an ""internalist"" critique of Freidson's past and present views of the medical profession.","Freidson is a foremost analyst of the medical profession. Most recently Freidson attacks those who claim that medicine is declining in power. He insists that medicine has not lost the core elements that make it a powerful, indeed, the dominant, health profession. The author compares Freidson's early writings on medicine with his most recent ones, and shows that there are critical confusions in Freidson's central concepts of professional autonomy and dominance. This difficulty is illuminated by viewing dominance, autonomy, and subordination as on a continuum of control. Using this continuum, the author argues that Freidson implicitly admits what he set out to deny (that medicine has not declined in power) by shifting his focus from medical dominance to that of autonomy. Freidson also now rejects valid parts of his earlier work (that which emphasizes social structural determinants of behavior over socialization). In equating medicine in the United States with teaching in that country, Freidson's contention of ""little change in medical power"" meets its own refutation. Finally, despite his derogation of others, Freidson's lack of an adequate framework to explain the dynamics and not simply the structure of health care produces purely normative, utopian (and unhelpful) policy recommendations.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1992,United States,1992,90
1634431,On the relationship between self-injurious behavior and self-restraint.,"Many individuals who exhibit self-injurious behavior (SIB) also exhibit self-restraint. Three hypotheses about the determinants of self-restraint have been suggested: (a) Self-restraint is maintained by escape from or avoidance of aversive aspects of SIB, (b) self-restraint and SIB are members of the same functional class, and (c) self-restraint and SIB are functionally independent. This study examined a method by which the relationship between self-restraint and SIB may be investigated using functional analysis. Data were collected on the self-restraint and SIB exhibited by 5 mentally retarded males, while conditions suspected to maintain SIB were manipulated. Results suggested that self-restraint, like SIB, may be maintained by idiosyncratic contingencies. Implications of an understanding of self-restraint for the analysis and treatment of SIB are discussed, as are some general possibilities for future research.",Journal of applied behavior analysis,1992 Summer,United States,1992,90

Results of a prospective comparative interview study following mastectomy and breast conservation.,"In a prospective interview study, designed to compare the psycho-social outcome after a breast-conserving vs. a mastectomy operation, we analysed possible predictors of the psycho-social adjustment. 99 women with breast cancer histopathological TNM stages I and II were consecutively admitted to the study. Half-structured interviews, based on the Social Adjustment Scale and a scale by P. Maguire, were performed 4 and 13 months after the operation. Living together with the spouse seems to protect women from developing psycho-social problems postoperatively. Women who were gainfully employed or who were given radiotherapy had a higher risk of poor adjustment after 4 months. At 13 months, the scorings indicate that radiotherapy has a reassuring effect. Type of surgery was controlled for in the analysis and showed that, of the risk factors studied, the most consistent trend for an overall better outcome was in the breast-conserved group except for sexual disturbances.","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",1992,England,1992,90

The importance of comprehensive rehabilitation during convalescence is emphasised. Education, motivation and support of the patients are essential for the adoption of healthier lifestyles. Despite comprehensive rehabilitation, however, recidivism to former habits is common, particularly with smoking and physical inactivity. This is partly determined by premorbid social and personality characteristics of patients. Social and behavioural support at the workplace and within the community may well be of significant benefit in supporting patients to maintain their necessary health behaviour changes.

Using an experimental methodology in a simulated social drinking setting, this research tested the potential influence of expectations for the effects of drinking, environmental cues, and beverage content on ad lib consumption and post-drinking self-perception. Eighty-eight moderate to heavy-drinking males were randomly assigned to one of eight experimental conditions in which beverage content (alcohol or placebo), social environment (friendly or unfriendly), and physical environment (simulated bar or residence) were varied. Subjects were further divided into high and low groups on three outcome expectancy factors. Unaffected by environmental cues, beverage self-administration increased when subjects strongly expected behavioral impairment from drinking but received placebo beverage. Post-drinking reports of disinhibition increased in response to friendly social cues but were not affected by beverage content or amount. Results therefore suggest that individual's beliefs about the effects of drinking influence the amounts of beverage they consume, whereas social cues more greatly affect post-drinking self-perception.",Addictive behaviors,1992,England,1992,90
1557792,A framework for analyzing the determinants of maternal mortality.,"Hundreds of thousands of women in developing countries die each year from complications of pregnancy, attempted abortion, and childbirth. This article presents a comprehensive and integrated framework for analyzing the cultural, social, economic, behavioral, and biological factors that influence maternal mortality. The development of a comprehensive framework was carried out by reviewing the widely accepted frameworks that have been developed for fertility and child survival, and by reviewing the existing literature on maternal mortality, including the results of research studies and accounts of intervention programs. The principal result of this exercise is the framework itself. One of the main conclusions is that all determinants of maternal mortality (and, hence, all efforts to reduce maternal mortality) must operate through a sequence of only three intermediate outcomes. These efforts must either (1) reduce the likelihood that a woman will become pregnant; (2) reduce the likelihood that a pregnant woman will experience a serious complication of pregnancy or childbirth; or (3) improve the outcomes for women with complications. Several types of interventions are most likely to have substantial and immediate effects on maternal mortality, including family planning programs to prevent pregnancies, safe abortion services to reduce the incidence of complications, and improvements in labor and delivery services to increase the survival of women who do experience complications.",Studies in family planning,1992 Jan-Feb,United States,1992,90
1525198,Context and content: the impact of school-leaving and school-based health education on AIDS-relevant cognitions.,"A survey examined health beliefs and intentions among 690 16-18 year-olds in Dundee. Respondents in the younger cohort (n = 363) were classified according to their educational situation (at school vs left) and self-reports of having received AIDS/HIV-relevant health education. Both remaining in school and receiving AIDS/HIV-relevant health education had independent beneficial effects, but the effects of leaving school also interacted with sex of respondent and with amount of relevant education received prior to leaving. Males' and females' reliance on mass media and other information sources diverged once they left school, indicating that males who leave school early are most likely to disregard useful or important information regarding AIDS. Consistent with this finding, leaving school reduced the difference between males' and females' intention to use condoms with a new partner. The beneficial impact of having previously received AIDS/HIV-relevant education on beliefs concerning the controllability of the epidemic and on feeling worried about everyday contact with a person with HIV/AIDS, was most marked among those who had left school. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for health education strategies.",AIDS care,1992,England,1992,90
1514126,"Violent and accidental mortality among four immigrant groups in Canada, 1970-1972.","For most people immigration to a new country such as Canada entails a positive move and an improvement in life. The many challenges associated with resettlement may, however, lead to insurmountable difficulties, stresses and conflict for a significant number of newcomers. The mortality experience of immigrants, as reflected in cause-of-death statistics, may provide indication of the extent of stress and conflict in their migration experience. This situation is most clearly exhibited in mortality from suicide, homicide, and motor vehicle accidents. In this study, hypotheses concerning immigrant mortality in Canada are developed and tested with a log-linear model for rates pertaining to rare events. Overall, the results give support for the importance of country-of-origin effects in explaining suicide propensities, but not for homicide and motor vehicle accidents mortality. Income discrepancies are a significant determinant of variability in death rates overall, but discrepancies between the immigrants in this study and the Canadian-born are not of much significance. The strongest net effect on the cause-specific death rate is associated with group membership. This effect likely reflects a number of residual unmeasured sources of variation including the influence of the immigrant ethnic community as a source of social support, and the potential confounding effects of migration selectivity.",Social biology,1992 Spring-Summer,United States,1992,90
1514117,"Reproductive and socioeconomic determinants of child survival: confounded, interactive, and age-dependent effects.","Studies of infant and child mortality have evolved to distinguish between two sets of explanatory variables-factors related to reproductive or maternal characteristics and socioeconomic factors, generally described as characteristics of the family or household. Almost all multivariate analyses include variables from each of these two sets, but there has been little consideration of the relationship between them. We examine how these two sets of variables jointly affect mortality. We test first for confounded effects by examining socioeconomic effects while excluding and then including reproductive variables in nested multivariate models. Next, we look for age-dependent effects among the explanatory variables and find that reproductive and socioeconomic factors affect mortality at differing ages of children. Finally, we examine interactive effects of the two sets of variables. We conclude that the higher mortality observed among the low status groups is not a result of greater concentration of poor reproductive patterns in those groups. Instead, higher status groups probably have more resources available for combating the negative effects of the same high-risk reproductive patterns.",Social biology,1992 Spring-Summer,United States,1992,90

Therefore, any intervention aimed at promoting health must derive from and evolve within the community itself, with the participation of all its members, each of whom charged with a specific and well-defined role to play. Deep changes have occurred in modern society, as a consequence of industrialization and urbanization. This notwithstanding, the biological and social role of women in family management has remained unchanged, even after the spreading of female work. The community-based control of chronic and degenerative diseases calls for the acquirement of a lifestyle more suitable to maintaining health.

Data from the 1985 German Cardiovascular Prevention Study are used to explore associations between these behaviours, separate for young men (n = 561) and young women (n = 509) between 25 to 34 years of age. Analyses concern three forms of associations: 1. associations between different categories of single health behaviours; 2. associations between various health behaviours, and 3. associations between health behaviours, and their social determinants. Contingency tables, cluster analyses and logistic regression analyses are applied. Cluster analyses identified subgroups with particular health behaviour patterns. One distinct pattern, similarly among men and women, was typified by increased physical exercise, less smoking and increased beer consumption. For young men, results from regression analyses showed significant effects of higher income and positive health attitudes on belonging to this distinct cluster. For young women cluster membership was significantly correlated with higher education and positive health attitudes. Results of the statistical analyses demonstrate the usefulness of a multi-methods approach in studying complex behaviour patterns. Finally the relevance of the present findings for future studies and applications is indicated.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1992,Switzerland,1992,90
1490130,"Social inequality of stroke mortality among US black populations, 1968 to 1987.","Though the rate of stroke mortality in the United States has been declining for all race-sex-specific groups, rates for blacks are among the highest in the world. Studies of the geographic and social variation of stroke mortality between populations have focused solely on either trends or social determinants, but not on both. In addition, conclusions have concentrated on the comparison of whites to nonwhites. The purpose of this study was to investigate the variation in stroke mortality trends, from 1968 to 1987, between US black populations categorized by the socioeconomic structure of the state economic area. The educational achievement profile of the population (percentage of the state economic area that had not completed high school) was used as an indicator of socioeconomic development. This aggregate study assessed whether (1) an inverse relationship existed between stroke mortality and educational achievement category, and (2) levels and trends of stroke mortality by educational achievement category varied from 1968 to 1987, for each age-gender-specific group (35 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84 years). Results showed an inverse relationship between educational achievement level of communities and stroke mortality, as well as a rank-ordering in level of educational achievement for all age-gender-specific groups. The absolute difference in rates among educational achievement levels clearly converged over time, with greater convergence in the period 1968 to 1978 than 1979 to 1987. The percent declines were similar across education categories. Results suggest that geographic inequalities in stroke mortality, in relation to socioeconomic structure, have converged over time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Ethnicity & disease,1992 Fall,United States,1992,90
1488500,Compliance.,"Compliance is an ancient topic subjected to intense recent scrutiny as a result of scientific and social changes which focus on lifestyle adjustment to chronic illness and emphasize increasing patient involvement in self-care. Difficulties in definition, measurement and research design as well as the complexity of the problems contribute to conflicting findings and a lack of consensus about determinants of compliance. Five conceptual models have been studied but only a few positive and negative factors have been consistently identified, perhaps because outcome is often influenced by subtle attitudes, beliefs and quality of life considerations. Management involves both education and a variety of interventions that range from simple single strategies to complex multimodal approaches in which the patient's role may vary from being a passive participant of professional supervision to complete autonomy and self-care.",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,1992,Switzerland,1992,90

We also know that caries-related levels of dental health are inequitably distributed among social classes: on the average, disadvantaged people experience higher DMFS then privileged people. This difference can be explained by a differential access to health care, which can be shown by the study of components of the DMFS index: proportion of filled surfaces (F/DMFS), proportion of missing surfaces (M/DMFS), and proportion of recurrent caries (secondary caries/filled surfaces). Though we are able to describe the social distribution of levels of dental care, we cannot ""explain"" the differences we observe. The explanation of those differences defines the field of social epidemiology.

1473776,Environmental and social determinants of sexual function in the male lesser mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus).,"Environmental factors that regulate the sexual activity of male lesser mouse lemurs have been studied experimentally with more than 60 captive animals over an 8-year period. In this nocturnal Malagasy prosimian, variation in day length is the primary factor controlling seasonal sexual activity. Plasma testosterone concentrations were low (= 9 ng/ml) during short days and reached 60 ng/ml during long days (> 12-hour day). This cyclic pattern persists unchanged when artificial photoperiodic rhythms are applied and is not altered by ageing. The timing of puberty is also regulated by photoperiodic changes. Nevertheless, the sexual activity of the male lesser mouse lemur can be dramatically modified by the social environment. In heterosexual groups, behavioural and physiological components of sexual activity are depressed in all males except the dominant one, whose aggressive interactions are always successful. Intermale sexual inhibition was shown to be mediated by chemical cues present in the urine of dominant or isolated males but not in urine of subordinate individuals. The inhibitory signals possess lipophilic properties and are not contingent on the gonadal activity of the urine donor but are linked to adrenocortical activity. By contrast, chemical signals stimulating the reproductive function of all males are found in the urine of females, the presence of which is required for the establishment of clear dominance among grouped males. Endocrine mechanisms underlying intermale sexual inhibition by chemical cues were analysed. Variations in prolactin strongly suggest that olfaction interacts with the photoperiodic regulation of reproductive function, leading to changes in the sensitivity of the negative feedback effect of testosterone on gonadotrophin secretion. Inhibitory or stimulatory effects of chemical signals are discussed in the context of their functional significance for wild populations.",Folia primatologica; international journal of primatology,1992,Switzerland,1992,90

The girls were 14 through 17 years of age, from working-class backgrounds, and living in rural and urban areas. Adapted versions of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and the Parental Bonding Instrument were administered. Results indicated that the two groups did not differ in perceived maternal care and control. However, the self-esteem of urban schoolgirls was significantly higher than that of their once-pregnant counterparts. This was also true of the total sample. Urban teenagers without father figures were nearly 2.7 times more likely to have been pregnant than were those living with adult male relatives. Thus, father-figure absence and low self-esteem may combine as risk factors for teenage pregnancy in urban Jamaica.",Adolescence,1992 Winter,United States,1992,90
1464153,Nutritional status of Brazilian children: trends from 1975 to 1989.,"The prevalence of malnutrition among under-5-year-olds in Brazil fell by more than 60% between 1975 and 1989. The benefits were smaller for population strata that were more affected by malnutrition in the 1970s, i.e., children from the North and North-east regions and those from poor families in general. Regional and socioeconomic differentials in the prevalence of malnutrition therefore increased between 1975 and 1989. Trends in family income indicate extraordinary economic gains in the 1970s, some losses in the 1980s, and a modest net gain over the period 1975-89. The availability of sanitation, health, and education services, and the provision of preschool supplementary feeding programmes increased markedly in the 1970s and 1980s. Demographic trends were also positive, reducing the demand for services and programmes, increasing the economic efficiency of families, and concentrating the population in urban areas, where incomes, job opportunities, and social and material infrastructures are better. The observed nutritional improvement was therefore probably due to a moderate increase in family income associated with a substantial expansion in the provision of services and programmes, both of which were facilitated by favourable demographic trends. Also, the nutritional improvement was probably concentrated during the 1970s, while little, if any, occurred after 1980; prospects for the 1990s point to a stagnant situation. This is a reason for great concern particularly in the North and North-east regions of the country, where high rates of child malnutrition are still found.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,1992,Switzerland,1992,90

The relationship of panic/agoraphobia and allergy/anaphylaxis (IgE-mediated immediate reaction) is demonstrated and discussed with specific consideration of vasomotor reactions, tachycardia and hyperventilation in panic patients and allergies with anaphylactic reactions. The vegetative symptoms of panic reactions and anaphylaxis showed a high correlative correspondence. 74% of 23 panic and/or agoraphobia patients in a pretest to an epidemiologic study turned out to have an allergic illness that needed treatment; but there were no more anxiety disorders disclosed in 50 allergic patients than in the general population according to expectancies found in epidemiologic publications. If these data are confirmed then panic and agoraphobia cannot be seen as merely a cognitive-emotional event, but also as a further kind of allergic disease with genetic, ecological, psychological and social determinants; they would then have to be diagnosed as psychoimmunological disturbances and treated with behavior medicine (preferably with exposition and immunotherapy or hyposensitization). Anxiety therapies would improve qualitatively and could be cut down in duration.","Zeitschrift fur klinische Psychologie, Psychopathologie und Psychotherapie",1992,Germany,1992,90

Data obtained included drug history and related behaviors, sexual behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes regarding HIV infection and AIDS. Approximately 20% of the sample had used IV drugs in the year prior to the interview and 94% of these reported sharing needles; 20% of the IV drug users (IVDUs) reported always using bleach to clean needles. With regard to sexual practices, 7% of the total sample reported sex with other males in the year prior to the interview; 86% of the total sample reported having sex with females and 80% of these noted they never or rarely used condoms during vaginal sex. Respondents generally did not believe they themselves were at high risk for HIV infection, yet they continued to engage in acknowledged high-risk behaviors.

Marked gender differences, however, could be detected regarding the age at onset and its distribution and regarding illness behavior and certain secondary symptoms. The transnational stability of these findings was tested with data from the WHO studies ""On Assessment and Reduction of Psychiatric Disability"" (including 510 patients from 7 centres) and on ""Determinants of Outcome of Severe Mental Disorders"" (with 1,292 patients from 11 centres). Studying pooled data sets from the studies minimized centre-specific selection effects on sampling. Major results of the ABC-Schizophrenia-Study were validated: the lack of a gender difference in the morbidity risk (cumulative lifetime incidence rates) for schizophrenia; lower mean age at first admission in males; an early, marked peak in the distribution of the age at onset in males; a later and broader peak in this distribution in females with a second peak after age 40-45; equal frequency of nuclear symptoms in both sexes; gender differences in some specific contents of delusions, secondary affective symptoms, social adjustment and illness behavior.","Schweizer Archiv fur Neurologie und Psychiatrie (Zurich, Switzerland : 1985)",1992,Switzerland,1992,90

The sampling strategy was similar to the one recommended by UNICEF for assessment of vaccination coverage. Only 1 child had never been breast-fed and 60% were still breast-fed at the time of the interview during the second year of life. A number of factors were detected that seem important determinants of breast-feeding behaviour, e.g. marital status and level of formal education. Early supplementary feeding and early weaning were identified as major problems. Children were weaned onto commercial feeds or low-energy-dense staples, and there was also an obvious lack of energy-dense foods (e.g. butter, coconut oil) during the second year of life. Some determinants of these practices were recorded. The data have implications for the health services and should influence social and educational policy for the area. If properly implemented, the recommendations could result in significant financial saving for the study population. The health services should promote appropriate nutritional education, starting with antenatal care, early and frequent attendance at child health services should be encouraged and education concerning nutrition should be strengthened, and health education should encourage prolonged breast-feeding, discourage the use of commercial weaning foods, and encourage the use of natural multimixes (e.g. bananas, beans, cooking oil) for weaning.

1945937,Determinants of health-promotive behavior. A review of current research.,"The determinants of health promotive-behavior are proposed by Pender in the HPM. The exact impact of the various variables on singular behaviors or a lifestyle index, however, is far from conclusive. All the proposed factors have been supported through research, at least in part, as either directly or indirectly influencing the intent to participate in different health behaviors. The difficulty in concluding which variables are most critical is perhaps due to the variety of definitions, theoretical approaches (from different disciplines), and research methods. Of primary concern to this author is the overlap of activities among different ""patterns"" of behavior and the various definitions of such behavioral patterns. Little evidence exists on how specific types of behaviors relate to one another. Thus, knowing the determinants of a lifestyle index, for example, may be insignificant if the goal of nursing is to target priority behaviors that may indeed be influenced by more significant variables. For example, a person's perception of control may be a significant predictor of lifestyle behaviors in general; however, this variable may not impact on the person's decision to engage in changes related to exercise or activity behavior. Hence, because the motives behind various behaviors may be different, it seems more prudent to invest our research efforts on the impact of various factors on singular behaviors rather than lifestyle patterns. Finally, the efforts of nursing research on health behavior have been directed primarily at explaining the impact of various individual perceptions on the likelihood of behavior. Such focus has revealed some evidence of the significance of these variables, yet much unexplained variance remains. Perhaps it would be more prudent to direct attention at those variables such as situational or environmental factors that may impede or act as a cue to healthy behavior. Because the explanation of behavior has been individually focused (perhaps due to an ""individualizing"" theme in nursing education), the impact of the ecological model of behavior tends to be dismissed or underrated in nursing research. Knowledge of the impact of societal factors on behavior may be more appropriate to planning strategies for various groups rather than the behavioristic approaches that separate people from their social, physical, and economic environments. Thus, personal lifestyles may not be a simple matter of informed choice, and attention to the complex processes of societal opportunities, cultural interpretations, and group-specific attitudes must be studied further.",The Nursing clinics of North America,1991 Dec,United States,1991,90

After various factors were examined, it appeared certain that the intensification of adolescent turmoil as well as the neurotic level of determinants can become the strong driving force and the cause of eating disorder. Among most cases, the less sprightly life is dominant around preadolescence, which affects the orientation of psychopathology in adolescence. Under the influence of the developmental mode in preadolescence, every case determines how to utilize adolescent mentality (asceticism and indulgence colored by masochism and defiance vs. obedience).

1795152,Variation in the magnitude of black-white differences in stroke mortality by community occupational structure.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the patterns of black-white differences in stroke mortality across communities with varying levels of occupational structure in the southern region of the United States DESIGN: Annual age adjusted race-sex specific rates for stroke mortality were calculated for the years 1979-1981 and related to socioeconomic conditions. SETTING: The study involved 211 state economic areas comprising the southern region of the USA. STUDY POPULATION: Data on stroke mortality for black and white men and women between the ages of 35 and 74 years living in the study area were acquired from the National Center for Health Statistics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Occupational structure was measured as the proportion of white collar workers in each state economic area, and is an indicator of the employment opportunities and related social and economic resources of a community. Stratified analyses and linear regression modelling indicate that communities of lower occupational structure have (a) higher levels of stroke mortality for all four race-sex groups (p less than 0.05) and (b) larger racial inequalities in stroke mortality (p less than 0.01). For men and women, the excess stroke mortality among blacks compared to whites is larger in communities of lower occupational structure. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of occupational structure and related patterns of economic development is crucial for understanding the distribution of stroke mortality within and between racial groups, as well as for planning effective public health interventions. The larger racial inequalities in communities of lower occupational structure in the south suggest that aspects of the black experience which are conducive to high rates of stroke mortality are exacerbated in those communities. Public health interventions to reduce the racial and social inequalities in stroke mortality should recognise the social context within which nutritional, occupational, medical care, and environmental determinants of stroke are distributed.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1991 Dec,England,1991,90
1782520,The politics of welfare policy in Sweden: structural determinants and attitudinal cleavages.,"The article analyzes attitudes to Swedish welfare policies, using data from a survey conducted in 1986. In the first section, a number of indices tapping various aspects of attitudes to welfare policy are constructed. In the second section these indices are used to give an empirical assessment of competing theories about the impact of different structural determinants on attitudes. It is concluded (a) that there is general support for Swedish welfare policies, which, however, is mixed with criticisms of bureaucracy and suspicion about abuse of welfare programs, and (b) that class position and 'class-related' determinants such as income are more important than factors such as gender, private or public sector location or consumption groups in structuring attitudes. In the concluding section, these findings are discussed in relation to recent theorizing about newly emerging lines of division in the population. It is argued that either Sweden must be seen as a deviant case, which for specific historical and institutional reasons is characterized by class conflicts rather than other sectional splits, or the theories about new lines of division are simply mistaken.",The British journal of sociology,1991 Dec,England,1991,90
1774626,Behavior identification as a mediator of dispositional inference.,"According to Trope's (1986) 2-stage model, the use of situational information (""A was teased"") to identify behavior (""A reacted aggressively"") may result in subsequent dispositional inferences (""A is an aggressive person"") that seem insensitive to situational information. Two determinants of the situational biasing effect on behavior identification were varied, namely, behavior ambiguity and order of situational and behavioral information. It was found that when behavior was ambiguous and preceded by situational information, the latter affected behavior identification but not dispositional inference; in contrast, when behavior was unambiguous or when it was followed by situational information, the latter affected dispositional inference but not behavior identification. Thus, the same conditions that allowed situational information to bias behavior identification also nullified the effect of situational information on dispositional inference.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1991 Dec,United States,1991,90
1774617,Self-image and guilt: a further test of the cognitive-developmental formulation.,"The cognitive-developmental formulation of self-image disparity holds that an increasing disparity between the real and ideal self-image is due to (a) increasing differentiation of the real from the ideal self with maturity and (b) the increased capacity for incorporation of social mores with a greater propensity for guilt as a result. Guilt and self-image disparity were assessed in 47 young adults in Study 1, and in 108 children, of varying intellectual abilities, in the 5th, 8th, and 11th grades in Study 2. In both studies, guilt was related to self-image disparity. At all age levels, guilt was related to a higher ideal self-image. Guilt was related to a higher real self-image among 5th graders, but not among older individuals. Brighter children had a higher ideal self-image, greater self-image disparity, and marginally more guilt than children of average intellectual abilities. Guilt and self-image disparity were not related to grade level. The pattern of findings indicated that self-image is influenced by both cognitive-developmental and experiential determinants.",Journal of personality,1991 Dec,United States,1991,90
1763283,Concepts of health and disease and caries prediction: a literature review.,"Biomedical determinants of dental caries have been more extensively investigated than psychosocial factors and their impact on caries prevalence and incidence seems to be greater. However, a majority of these investigations relate to children and adolescents. An implementation of social and psychologic variables may be more relevant regarding dental caries in adults. In addition, a multidisciplinary approach might improve our understanding of dental caries as a multifactorial disease and bridge the gap between a biomedical concept and a more holistic approach to dental health.",Scandinavian journal of dental research,1991 Dec,Denmark,1991,90
1761131,"From hopeful to hopeless ... when do we write ""do not resuscitate""?","The issue of do not resuscitate (DNR) decisions has been the subject of much discussion in the medical literature. To try to understand the factors that may be determinants of the timing of DNR decisions, we reviewed the charts of 70 consecutive burned patients who died between 1986 and 1988. When a DNR decision was written, it was within 48 hours of the patient's death (74% of patients). No statistical difference was found in the sex distribution or in the percentage of body surface area burned in the DNR group and in the resuscitation group. Physicians, nurses, social workers, the hospital attorney, the district attorney, and the coroner of our county were interviewed. The uncertainty of legal guidelines and practical considerations of family expectations preclude a uniform approach to this problem.",Focus on critical care,1991 Dec,United States,1991,90
1760800,African-American men. Perceptual determinants of early cancer detection and cancer risk reduction.,"Research has shown that African-American men have a higher incidence, a higher death rate, and a lower survival rate for most cancers. But currently there are few studies addressing factors influencing the health care trends of this high-risk population. A study focused on identifying factors that contribute to early cancer detection and cancer risk-reduction health behavior in African-American men was therefore implemented. There is evidence to support the conclusion that perceptions do significantly contribute to the health behavior of African-American men. Those having the greatest impact were related to methods of early cancer screening. Clearly, if the National Cancer Institute's goal to reduce the mortality from cancer in the general population by 50% from the base rate in 1984 is to be met by the year 2000, there must be an increase in programs targeting African-American men. Every day African-American men can take steps to help protect themselves from cancer. Our charge as health care clinicians, educators, and researchers is to pinpoint ways to encourage them to do so.",Cancer nursing,1991 Dec,United States,1991,90
1755449,"Prevalence, determinants, and consequences of chronic neck pain in Finland.","Chronic neck pain is a relatively mild musculoskeletal condition, but common enough to be a possible public health problem. The distribution, determinants, and consequences of chronic neck pain have hitherto been described inadequately. In the Mini-Finland Health Survey, a representative population sample of 8,000 Finns aged greater than or equal to 30 years was invited to participate in a comprehensive health examination comprising an interview and a clinical examination; 90.2% complied. Predetermined criteria were used to diagnose major cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, respiratory, mental, and other disorders, regardless of other simultaneous disorders. Chronic neck syndrome was diagnosed in 9.5% of the men and 13.5% of the women. When adjusted for age and sex, the prevalence of the neck syndrome was associated with a history of injury to the back, neck, or shoulder and with mental and physical stress at work. Among those aged 30 to 64 years, overweight and parity were also significant determinants. Other musculoskeletal and mental disorders were associated with neck syndrome, and the association persisted after working conditions, injuries, overweight, and parity were adjusted for. There was some independent association between neck syndrome and disabilities, use of physician services, and use of pain killers.",American journal of epidemiology,1991 Dec 1,United States,1991,90

1951797,"Smoking, social support, and hassles in an urban African-American community.","BACKGROUND: Despite public health efforts, the prevalence of smoking among African Americans remains high. The determinants of smoking behavior in this population must be elucidated so that interventions can be better targeted and more effective. METHODS: As part of a prospective community intervention trial to reduce cancer mortality, we conducted a random household survey of 1137 African-American adults in San Francisco and Oakland between November 1985 and July 1986. The survey instrument included questions about social network characteristics, instrumental and emotional aspects of social support, smoking behavior, and stressors. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of smoking (41.9%) was higher than that reported in national surveys. Logistic models revealed that persons reporting high levels of stress, represented by an abbreviated hassles index, were more likely to smoke than those reporting less stress. Women with poor social networks were more likely to smoke (odds ratio = 3.1) than women with optimal networks; however, this relationship did not hold among men. Indeed, men lacking emotional support from friends or family were less likely to smoke (odds ratio = 0.5) than men receiving such support. No interaction between social support and hassles was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Stressful environments may contribute to high-risk smoking behavior among urban African Americans.",American journal of public health,1991 Nov,United States,1991,90
1941394,"Psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infection, among urban high school students.","The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of multiple psychosocial and knowledge-related antecedent factors that may predict sexual and alcohol and drug use behaviors that are associated with the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus infection. Five hundred forty-four ninth-grade urban high school students were surveyed regarding knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to STDs and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Results of multiple regression analyses indicate that higher levels of STD and AIDS knowledge were associated with lower levels of STD and AIDS anxiety (R2 delta = 0.09; p less than 0.001), fewer negative attitudes toward people with AIDS (R2 delta = 0.09; p less than 0.001), stronger perceptions of self-efficacy (R2 delta = 0.03; p less than 0.01), and stronger peer affiliation (R2 delta = 0.02; p less than 0.05). Negative attitudes toward people with AIDS were inversely related to knowledge (R2 delta = 0.08; p less than 0.001), social support (R2 delta = 0.02; p less than 0.01), and perceived self-efficacy (R2 delta = 0.01; p less than 0.05). Predictors of alcohol and drug use included perceived peer norms (R2 delta = 0.08; p less than 0.001) and strong peer affiliation (R2 delta = 0.05; p less than 0.001). The best predictor of sexual risk behavior was alcohol and drug use (R2 delta = 0.07; p less than 0.001). Lower levels of knowledge (R2 delta = 0.14; p less than 0.01) and perceived peer norms (R2 delta = 0.05; p less than 0.05) predicted nonuse of condoms. Our results indicate that several factors relate to adolescent risk for STDs: the connection between peer influence and adolescent risk behaviors, the link between alcohol and drug use and sexual risk behavior, and the role of knowledge in determining nonuse of condoms.",The Journal of pediatrics,1991 Nov,United States,1991,90
1788366,The deficiency model: an exploration of current approaches to late-life disorders.,"Many of the terms used to describe conditions in elderly individuals, whether medical (deterioration, involution, degeneration) or neurobehavioral (impairment, dysfunction), imply deficiency. The complex of distorted views of real impairment, illness, or disability may be described as the deficiency model. Although developmental theory has expanded explosively and could offer an alternative frame of reference to dispel denigration of the elderly condition, late life continues to be viewed as lacking all redeeming aspects, while mortality is considered an obstacle to prolonging life rather than one of its determinants. Deficiency-model thinking has influenced the conduct of epidemiologic, neurobiologic and clinical research, whose results in turn have often been interpreted to reinforce such thinking. It can also distort clinical approaches to diagnosis and treatment of late-life disorders. This paper offers instead an alternative approach that focuses on late life as a developmental task.",Psychiatry,1991 Nov,United States,1991,90

A study in pauper children attending schools in an urban strip in Lisbon].,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether race is a factor of blood pressure levels in school-age children of similar social status, and to investigate other potential determinants of the levels of blood pressure. DESIGN: Inquiry in schools of the suburbs of Lisbon. SETTING: Three schools, four medical observers (general practitioners with school-health functions). SUBJECTS: Three hundred ninety seven children, aged 6-14 years, both sexes, 296 being white and 101 non-white. INTERVENTIONS: Inquiry to the following individual characteristics--sex, age, race, birthplace, type of housing, house availability of water, electricity and waste water, type of transportation to school, number of cohabitans, family income, school marks. Individual determination of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), weight and height. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood pressure values were cross-analyzed with all the determined variables, and the virtual correlations were checked. Main results as follows: Race does not influence either SBP or DBP. In this age group, sex does not influence blood pressure values. The used markers of socioeconomical status have equally no influence on blood pressure. Age has only a significant repercussion on SBP. No significant correlation was found between height and blood pressure. Body weight, however, influence either SBP or DBP. SBP was found to be lower in the second of two successive measurements, and the difference increases with age. CONCLUSIONS: In this school-aged biracial population, body weight seems to be the major factor of blood pressure levels, in the sense-bigger weight, higher SBP and DBP.",Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology,1991 Nov,Portugal,1991,90
1776493,An interactionistic integrating view of depressive disorders and their treatment.,"The development of a depressive disorder is often considered from the perspective of biological causation, mental processes, or with a focus on possible social determinants, even though the possible concomitance of factors belonging to the different domains is generally acknowledged. In this article, a further development of an interactional model previously described is presented. The model is focused on the concept of individual vulnerability, which is assumed to result from a continuous interplay of the individuals with their environment, and from the effect of factors belonging to different domains that interact. A closer definition of individual vulnerability suggests that it consists of the interaction of biological characteristics of the person and a basically dysfunctional self-schema. Empirical studies in support of some of the hypotheses which can be derived from the model are briefly reviewed, and the implications of the model for the treatment of depression is underscored.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,1991 Nov,United States,1991,90
1769402,Gender and changing generational relations: spouse choice in Indonesia.,"Many Asian societies are undergoing a nuptiality transition that is not only tied integrally to other aspects of family organization, but is also often more complex than standard studies of female age at marriage can reveal. To comprehend some of this complexity, we focus on the patterns of spouse choice for both men and women in central Java. The extent of parental control over mate selection is examined for change over time, gender differences, and likely determinants, including family class, education, premarital work, and residence. It is argued that the current marriage transition in Indonesia reflects both gender and generational hierarchies in the Javanese family system. The analysis is conducted using a multinomial logit model; in general, it yields results strongly supportive of the argument that the determinants of spouse selection differ by gender. The results also show that although there is a dramatic shift towards self-choice marriages, it is occurring within the context of historical and institutional factors specific to Javanese society.",Demography,1991 Nov,United States,1991,90
24390608,Labor force participation at older ages in the Western Pacific: A microeconomic analysis.,"Retirement has become a very important stage of life for persons in developed countries. Life expectancy for those over age 60 has increased markedly. Rising real income and the institution of broad based social security systems have encouraged older workers to leave the labor force at younger ages. p]Reductions in older age mortality have also affected the less developed regions. Increases in the number of older persons, coupled with continuing high fertility, have increased the size of the working age population through both large entry cohorts and longevity of current workers. The capacity of the economy to absorb this growth is severely limited. As a result, labor force decisions by older individuals will be of increasing importance.This study provides new evidence on labor force decisions in four developing countries in the Western Pacific: Fiji, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines. A uniform survey sponsored by the World Health Organization in the four countries of persons aged 60 and over is employed to estimate the determinants of work decisions.",Journal of cross-cultural gerontology,1991 Oct,Netherlands,1991,90

The results show that the probability of moving with a pre-arranged job increases with education and with age, and is higher for those who seek non-manual jobs. For migrants who arrive in the city without a pre-arranged job, unemployment duration depends on marital status, premigration information on urban employment opportunities, and on the reliance on contacts for job search.""",Journal of development economics,1991 Oct,Netherlands,1991,90

Although only imperfect proxies for breast-feeding practices and other potentially confounding factors are available for this population, the results suggest that the association between previous interval length and infant mortality in this population is not solely, or primarily, a function of differences in breast-feeding behaviour or socioeconomic status.

Patients chosen for analysis had an apnea index (AI) of greater than or equal to 20 hr-1 prior to CPAP. The AI was 67 +/- 30 hr-1, the body mass index (BMI) was 36 +/- 9 kg/m2, the age was 51 +/- 13 yr and the lowest oxygen saturation was 72 +/- 14%. Effective CPAP (9 +/- 3 cm H2O) was documented in 320 patients on single night studies and resulted in a 99% reduction in the frequency of obstructive events and improvement in the lowest O2 saturation to 94 +/- 5%. Only 18% of the variability in effective CPAP could be explained by AI and BMI. Single night studies are sufficient to establish effective CPAP in 78% of patients and offer considerable conservation of resources compared to routine multiple night studies. Effective CPAP pressures are variable and must be determined by incremental CPAP trials.",Sleep,1991 Oct,United States,1991,90

12319428,"[Means of support, fertility, and social reproduction among peasants: three approaches].","This article examines interpretations regarding the relationship between means of support and fertility, taking into account views on social reproduction among peasants, with emphasis on the way they are expressed in terms of indicators. The author begins with a brief summary of theories put forth by Malthus, and then examines Neo-Malthusian models which use as an independent variable, the amount of land and as a dependent variable, the number of children. He notes the existence of a positive ratio between these variables, and then demonstrates that in Chayanov's model, the number of children is used as an independent variable, while the idea of a positive ratio with the amount of land is still maintained. He compares these assumptions with those of Palerm, who suggests the existence of an inverse ratio between the amount of land available and fertility; this leads to policy implications contrary to those arising from neo-Malthusian models. The paper ends with a discussion of assumptions about the rationality, motivations, and guiding values the different approaches attribute to economic and demographic behavior among peasants.",Estudios demograficos y urbanos,1991 Sep-Dec,Mexico,1991,90

The association of these factors with the prevalence of obesity (body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) was also studied in a subsequent cross-sectional survey of 5673 Finns. In uni- and multivariate analyses, the risk of substantial weight gain (greater than or equal to 5 kg/5 years) was greatest for persons with a low level of education, chronic diseases, little physical activity at leisure or heavy alcohol consumption, and for those who got married or quit smoking between the examinations. Parity and energy intake predicted weight gain in women. The prevalence of obesity was inversely associated with the level of education and physical activity, and positively associated with alcohol consumption in men and parity in women. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of obesity by smoking or marital status. The recognition of socioeconomic and behavioural factors as important determinants of weight gain and overweight helps the planning of effective treatment and preventive programmes tailored for subjects at highest risk of obesity.",European journal of clinical nutrition,1991 Sep,England,1991,90

1955254,Determinants of traffic accident mortality in The Netherlands: a geographical analysis.,"In the Netherlands, a country with one of the lowest levels of traffic accident mortality in the world, large regional mortality differences can be observed. An analysis was performed of the contribution of regional differences in traffic mobility (kilometers travelled/person-years), injury rate (injured people/kilometre travelled) and case fatality (traffic deaths/injured people). Subsequently, possible determinants of regional differences in traffic accident mortality and its constituent parts were investigated. Both the influence of sociodemographic factors and of factors probably more directly related to traffic deaths (road infrastructure, medical care) was studied. Regional differences in traffic accident mortality in the Netherlands can only to a very limited extent be explained by regional differences in traffic mobility. Regional differences in case fatality seem to make the most important contribution. Of the sociodemographic factors that were used in the analysis, per capita income appears to be the strongest predictor of regional mortality differences. A higher income level is associated with lower mortality levels. Of the factors more directly related to traffic deaths, traffic density and the availability of advanced trauma care (neurosurgery and computerized tomography (CT-Scan)) in the region are the most important predictors of regional mortality differences. Both variables show an inverse relationship with case fatality. Probably a higher traffic density leads to a shift towards less severe injuries. The availability of advanced trauma care could be important in early diagnosis and treatment of head injuries. The results of this study, based on existing data sources, must be interpreted with care. Some potential sources of bias (omitted variables, regional differences in accident reporting) are discussed.",International journal of epidemiology,1991 Sep,England,1991,90
1955251,"Cigarette smoking, body mass and other risk factors for fractures of the hip in women.","Determinants of hip fractures were assessed using data from a network of hospital-based case-control studies from northern Italy. For the present analysis, cases were 209 women with fractures of the hip/proximal femur (aged 29 to 74, median age 62) admitted to a network of teaching and general hospitals in the greater Milan area; controls were 1449 women, aged 25 to 74 (median age 55), admitted for non-traumatic, acute conditions to the same network of hospitals. There was a strong direct association with smoking, the relative risk (RR) being significantly and similarly elevated both in ex- and in current smokers (RR 1.7 and 1.5 respectively) which rose to 2.4 for 25 or over cigarettes per day. The risk was associated with duration of smoking and apparently greater in post-menopausal women. Two factors showed significant inverse associations with hip fractures: relative weight, with relative risks of 0.5, 0.4 and 0.3 in subsequent categories of body mass index as compared with thinner ones, and the use of oestrogen replacement treatment (multivariate RR = 0.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2-1.1). No association was observed with education or social class, selected indicator foods or alcohol consumption (RR for the highest consumption level = 1.0). The effects of smoking and body mass index appeared independent: compared with never smoking heavier women, the RR for smoking thin women was 4.6. Thus, this case-control study of hip fractures in a predominantly post-menopausal population of Italian women showed a strong association with smoking and appreciable protection from heavier body mass index and the use of oestrogen replacement treatment.",International journal of epidemiology,1991 Sep,England,1991,90

Associations between menopausal development, psychosocial factors and climacteric complaints were analyzed. Factor analysis of 24 climacteric complaints identified five factors (vague somatic complaints, nervous complaints, mood lability, vasomotor and urogenital complaints) which were analyzed in relation to stage of menopausal development and a number of psychosocial variables. Five types of variable contributed to the variance in the five previously identified factors, viz. style of reacting to menstruation earlier in life, mother's climacteric complaints, negative expectations regarding the menopause, social network, sociodemographic factors, and chronological age. Menopausal development played a modest role in explaining the variance in all except vasomotor complaints, the latter being associated with current cigarette smoking. Traditional sex-role identification was associated with nervous complaints. The authors conclude that hot flushes, excessive sweating and vaginal dryness are the only complaints clearly attributable to menopausal development.",Maturitas,1991 Sep,Ireland,1991,90

Determinants of consumption frequency and quantity consumed.,"Genetic models were fitted to self-report data on frequency of alcohol consumption and average quantity consumed when drinking, from 3,810 adult Australian twin pairs. Frequency of consumption is determined both by an abstinence dimension, which is strongly influenced by shared environmental effects but not by genetic effects, and by an independent frequency dimension, which is influenced by genetic effects in both sexes and possibly by shared environmental affects in men. Quantity of alcohol consumed is likewise determined by an environmental abstinence dimension and by an independent and partly heritable quantity dimension. The best-fitting model allowed for two routes to abstinence: those who were not abstainers by virtue of their position on the abstinence dimension could nonetheless become abstainers by their position on the second, frequency (or quantity) dimension. Heritability estimates were 66% in women and 42-75% in men, for frequency; and 57% in women and 24-61% in men, for quantity.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1991 Sep,United States,1991,90
1941951,Paying for health.,"Health care systems, irrespective of how they are financed, present the paradox that to some observers they appear as a major component of social benefits, while to other observers they seem both excessively costly and limited in their effectiveness. These differing perceptions may be explained in part by the diversity of the determinants of health and disease, only some of which are amenable to those preventive or therapeutic measures encompassed in a health care system--the majority of determinants being genetic, societal, or else uninfluenced by those interventions at present available within a health service. The share of national resources which should be devoted to health care, and the method of raising resources, are primarily matters for political decision; but a national system has advantages both of economy and of comprehensiveness. But when it comes to allocation of resources within the established health budget, the knowledge and skills of health professionals are essential to informed decision-making. The possibilities depend critically on the 'state of the art' at a given time, as is illustrated by the radical changes over time in what could be done for patients with renal failure; and health professionals are likely to be most aware of current options, and of how to choose between them. More speculatively, they are also less likely to confuse the attitudes appropriate to providing a service with those required to run a business.",Journal of medical ethics,1991 Sep,England,1991,90

The mortality data used in the study were the best available for the period and are reasonably accurate; descriptive data were derived from recognised sources. Political status was a major correlate, with independence positively associated with mortality. However, the influence of political status was partly accounted for by economic and social variables. Economic indices, particularly imports per capita, were major inverse correlates of mortality. Disparities in life expectancy occurred between malarious and nonmalarious countries, and these were not explicable by other factors. Melanesians, especially women, experienced high mortality rates. Education and doctor availability were both associated with increased life expectancy. Intercorrelation and confounding need to be taken into account in the interpretation of this analysis. The results have ramifications for policy development in the Pacific island countries themselves, and for investment and aid programs from major donor nations and organisations.",Australian journal of public health,1991 Sep,Australia,1991,90
1757767,Cultural and economic determinants of geographical mortality patterns in The Netherlands.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The geographical pattern of mortality in The Netherlands is dominated by an area of relatively high mortality in the southern part of the country. The aim was to analyse the background of this geographical mortality pattern in the early 1980s, and its evolution over time since the early 1950s. DESIGN: Mortality data by district (n = 39), cause of death (13 large causes, ""symptoms and ill defined conditions"", all other causes), and time period (1950-54, 1960-64, 1970-74, 1980-84) were available from the Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics. Standardised mortality ratios were calculated, and the logarithms of these were related to three sociodemographic characteristics using multiple, ordinary least squares regression analysis. SETTING: This study used data for the whole Dutch population. MAIN RESULTS: Although the geographical mortality pattern has been rather stable over the last decades, a clear tendency towards convergence is also apparent. Approximately 90% of the current excess mortality in the southern part of the country is due to cardiovascular diseases. The results of regression analysis show that the excess mortality is primarily related to the high percentage of Roman Catholics in this part of the country, and additionally to a slightly lower average income. In The Netherlands, a higher percentage of Roman Catholics in the population is linked with higher all cause mortality rates, as well as with higher mortality rates for lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, arterial disease, and chronic non-specific lung disease. Survey data show that these associations are partly due to a higher prevalence of smoking among Roman Catholics. As in many other countries, a lower average income is linked with high all cause mortality rates in The Netherlands. Cause specific data show negative associations for stomach cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic non-specific lung disease, and traffic accidents. Since the early 1950s the association between geographical mortality patterns and the percentage of Roman Catholics in the population has gradually become less strongly positive. This suggests that the convergence of the mortality rates in the South towards the national average may be related to a gradual lessening of differences in lifestyle between population groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both cultural and economic factors are important in the explanation of geographical mortality patterns in The Netherlands.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1991 Sep,England,1991,90
1743273,Determinants of unintended childbearing among ever-married women in the United States: 1973-1988.,"A downward trend in unwanted childbearing has reversed among large segments of the population, according to data from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth. The proportion of births in the previous five years that were unwanted at conception fell from 14 percent in 1973 to eight percent in 1982, but increased to 10 percent in 1988. Between the 1982 and 1988 surveys, increases were most pronounced among women with less than a high school education and among women living below the federal poverty level. Differences between black women and white women in levels of unwanted childbearing, which were converging prior to 1982, have since grown considerably, particularly among the poor and the less educated.",Family planning perspectives,1991 Sep-Oct,United States,1991,90

Menarcheal age.,"The median menarcheal age of 107 girls adopted from India by families in Sweden was 11.6 years, which was significantly lower than in Swedish and most Indian studies. Five girls had menarche before the age of 9 years, the earliest at 7.3 years. Those who arrived at a later age had earlier menarche. No differences in menarcheal age were found with respect to geographic origin. The reasons for the earlier pubertal maturation are not clear. Factors associated with the rapid transition from an underprivileged to a privileged environment are probably involved, besides genetic determinants. The serious medical, social and emotional consequences of very early pubertal development necessitate further clarification of the underlying mechanisms.",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,1991 Aug-Sep,Sweden,1991,90

Residents of 24 nursing homes were surveyed using the Canberra Interview for the Elderly (CIE) and a range of environmental measures was also taken. Of 323 residents who were screened for cognitive impairment, 165 (51%) scored 18 or above on the Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al. 1975), and were interviewed with the CIE. According to DSM-III-R criteria and the CIE, the prevalence of major depressive episode was 9.7%. Using ICD-10 criteria, 6.1% of residents suffered from a severe depressive episode, 6.7% from a moderate depressive episode and 6.7% from a mild depressive episode. Some measures of the social environment were significantly related to depressive symptoms.",Psychological medicine,1991 Aug,England,1991,90

The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which sociodemographic variables and life-style associated health behaviors explain body weight distribution. A second aim was to explain the relation of body weight and health status to stress the importance of body weight as an early risk indicator of health status. The canonical correlation between the weight distribution (underweight and overweight) and the independent variables was 0.29, 17% of the total variance was explained. Perceived health level represented the highest contribution (canonical coefficient 0.82) to body weight. Sociodemographic factors such as sex, economic status, and life-style factors such as smoking, exercise, regular meals and sleep showed comparatively high contributions to body weight. The relevance of body weight for health status including the rate of chronic disease and the rate of medical utilization was significant. Especially, underweight was clarified as being more important than overweight to morbidity level and medical utilization. These findings suggest that perceived body weight is an important indicator of health status and is thus a valuable variable to be considered for nursing intervention and health education related to the promotion of health.",Kanho Hakhoe chi [The Journal of Nurses Academic Society],1991 Aug,Korea (South),1991,90
1920063,Group members' reactions to opinion deviates and conformists at varying degrees of proximity to decision deadline and of environmental noise.,"Four experiments examined freely interacting groups to investigate the determinants of group members' reactions to opinion deviates and conformists. In the 1st experiment, the deviate was rejected more when he or she articulated the dissenting opinion in close proximity to the group-decision deadline versus at an earlier point in the group discussion. In the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th experiment, the deviate was rejected more when the group discussion was carried out in a noisy versus a quiet environment. Furthermore, when the conformist's contributions to the group's attempts to reach consensus were made salient (in Experiment 4), he or she was evaluated more positively in a noisy versus a quiet environment. The results were discussed in terms of the notion that group members' tendency to denigrate a deviate or extol a conformist may be stronger when their need for collective cognitive closure is heightened.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1991 Aug,United States,1991,90

This paper shows that, when race is analyzed separately, family-related variables such as marital history and the number of children raised, rather than economic affordability, are the most important factors in the living arrangement decision of widowed elderly women of color. Economic affordability also turns out to be insignificant when white and nonwhite divorced elderly women are analyzed separately.",The Gerontologist,1991 Aug,United States,1991,90

An understanding of physician behaviour in this domain is therefore important. This cross-sectional survey examined physician beliefs, attitudes, intentions and behaviour with respect to contraceptive prescription. Physician gender was associated with attitudes to diaphragm prescription, while year of medical graduation was associated with attitude to IUCD prescription. Age and gender in turn were related to differing perceptions of methods pertaining to efficacy, adverse effects, women for whom the methods were suitable and possible impacts on the physician.

The effects of individual indicators of the status of women on fertility are decomposed into effects through each of the proximate variables, notably those affecting marriage duration, marital fertility, and contraception. There is considerable variation in the direction and magnitude of the relationships between the status indicators and fertility behavior and in the relationship to the underlying mechanisms at the two points in time. On balance, the evidence suggests improvements in the status of women come to exert an increasingly negative effect on fertility over the course of demographic transition.",Studies in family planning,1991 Jul-Aug,United States,1991,90

Parental psychiatric diagnosis was significantly related to high-EE in fathers (p = .0002) and mothers (p = .0001) of all groups combined, and in parents of the ill groups (p = .03). Absence of diagnosis was associated with low-EE in fathers (p = .0006) and mothers (p = .04) of the controls. Psychiatric diagnosis was the only significant predictor for high-EE in fathers, while for mothers child's diagnosis was a stronger predictor.","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",1991 Jul,England,1991,90
1894842,Relationship of role conflict and role ambiguity to selected job dimensions among joint appointees.,"The purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of role conflict and role ambiguity experienced by nurse faculty in joint academic-clinical appointments and non-joint-appointed faculty (traditional faculty), and to examine the relationships of these two constructs with social support, job satisfaction, and propensity to leave the joint appointment. Scholarly productivity of the two groups was also examined. Five hypotheses were proposed. The sample (N = 113) was drawn from the five Canadian university nursing faculties with the largest proportion of joint academic-clinical appointees. Findings indicate that assuming a joint appointment does not necessarily lead to an increase in role conflict and role ambiguity, and that joint appointees do not differ from traditional faculty in levels of role conflict and role ambiguity, scholarly productivity levels, or job satisfaction. Within the joint-appointee group (N = 33), role conflict was significantly higher than role ambiguity, both role conflict and role ambiguity had an adverse effect on job satisfaction and are determinants of intent to leave the joint appointment. In addition, social support was found to have a buffering effect on role conflict.",Journal of professional nursing : official journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing,1991 Jul-Aug,United States,1991,90
2063828,Assessing risk factors for transmission of infection.,"Commonly used measures of effect, such as risk ratios and odds ratios, may be quite biased when used to assess the effect of factors that alter transmission risks given exposure to infected individuals. This is demonstrated in a simulation model involving a higher-risk behavior and a lower-risk behavior affecting the sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. The bias arises because population contact patterns between higher-risk and lower-risk persons change their relative probabilities of exposure to an infected individual as an epidemic progresses. The assessment of contact patterns is thus central to risk assessment for contagious diseases. A new formulation of selective mixing presented here, together with a structured mixing specification of the social settings of contact, provides a theoretic framework for the investigation of contact pattern determinants.",American journal of epidemiology,1991 Jun 15,United States,1991,90

Inter-specialty variation in the frequency of malpractice claims is almost entirely related to the differential performance of major surgery. Various legal doctrines concerning both compensation and liability appear responsible for approximately half of the upward trend in the propensity to initiate malpractice litigation. We believe that the remaining explanations for growth in claims frequency are changes in social attitudes toward risk-bearing, increasing social distance between patients and physicians, and innovations in medical technology.",Journal of health economics,1991 Jul,Netherlands,1991,90
16348501,Distribution of DNA Sequences Encoding Narrow- and Broad-Spectrum Mercury Resistance.,"The distribution of DNA sequences homologous with three mer genes was determined in unselected and mercury-resistant water and sediment isolates. The maximum proportions of unselected bacterial isolates containing DNA hybridizing with the 358merA, 358merB, and 501merR probes, derived from gram-negative organisms, were 93.8, 21, and 100%, respectively. Up to 53.3% of mercury chloride-resistant isolates and 54% of methylmercury hydroxide-resistant isolates did not contain DNA homologous with 358merA or 358merB, respectively. Hybridizations performed at high and low stringencies demonstrated that divergence of the merA gene accounted for many of the mercury-resistant but probe-negative isolates. Sixteen mercury-resistant Bacillus spp. isolated from the least contaminated site all contained DNA homologous with 258merA, originally from a gram-positive organism, but only four hybridized weakly with 358merA. The results demonstrate the wide distribution of mercury resistance genes but, because of the diversity of genetic determinants, highlight the importance of using multiple detection techniques and gene probes derived from a variety of origins for such studies.",Applied and environmental microbiology,1991 Jun,United States,1991,90
15830042,"[Framework for the study of the relationships between work, women and health].","The present paper aims at showing the importance of the gender approach in the theoretical construction of the field of worker's health since men and women are exposed to different work conditions within the productive process. In the case of female workers, we point to the liaison of capitalism and patriarchy as determinants of women's oppression in the hierarchical relationships of labor as well as to the hidden social responsibility of the housework, which is carried out in the private sphere thus keeping women distant from the social and political world and generating strong impacts on their health. According to the sexual division of labor, female work in industry is restricted to rather repetitive tasks that require a great nervous resistance - not especially healthy conditions that lead to a specific consuming pattern. We concluded that changes should occur in the social life schemes, besides breaking with the myths that support the sexual division of labor, so that the aggressive conditions imposed on men and women's health in the work process can be altered.",Cadernos de saude publica,1991 Apr-Jun,Brazil,1991,90

In urban areas, in particular, the use of hospital outpatient departments and emergency rooms by the indigent has been increasing. This article examines the determinants of regular source of care and illuminates the ethnicity-poverty-health care nexus. The data set analyzed includes blacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and non-Hispanic whites residing in poverty areas in Chicago, IL. Multinomial logit analysis is used to estimate the likelihood of having a particular kind of regular source of care. The findings demonstrated considerable ethnic group differences. In particular, blacks tend to utilize hospital facilities as a result of past constraints and their current dependence on public insurance programs. Mexicans are the least likely to have a regular source of care due to social and cultural barriers such as language, migration status, and low community participation. The implications of social isolation associated with poverty are also examined and discussed.",Medical care,1991 Jun,United States,1991,90
1830689,Determinants of sciatica and low-back pain.,"Several factors were studied for their association with the prevalence of chronic low-back syndromes, sciatica, and unspecified low-back pain (LBP) in 2,946 women and 2,727 men (age range, 30-64 years) participating in the Mini-Finland Health Survey, a project aimed at comprehensive evaluation of the population's health. On the basis of a standardized clinical examination, a physician diagnosed sciatica in 5.1% and LBP in 11.6% of the subjects. Those with a previous traumatic back injury had a 2.5-fold risk of having sciatica or LBP. The fractions of sciatica and LBP attributable to such back injuries were estimated to be 16.5% and 13.7%, respectively. Sum indices of both physical and mental stress at work were found to be directly proportional to the prevalence of sciatica and LBP. Smokers had an increased risk of LBP, and body height was related positively to the prevalence of sciatica. These associations, however, were inconsistent between sex and age subgroups. In the presence of osteoarthritis in the knee, hip, or hand, LBP was prevalent (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-6.9), but sciatica was not (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.7). Diabetics were found to have a significantly decreased prevalence of LBP (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8). Many factors, independent of each other, determine the occurrence of chronic low-back syndromes. The determinants of sciatica and LBP are different to some extent.",Spine,1991 Jun,United States,1991,90

Putative confounders such as age, body mass index, smoking, sporting activity and educational attainment were controlled for by multiple regression analyses. The main effect models showed that men aged 25-64 years consuming greater than or equal to 80 g alcohol per day had, on average, 3-11 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) values and 2-6 mmHg higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values compared with non-drinkers. Women consuming greater than or equal to 40 g alcohol per day showed consistently higher SBP (2-6 mmHg) and DBP (1-5 mmHg) values compared with non-drinkers. In the group aged 55-64 years, no clear relationship was seen for SBP or DBP in men or women. Multiple regression models, allowing for interactions between alcohol consumption and the four behavioural variables: smoking, sporting activity; coffee consumption; and type A/B behaviour, showed a consistent interaction between alcohol consumption and smoking in men and women. Smoking modified the effect of alcohol on SBP and DBP in men by 2-8 mmHg and in women by 1-14 mmHg. These findings confirm those obtained for women in previous studies in Munich and Lubeck. Interactions between alcohol and sporting activity, coffee consumption and type A/B behaviour are less consistent.",Journal of hypertension,1991 Jun,England,1991,90
2030286,A typology of social climates in group residential facilities for older people.,"A typology of the social climates of group residential facilities for older people was developed by a cluster analysis of seven social climate attributes obtained on a national sample of 235 nursing homes, residential care facilities, and congregate apartments. The analysis yielded six distinct types of social climate: Supportive, Self-Directed; Supportive, Well-Organized; Open Conflict; Suppressed Conflict; Emergent-Positive; and Unresponsive. Facility and resident characteristics were related to social climate type. In addition, the type of social climate was related to resident adaptation. Supportive, Self-Directed and Supportive, Well-Organized facilities had residents who rated higher in well-being and levels of self-initiated activities and who used fewer health services. A configural approach to describing social climates and their determinants and effects may help to develop more humanistic residential facilities and to better match individual residents to appropriate housing placements.",Journal of gerontology,1991 May,United States,1991,90
2028980,Health and social predictors of mortality in an elderly Chinese cohort.,"A total of 1,054 Hong Kong Chinese subjects aged 70 years or over were recruited into a cohort study to investigate the relation between social support and health outcomes. More than 30 social, health, and behavioral characteristics were recorded as baseline information when the study began in 1985. Mortality data were obtained during a 2-year follow-up. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the roles of these variables in predicting mortality. The mortality patterns of Hong Kong and of the studied cohort closely resemble that of Western developed countries with cancer, heart disease, and cerebrovascular diseases as the leading causes of death. Besides sex and place of residence (whether living in the community or in homes for the elderly), the independent predictors of mortality included five baseline variables: being single or widowed, limited ability in activities of daily living, smoking habit, low body mass index, and poor self-evaluated health status. Subjects with at least three of these predictors had a relative risk of 3.9 (95% confidence interval 2.4-6.2) compared with those with zero to two of these characteristics.",American journal of epidemiology,1991 May 1,United States,1991,90
2021295,Depression among alcoholics. Relationship to clinical and cerebrospinal fluid variables.,"Although depression is common among alcoholics, its determinants are poorly understood. Among 339 alcoholics, 111 (33%) had a history of major depression. Depressed, compared with never-depressed alcoholics, had a higher daily alcohol intake, more lifetime diagnoses of other anxiety and affective disorders and drug abuse, more had attempted suicide, and more reported alcoholism in both parents. Depressed alcoholics also had significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid and of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Among subgroups of depressed alcoholics, secondary compared with primary depressives were more often divorced, of lower social status, with an earlier onset of alcoholism, and higher Michigan Alcohol Screening Test scores. Secondary depressives also had significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of homovanillic acid than never depressed alcoholics. These results suggest that certain psychosocial variables, alcohol consumption, and neurochemical variables may be specifically associated with depression in alcoholics.",Archives of general psychiatry,1991 May,United States,1991,90

At the aggregate level, consistency was remarkable: In 1982, 47 percent of women said they wanted more children and in 1985, 49 percent had more, for a slight excess of actual over wanted fertility. Even though inconsistencies existed, at the individual level preferences were moderately predictive of subsequent behavior. Unwanted fertility was related not only to the demographic characteristics of the women but also to disagreement with their husbands on desired fertility. More of those who believed that their husbands wanted additional children than those who believed otherwise reported births in the follow-up period. Nonusers of contraception were over three times more likely than contraceptors using modern methods to have had an unwanted birth.",Studies in family planning,1991 May-Jun,United States,1991,90
1949098,The contribution of the World Fertility Surveys to an understanding of the relationship between women's work and fertility.,"A consistent negative association between women's paid work and fertility in developed countries has emerged from many years of research. Results from research in developing countries are more ambiguous, with as many examples of a positive association as of a negative one. Lack of data comparability has often hampered interpretation of results. The World Fertility Surveys (WFS)--undertaken in 40 developing countries between 1974-81, using a common core questionnaire that included numerous questions on women's work--have created a unique opportunity to evaluate this association in a comparative framework. This article reviews and interprets the major findings on the work-fertility relationship from this and other published research on women's work and fertility, and assesses the data limitations. The article concludes with recommendations for the treatment of women's work in the design of future fertility and family planning surveys.",Studies in family planning,1991 May-Jun,United States,1991,90

1884713,Structural determinants of the psychosocial work environment: introducing technology in the work stress framework.,"To extend current models of psychosocial work stress research into organizational structure, technology is introduced. An exploratory model is developed combining research from ergonomics, epidemiology, and organizational science. It is hypothesized that technology influences a worker's health by structuring the job, and the relationship between the job and a worker's health is mediated by attitudes at work. To test the model, data are used from a 1978 NIOSH survey of postal workers sorting mail (N = 4903). Path analysis shows technology is indirectly associated with job satisfaction and psychosomatic symptoms by how it structured the job. A machine-paced technological system of work is associated with greater job demands, less control in the job, and less co-worker support but not with supervisor support. The implications of this model for prevention strategies at the workplace are discussed suggesting that influencing supervisor support is the most effective way to affect a person's job satisfaction and level of psychosomatic symptomology.",Ergonomics,1991 May,England,1991,90

Hypotheses were tested on samples of 'somatizers', 'psychologizers' and controls recruited by epidemiological procedures. Although 'somatizers' were found to be similar to 'psychologizers' in many respects, they were (i) less depressed; (ii) reported lower levels of social dissatisfaction, social stress and less dependence on their relatives; (iii) more likely to have an unsympathetic attitude towards mental illness and less likely to consult a doctor about psychological symptoms, and (iv) more likely to have received medical in-patient care as an adult before they had consulted their doctor with their current illness.

1861614,Determinants of spatial priming in environmental memory.,"Spatial priming in recognizing objects in experimentally learned environments has been proposed as strong evidence for spatial organization of environmental memory. However, in all studies showing recognition priming effects, encoding and rehearsal contiguity may have coincided with spatial proximity, and thus priming may have been due to temporal associations formed during rehearsal, not encoded spatial relations per se. We investigated this question in four experiments, using a trip trial learning method in which temporal contiguity and spatial relations were independent. In Experiment 1, no spatial priming in recognition was found, even though indirect evidence suggested that subjects had encoded spatial relations. In Experiment 2, the trip trial method was compared with the free study procedure commonly used in previous priming studies. Spatial priming occurred only for free study subjects, even though the two groups were equivalent on direct measures of encoding accuracy. In Experiment 3, spatial priming in recognition was obtained with a modification of the trip trial method in which temporal and spatial contiguity were deliberately confounded. In Experiment 4, the unmodified trip trial method produced spatial priming in a location-decision task. Taken together, our results suggest that environmental memory may be spatially organized, but retrieval of object identities does not necessarily activate encoded spatial relations.",Memory & cognition,1991 May,United States,1991,90
1860024,Is sex necessarily a risk factor to depression?,"""To isolate and quantify possible determinants of any increased prevalence of depressive disorders in women we studied a select group of men and women, initially similar in terms of a number of putative social determinants of depression, and reviewed the sample five years later when social role diversity was anticipated. We used the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) to generate DSM-III and RDC diagnoses to estimate lifetime depressive disorders, and established (via corroborative reports) the likely accuracy of those data. Despite lifetime depression being a relatively common experience, no significant sex differences in depressive episodes were demonstrated, suggesting the possible irrelevance of biological factors in determining any sex difference. As there was not major social role divergence over the five year study, we interpret the lack of a sex difference as a consequence, and suggest that findings support the view that social factors are of key relevance in determining any female preponderance in depression described in general population studies.""",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1991 May,England,1991,90
1859918,Individual differences in difficulty quitting smoking.,"This essay comments on the main approaches to studying individual differences in ability to quit smoking, and suggests complementing them with a concept of 'difficulty of quitting'. Several areas of research into determinants of ability to quit smoking are discussed, including measures of dependence, reactivity to nicotine, severity of withdrawal symptoms, endurance of discomfort, and psychological well being. A number of correlates of inability to quit may have a common denominator in stress and neuroticism. If these are the primary obstacles to quitting, changes in the composition of the smoking population and in the image of smoking can be expected which could lead to smoking losing some of its appeal for potential new recruits.",British journal of addiction,1991 May,England,1991,90
2020883,Measles control in the urbanising environment.,"The relationship between urbanisation and measles control is examined. In urban settings in developing regions measles is a disease of particular importance, since it tends to affect children at a younger age and with greater severity than in rural settings. A further finding in urban areas, especially peri-urban slums, is the lower measles vaccination coverage rates compared with rural regions. Factors identified as determinants of measles vaccination coverage among children under 2 years of age in urban areas include: home delivery; being born outside the urban setting; and length of stay in the city. These factors are probably related to the low socioeconomic status and lack of social integration experienced by new urban immigrants. A number of additional obstacles, such as distance, economic and cultural barriers, and inconvenient clinic hours all prevent parents from gaining easy access to vaccination services. In order to address the problems of measles control in expanding urban settings, a regional approach--with full integration of curative and preventive services--is called for. A more effective use of existing services will probably go a long way towards improving urban vaccination coverage with resultant measles control.",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,1991 Apr 20,South Africa,1991,90
2056748,"Consequences of person-environment incongruence: absenteeism, frustration, and stress.","Two correlational studies using English nurses and working adults are reported that examined the relationship between the three measures of person-environment (P-E) fit as derived from Holland's (1973) theory and three dependent work-related variables. In the first study, the P-E fit measures of congruence, consistency, and differentiation were correlated with two measures of absenteeism, frustration, and various demographic variables. Contrary to predictions, two measures of absenteeism were positively correlated with congruence and consistency. In accordance with the hypothesis, however, frustration was highly negatively correlated with congruence and consistency. In the second study, consistency, but not congruence or differentiation, was significantly negatively correlated with stress, as predicted. These studies provide some support for Holland's theses, although not all hypotheses were supported, both for methodological and theoretical reasons. It is argued that P-E fit measures are useful predictors of occupational behavior in conjunction with other major determinants.",The Journal of social psychology,1991 Apr,United States,1991,90
2054533,"Determinants of teenage smoking, with special reference to non-standard family background.","The prevalence of teenage smoking in a cohort of 12,058 subjects born in northern Finland in 1966 is discussed in terms of its social and family determinants, especially in ""non-standard"" families (with one or more of the parents absent for at least part of the child's upbringing). The prevalence of experimental or daily smoking was 67.4%, the rate being 65.5% in the standard, two-parent families and 75.5% in the non-standard families, the difference being statistically significant (p less than 0.001). The corresponding prevalence of daily smoking was 6.4%, but the rate was 5.1% in standard families and 12.1% in non-standard families (p less than 0.001). An elevated risk of smoking existed among adolescents who had experienced death of their father or divorce of their parents and among girls who had experienced death of their mother. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and maternal age under 20 years at the time of delivery increased the risk, while being the first-born child reduced it. Among family factors existing in 1980, paternal smoking increased the risk for both sexes, while more than three siblings, mother's unemployment or gainful employment (i.e. not a housewife) were associated with smoking by the boys as was urban living, and for the girls migration by the family to a town. The results suggest that juvenile smoking may be a kind of indicator of possible problems experienced by the parents and/or the adolescents themselves with respect to parenthood and family development.",British journal of addiction,1991 Apr,England,1991,90
2046352,Following up on treated stutterers: studies of perceptions of fluency and job status.,"The present research aimed to investigate perceptions of fluency of persons treated with a fluency shaping technique called smooth speech. Four separate studies were conducted. The first showed that virtually all those treated were satisfied with their fluency following treatment. However, this satisfaction decreased to under half in the long term. The second study showed considerable opportunity in the long term for job promotion and upgrade in occupation for persons successfully completing a smooth-speech program. The third study compared employer perceptions of their employees' speech between a group who had received treatment for stuttering and a nontreatment control. The employers' perceptions of the treatment group were significantly enhanced, whereas no significant change occurred in employers' perceptions for the control group. The last study explored possible determinants of relapse in a population of treated stutterers. Results showed that most had experienced some degree of relapse, but had subsequently recovered. Few believed their relapse was associated with being embarrassed about using smooth speech. The majority believed their relapses were related to feeling pressured to speak faster. Investigating perceptions of fluency following treatment for stuttering seems an important goal for research in order to enhance treatment effectiveness. Directions for further research into this area are discussed.",Journal of speech and hearing research,1991 Apr,United States,1991,90
1936579,Individual olfactory signatures as major determinants of early maternal discrimination in sheep.,"Responses of recently parturient ewes to their familiar versus separated (i.e., unfamiliar) twin lambs were observed in an attempt to elucidate further the characteristics of the phenotypic traits (signatures) mediating maternal recognition and bonding. Ewes responded more positively to their familiar lamb than to its twin that had been isolated at birth. Nonetheless, those same mothers also discriminated between their separated twin and unfamiliar alien lambs. Alien lambs elicited similar rejection behavior regardless of whether they had been housed with their own mother or in isolation prior to testing. Lambs appear to have individually distinct (olfactory) signatures; however, the signatures of twin siblings may be sufficiently similar to enable the mother to detect a resemblance. No evidence suggests that acquired maternal labels play a role in either the acceptance of the ewe's own lamb(s) or rejection of aliens.",Developmental psychobiology,1991 Apr,United States,1991,90
1901487,Social determinants of cataract surgery utilization in south India. The Operations Research Group.,"A field trial was conducted to compare the effects of eight health education and economic incentive interventions on the awareness and acceptance of cataract surgery. Cataract screening and follow-up surgery were offered to more than 19,000 residents age 40 years and older in a probability sample of 90 villages in south India. Eight months after intervention, an evaluation was conducted to identify those in need of surgery who had been operated on. Two principal measures of program effectiveness are examined: awareness of cataract surgery and acceptance of the surgery. The type of intervention had a negligible effect on awareness of cataract surgery. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals who were aware of surgery tended to be male, literate, and more affluent than those who were unaware of that option. Interventions that covered the complete costs of surgery had higher surgery acceptance rates. One health education strategy, house-to-house visits by a subject with aphakia, increased acceptance of the procedure more than others. In a multiple logistic regression analysis of acceptance rates, persons accepting surgery tended to be male; other factors were not important in explaining variation in acceptance rates.","Archives of ophthalmology (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",1991 Apr,United States,1991,90
1890782,[Determinants of preferences among tasks with diagnosis of his/her own ability: individual and sex differences in self-assessment motivation and self-enhancement motivation].,"There are two different views on gathering information about self. According to ""self-assessment"" view, individuals choose tasks that are diagnostic about themselves, regardless of self-esteem implications. On the other hand, according to ""self-enhancement"" view, individuals choose tasks that are diagnostic only when they have positive self-esteem implications. Present research tested these predictions in Japanese college students, using for tasks with high or low diagnosticity of success and failure. In subjects with low uncertainty of self-esteem, task preference increased with diagnosticity of success and diagnosticity of failure. This was consistent with self-assessment view. However, in subjects with high uncertainty of self-esteem, task preference didn't increase with diagnosticity of failure. In subjects with high self-esteem, task preference is high with high diagnosticity of failure than that of subjects with low self-esteem. The results suggest large individual differences in gathering information about self. They also suggest that not only self-esteem but also uncertainty of self-esteem should be considered in studies of self-enhancement motivation.",Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology,1991 Apr,Japan,1991,90
10148802,Elements for a theory of the health transition.,"This article presents the basic elements for developing a theory of the health transition. Such elements include the definition of concepts, the specification of a framework on the determinants of health status, the analysis of the mechanisms through which health change occurs in populations, the characterization of the attributes that allow us to identify different transition models, and the enumeration of the possible consequences of the transition. The propositions are presented with a sufficient level of generality as to make them applicable to different contexts; at the same time, an attempt is made to provide them with the necessary specificity to account for different national experiences, thus opening a space for future comparative research efforts. Through the systematization exercise presented in this article, we hope to contribute to the progress of a topic that has grown in importance during recent years. Such importance is due to the enormous potential that health transition theory has for understanding and transforming the growing complexity of our times.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1991 Apr,Australia,1991,90
10148801,"What have we learnt about the cultural, social and behavioural determinants of health? From selected readings to the first Health Transition Workshop.","The article explores the issue of whether the holding of an international workshop in Canberra in 1989, and the preparation of papers for it, increased our knowledge of the cultural, social and behavioural determinants of health and whether the publication of the proceedings placed new knowledge in the public domain. The approach adopted is to compare those proceedings with a collection of selected readings on the subject made shortly before as part of the same program and also with certain other publications. The conclusions reached are that, in addition to having stimulated interest in the field, the workshop and its proceedings furthered knowledge in at least five important areas: (1) the existence of mortality-prone households; (2) the impact of differing cultural situations of women in terms of individualism on their children's survival; (3) the mechanisms whereby maternal education is translated into child survival; (4) the impact of culture and ethnicity on mortality; and (5) indirect indices of the impact of care. The workshop failed to contribute to substantial advances (or draw attention to the lack of advance) in the following areas: (1) the measurement of Third World morbidity or health; (2) adult health transition; (3) the impact of radicalism or egalitarianism in communities other than Kerala and Sri Lanka on mortality; (4) the impact of lifestyle diseases on Third World mortality; (5) the identification of economically optimum mixes of social change and the provision of health services in reducing mortality and improving health; and (6) the employment of health transition knowledge in the reduction of mortality and the improvement of health.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1991 Apr,Australia,1991,90

2065639,Total and domestic consumption of salt and their determinants in three regions of Italy.,"Total and domestic (discretionary) consumption of salt was assessed in a sample of 91 households, which were randomly selected in three areas of Italy characterized by different dietary habits. Total salt intake was estimated by the mean urinary sodium in four 24 h collections. Discretionary salt, added during the preparation of the meals or at the table, was assessed using a simplified protocol of the lithium marker technique. Total sodium excretion was 191 mmol/d, 160 mmol/d and 132 mmol/d in adult males, adult females and children respectively. Dietary sodium density was 15 mmol per MJ of energy in children and 19 mmol/MJ in adults. It was significantly lower in the area where the traditional consumption of unsalted bread persists. Discretionary sodium intake was 67 mmol/d in adult males and females and 43 mmol/d in children; equivalent respectively to 36 per cent, 39 per cent and 34 per cent of total sodium intake. No difference was found between urban and rural environments, whereas discretionary use of salt was higher in the lower social class. These findings have important nutrition policy implications for the lowering of salt intake in the general population.",European journal of clinical nutrition,1991 Mar,England,1991,90
2052395,Self-efficacy and outcome expectancies: relationship to chronic pain coping strategies and adjustment.,"Recent studies suggest that coping strategies play an important role in adjustment to chronic pain. Identification of factors that influence coping could potentially help clinicians facilitate the use of adaptive coping strategies by pain patients. According to social learning theory, self-efficacy beliefs (judgments regarding one's capabilities) and outcome expectancies (judgments regarding the consequences of behaviors) are significant determinants of coping behavior. This study tested hypotheses derived from social learning theory by examining the contributions of these beliefs to the prediction of coping behavior in chronic pain patients. One hundred and fourteen chronic pain patients completed measures of health-related dysfunction, pain severity, use of 8 coping strategies, and outcome and self-efficacy expectancies regarding these coping strategies. In support of social learning theory, and consistent with research in other areas, the patients' beliefs regarding their capabilities were strongly related to reported coping efforts. Beliefs about the consequences of coping efforts and their interaction with beliefs about capabilities were generally unrelated to coping. These results suggest that treatment should emphasize the actual practice and use of adaptive coping strategies over education about their outcome.",Pain,1991 Mar,United States,1991,90

The content and extension of each hope, as well as the levels of internality, optimism and realization, were estimated from the answers. The results showed that a high level of family discussion increased interest in a future family. The influences of parental control and family discussion, however, change as adolescents grow older: the more 11-year-olds reported parental control, the less optimistic they were about the future but the more steps they had taken to realize their hopes. On the other hand, the higher the level of family discussion adolescents reported at the age of 15, the more optimistic they were and the more they had realized their hopes. Adolescents with high self-esteem were more internal in their thinking about the future than those with low self-esteem.",Journal of adolescence,1991 Mar,England,1991,90
2033940,"Prevalence and determinants of alcohol consumption among schoolchildren in Barcelona, Spain.","The pattern of use of alcoholic beverages and factors influencing it among Barcelona schoolchildren were studied; 2,255 fifth and eighth grade students from 71 schools completed a self-administered questionnaire. Between fifth-eighth grades, important changes take place in attitudes--strongly opposed to alcohol among the younger, much more moderate among the older. Family celebrations such as Christmas or birthdays are the earliest source of exposure to alcohol, at which one-third of fifth grade students and two-thirds of eighth grade students drink. In eighth grade, though daily consumption is relatively rare (4.4% for boys), a considerable proportion have been drunk at least once (16% of girls and 19% of boys) or have had four or more drinks in a row, while a small but significant proportion (2.5%) have been drunk two or more times in the last six months. A discriminant analysis uncovered some features predicting this ""higher risk"" use of alcohol: age and gender (being a boy in eighth grade), lower socioeconomic status, higher weekly allowance available for personal expenses, a pattern of usual consumption by both the father and friends, smoking regularly, and having a moderate or high physical activity level, as well as holding opinions in favor of drinking.",The Journal of school health,1991 Mar,United States,1991,90
2033939,Gender differences in psychosocial determinants of adolescent smoking.,"Because of the social meaning smoking has acquired and because of different trends in male and female initiation rates, it is reasonable to suspect that different psychosocial factors predict smoking in teen-age boys and girls. A literature review revealed external pressures such as peer and parental smoking are important for both boys and girls though their influence may be moderated differentially by age and type of smoking behavior assessed. Some data support the hypothesis that female smoking is associated with self-confidence, social experience, and rebellion, whereas male smoking is associated with social insecurity. Overall, group differences such as gender and socioeconomic status are well-documented in terms of smoking prevalence but underexplored in the area of psychosocial predictors. In this review, gender differences have been documented with sufficient frequency to warrant further attention to develop gender specific components of smoking prevention programs.",The Journal of school health,1991 Mar,United States,1991,90
2033624,What future for ethical medical practice in the new National Health Service?,"The British Government is implementing some major alterations to the way health services in Great Britain are organised. As well as the introduction of competition between health care providers, their financial interests are to be linked to their output, in efforts to use market forces to increase efficiency and cut costs. This paper looks at the possible impact of these changes of health care organisation on ethical medical practice. This is investigated with particular reference to the country whose health service has embraced most closely these elements of the market--the United States of America. The question to be answered is whether high standards of ethical care are ensured by factors somehow intrinsic to the medical profession, and are therefore immune to changes in the economics of health care. This assumption is shown to be questionable in light of what is known about the determinants of ethical medical practice.",Journal of medical ethics,1991 Mar,England,1991,90

Four studies investigated agreement between subject and collateral questionnaire reports of drinking by adults over age 60 years (N = 83), and three of these studies also assessed agreement between daily subject and collateral prospective reports of subject drinking over 4 (Study 2) or 12 (Studies 3 and 4) week intervals. Subject and collateral questionnaire reports were significantly correlated. Excellent agreement was found for the group of subjects for self-monitoring reports of the number of drinking days and quantity of alcohol consumption per day, including reports of the temporal patterning of consumption, but variability in agreement existed across subject-collateral pairs. The discussion focuses on the conditions conductive to accurate measurement and on the importance of investigating predictor variables of individual differences in the accuracy of verbal reports of alcohol consumption.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1991 Mar,United States,1991,90
1997583,Health perceptions and survival: do global evaluations of health status really predict mortality?,"Self-evaluations of health status have been shown to predict mortality, above and beyond the contribution to prediction made by indices based on the presence of health problems, physical disability, and biological or life-style risk factors. Several possible reasons for this association are discussed: (a) methodological shortcomings of previous studies render the association spurious; (b) other psychosocial influences on mortality are involved and explain the association; and (c) self-evaluations of health status have a direct and independent effect of their own. Four-year follow-up mortality data from the Yale Health and Aging Project (N = 2812) are used to explore these possibilities. The analysis controls for the contribution of numerous indicators of health problems, disability and risk factors, and also makes adjustments of standard errors for the complex sample design. The findings favor the third possibility, an independent effect, to the extent that the particular set of psychosocial factors examined did not explain the basic association, and to the extent that the control variables were an adequately comprehensive set.",Journal of gerontology,1991 Mar,United States,1991,90

Predictive variables, i.e. hyperactivity, aggression, social maladjustment and self-esteem were measured when the subjects were aged 12. Type A dimensions, i.e. hard-driving, competitiveness plus aggression and impatience were measured in the same subjects when they were aged 18. ""Impatience"" was predicted by means of preadolescent hyperactivity, and ""competitiveness-aggression"" by social maladjustment. ""Hard-driving"", which was most strongly related to CHD risk factor levels in young adulthood, was anteceded by the subject's feeling that he or she could not cope with life. This supports the hypothesis that Type A behaviour is a coping mechanism: a person tries to cope with stress by increasing his or her level of achievement.",Annals of medicine,1991 Feb,England,1991,90
2019096,Determinants of psychiatric rehospitalization: a social area analysis.,"The purpose of this paper is to develop an analytic framework and methodology for estimating the demand for psychiatric hospitalization in state facilities, either new admissions or readmissions of clients from the Community Services Boards (CSBs) of Virginia. The combination of community and organizational factors with inpatient characteristics for the CSBs can help identify pertinent predictors of psychiatric hospitalization. Review of the literature on psychiatric epidemiology shows that the predictors of psychiatric hospitalization can be classified into four major dimensions including community resources, socio-demographic factors, CSB client characteristics, and CSB organizational factors. It is postulated that the rates of first admissions and readmissions to state facilities are influenced by four dimensions. Furthermore, the variation in readmissions rates is contingent upon previous first admission rates and the average length of stays in state institutions while other conditions-such as community resources and demographics, CSB client mix, and CSB organizational factors-are simultaneously considered. The data were compiled from multiple sources. A path analytic model, using a linear structural relations program (LISREL VI), was validated. After the model was carefully fitted, the estimation equations for the rates of first admissions and readmissions were finalized. The estimates for psychiatric hospitalization, both first- and re-admissions, were made for each of the study CSBs.",Community mental health journal,1991 Feb,United States,1991,90
2010569,Identification of correlates of physical activity among Latino adults.,"127 Latino adults responded to a survey concerning physical activity. Respondents over-represented well educated and middle class Latinos. Subjects reported a mean of 48 minutes/week of walking for exercise. This sample reported less than two episodes per week of vigorous physical activity, again below the recommended 3/wk needed to insure cardiovascular fitness. We expect more representative samples to engage in less physical activity. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were conducted using 24 variables based on Social Learning Theory. A multiple R of 0.66 accounted for over 27% of the variance in walking for exercise (p less than 0.001). Older adults, those with a history of childhood injury, and those who reported friend support were more likely to walk for exercise. Respondents who participated in physical activity during childhood and adolescence (including formal physical education in school) and, paradoxically, those who had models for exercise in childhood were less likely to walk for exercise. A multiple R of 0.75 accounted for 43% of the variance in vigorous physical activity and reached significance (p less than 0.001). Self-efficacy, friends' support, childhood physical activity, and eating a heart healthy diet were positively related to vigorous activity. These results suggest that different correlates influence walking versus vigorous activity, and that correlates of physical activity are different for Latinos compared to Anglos. The findings emphasize the need for larger scale investigations of the determinants of activity within the Latino population.",Journal of community health,1991 Feb,Netherlands,1991,90

Depressed (n = 60) and nondepressed (n = 60) subjects engaged in group discussions. We assessed subjects' social competence schemata with a questionnaire and subjects' actual level of social competence in the discussion through objective ratings made by codiscussants and outside observers. We found that independently of their negative schemata, depressed subjects' social skill deficits explained a significant portion of the variance in their more negative interpretation of feedback (relative to nondepressed subjects'). This suggests that real deficits in depressed persons' performance compound the effects of their negative schemata and further contribute to their negative cognitions.

By strengthening knowledge about the determinants and mediational role of coping, the results demonstrate in a 2-group LISREL analysis that the pattern of predictive relations differs under high and low stressors. Under high stressors, personal and social resources relate to future psychological health indirectly, through more adaptive coping strategies. Under low stressors, these resources relate directly to psychological health. The results support the idea that such resources play a causal role in maintaining psychological health, and they suggest the potential for a general, adaptively oriented framework applicable to adjustment under both high and low stressors.",Journal of abnormal psychology,1991 Feb,United States,1991,90

The unifying host-agent-environment epidemiologic paradigm is applied to contemporary cancer prevention issues, principally smoking cessation and dietary modification, to demonstrate differences in inferences, prevention strategies, and research opportunities. An integration of population-based approaches with the dynamics of patient behavior and risks for cancer is especially salient when considering the role of psychosocial stress and personal and social resources. The social epidemiologic perspective, the study of the psychosocial determinants of physical health status, offers one approach for resolving the outlined differences in perspectives and is particularly relevant for understanding the etiology of life-style behaviors and how they might be altered.",Cancer,1991 Feb 1,United States,1991,90

Assuming no environmental transmission from parents to offspring, heritability was estimated at 0.43 for both anxiety and depression scores, and common sibling environment or reciprocal sibling influence explained 19% of the variances for both scores. Most of the (genetic or environmental) family effect seemed to be common for the two scores. There was no evidence of common determinants in the family for the symptom scores and alcohol consumption, not even of any substantial relationship within persons between symptoms and consumption. The spouse correlations were 0.25 for anxiety and 0.38 for depression. Similar values for the correlations between anxiety in one person and depression in his/her spouse implies a mate selection based on a single latent variable to which the two observed traits contribute.",Journal of affective disorders,1991 Feb,Netherlands,1991,90

A methodology is presented for assessing the effects of ""underlying"" social factors and ""proximate"" behavioral and biomedical factors on infant morbidity, growth, and mortality. The method is applied to data collected from over 3,000 children in Cebu, Philippines, over the first 2 years of life. Data were collected between 1983 and 1985. A central theme is that mothers recognize certain observable and nonobservable threats to the health of their infants, and that the mothers take measures to reduce the risk from such threats. It is shown that if conventional statistical techniques (which do not take such behaviors into account) are used, the estimates of the effect of the risk factors on health are incorrect. Procedures for obtaining correct estimates are described. The application of the methodology is illustrated by modeling childhood diarrhea, and by showing how maternal education induces behavioral changes, and how these changes, in turn, induce changes in the prevalence of childhood diarrhea.",American journal of epidemiology,1991 Jan 15,United States,1991,90

The Social Readjustment Rating Scale of Holmes and Rahe was used to assign maternal stress scores established during an interview conducted within 36 hours of delivery. Only mothers without medical problems who had delivered liveborn infants were included. Maternal age, obstetric history, smoking history and stresses present during the 12 months preceding delivery were recorded. Of 535 Johannesburg and 662 Baragwanath mothers studied, 48% and 55% respectively reported significant stresses. Analysis of the two groups revealed that for the Johannesburg mothers, smoking, cumulative stress score and previous preterm birth were important determinants of birth weight.

28590572,Sources of measurement variation in child anthropometry in the Malawi maternal and child nutrition study.,"An examination of intra- and inter-observer error in child anthropometry and variation between two skinfold calipers was conducted as part of a large prospective study of maternal and child nutrition in Malawi, Central Africa. Measurements include length, weight, head and arm circumferences, triceps and subscapular skinfolds, and estimated cross-sectional arm fat and arm muscle areas. Total observer error, expressed as a percentage of total variance in each trait, is 3.2% for length, weight, and head circumference; 7% for arm circumference; 10% for arm fat area; and 16-20% for skinfolds and arm muscle area. When total observer error is divided into the two additive components studied, intraobserver error represents approximately 50% or more of total observer error for most traits. An exception is the subscapular skinfold for which intra-observer represents 38% of total observer error. Errors of this magnitude will cause an attenuation of approximately 10% in the correlation coefficients between anthropometric and other variables, and a loss of power in attempting to detect associations between anthropometric variables and either their determinants or outcomes. However, the effects of errors of this magnitude are minor compared to those encountered in studies correlating nutrient intake with other variables. This study also finds that the SlimGuide caliper systematically overestimates skinfolds at low readings and underestimates skinfolds at high readingss relative to the Lange caliper.",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,1991,United States,1991,90
28520302,Malawi maternal and child nutrition study: Study design and anthropometric characteristics of children and adults.,"The Malawi Maternal and Child Nutrition (MMCN) Study is a three-year longitudinal investigation of some of the determinants and consequences of protein-energy malnutrition in a rural African population. This paper describes the anthropometric characteristics of children and adults based on the baseline census conducted in the 89 villages included in the MMCN Study. Mean length-for-age of Malawian children (birth-60 months) is very low (Z-score = -2.21) and, unlike most other populations, continues to decline with advancing age. Weight-for-length is more nearly normal (mean Z-score = -0.21) but shows the same age-related decline between birth and 18 months (and subsequent return to normal levels) as that seen in many other developing countries. This age pattern is also reflected in upper arm anthropometry, notably estimated arm fat area. Length-for-age and weight-for-age of children is associated with birthweight in the 40% of children having health cards, but body composition indicators do not show the same consistent association with birthweight at all ages. Adult men and women have very low skinfold thicknesses relative to U.S. blacks (50-60% of U.S. medians at the triceps and subscapular sites). Estimated upper arm cross-sectional muscle (plus bone) area for Malawian men averages 74% of U.S. white values, while that for women averages 100% of U.S. white values.",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,1991,United States,1991,90

This controversy includes both the importance of diet as a precursor of an unfavorable lipid profile, and the potential importance of social and psychological factors in determining lipid values. These questions were addressed in a study of serum lipids in urban Brazil. It was found that both dietary and social-psychological factors were associated with total serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum triglycerides. This exploratory study highlights the importance of the careful measurement of dietary intake, and the inclusion of theoretically relevant social and psychological variables, in any study of serum lipids.",Social science & medicine (1982),1991,England,1991,90

Subject compliance was assessed through the use of study nurse independent ratings. The 20 most compliant and 20 least compliant subjects were surveyed at a 6-month interval using a self-report instrument designed to assess perceived social support and other psychosocial factors thought to effect compliance. Results indicated that more adherent subjects lived further from their treatment site, did not live alone, saw their study nurse as supportive, and were more likely to depend on a significant other for a wide range of social, economic, and emotional support. Implications for the practical use of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are proposed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1991,England,1991,90
2065114,Genetic determinants of susceptibility to the rewarding and other behavioral actions of cocaine.,"The role of genotype as a determinant of biologically based inter-individual differences in vulnerability to substance abuse has received little systematic investigation except in the case of alcohol. This report describes the use of an animal model, the inbred mouse, to identify and to characterize variants with inherently altered susceptibilities to the rewarding and other behavioral actions of cocaine. Among a battery of nine inbred strains chosen solely for their genetic diversity, genetic polymorphisms commonly occurred which altered the potency and/or efficacy of cocaine to induce conditioned place preference, oral self-administration, motor activity activation, seizures and lethality. These changes in cocaine sensitivity generally were of a behavior-specific and pharmacodynamic nature. One strain, DBA/2J, found to be markedly hyporesponsive to the rewarding action of cocaine, also was hyporesponsive to the rewarding effects of amphetamine, etonitazene, phencyclidine, caffeine and procaine. We speculate that this strain has an inherent generalized appetitive defect. The frequent occurrence and large magnitude of inherent phenotypic changes in cocaine responsiveness which we have identified among inbred mouse strains now permits an analytical genetic study of processes underlying cocaine-mediated reinforcement.",Journal of addictive diseases,1991,England,1991,90
2065113,Is there a common biological basis for reinforcement from alcohol and other drugs?,"Vulnerability to substance abuse is an important emerging issue. A critical aspect of this phenomenon is the degree to which individuals who abuse one substance are likely to abuse other substances, alone or in combination with each other. The extent to which several distinct drugs will come to serve as positive reinforcers within genetically defined subjects defines their commonality. Questions in this area are directed at determining whether reinforcement from and abuse of alcohol and other drugs define variations within a single behavioral phenomenon, or whether reinforcement and abuse must be individually defined for each substance involved. Findings related to this commonality issue are now emerging from the areas of pharmacogenetics and operant drug self-administration. Previous studies have shown that ethanol can be readily established as a positive reinforcer in LEWIS rats, as well as C57BL/6J mice. In low ethanol preferring F344 rats, ethanol maintains significant but low levels of responding. Ethanol does not maintain lever pressing behavior in BALB/cJ mice, and is avoided in DBA/2J mice. Initial findings reported in this paper show that these genotypic patterns of reinforcement from ethanol appear to correlate highly with patterns of reinforcement from cocaine and opiates. From these findings it is concluded that (1) there exist important genetic determinants of drug reinforced behavior; and (2) drug seeking behaviors maintained by ethanol, cocaine and opiates may have at least some common biological determinants.",Journal of addictive diseases,1991,England,1991,90

We draw predictions from industrialism and dependency theories for the explanation of social security programs. The explanations are tested with data on seventy-five nations, representative of core, semipheripheral and peripheral nations. Industrialization variables such as the percentage of older adults and economic productivity have strong effects in models involving all nations, as does multinational corporate (MNC) penetration in extraction, particularly when region is controlled; such penetration is negatively associated with spending on social security. We then look at industrialism and dependency effects for peripheral and non-core nations alone. The effects of all industrialization variables, except economic productivity, appear insignificant for peripheral nations, while the effects of region and multinational corporate penetration in extractive and agricultural industries appears significant. Models involving all non-core nations (peripheral and semi-peripheral) look more like models for all nations than for peripheral nations alone.",International journal of aging & human development,1991,United States,1991,90

2029940,Tailoring family planning services to the special needs of adolescents.,"Experimental service protocols tailored to the needs of teenage family planning patients were developed that emphasized indepth counseling, education geared to an adolescent's level of development, and the provision of reassurance and social support. These protocols were tested against usual service delivery practices in a study involving 1,261 patients under 18 years of age at six nonmetropolitan family planning clinics. A comparison with teenagers obtaining services at control sites found that six months after their first clinic visit, patients at the experimental sites were more likely to be using a method, were less likely to experience difficulty in dealing with problems, were more likely to continue using their method despite problems and had learned more during the educational session. Teenage patients at the experimental clinics were also less likely to have become pregnant within one year than those who went to control clinics. Attrition during the year following the first study visit was similar among both groups; patient satisfaction was very high, and equivalent at experimental and control sites. The data show that the extra time and effort required to meet the special needs of teenagers is justified by their improved contraceptive use, greater knowledge and lower pregnancy rates.",Family planning perspectives,1991 Jan-Feb,United States,1991,90

Clinical management involves patients managing a complex and variable regimen. This article reviews the determinants of effective self-management and the methods of promoting better self-management. Trait variables (e.g., personality and demographics) have been presumed to affect self-management, but evidence suggests they have little impact. The important determinants of self-management are transient situational factors such as psychological stress and social pressure to eat. Interventions to promote better self-management have reported initial improvements in blood glucose control, but the long-term effects are unclear. We conclude that self-management has been inadequately assessed and that attempts to improve self-management have relied excessively on providing information. More research is needed to clarify determinants of self-management, and interventions to improve self-management will need to change these determinants.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1991,United States,1991,90

The correlation for MZA pairs was .61 and the correlation for MZT pairs was .75. These correlations did not differ significantly, nor did correlations differ between MZA pairs subclassified as having been raised in relatively more or less similar environments.

2014415,Determinants of mental illness in a rural Ethiopian adult population.,"A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 2000 adult Ethiopians living in rural communities to determine firstly the prevalence of mental illness and secondly its association with stress and demographic variables. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire developed by WHO experts was used as the measure of mental illness. A modified version of the Holmes-Rahe Social Readjustment Scale was the measure of stress. Respondents were interviewed in their homes. Those experiencing 11 or more of the 20 neurotic symptoms and 3 or more of the 4 psychotic symptoms were considered mentally ill. Despite the use of high cut-off points for identifying potential cases, the prevalence of mental illness was 17.2%--neurotic 11.2% and psychotic 6.0%. This is higher than earlier reports for Ethiopia, but comparable to rates found in other African countries. Mental illness scores were most strongly associated with stress in that the odds of experiencing 6 or more stressful life events in the past year were 2.7 times greater for neurotics and 2.1 times greater for psychotics. In addition, neuroses and psychoses were significantly associated with a family history of mental illness and with being divorced, separated or widowed. Neurosis alone was also associated with chronic illness, females, those between the ages of 35 and 44, and illiteracy. These findings were discussed in terms of their relevance for identifying high stress groups and thus for preventing mental illness through community activities.",Social science & medicine (1982),1991,England,1991,90
2014409,The Tromso Study: predictors of self-evaluated health--has society adopted the expanded health concept?,"The determinants of self-evaluated general health status were examined in a comprehensive population study of 9408 men aged 20-61 and 9152 women aged 20-56. Reduced self-evaluated health was in both sexes closely related to symptoms and diseases connected to the musculo-skeletal system and psycho-social problems and less to age and some of the major chronic diseases. Physical activity at leisure time and workload were positively associated with self-evaluated health. Our findings indicate that an important dimension reflected by self-evaluation of health is the individual's perception of own physical performance and suffice in general. There is a striking gap between the conditions which reduce the population's subjective perceived health and our ability to offer these conditions effective treatment through the health care system. This suggests differences in health concept between the medical society and the population. The association between our applied measure and coronary risk profile, based on serum cholesterol, blood pressure and cigarette smoking, was found to be almost non-existent. This supports previous findings of self-evaluation of health as an independent predictor of survival.",Social science & medicine (1982),1991,England,1991,90
2004868,Women and AIDS in Zimbabwe: the making of an epidemic.,"As the AIDS epidemic in Africa assumes major proportions, the need to understand the social context in which heterosexual transmission occurs takes on urgent importance. In this article we explore how the intersection of traditional culture with the colonial legacy and present-day political economy has influenced family structure and sexual relations, and particularly the social position of women. Drawing on Zimbabwe's historical experience, we show how land expropriation, rural impoverishment, and the forcible introduction of male migrant labor fostered new patterns of sexual relations, characterized by multiple partners. Traditional patriarchal values reinterpreted in European law resulted in further subjugation of women as even limited rights to ownership were withdrawn. For many women, sexual relations with men, either within marriage (for the majority) or outside, become inextricably linked to economic and social survival. In this setting, all sexually transmitted diseases became rampant, including genital ulcer, which facilitates transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Intervention programs to halt the spread of AIDS need to take into the account the epidemic's historical roots and social nature. For example, efforts to reduce risk of HIV transmission should seek to expand women's limited options, both technically (e.g., by providing alternatives to condoms) and socially (e.g., by promoting employment).","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1991,United States,1991,90
2002204,Academic underachievement in children with epilepsy.,"Academic achievement was studied in 78 children with epilepsy, ages 5 to 13 years, to determine how seizures, treatment of seizures, and sociocultural factors influence academic achievement. Cognitive abilities were assessed with either the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised. Achievement was measured with the Peabody Individual Achievement Tests. Achievement scores were corrected for cognitive ability (IQ), and underachievement was defined as achievement score 1/2 standard deviation or more below IQ. Information regarding seizure history (severity, duration) and treatment with anticonvulsant drugs was obtained. In addition, the family was extensively interviewed regarding the child's environment, behavior, and demographic background. The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) scale was completed on a home visit. Underachievement was frequent, ranging from 16% (Reading Recognition) to 50% (General Knowledge), but there was no relationship between severity or duration of seizure disorder or total exposure to anticonvulsant medications and achievement. Major determinants of achievement included subscales of the HOME scale, age (older children more likely to be underachieving), and parental education. An equal proportion of newly diagnosed and/or untreated subjects were underachieving compared to those with longstanding epilepsy and anticonvulsant drug treatment.",Journal of child neurology,1991 Jan,United States,1991,90
1956905,The institutionalization of operations research.,"When the conceptualization of OR is inappropriate, institutionalization will not take place. For this reason, the discussion here has focused as much on the pitfalls in OR design as on factors that facilitate institutionalization. Research that is inappropriately adapted to the societal or programmatic context will not be institutionalized, nor will OR lead to institutionalized research capabilities if theory is ignored or the research lacks credibility. The institutionalization of credible and scientifically sound OR requires well-trained social scientists who can carry out this task. Career opportunities must persist in OR so that well-trained scientists will find in an attractive and rewarding pursuit. Long-term projects facilitate institutionalization by providing a setting where work teams can be developed and career tracks defined. Academics and universities institutionalize OR by sponsoring training in applied research and developing high-level research leadership. For this reason, institutional linkages and mechanisms that nurture collaboration facilitate the institutionalization of OR. Finally, institutionalization of OR implies that research is being utilized for action by program management and the policy community. There is extensive literature on the determinants of research utilization, much of which is relevant to the question of how OR can be institutionalized.",Progress in clinical and biological research,1991,United States,1991,90

Overall stopping ratios or ""quit ratios"" (i.e., ratios between ex- and ever-smokers) were 20.5% for males and 9.0% for females in the 1983 survey, and rose to 23.2 and 11.9% respectively in 1986-87. With reference to age, stopping rates were slightly higher for females than for males below age 35, but considerably higher for males in each subsequent age group, particularly in middle age. Ratios were apparently higher for the most recent survey for both sexes and each subsequent age group. After standardisation for age, ""quit ratios"" in both sexes were directly related with education. Cessation of smoking was more common in northern (and richer) areas of the country, and positively associated with the prevalence of smoking-related chronic diseases. The major, and most discouraging, finding from these analyses is the absolute low rate of stopping in Italy as compared to northern America or northern Europe, although some positive tendency towards increasing cessation was evident between the early and the late 1980s. These tendencies, together with some recent drops in smoking prevalence in younger women, first observed after decades of increase, indicate a change at least in attitudes towards reporting smoking, and hence social acceptance of the habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1991,Switzerland,1991,90

This analysis assesses the determinants of successful aging--whether or not an individual will live to an advanced age, continue to function well at home, and remain mentally alert. Over 100 separate indicators of demographic and socio-economic status, social supports, health and mental status in 1971 were available as potential predictors of successful aging. Indicators of access to health care over the period 1970-82 and indicators of diseases over this period were also available as predictors. Those who aged successfully were shown to have greater satisfaction with life in 1983 and to have made fewer demands on the health care system than those who aged less well. Despite the large number of potential predictors of successful aging which were examined, only age, four measures of health status, two measures of mental status, and not having one's spouse die or enter a nursing home were shown to be predictive of successful aging.",American journal of public health,1991 Jan,United States,1991,90

Substantial increases in condom use were observed, and these changes were unrelated to attrition and cohort bias. In terms of predictors of condom use, men who always used condoms had higher levels of social support from informal sources of help, had more positive expectations that condoms would have positive interpersonal and personal consequences, and were more likely to be HIV positive than men who used condoms occasionally or never.

1871990,Gender differences in teenage smoking.,"This study analyzes the patterns and correlates of gender differences in cigarette smoking in a national sample of white high school seniors in 1985. More females than males were smokers, because females had higher rates for the early stages of smoking adoption. Specifically, females were more likely to have tried smoking at least once and, among those who had tried smoking, females were more likely to have smoked more than once or twice. Gender differences in smoking varied, depending on the students' characteristics. For example, the female excess in the early stages of smoking adoption was small or absent among rural students or very religious students, apparently because traditional values inhibit smoking adoption more among females than among males. We estimated the contributions of gender differences in students' characteristics to gender differences in smoking adoption. For example, males were more involved in sports, and this appears to be one reason why males had lower rates of smoking adoption than females. On the other hand, males had more deviant behavior and attitudes, and this would be expected to contribute to greater smoking adoption by males. The findings of this study indicate important gender differences in the determinants of smoking adoption.",Women & health,1991,United States,1991,90
1871609,"Response of parents to five killer diseases among children in a Yoruba community, Nigeria.","This paper examines the various ways through which adults' health beliefs and attitudes affect their responses to five major killer diseases during childhood. The data for the study were derived from in-depth interviews conducted between December 1988 and January 1989 in a Yoruba community, Nigeria. The diseases covered in the study include diarrhoea, measles, tetanus, pertussis and fever. It was observed that teething and food related causes were believed to be responsible for diarrhoea; the cause of measles and pertussis was generally unknown; tetanus was usually associated with convulsions; and fever was believed to be caused by roaming in the sun and by constipation. Herbal tea, modern drugs and prayers were the most commonly prescribed treatments for these diseases. It was observed that most mothers used alternative sources of health care, rather than hospitals, clinics and maternity centres, in their treatment of diseases among children. Prominent among the alternative sources were patent medicine stores where there were personalistic social interaction between clients and operators, free consultancy and flexible pricing. Parents' location at the time of a child's sickness, access to good advisers, the perceived seriousness of the sickness and religious beliefs of mothers were important determinants of their response. Avoidance of blame was noted to be a major motivating force in parents' search for potential sources of health care. The paper concludes that although some of the practices might have negative health implications, they could be usefully adapted to the goal of self-reliance in medical care as a strategy for attaining health for all by the year 2000.",Social science & medicine (1982),1991,England,1991,90
1845572,Common mechanisms of reinforcement from alcohol and other drugs.,"Vulnerability to substance abuse is an important social and scientific issue. A critical aspect of this phenomenon is the degree to which individuals who abuse one substance are likely to abuse other substances. The extent to which several pharmacologically distinct drugs will come to serve as positive reinforcers within genetically defined subjects defines their community with respect to abuse liability. Questions in this area are directed at determining whether reinforcement from and abuse of alcohol and other drugs define variations within a single behavioral phenomenon, or whether reinforcement and abuse must be individually defined for each substance involved. Previous studies have shown that ethanol can be readily established as a positive reinforcer in LEWIS rats and C57BL/6J mice. In low ethanol preferring F344 rats, ethanol maintains significant but low levels of responding. Ethanol does not maintain behavior in BALB/cJ or DBA/2J mice. These genotypic patterns of reinforcement from ethanol appear to correlate highly with patterns of reinforcement from cocaine and opiates. Other studies suggest that some aspects of drug self-administration may be mediated in part by common dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms, and animals which differ in ethanol drinking behavior show substantial differences in parameters of serotonergic function. Thus, there may exist important genetic determinants of drug reinforced behavior.","Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire). Supplement",1991,England,1991,90
1807070,Cognitive orientation and genital infections in young women.,"The purpose was to explore the psychological determinants of common genital infections in young women. The study was done in the framework of the cognitive orientation theory which assumes that cognition guides behavior and provides predictions of behaviors and psychophysiological phenomena. We expected that beliefs of four types (about self, norms, goals, and general) would predict the occurrence and/or frequency of 17 gynecological symptoms (e.g., itching, swelling, different vaginal discharges, abscesses). The subjects were 195 female volunteers, undergraduates, about 23 years old, without gross gynecological disorders, mostly (87.7%) unmarried, mostly (83.6%) having had intercourse. They were administered anonymously questionnaires about demographic variables, frequency and treatment of gynecological symptoms and 3 urological ones (for control), and about cognitive orientation that referred to pretested themes (e.g., assertiveness, hypochondriasis). Stepwise discriminant and regression analyses showed that the belief types enabled predicting the occurrence and frequency of all symptoms, with a mean 34.5% improvement over the 50% chance level, accounting for 45.7-67.2% of the variance. Also the urological symptoms were predicted although at a lower level. Discussion focuses on the specificity of cognitive-motivational determinants and their role in producing conditions favoring physical pathology.",Women & health,1991,United States,1991,90
1805368,Determinants of the evolution of the health situation of the population.,"The objective of the present project is to evaluate the relative importance of different governmental social programmes for health development during the 1970's. National statistics available for the whole period and disaggregated to district level were analyzed with particular regard to three indicators of infant health status when the infant mortality rate was used, increased access to secondary care and improved socio-economic status were related to improvement in infant health status. When the percentage of neonatal deaths or the percentage of deceased live births per woman was used, neither the socio-economic improvement nor the assess to secondary did explain the improvement. Moreover, the primary health programme did not seem to be of importance in explaining the changes in the three indicators of infant health status. A second phase of the project, currently ongoing, is aimed at the evaluation of other factors such as the degree of efficiency of some of the health programmes. This study is based on directly collected information, quantitative as well as qualitative. Structured interviews have been used together with anthropological information from in-depth interviews with individuals and groups. The preliminary results of this second phase indicate that the contradictions observed in the first phase might be due to shortcomings in the national registers. In one of the study areas the coverage of PHC developed earlier than indicated by the official information. In other areas it was found that different obstacles as access problems, lack of health centers, socio-economical problems and lack of cultural knowledge reduced the effectiveness and impact of the primary health programmes.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine.

1805367,"Socioeconomic development, health interventions and mortality decline in Costa Rica.","Costa Rica, whose life expectancy was 74 years by 1985, has reached a health level comparable to a developed country. The health achievements of this country are product of political and socioeconomic circumstances as well as of right public health policies. Until about 1970 the features of Costa Rica mortality, although somewhat better than the Latin American average, evolved in a similar way to the rest of the region. In particular, the decades of 1940s and 1950s saw dramatic improvements in life expectancy, thanks mainly to the import of low-cost, high-effectiveness health technologies. In the 1970s, however, Costa Rica departed from a regional pattern of stagnation and managed to close the gap with developed countries in terms of mortality levels. A dramatic decline in the infant mortality rate from 60 to 19 per 1,000 took place in this decade. The main determinants of this breakthrough were health interventions, notably a primary health care program, even though favorable socioeconomic conditions and a reduced fertility also played a role. Ecological data and other evidence suggest that up to three fourths of the mortality decline was accounted for contemporary improvements in public health services, with about 40 percent attributable to primary health care interventions. Furthermore, by targeting interventions on the less privileged population, these interventions had the merit of reducing geographic and socioeconomic differentials in child mortality.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine.

1796339,Predicting elderly cardiac patients at risk for readmission.,"Elder patients with cardiac disease are at high risk for physical deterioration during post hospital recovery and suffer frequent early readmission. It is important to identify such patients who frequently need help with discharge planning from social workers during their first admission. This study utilized computerized data on 628 patients, 238 of whom were readmissions. Question was raised as to what factors (functional, psychological, social and environmental), differentiated patients who were readmitted from those who were not. Using logistic regression, three variables: marital status, presence of coping difficulty and age of patients were identified as predictors of readmission within three months. Those who were married were less likely to be readmitted. Those with coping difficulties and older individuals were more likely to be readmitted. The accuracy of prediction, using these three factors, was 61 percent. Of those patients predicted as not being readmitted, sixty-nine percent were correctly predicted, while 39 percent were readmitted. Of patients predicted as readmissions, 49 percent were correctly predicted, while 51 percent were not. The major limitation of this study was that key physiological determinants of readmission were not collected. It is imperative that a valid screening device for predicting who is at risk for readmission should include physiological preconditions as well as functional and psychosocial data.",Social work in health care,1991,United States,1991,90

1789165,Sexual activity and contraceptive use among low-income urban black adolescent females.,"A modified form of Nathanson and Becker's (1983) Health Belief Model Questionnaire and other measures designed to assess cognitive processing were administered to low-income black adolescent female clients of an inner-city comprehensive health care clinic. The purpose of the study was to explore determinants of sexual activity and contraceptive use. Subjects were classified as not sexually active (n = 50), sexually active/noncontracepting (n = 20), or sexually active/contracepting (n = 72). Not sexually active subjects tended to be younger, more career motivated, to have a father at home, to be more influenced by family values, and to have more conservative attitudes regarding adolescent sexuality than did sexually active subjects. Sexually active/noncontracepting subjects tended to report fewer benefits and more barriers to the use of contraception. Level of cognitive processing did not differ among the three groups, but was at a lower-than-expected level for age. Finally, inconsistent contraceptive use was common to both sexually active groups.",Adolescence,1991 Winter,United States,1991,90
1769760,Sterilization of workers from pesticide exposure: the causes and consequences of DBCP-induced damage in Costa Rica and beyond.,"Public health hazards from the use of agricultural pesticides have received increasing attention in developing as well as industrial nations. This article examines a remarkable case of massive sterilization of approximately 1,500 workers in Costa Rica, due to exposure to a toxic nematicide called DBCP 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane), applied in large commercial banana plantations. Although the product was used during the 1970s, sterile victims have continued to be diagnosed through the 1980s. The effects include psychological trauma as well as permanent infertility. The case has international repercussions because several hundred workers have filed law suits against the U.S.-based transnational DBCP manufacturers, and because DBCP use was continued during the 1980s in other developing nations. The author analyzes the causes behind this serious impairment. It is argued that the contributing factors include not only biomedical processes and technical dimensions (i.e., how DBCP was used), but most importantly, political-economic factors that explain how and why DBCP was used despite the severe hazard. The crucial determinants pertain to the dominance of short-term profit motives, and the control over information and technology by the manufacturers (who concealed early toxicological research evidence of the reproductive hazards) and by the managers of the banana producer-companies. This case well illustrates problems and injustices from labor exploitation and resource extraction from transnational agro-industries. The article concludes with a brief summary of policy implications from the case.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1991,United States,1991,90
1753246,Medical educational and functional determinants of employment after stroke.,To evaluate the medical educational and functional determinants of employment after stroke a total of 204 Patients were assessed for functional changes during rehabilitation and after one year. Additionally the educational and social background of each patient was documented. One year after discharge from the rehabilitation unit 11.3% of the patients worked full-time and 2.7% part time. Another 14.7% had the decision pension versus employment still pending and 0.5% were classified as unemployed. 70.8% received regular retirement plan payments or disability pensions. Generally a similar level of functional capabilities can be observed after one year for working and non-working patients except for manual dexterity. Early admission to rehabilitation (within the first 12 weeks) favours return to work. A high school degree qualifying for university entrance and a well paid and better qualified profession as well are correlated with a higher percentage of patients regaining their employment. An other determining factor of employment after CVA is the physical requirement of the former work. Most of the working patients (92%) had been either transferred onto a job suited for an handicapped people or their work plan had been restructured accordingly.,Journal of neural transmission.

1752842,Linking descriptive and experimental analyses in the treatment of bizarre speech.,"Descriptive and experimental methods were used to analyze the environmental determinants of an adult's bizarre speech. A descriptive analysis of behavior under natural conditions indicated that bizarre vocalizations occurred most often in the presence of task-related demands and in the absence of adult attention. Further, bizarre speech occurring during tasks was followed frequently by the cessation of task demands by staff or the subject's voluntary disengagement from task-related activities; bizarre speech observed during noninteractional periods (i.e., in the absence of adult attention) was frequently followed by staff attention. The escape and attention hypotheses were tested under analogue conditions. Results of the experimental analysis supported only the attention hypothesis; that is, bizarre speech appeared to function as an attention-producing behavior. The functional analysis data were used to select two different yet functionally equivalent treatments. The first treatment provided the subject with noncontingent scheduled attention. The second intervention taught the subject social language skills in the form of initiation and expansion statements. Both interventions were effective in suppressing maladapted speech. Advantages of linking descriptive and experimental analyses are discussed.",Journal of applied behavior analysis,1991 Fall,United States,1991,90
1749959,Seasonality of vital events in a Pacific Island population.,"Analyses of vital data derived from a family record register for the native population of Guam reveal significant variations in births, deaths, and marriages over the period 1901-41. Although lacking marked photoperiod or temperature changes of temperate zones, the tropical island is subject to marked seasonal differences in rainfall characteristic of western Pacific islands. Marital patterns exhibit troughs associated respectively with the Lenten period and with Christmas celebrations. Infant and childhood deaths show close correspondence with rainfall patterns, consistently exceeding expected values during the rainy season (July-November) when conditions are optimal for the spread of communicable and gastrointestinal diseases. Births attain a peak in November, or at the beginning of the more advantageous season for infant health and survival. Seasonality in vital events, reported for many Euroamerican and some African and Asian populations of modern and historical periods, has rarely been documented for native populations of the tropical Pacific. Comparisons of differences in these patterns among different populations in varied environments provide unique opportunities to evaluate causal models of interactions among biological, sociocultural, and physioenvironmental factors.",Social biology,1991 Spring-Summer,United States,1991,90

Data are from the Determinants of Natural Fertility Study conducted from 1975 to 1978 among some 2,000 women in Matlab thana. ""The statistical analyses show that breastfeeding type at various stages of the child's life is a significant predictor of infant mortality, even when variables such as...mother's [age], education, religion and SES [socioeconomic status] are included in the model. The study shows that infants breastfed at birth have better probabilities of survival relative to those who are never breastfed or are given liquid supplements very early in life.

2292740,Why doctors do what they do: determinants of physician behavior.,"Direct payments to physicians account for about 20% of the medical care dollar, but physician decisions cause over 80% of the costs of medical care. Decision making can be viewed in a number of ways: as pure information processing, as an interaction with various stimuli, including financial penalties and incentives, and as social behavior, interacting with and reacting to peer and leadership influence. The model that accounts for the greatest amount of the available data is a multifactorial one that takes all of these views into account. The most successful behavior change efforts use a variety of mutually reinforcing approaches, and must be present constantly or behaviors revert to highly variable (lower quality) actions and decisions. This appears to be a behavioral version of the second law of thermodynamics (entropy increases spontaneously). The best practice model to manage costs and quality appears to be one in which physicians and administrators have adequate up to date information available, make group decisions, develop and continuously improve agreed upon methods of practice, interact and think before acting, and have rewards for such behavior.",Journal of occupational medicine. : official publication of the Industrial Medical Association,1990 Dec,United States,1990,90
2292691,Life events and difficulties preceding stroke.,"Life events and difficulties were recorded for the year before stroke, using a standardised semi-structured interview, in 113 surviving patients seen after their first ever in a lifetime stroke. An age and sex-matched control group (n = 109) was also interviewed about the preceding year. The stroke patients reported fewer non-threatening events and events with only a short-term threat, while difficulties were reported with equal frequency by the two groups. However, events which were severely threatening in the long-term were significantly more common in the stroke patients (in the 52 weeks before stroke 26% versus 13%, odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.9). The increased rate was apparent throughout the year and not just in the weeks immediately before stroke onset. The number of stroke patients experiencing severe events in the follow up year fell to the level found in the control group. Recognised risk factors for stroke were found equally in those patients with and without severe events before onset, except that hypertension was rather less common in the patients who had experienced a severe event. It therefore appears that severe life events may be one of the determinants of stroke onset.","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",1990 Dec,England,1990,90

Admission problems and patterns.,"In an age-matched sample of male and female inpatient alcoholics (n = 518) of the same ethnic background, subjects under 35 years of age described significantly more problem areas than older age groups. Elderly subjects over 55 were the least articulate group. The first-ever addiction treatment subjects reported the lowest mean number of years of problem drinking, the lowest mean Michigan Alcoholic Screening Test scores and the lowest mean daily alcohol intakes. They also displayed greater current social stability than the 2 readmission treatment categories. The general determinants of admission to this addiction unit centered around the experience of crises, social instability and psychological complaints. The most important specific determinants for the individual subject were the propensity to fight when drunk, followed by a positive parental history of excess alcohol intake. Criminal and occupational factors were infrequently encountered in female subjects, but widowhood was common in the older ones.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,1990 Dec,United States,1990,90
2285455,The effect of an educational program on knowledge & attitudes about blood pressure by junior high school students: a pilot project.,"This study tested the effectiveness of a 10 minute videotape and complementary print program guide on the knowledge and attitudes of junior high school students about blood pressure (BP). A randomized two group pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test design was used. The experimental group received an educational session on BP, designed for this study, which consisted of a 40-minute session, comprised of a 10-minute video presentation and discussion by the teacher on BP (guided by the program guide). The educational session was effective in improving students knowledge of BP at one week post-test; however, this positive effect did not persist at the three month post-test. Student interest in, or knowledge of, their own BP was not obviously affected by the session. The findings were interpreted in light of Social Learning Theory (SLT) and the PRECEDE Model of Health Education (PMHE). In testing the effect of one component of an educational program, i.e., the videotape and teacher lesson the environmental determinants of behaviour change could not be addressed in this study. The educational session was able, however, to achieve the desired knowledge change. The 10-minute videotape and complementary print program guide was shown to be a viable educational tool and can therefore be utilized as a resource in a broader multi-faceted program of cardiovascular (CV) health promotion.",Canadian journal of cardiovascular nursing = Journal canadien en soins infirmiers cardio-vasculaires,1990 Dec,Canada,1990,90

However, the link between panic/agoraphobia and Axis II disorders does not appear to be specific because (1) general features such as neuroticism, stress, dysphoric mood, and interpersonal sensitivity, rather than duration and severity of panic attacks and phobias, emerge as unique predictors or determinants of personality disorder; and (2) similar personality profiles are obtained in a heterogenous population of psychiatric outpatients or patients with social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depression.",The Psychiatric clinics of North America,1990 Dec,United States,1990,90

The patients were stratified according to their parities in relation to their levels of formal education. The results showed that those with the least formal education were the most parous (p less than 0.005) and had the highest perinatal deaths. The difference between perinatal deaths suffered by mothers with no formal education and those with post-secondary school education was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). No association was demonstrated between the level of formal education and the delivery of low birthweight infants. When compared with grandmultiparae (parity greater than or equal to 5), primipara had more formal education (p less than 0.005). Therefore, for a successful implementation of the four-child policy in Nigeria, a concerted effort must be made to encourage maternal formal education.

The analysis showed the presence of small consistent correlations between family social background and individual outcomes on a range of childhood measures. These correlations ranged from 0.12 to 0.31 with a median value of 0.18. The association between family social background and childhood outcomes was modelled using LISREL modelling methods which assumed that this association was mediated by common non-observed vulnerability processes. This analysis suggested that while variations in family social background act as relatively weak determinants of specific problem outcomes, these factors had a relatively strong influence on the child's generalized vulnerability to a wide range of childhood problems. The implications of these results for research into social background and childhood are discussed.","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",1990 Nov,England,1990,90
2266433,Preferences for autonomy when patients are physicians.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess physicians' preferences for patient autonomy when they are patients themselves. DESIGN: Data from practicing physicians attending a continuing medical education course were obtained by questionnaire. After adjustment for sociodemographic differences, data from the physician population were compared with similar data previously obtained from a patient population. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-one physicians (94% of the study population) agreed to participate. Ninety percent were primary care physicians. Fifty-eight percent practiced in the eastern United States. MAIN RESULTS: The physicians, like the regular patients, preferred that the principal role in decision making for their own illnesses be handled by their providers, not by themselves. As illness severity increased, physicians indicated significantly less desire for making decisions (p less than 0.01). The magnitudes of the effects of increasing illness severity upon the decision-making preferences of physician and regular patients were comparable (p = 0.53). Physician-patients, however, were slightly more interested than regular patients in making decisions (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: although physician-patients are slightly more interested than regular patients in making decisions, for the most part their preferences for autonomy resemble those of regular patients. These results suggest that medical knowledge and sociocultural factors are only minor determinants of patient attitudes towards autonomy. Rather, patients' preferences to be relieved of decision-making responsibility are better understood as part of the phenomenology of illness.",Journal of general internal medicine,1990 Nov-Dec,United States,1990,90
2262395,Contraceptive behavior among sexually active Hispanic adolescents.,"The purpose of this study was to examine those factors associated with the contraceptive behavior of a national representative sample of Hispanic female adolescents. The subjects included all (n = 85) unmarried, sexually active Hispanic women, aged 15 to 19, from the 1982 National Survey of Family Growth. Contraceptive behavior was measured on a normalized scale, ranging from oral contraceptives to no contraception. Mexican/American and Central/South American background females were more likely (p less than 0.031) to use effective birth control than Puerto Rican, Cuban, and other Hispanic background subjects. Twenty additional social, behavioral, and demographic variables were found to be significantly associated (p less than 0.05) with contraceptive behavior. Based on multiple regression analysis, seven of these variables were found to explain 62% (p less than 0.0001) of the variation in the contraceptive behavior of this sample. Poorer contraceptive behavior was associated with noncompliance with the initial birth control method used (33.8%), lower coital frequency (8.3%), older postmenarchial age (5.7%), failure to use birth control at first coitus (4.6%), fewer years dating (4.0%), lower frequency of church attendance (3.3%), and never having experienced a pregnancy scare (2.0%). These findings suggest that the contraceptive behavior of Hispanic female adolescents is a dynamic process that can be understood in the context of previous sexual and contraceptive behavior.",Journal of adolescent health care : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1990 Nov,United States,1990,90

House-staff attitudes and behaviors during a hospital work action.,"Work actions by house staff are an infrequent response to sometimes difficult working conditions, but they can have a notable effect on institutional cohesiveness and represent a challenge to traditional notions of medical ethics. To determine the extent of participation in a hospital-wide doctors' strike and factors associated with participation, we surveyed 432 house officers at a university-affiliated public hospital where a contract dispute had recently led to a 4-day work action. Of 257 respondents, 69% approved of the strike and 50% participated in it. Both strikers and nonstrikers agreed that quality of care and specific contract issues were important precipitants of the event. By logistic regression, factors independently associated with strike participation (P less than .05) included being unmarried, training in internal medicine or psychiatry, being in earlier stages of training, being assigned to an outpatient service at the time of the strike, holding a favorable view of physician activism, and perceiving nurses, faculty, peers, and the public to have favored the strike.

2088762,"Determinants of elevated blood lead during pregnancy in a population surrounding a lead smelter in Kosovo, Yugoslavia.","We are prospectively examining the relation between environmental lead exposure and pregnancy outcome in cohorts of women exposed to a wide range of air lead concentrations. Titova Mitrovica, Yugoslavia, is the site of a large lead smelter, refinery, and battery factory. At midpregnancy, 602 women in T. Mitrovica and 900 women in Pristina, a non-lead-exposed control town, were interviewed. Blood was obtained for blood lead (PbB), hemoglobin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and serum ferritin measurements. Women were seen again at delivery, at which time maternal and umbilical cord blood samples were obtained. While many demographic and social characteristics were similar across the two towns, women in Pristina were more likely to report employment outside the home, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use during pregnancy. As expected, PbB levels were substantially higher in the smelter town. At midpregnancy, PbB geometric means were 17.1 micrograms/dL in T. Mitrovica and 5.1 micrograms/dL in Pristina; 86% of the pregnant women in T. Mitrovica, compared to 3.4% of those in Pristina, had PbB levels greater than 10 micrograms/dL. Within T. Mitrovica, distance between the home and the smelter was the most important predictor of PbB at mid-pregnancy and delivery. Husband's employment in the lead industry was associated with a significant increase in maternal PbB levels independent of place of residence. Higher maternal serum ferritin concentrations were associated with lower PbB levels, suggesting that dietary iron inhibits lead absorption. Overall, the placenta was a poor barrier to lead; the relationship between maternal PbB and umbilical cord PbB was linear across a wide range of PbB levels.",Environmental health perspectives,1990 Nov,United States,1990,90
10107492,Linking quality assurance and quality of care.,"Since the introduction of the problem-oriented record into hospital work nearly 30 years ago, psychiatry has struggled to adapt it to the complex bio-psycho-social determinants of illness and therapeutics. This struggle has been especially difficult with the seriously and persistently ill patient who requires more than a minimal hospital stay. Justification of the work with the longer-stay patient has now come under extreme pressure from utilization review, third-party payors and quality assurance, but hospital psychiatrists continue to have the same difficulties with documentation. Based on two years of chart review with clinical teams, principles of psychosocial rehabilitation and a dynamically oriented philosophy of inpatient treatment for the long-term patient, this presentation demonstrates one method for linking problems and goals with length of stay, quality assurance behaviors with quality of care, and integration of the multidisciplinary team into the entire process.",Journal of mental health administration,1990 Fall,United States,1990,90

For gastric cancer, the standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for the 234 traditional communities in 1969-73 and for the 56 districts in 1979-83 were calculated. For colorectal cancer, only the data for the latter period were available, and SMRs for that period were calculated similarly. Possible determinants on the resulting pattern of high and low SMRs were investigated. Gastric cancer was generally associated with industrial and urban environments, particularly in west central Scotland, although mortality in Dundee was high in both periods; this cancer also showed significant negative correlations with social class II. By contrast, colorectal cancer showed no strong geographical pattern, no urban-rural gradient, and no social class associations. The cancers showed a weak association with each other.",Scottish medical journal,1990 Oct,Scotland,1990,90

Residents saw more interpersonal support and self-direction in facilities with more physical resources (comfort and staff facilities) and policies providing more autonomy. A similar pattern was found for staff's perceptions of self-direction. Residents and staff also viewed facilities as providing more interpersonal support and self-direction when residents were more socially competent. Larger facility size was associated with residents' assessments of more conflict, and a higher staff-resident ratio was related to residents' judgments of having less independence and influence. These findings may help to improve residential facilities by suggesting factors that can be targeted in interventions to improve the social climate.",Journal of gerontology,1990 Sep,United States,1990,90
2273357,Social determinants of nutrient intake in smokers and non-smokers during pregnancy.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the effects of social factors (education, income, marital status, partners' employment status, housing tenure, social class), smoking, and maternal height on the dietary intake of pregnant women. DESIGN: The study was a prospective investigation on a two phase sample. SETTING: The study involved women attending the antenatal clinic at a district general hospital. PATIENTS: A group of pregnant Caucasian women, selected because they were heavy smokers (15+ cigarettes/day) (n = 94) and a randomly selected sample of never smokers (n = 112) were studied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data on social factors were collected by interviewer administered questionnaire. A 7 day weighed intake method was used to determine dietary intake at 28 weeks gestation. In univariate analyses, income, housing tenure and social class had significant effects on intakes of both macro- and micronutrients, and maternal education and smoking had significant effects on intakes of micronutrients. Using a stepwise multivariate analysis with income, smoking and maternal education, income was a significant factor in the intake of most nutrients but this effect disappeared when social class and housing tenure factors were entered into the model. Only social class and housing tenure had any significant effect on intakes of macronutrients--energy, protein and fat. Smoking and maternal education were the most important determinants of quality of diet (nutrient density); other factors had only negligible effects. Income was the only significant factor in alcohol intake. It is suggested that the effects of social class and income are overlapping. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking, being renters of accommodation, and being of minimum education and low social class are risk factors for poor dietary intake. It is recommended that such higher risk groups be specifically targeted for nutritional advice in pregnancy.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1990 Sep,England,1990,90

2237325,"Work and ""lifestyle"" in occupational mortality in Denmark.","Using social class standardization Fox and Adelstein found that 18% of all mortality was attributed to work, while 82% was attributable to lifestyle. Fox and Adelstein had access to 25 occupational orders. We have made similar calculations on Danish mortality statistics including 146 occupational groups. Our results are very different: more than 50% of all mortality among Danish men seems to be related to work. Of 51,317 work-related deaths in 10 years, one third were due to cancer, and half due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The marked differences in results have lead to considerations on the applicability of the model and the underlying assumptions. One conclusion is that social differences and differences in mortality between social groups are so small in Denmark that a few subgroups with ""deviant"" mortality and/or lifestyle will be determinants of the results. Inclusion of more occupational groups increases the percentage of deaths associated with work.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine,1990 Sep,Sweden,1990,90
2236478,Clinical judgment analysis.,"Judgement is central to the practice of medicine and occurs between making clinical observations and taking clinical decisions. Clinical judgment analysis has developed as a method of making statistically firm models of doctors' judgments. Computed models reveal the differential importance attached to items of clinical, social, or other data which are determinants of clinical decisions. These models can both reveal the causes of conflicts of judgment and may help resolve them in a way that unaided discussion cannot. Revealing experts' models to students speeds learning of diagnostic skills. Clinical judgment analysis offers a method of probing the judgments not just of students and doctors but also of patients who have shown systematic differences in their perceptions of risk and benefit. The power and relevance of clinical trials can be improved by the consistent application of judgment policies generated from both the trialists and those who will use their results.",The Quarterly journal of medicine,1990 Sep,England,1990,90

First attention is paid to the development of the health status. Subsequently the author characterizes briefly the basic spheres which influence health, i.e. the lifestyle, living and working environment and the activities of the health services. In the conclusion the author presents a characteristic of the socio-economic structure of Czechoslovak society as regards social relations. The author emphasizes the need of rapid transition to a truly democratic set-up of society and the implementation of fundamental economic reforms as the prerequisite for gradual improvement of the health status of the Czechoslovak population. Part of the contemplated social changes and at the same time an essential prerequisite of success is the implementation of the strategy of restoration and promotion of national health.",Ceskoslovenske zdravotnictvi,1990 Sep,Czech Republic,1990,90

The study group comprised 127 14-year-old schoolchildren in Aarhus. Data were collected by means of semistructured interviews and self-administered questionnaires. Forward selection multiple regression analysis was the analytical method of choice, and the relationships were interpreted using the problem behaviour theory. The results showed that environmental variables were more important than personal variables for sugar consumption. In particular, degree of peer orientation was closely linked to sugar consumption (beta = 0.29). The full model including both sets of variables explained 14.5 per cent of the variance in sugar consumption. Sugar consumption seems to be a way of demonstrating adherence to and identification with peer group norms for adolescents at this age.",Community dental health,1990 Sep,England,1990,90

By using data from the 1982 National Survey of Family Growth, we examined factors that differentiate users of various methods early in the sexual careers of teenaged women. We find that patterns of method choice not only vary by race and region within the United States but also change over the teenager's life course. In addition, among teenagers who did not use a method at first sex, the likelihood of adopting a method soon thereafter was low for both whites and blacks and was unaffected by social structural characteristics.",Demography,1990 Aug,United States,1990,90
2389133,Chronic perceived work stress and blood pressure among Australian government employees.,"Prospective data on 2634 Australian government employees over five years were examined for the effects of chronic perceived work stress on blood pressure change. The study sample (2100 men and 534 women) represented 57% of the original volunteers, or 75% of those eligible after exclusion criteria were met. Data on perceived stress were obtained by questionnaire, and a principal component analysis produced six components: qualitative demands, quantitative demands, job control, future control, work support, and outside stress. Multiple linear regression, which controlled for determinants of blood pressure, tested the main effects and specific two-way interaction effects of the chronicity scores of the six components and 30 items. Many items but only some components were associated with blood pressure change. Sex and age differences were observed. The observed interactions between job demands and control provided equivocal support for the Karasek job-strain model. The women responded to work-based support, but not necessarily as predicted.","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",1990 Aug,Finland,1990,90

The purpose of this study was to explore QOL in a population of elderly patients with hypertension and to suggest a technique for model building. The specific purpose of the study was to test the viability of a model for understanding how the treatment of hypertension affects QOL. Indicators of QOL and determinants of QOL were measured in a group of patients aged 60 years or older with hypertension. Correlation coefficients confirmed the hypothesized model. The confirmed model thus can be used to study other chronic diseases and to assess the QOL effects of treatment of chronic diseases.",Southern medical journal,1990 Aug,United States,1990,90
2246428,Attributions for social failure and aggression in incarcerated delinquent youth.,"While a variety of cognitive deficits and biases have been found to characterize aggressive and delinquent children and youth, very little attention has focused on determining whether aggressive youth also display deviant attributional beliefs in response to social failure. Research in the more impersonal cognitive domains such as achievement has shown attributions for failure to be potent determinants of both affective reactions and subsequent responding. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate whether specific attributional patterns following social failure may also relate to aggressive behavior. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between the level of self-reported physical aggression and specific attributional patterns following hypothetical social failure in a sample of incarcerated delinquent males. While the general hypotheses were that increased aggressiveness would be related to a greater tendency to endorse attributions for social failure that are external, stable, and controllable, only the hypothesis with regard to controllability was supported. The findings are discussed in terms of the relation between cognition and aggression in delinquent youth.",Journal of abnormal child psychology,1990 Aug,United States,1990,90
2239359,Alcohol consumption in parents and offspring: a study of the family correlation structure in a general population.,"Alcohol consumption was recorded for 2390 spouses and 498 children of age 18 or above living with their parents. The spouse correlation was 0.67, whereas parent-offspring and sibling correlations were all close to 0.35. This family correlation structure implies an upper limit for heritability of 0.44. The design does not permit a separation of effect of cultural (environmental) and genetic transmission in families, but comparisons with previous heritability analyses suggest that heritability is in fact close to the upper limit, implying little or no cultural transmission. There were virtually no correlations between alcohol consumption and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Nor did consumption correlate substantially with symptoms in first-degree relatives. These results do not support hypotheses of common genetic nor even of common environmental determinants for alcohol consumption and mental disorders.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,1990 Aug,United States,1990,90
2236366,Genetic and environmental determinants of the lability of trait neuroticism and the symptoms of anxiety and depression.,"A genetic analysis was conducted on trait neuroticism and symptoms of anxiety and depression in a five-wave study of 462 twin pairs. Models that assessed the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors to the lability (within-individual variability over time) of these measures were fitted to the data. Previous results concerning the substantial genetic involvement in the level of neuroticism and symptoms were confirmed. However, it was found that neither genes nor the shared environment of the twins was a significant cause of lability of these measures. An attempt was therefore made to identify aspects of individuals' environments that might be responsible for lability of neuroticism and symptoms. Adverse life events were found to predict variability of symptoms, but not of neuroticism. The availability of close social ties or having affectionless control in childhood did not contribute to lability.",Psychological medicine,1990 Aug,England,1990,90
2212095,Pre-diagnostic symptom recognition and help seeking among cancer patients.,"Failure to recognize symptoms which signal cancer may delay contact with the medical care system, thus decreasing the chances of diagnosis at an early stage of disease. We investigated the determinants of cancer symptom recognition and delay in seeking medical care in a population-based sample of 625 newly diagnosed lung, breast and colorectal cancer patients. Although the majority (79.5%) of patients reported noticing symptoms prior to diagnosis, one quarter of these patients (24.7%) delayed longer than three months in seeking medical care. Contrary to the findings of research based on clinic samples, logistic regression analysis revealed that no demographic or social support factors were predictive of symptom recognition or delay, with the exception that older colorectal cancer patients were less likely to notice symptoms, but also less likely to delay. Lung and colorectal patients diagnosed with advanced disease were more likely to notice symptoms than patients with local disease. Results of a content analysis of patients' remarks indicate that breast cancer patients were significantly more likely than lung or colorectal cancer patients to attribute their symptoms to cancer (p less than .001). Symptoms common to lung and colorectal cancer appear to be attributed to other, less serious causes. Given the lack of demographic predictors of symptom recognition and delay in seeking care, we suggest that education programs address risk groups for specific cancers, rather than the general public as a whole, grouping together all cancers and cancer symptomatology.",Journal of community health,1990 Aug,Netherlands,1990,90

2169762,Separation of opioid from nonopioid mediation of affect in neonatal rats: nonopioid mechanisms mediate maternal contact influences.,"A causal distinction is established in infant Norway rats between opioid- and nonopioid-mediated determinants of behavior. Contact influences are shown to be mediated by nonopioid pathways, whereas gustatory influences are shown to be opioid mediated. Specifically, naltrexone (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) did not at all diminish quieting exerted by contact with an anesthetized dam but completely reversed the quieting effects of morphine in isolated rats. Naloxone (5 mg/kg) did not affect the latencies with which nondeprived or 8-hr deprived rats 9, 12, 15, and 18 days of age attached to the nipples of anesthetized dams, nor did naloxone (5 and 10 mg/kg) cause any systematic change in nipple attachment in 10- and 18-day-old rats that had been deprived of their dam for either 0, 8, or 24 hr. In a 3rd experiment, naloxone (5 mg/kg) did not significantly reduce milk intake by 9-, 12-, 15-, or 18-day-old rats from the nipple when milk letdown was induced by oxytocin. Moreover, naloxone (5 and 10 mg/kg) did not reduce milk intake in Day-10 rats that, while suckling, received milk via a cannula placed in the posterior portion of the tongue at the level of the intermolar eminence or in rats that obtained milk directly from their awake mother. In contrast, milk intake was significantly reduced by naltrexone (0.25-1.0 mg/kg) in Day-10 rats that obtained milk (a) by licking it off a saturated substrate or (b) through an indwelling cannula located in the anterior portion of the lower jaw. (Milk delivered at this placement is thought to engage feeding systems by its taste and texture.) In a final set of experiments in Day-10 rats, intake of milk delivered via anterior jaw cannulae was reduced by naloxone (5 and 10 mg/kg) in rats that were either isolated, in contact with an anesthetized dam, or attached to her nipples. On the basis of resistance to naloxone and naltrexone administration, these experiments demonstrate that behavioral influences of the tactile (and possibly olfactory) qualities of the mother are not mediated by opioid systems. Implications for understanding the means through which mothers can influence their young and the infantile mediators of these maternal influences are discussed.",Behavioral neuroscience,1990 Aug,United States,1990,90

Although cessation is necessary and important to achieving sobriety, this article suggests that maintenance of sobriety is a crucial, but oft ignored, component of effective treatment. Alcohol relapse is discussed in the context of aftercare treatment employing a relapse prevention approach. Within this model, relapse is not automatically defined as a treatment failure but as an opportunity for intervention and the interruption of the relapse process. Determinants and predictors of relapse are discussed, and assessment and intervention strategies provided.

After learning the location quality, the worker can stay at the current job, search locally at the same location, or search for a job at another location (leading to repeat migration). This paper develops the properties of optimal search, migration, and repeat migration decisions, and finds how revealed location quality influences the tradeoffs between local search and repeat migration. The effects of search costs and better job opportunities on the reservation levels of wages and revealed quality levels are also determined.""",Journal of economic dynamics & control,1990 Jul-Oct,Netherlands,1990,90
12283833,Determinants of fertility control in Korea.,"The objective of this study is to examine the socioeconomic and intervening determinants of fertility control in Korea. The conceptual framework applied here is based on the synthesis framework of fertility control developed by Easterlin and Crimmins. The data came from the 1974 Korean National Family Survey, which was conducted as part of the World Fertility Survey. The study focuses on the relative importance of the socioeconomic factors and intervening variables in the determination of fertility control. The most interesting finding is that there are only small differentials in fertility control by socioeconomic factors. The analysis emphasizes the importance of examining the determinants of fertility control in terms of the intervening variables, which include the components of natural fertility, desired family size, and costs of fertility control. These intervening variables provide general support for the theoretical predictions. Moreover, most of the coefficients for these variables are statistically significant at the .05 level. The analysis also shows that motivation for fertility control is an important factor in determining use of fertility control.",Korea journal of population and development,1990 Jul,Korea (South),1990,90

Finally, the impact of return migration on Tubuai, a rapidly developing outer island, is assessed specifically analyzing the manner in which returnees are reintegrated socially and economically into rural community life. The article concludes that returnees are development-oriented, but that increasing population growth in a context of fundamentally limited rural resources is not an economically viable process in the long term.""",The International migration review,1990 Summer,United States,1990,90
11100216,Personality and dental care utilization: findings from the VA longitudinal study.,"The personality traits of introversion/extraversion and neuroticism were investigated as determinants of the utilization of restorative dental care, controlling for socioeconomic status and restorative need. The VA Dental Longitudinal Study (DLS) provided information on the restorative treatment received by 593 healthy adult males during a 10-year period. Utilization of restorative services was measured by calculating the percentage of surfaces that needed and received treatment, as identified by the DLS examiners by clinical and radiographic examination. Oral examinations were initiated in 1969 with subsequent examinations occurring at approximately 3-year intervals. Personality measures for these individuals were obtained using the EPI-Q, a shortened form of the Eysenck Personality Inventory. A plot of neuroticism versus the utilization measure yielded a curvilinear relationship suggesting that participants seeking the most dental care scored moderately on the neuroticism scale while those scoring lowest and highest on this scale sought less treatment. In contrast, the introversion/extraversion scale showed no apparent relationship with dental care utilization. Results from the regression analysis suggest that dentition and socioeconomic status are strong determinants of utilization and that need for restorative treatment influences utilization.","Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",1990 Jul-Aug,United States,1990,90

2401284,Dietary and other determinants of lipoprotein levels within a population of 315 Dutch males aged 28 and 29.,"The objective of this study was to estimate the strength of the association between diet and serum lipids and lipoproteins within a free-living population. Three hundred and fifteen Dutch males aged 28 and 29 were located via the Army registry. Their diets were assessed through a dietary history questionnaire plus oral cross-check, and blood was sampled twice at a 1-week interval. Height, weight, skinfolds, and waist and hip circumference were measured to estimate amount and location of body fat. Physical activity, social status and smoking were estimated through questionnaires. The range of cholesterol values predicted from differences in dietary fatty acid and cholesterol intake as summarized by the Keys equation score was 5.11 to 6.29 mmol/l, while the actual levels ranged from 3.30 to 9.28 mmol/l. Multiple regression analysis showed a weak but significant association of the Keys score with total cholesterol (slope 0.83, P less than 0.05), LDL cholesterol (slope 0.71, P less than 0.05), and the HDL/total cholesterol ratio (slope -0.04, P less than 0.01). The percentage of energy from alcohol was strongly and independently associated with both total and HDL cholesterol (slopes 0.04 and 0.02, P less than 0.001). Body fat parameters were strongly associated with all serum lipids and lipoproteins. We conclude that the contribution of dietary differences to differences in serum lipids and lipoproteins within this population is real but small.",European journal of clinical nutrition,1990 Jul,England,1990,90
2397313,Links between drug misuse and crime.,"The paper argues that there may be benefits from combining the efforts of criminologists and drug researchers in the study of the nature of the relationship between drug/alcohol use and crime. The available evidence suggests that the relationship is probably not a simple one. In particular, the research shows that social, cultural, and environmental factors may all play some part in explaining the relationship. It is suggested that something might be gained by focusing on the various situational factors which link drug/alcohol use and crime. Some help might be forthcoming for this endeavour from criminology which has in recent years developed a body of knowledge on the role of situational determinants of crime. Research from within this perspective has been helpful in informing strategies for intervention over a wide range of crimes and crime settings. In particular, attention is drawn to the wealth of crime prevention ideas that has arisen out of situational analyses of alcohol-related public disorder. It is proposed that further research is conducted which draws on this approach in an attempt to increase our understanding of the micro social processes involved.",British journal of addiction,1990 Jul,England,1990,90
2366055,Supportive housing for the chronically mentally ill. Matching clients with community environments.,"The need for permanent housing for the chronically mentally ill has received a great deal of attention over the last several years. One response to the problem has been the development of supportive housing, that is, non-facility-based permanent homes with placement based on clients' functional capabilities and preferences. However, little research has focused on assessing the match between clients and environmental requirements. This study begins to identify the social and clinical characteristics of clients that contribute to selection into different types of housing environments. Ninety-one clients were sampled from the supportive housing services of a major provider in two New England states. Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability that clients will be placed into apartments vs. other, more restricted settings, based on their clinical and social characteristics. Findings show that the primary determinants of placement were clinical severity, early family history, and adequacy of family support. The less severely ill and better functioning the client, the more likely that he or she was placed in an apartment. This was mitigated, however, by the availability and adequacy of family support. In addition, clients with early family disruptions were also less likely to be placed in apartments. Findings are discussed in light of their implications for providing permanent housing placements for chronically mentally ill persons and for factors in future research to evaluate the success of placement.",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,1990 Jul,United States,1990,90

In 2 experiments, Ss' processing goals were manipulated to increase or inhibit on-line change and message elaboration. As predicted, Ss reported postexposure attitudes more rapidly in on-line vs memory-based conditions. Decreased message elaboration increased attitude-recall correspondence, regardless of when attitude change occurred. Increased elaboration produced elaboration-attitude judgment correspondence.

""Estimates of survival functions corresponding to data relating to mothers of different social status groups, assumed to represent health condition of mothers, are obtained and compared. Finally, it is concluded that the distribution of duration of PPA is a mixture of two distributions and it differs from one social status group to [the] other.""",Janasamkhya,1990 Jun,India,1990,90
2378804,Experiences in school as determinants of behaviour in a discussion situation.,This study examined the effects of school experiences on behaviour in a discussion. Participants were 80 8th grade students (40 females and 40 males). Dyads of students (one high and one low achiever) were assigned to two different solutions of a problem. Each student in the dyad was asked to defend one of these solutions and was given four written arguments in favour of it. The students were instructed to give up the discussion if they were convinced that the partner's position was a better solution. At the end of the discussion the students independently of each other indicated what solution they really thought was the better. Low achievers in school gave up the discussion and claimed to believe that the opposite solution was the better more frequently than did high achievers. There was no significant difference between high and low achievers in the tendency to really believe in the solution they argued for. The results are discussed in terms of self-confidence and self-protection.,The British journal of educational psychology,1990 Jun,England,1990,90
2375937,Internal vs. external determinants of coping responses to stressful life-events in the elderly.,"Coping appears to function in the relationship between stressful life-events and health. Factors that may influence an individual's use of a particular coping strategy, however, are not well understood. Coping consistency within individuals and across situations was examined in a longitudinal study of 74 independently living elderly persons, as were the effects of the type of event experienced, appraisal of its degree of threat, and demographic variables on coping behaviour. Correlational analyses indicated that coping responses were more a function of event type than of an individual's consistent style. A number of distinct life-events were associated with particular types of coping responses. The degree of threat, one's expectation of the changeability of an event, and one's appraisal of possible courses of action were also correlated with specific coping behaviours. Age was negatively correlated with problem-focused coping and total number of coping responses. This study suggests that the type of stressful event an individual experiences may be a more important general determinant of one's coping response than is one's overriding propensity to cope in a particular way.",The British journal of medical psychology,1990 Jun,England,1990,90
2367820,"Health workers and AIDS: knowledge, attitudes and experiences as determinants of anxiety.","The objective of the study was to measure the level of HIV/AIDS related anxiety among health care workers and identify its determinants. Data were obtained by means of a mailed, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire distributed to 2561 Danish medical doctors, nurses and nursing aides drawn randomly from the lists of members of the respective national associations. The data were analysed on the basis of a pre-study model including 12 variables hypothesizing a hierarchy of causal dependencies with anxiety at the top. 44% of the participants expressed HIV/AIDS related anxiety--hospital workers more than primary care workers, the older less than the younger. Anxiety was significantly associated with negative/restrictive attitudes towards HIV positives and gay men and with low levels of knowledge about HIV transmission and less education about HIV/AIDS. Negative/restrictive attitudes towards HIV positives were associated both with less knowledge regarding HIV transmission and fewer contacts with HIV positives. Similar associations were found regarding gay men. It is suggested that new kinds of training programmes be established which focus much more on attitudes and norms concerning HIV/AIDS--especially among health care workers with only occasional contact with HIV patients.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine,1990 Jun,Sweden,1990,90
2253992,Mortality determinants and prediction of outcome in high risk newborns.,"The aim of this study was to determine independent patient-related predictors of mortality in high risk newborns admitted at our centre. The study population comprised 100 consecutive newborns each, from the premature unit (PU) and sick baby care unit (SBCU), respectively. Thirteen high risk factors (variables) for each of the two units, were entered into a multivariate regression analysis. Variables with independent predictive value for poor outcome (i.e., death) in PU were, weight less than 1 kg, hyaline membrane disease, neurologic problems, and intravenous therapy. High risk factors in SBCU included, blood gas abnormality, bleeding phenomena, recurrent convulsions, apnea, and congenital anomalies. Identification of these factors guided us in defining priority areas for improvement in our system of neonatal care. Also, based on these variables a simple predictive score for outcome was constructed. The prediction equation and the score were cross-validated by applying them to a 'test-set' of 100 newborns each for PU and SBCU. Results showed a comparable sensitivity, specificity and error rate.",Indian pediatrics,1990 Jun,India,1990,90
2235037,"Sexual ability, activity, attitudes and satisfaction as part of adjustment in spinal cord-injured subjects.","Changes in different aspects of sexuality were investigated and related to overall quality of life and physical, psychological and social adjustment in 73 SCI subjects, who were sexually active both before and after injury. Items on sexual interest and satisfaction were treated as one composite variable, the SIS scale, measuring sexual adjustment after injury. Despite severe genital dysfunction, more than half of the subjects (57%) rated their sexual relations after injury as satisfying or at least rather satisfying. The majority continued having intercourse, although many of them more seldom than before, and about half experienced orgasm. Sexual adjustment after injury was closely and positively correlated to frequency of intercourse, willingness to experiment with alternative sexual expressions and young age at injury. Physical and social independence and a high mood level were further positive determinants of sexual adaptation after injury, whereas the neurological level and completeness of injury showed no significant correlation with sexuality. It is suggested that sexual information and counselling should be integrated in the total care of the SCI patient to reduce the negative effects on sexuality, caused by the injury.",Paraplegia,1990 Jun,England,1990,90

12283970,[A study on the proximate determinants of fertility decline in China].,"To study the biological and behavioral process of the recent drastic fertility decline in China, the authors reviewed relating factors (proximate determinants) and applied the Bongaarts model to the population of China for the years 1971 and 1981, during which the fertility rate dropped most rapidly and substantial population control policies were performed. By application of the model, the decrease of TFR of 2.78 between 1971 and 1981 was estimated to be contributed by widespread of contraception (68%), later marriage (49%), and increase of induced abortion (28%), through shortening of the length of postpartum breastfeeding showed negative effects (-32%), on the assumption that local data could be substituted for some national data. Compared with other countries, China was characterized by coexistence of strong fertility-inhibiting effects of nonmarriage, contraception, induced abortion, and relatively strong fertility-inhibiting effects of breastfeeding. It strongly suggested that the fertility transition in China was realized by powerful population policies in the context of insufficient socioeconomic development to lead to the transition.",[Minzoku eisei] Race hygiene,1990 May,Japan,1990,90

2347833,Determinants of maternal child-rearing attitudes.,"This study investigated the correlates of negative attitudes toward child-rearing among low-income urban black and Hispanic mothers. Using a randomized block procedure, 144 adolescents and 139 adults giving birth to healthy infants at a large metropolitan hospital were recruited. All consenting women were interviewed in the hospital within 2 days after delivery, using standardized measures of child-rearing attitudes, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, social support, and cognitive ability. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that depressive symptoms, cognitive ability, and two demographic characteristics (maternal age and spoken language) accounted for 42.4% of the variance in negative childrearing attitudes during the postpartum period. The contributions of social support and self-esteem were no longer significant when the effects of the other psychosocial factors were taken into consideration simultaneously. The utility of early assessment of maternal attitudes as a marker for maternal risk status is addressed. The adaptive function of maternal attitudes and the implications for child-rearing practices are discussed in relation to the process of acculturation.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1990 May,United States,1990,90
2342984,"Attitudes, subjective norms, and behavioral intentions of nurses toward dying patients and their families.","This investigation aimed to develop and validate an instrument, ""Attitudes, Subjective Norms, and Behavioral Intentions of Nurses Toward the Care of Dying Patients and Their Families"" (ASBID), and to examine the relationship among selected demographic variables, death anxiety, and social desirability response tendency on the behavioral intentions of nurses toward the dying. The Ajzen-Fishbein theory of reasoned action was used as the conceptual framework. Nursing behaviors toward the dying included in the ASBID were developed from interviews with bereaved family members. Three hundred seventy-two registered nurses caring for dying patients were used as the sample population for testing the ASBID. Internal consistency reliability coefficients for the ASBID achieved satisfactory standards. Factor analysis suggested three factors were being measured: general acute care measures for the dying, open communication with the dying, and continuing care for bereaved family members. Results supported the Ajzen-Fishbein theory that attitudes and subjective norms were major determinants of intentions. Findings indicate that educational programs planned to influence nursing care of the dying should focus on the consequences of specific behaviors of nurses rather than on death anxiety in nurses, and they should include nursing supervisors as well as nurses providing direct care for the dying.",Oncology nursing forum,1990 May-Jun,United States,1990,90
2342362,Subgroup differences in drinking patterns among black and white men: results from a national survey.,"Despite major increases in alcohol-related health problems and indications of shifts in the cultural role of alcoholic beverages among U.S. blacks, few studies have examined drinking patterns in this population. To address gaps in the literature, data from a 1984 national survey were used to compare drinking patterns and their sociocultural correlates among male, black (n = 723) and male, white (n = 743) Americans. Findings from the survey indicate that, at the aggregate level, black and white men exhibit very similar drinking patterns. The proportion of abstainers, infrequent, frequent and heavier drinkers is very similar for the two groups of men. However, major black-white differences occur when the relationship between drinking rates and major social characteristics is considered. Bivariate tables suggest that frequent heavier drinking among whites is associated with youthfulness, high-income status and residing in ""wetter"" areas, whereas among blacks these patterns are reversed or absent. Log-linear analysis confirmed some of these findings. When drinking behavior was modeled with respect to race, age, income and region, race emerged as an independent predictor and the effects of age and income varied by race. When the two groups of men were analyzed separately, age and region were the only significant determinants of heavier drinking among whites. Among blacks, income and age emerged as significant variables and the influence of age differed from the findings for whites. The results suggest that there may be important differences in the cultural environments of drinking in black and white men.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1990 May,United States,1990,90

A detailed review of interconnections among individual behavior, household strategies, community structures, and national political economies indicates that inter-level and inter-temporal dependencies are inherent to the migration process and give it a strong internal momentum. The dynamic interplay between network growth and individual migration labor, migration remittances, and local income distributions all create powerful feedback mechanisms that lead to the cumulative causation of migration. These mechanisms are reinforced and shaped by macrolevel relationships within the larger political economy.",Population index,1990 Spring,United States,1990,90

It argues that, because dependency deprives women of equal access to the public sphere and because it confines them, through normative definition, to the private sphere, it reduces their likelihood of seeking divorce. The paper also argues, contrary to recent findings, that socioeconomic development should be linearly and positively associated with divorce. Data from 51 nations are examined and multiple regression analysis [suggests] considerable support for these arguments.""",International journal of sociology of the family,1990 Spring,India,1990,90
10104655,Determinants of primary caregiver stress and burden: area of residence and the caregiving networks of frail elders.,"This research examines the association among characteristics of the caregiving network, primary caregiver stress and burden, and area of residence. The purpose is two-fold: to determine whether the structure of the relationship between the caregiving network, and stress and burden is uniform across rural, small city, and urban samples; and, to assess whether stress and burden are explained by a similar set of variables within area of residence categories. The data are drawn from a matched sample of 1,388 impaired elders and their primary caregivers from the 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey and the National Survey of Informal Caregivers. In general, the analysis shows that several characteristics of the care-receiver and the primary caregiver have a differential effect on stress and burden across residential categories, and that, within rural, small city, and urban samples, the determinants of stress and burden are not homogeneous. When the frail elder is able to reciprocate by doing chores, babysitting, or providing some other type of assistance for the primary caregiver, however, both stress and burden are reduced in all three residential categories. Similarly, the increased provision of assistance with instrumental activities of daily living by the primary caregiver uniformly increases stress and burden. These findings suggest that interventions designed to alleviate primary caregiver stress and burden may be able to have some common components, but may also need to be tailored in some ways to specific residential environments.",The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,1990 Apr,England,1990,90
2378312,Objective and subjective dimensions of travel impedance as determinants of commuting stress.,"The stressful characteristics of commuting constraints are conceptualized in terms of both physical and perceptual conditions of travel impedance. This study develops and operationalizes the concept of subjective impedance, as a complement to our previously developed concept of impedance as a physically defined condition of commuting stress. The stress impacts of high-impedance commuting were examined in a study of 79 employees of two companies in the follow-up testing of a longitudinal study. Subjective impedance was overlapping but not isomorphic with physical impedance, and these two dimensions have differential relationships with health and well-being outcomes. The physical impedance construct received further confirmation in validational analyses and in predicted effects on various illness measures and job satisfaction. The newly constructed subjective impedance index was significantly related to evening home mood, residential satisfaction, and chest pain. Job change was also influenced primarily by commuting satisfaction. The results are discussed within an ecological framework emphasizing interdomain transfer effects and situational moderators of commuting stress.",American journal of community psychology,1990 Apr,England,1990,90

2335545,Socioeconomic and health care determinants of child survival in Kuwait.,"This paper analyses the socioeconomic and health care determinants responsible for the decline over the last two decades in infant mortality in Kuwait. Published data and the results of a national health survey conducted in 1984-85 show the following. With the overall affluence of the society, health care in terms of immunization has improved dramatically and more than 90% of all children are covered. Of all births, 99% now occur in a hospital or clinic. About half of the mothers continue to breast-feed their babies for about 16 months. Despite these favourable conditions, differences still exist between social classes. The risk of stillbirth remains much higher among the poorer women, those without any education and those who gave birth at home. These findings are consistent with developed countries like the USA and Japan, where the social class differences in mortality still persist.",Journal of biosocial science,1990 Apr,England,1990,90

The peak season, November-February, coincided with the period of cool temperatures and the Bedouin Arab cultural seasons of winter and spring. This pattern is different from those of Jewish and Christian groups in the same region, a difference not attributable to religion alone. Sociodemographic factors associated with the peak season of birth include traditional occupations of fathers, multiparae 2+, and traditional place of residence. This pattern has persisted over the past 15 years although it is less apparent among the more recently sedentarized Bedouin Arabs.",Journal of biosocial science,1990 Apr,England,1990,90
2197395,Preventing relapse in the treatment of nicotine addiction: current issues and future directions.,"Although smoking-cessation rates have continued to increase, the vast majority of smokers who quit eventually relapse. Between 1974 and 1985, over 1.3 million smokers quit during each of those years. However, 75% to 80% of those individuals resumed smoking within six months. This article describes the dynamic phenomenon of smoking relapse within the context of cyclical episodes of smoking and quitting during an individual's lifetime. Theories of the determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed and methods designed to prevent relapse are described. Smoking relapse is discussed in terms of three aspects of tobacco addiction: (1) biological-addiction mechanisms, (2) conditioning processes, and (3) cognitive-social learning factors. The major determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed, including nicotine withdrawal, stress, weight gain, social influences, conditioning factors, causal attributions, and environmental variables. A trans-theoretical-developmental model is explored in the longitudinal investigation of the natural history of slips (lapses) and relapse episodes. Relapse prevention interventions are described that emphasize self-awareness, self-regulation, self-efficacy, affect regulation, social support, and lifestyle balance. Recent developments in pharmacological adjuncts to treatment are also examined. It is concluded that innovative relapse prevention methods need to be designed for hard-core smokers with histories of cessation failures, substance abuse and/or psychiatric impairment. These and other recommendations for future research on smoking relapse and relapse prevention are discussed.",Journal of psychoactive drugs,1990 Apr-Jun,United States,1990,90
2141337,The emergence of depressive symptoms in late life: the importance of declining health and increasing disability.,"Despite considerable progress in the epidemiology of late life depressive disorders, the determinants and course of late life depressive symptoms remain unclear. The apparent reciprocal relationship between depression and disability, a consistent finding in cross-sectional studies further confounds efforts to estimate the importance of depressive symptoms in the elderly. In a longitudinal study of 1457 aged community residents who completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale at baseline and 24 months later, a significant level of depressive symptoms emerged in 163 respondents (11%), while 1080 (74%) remained symptom free. Unlike other studies, we found that the number of medical conditions, social support, life events, and demographic characteristics contributed little to distinguish those with emerging symptoms from those who remained symptom free. However, increasing disability and declining health preceded the emergence of depressive symptoms and accounted for seventy percent of the variance explained by discriminant analysis. These findings have etiologic implications for both the course and determinants of depression in late life.",Journal of community health,1990 Apr,Netherlands,1990,90
2322698,Social influences and cardiovascular risk factors as determinants of plasma fibrinogen concentration in a general population sample of middle aged men.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the relation between fibrinogen concentration and social class and other social factors found to be related to mortality. The results regarding cardiovascular disease are unpublished, as yet. DESIGN: Cross sectional population study. SETTING: City of Gothenburg, Sweden. SUBJECTS: 639 Men from a population sample of 1016 men aged 50 in 1983. They were all employed and had no history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Fibrinogen values were available for all of them. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Fibrinogen concentration in relation to socioeconomic state according to occupation, and other social influences determined as number of people in the household and scores of social activities and activities in and outside the house. RESULTS: Men with low scores for activities at home had a mean plasma fibrinogen concentration of 3.34 g/l (95% confidence interval 3.21 to 3.47), whereas those with an intermediate score had a mean concentration of 3.16 (3.00 to 3.32) g/l and those with a high score 3.02 (2.95 to 3.10) g/l. Similar inverse relations were noted for the two other activity scores and for occupational class (class 1 being unskilled and semiskilled workers and class 5 professionals and executives) and the number of people in the household. Smoking exerted a strong influence on fibrinogen concentration, the relations between fibrinogen concentration and social factors being evident only in non-smokers. The mean difference in fibrinogen value between the non-smokers with the lowest activity scores at home and those with the highest scores was 0.36 (0.19 to 0.54) g/l, and similar differences were seen for the two other activity scores. Multiple regression analyses showed smoking, body mass index, the sum of all activities (inverse relation), and diabetes to be independently associated with fibrinogen value, whereas occupational class (p = 0.81) and the number of people in the household (p = 0.09) were not. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial influences seem to influence the coagulation system in the body in a way that is associated with cardiovascular disease and premature death.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1990 Mar 10,England,1990,90
22204507,An evaluation of the potential role of the physician in influencing community exercise behavior.,"Abstract The potential influence of physicians upon the exercise behavior of individuals has been examined. Key questions explored were a) whether people believed that their personal physician thought that they should exercise, and b) the level of motivation to comply with these perceived expectations. Subjects were drawn from four independent populations: 1) parents of junior high school students (N = 479); 2) university employees (N = 190); 3) lower-limb disabled adults (N = 62); and 4) pregnant women (N = 68). Questionnaire-based physical activity scores were transformed into Z-scores and the data sets for activity and beliefs were pooled. Multiple regression models were developed for each individual data set and for the combined data. The proportion of the variance in reported physical activity explained by the normative belief regarding the physician and the level of motivation to comply with the perceived physician's expectations was very low (adjusted R(2) = 0.026 for the combined data sets). In general, healthy adults thought that their personal physician wanted them to exercise and were motivated to comply with such advice. In contrast, disabled adults saw their personal physician as opposed to exercise which they were motivated to undertake. These findings are discussed in terms of the importance of social norms as determinants of exercise behavior and the position that physicians should adopt when seeking to enhance exercise behavior.",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,1990 Mar,United States,1990,90
2354684,The determinants of sexuality among adolescent school girls in Kenya.,"One thousand seven hundred and fifty one Secondary school girls aged 12 to 19 years were interviewed by means of a self-administered questionnaire. 416 (23.8%), of them reported to have been sexually experienced at the time of the study. 4.1% of the sexually experienced girls had started sex below the age of 10 years, some of whom had been raped. The low and middle class private schools in the city centre had higher incidence of sexually experienced girls. The same was observed in those girls staying away from their parents. Majority of the sexually experienced girls had started coitus within one to two years of attaining menarche or having a boyfriend. Some of these girls may have been forced to indulge in sex by the men/boys or circumstances. Lack of factual knowledge, parental guidance and lust for material gains are some of the factors the girls felt may be responsible for the upsurge in adolescent sexual behaviour. The role played by these factors in adolescent sexuality is discussed, and possible remedial measures are suggested.",East African medical journal,1990 Mar,Kenya,1990,90

A two-year follow-up of a first-contact sample.,"A two-year follow-up was conducted of a subsample of the Chandigarh cohort of first-contact schizophrenic patients from the WHO Determinants of Outcome project. The patients were those living with family members who had been interviewed initially to determine their levels of expressed emotion (EE). The interview was repeated for 74% of the relatives at one-year follow-up. A dramatic reduction had occurred in each of the EE components and in the global index. No rural relative was rated as high EE at follow-up. Of the patients included in the one-year follow-up, 86% were followed for two years. In contrast to the one-year findings, the global EE index at initial interview did not predict relapse of schizophrenia over the subsequent two years. However, there was a significant association between initial hostility and subsequent relapse. The better outcome of this cohort of schizophrenic patients compared with samples from the West is partly attributable to tolerance and acceptance by family members.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1990 Mar,England,1990,90

This study examined how well child adjustment at school could be determined from an assessment of interspousal relations, maternal functioning, and child perception variables. Teachers evaluated adaptive functioning, social withdrawal, and aggressive behavior at school for a carefully selected sample of 22 boys and 24 girls (ages 7-12) whose parents had been separated for two to 18 months. Regression analyses indicated that boys' overall school adjustment was associated with better maternal parenting skills, lower child fear of abandonment, less blaming of father for the separation, and positive parental verbal attributions toward the other parent. Girls with better overall school adjustment reported less blaming of their mothers and a higher rate of positive attributions by mother about father. These findings suggest concepts family physicians can use in working with families to minimize the effect of divorce on children.",Family medicine,1990 Mar-Apr,United States,1990,90

Based on a general population sample of 1556 married men and women, it goes beyond previous efforts in two ways. First, it presents the first large-scale analysis of situational determinants of coping effectiveness in response to a wide variety of stressful life events and chronic difficulties. This analysis documents that previous aggregate analyses overlooked a number of specifications which, when observed, provide insights into the mechanisms of coping effectiveness. Second, it assesses the importance of two empirically generated multivariate coping profiles, passivity and versatility. The study's findings suggest that these profiles are associated significantly with adjustment to stress, that these associations differ across situations, and that they help to interpret the effects of separate coping strategies.",Journal of health and social behavior,1990 Mar,United States,1990,90

This article analyzes the incidence and determinants of functional disability in a cohort of 1,001 females and males hospitalized with angina or other acute coronary diseases in 1976-77 and followed through 1985. Proportional hazards and logistic models are utilized to examine sex interactions in long-term disability outcomes. Female survivors with angina are shown to be at significantly higher risk for diminished functional capacity when compared to men as well as to women with other heart disease. Thus, the extended survival and higher incidence of angina among elderly women will likely result in an increased societal burden of disablement in the aged population.",Journal of gerontology,1990 Mar,United States,1990,90
2344434,"When pupils do not understand the determinants of their success and failure in school: relations between internal, teacher and unknown perceptions of control and school achievement.","Both dispositional and attributional perspectives on perceptions of control assume that people have some idea of outcome determinants. This, however, may not always be so. This study tested the hypothesis that pupils do not always understand the determinants of their learning outcomes, and that such a sense of unknown control will be associated with poor achievement in school. The study was unusual in that it tapped both dispositional control perceptions, using the new MMPCC, and causal attributions for success and failure in a school examination. Subjects were 186 10-year-old Israeli pupils of heterogeneous SES. Results confirmed that unknown control emerged as a distinct dimension of perceived control in both dispositional and attributional measures, and was consistently associated with poor achievement in school. Attributions of test outcomes to unknown causes were strongly related to dispositional unknown control, and were not affected by success or failure. In contrast, dispositional and attributional internality were unrelated, and did not predict achievement. It is argued that internal beliefs reflect internalised social-educational norms, and as a result have less impact on motivation than perceptions of unknown control. The implications of these findings for educational practice and motivational interventions are discussed.",The British journal of educational psychology,1990 Feb,England,1990,90

Exposure to a novel odor was paired with CCK injection, and the rats' olfactory choices were assessed 24 hr later. Rats at 5, 11, and 22 days of age preferred the odor previously associated with CCK, compared with vehicle-injected littermates. In contrast, CCK failed to support olfactory conditioning in 28-day-old rats, whether they were (a) weaned and independently housed, (b) residing with the dam and suckling, or (c) fed only milk. Adult rats also did not establish an odor preference with CCK as the unconditioned stimulus. Thus, CCK's changing impact from positive to neutral probably occurs during the rats' 4th postnatal week and may be related to maturational changes occurring during the final stages of weaning.",Behavioral neuroscience,1990 Feb,United States,1990,90
2308764,Non-institutional treatment of chronic pain by field management: an outcome study with comparison group.,"Field management, through the use of specially trained field consultants, is a mechanism by which interdisciplinary interventions can be implemented in non-institutional settings. Management of the real environmental determinants (home, work, social) of pain and disability should improve the effectiveness of behaviorally based interventions and make these treatments more accessible. Over a 6 year period, 261 patients having various chronic somatic complaints (e.g., pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints) underwent interdisciplinary outpatient treatment based on medical and behavioral sciences. Comparison of patients having field management with patients receiving office-based treatment found a significantly greater reduction in disability with field management. 84% of field managed patients had a successful outcome as defined by: (a) return to regular work, or (b) reduced limitations on work, exercise, and daily living activities, depending on functional status at assessment. Only 61% of patients with office-based treatment were successful. Compliance, defined as the frequency with which treatment was mutually terminated, was significantly higher with field management. The availability of long-term disability benefits was highly predictive of a poorer outcome. However, field management remained effective for improving functional status regardless of the availability of benefits. Finally, determination of the cost of non-institutional treatment indicated that field management is a cost-effective modality. Implications of these findings for the treatment of disability in chronic pain and other chronic illness syndromes are discussed.",Pain,1990 Feb,United States,1990,90
2299374,Adaptive behavioral responses to potential infertility among survivors of testis cancer.,"In a retrospective study of 153 testis cancer survivors, we examined the sociodemographic and clinical determinants of attitudes and behaviors toward illness-induced infertility. Five fertility adjustment responses were identified: sperm-banking awareness (SBA); adoption awareness (AA); fertility testing (FT); trying to father children (TFC); and fertility distress (FD). Although responses to infertility are multidetermined, these data demonstrate there is a distinct sociodemographic and clinical profile for the subgroups of men who engage in different fertility-related behaviors. Multivariate analysis results show that men most likely to be concerned with banking sperm are those who at diagnosis are younger (less than 35 years), childless, college educated, and whose relationships have become strained. Men who sought fertility tests were childless, college graduates, and able to ejaculate. The only factor predicting adoption was childlessness. Those married men attempting to father children were also less than 35 years of age at diagnosis and without ejaculatory dysfunction. The men at greatest risk for continued distress about infertility were those who remained childless and had posttreatment ejaculatory dysfunction. Residual infertility distress also was significantly associated with treatments that included extensive retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) surgery, indicating that the latter is a ""risk factor"" in survivors' long-term distress. These data, while not definitive, show that the prerogative to have children is very important to men and that losing it sets into motion a range of both adverse emotions and adaptive responses. Adjustment to infertility is a complex process that begins at diagnosis and extends long after treatment is completed.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,1990 Feb,United States,1990,90
2299337,Psychosocial predictors of survival in end-stage renal disease.,"Several psychosocial variables were investigated as predictors of 4-year survival in a sample of 97 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing treatment by hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, or renal transplantation. Hypothesized psychosocial predictors included depression, mood disturbance, life happiness, affect, pessimism, self-esteem, knowledge of renal disease and its treatment, perceived control over important life domains, perceived intrusiveness of ESRD into important life domains, illness-related concerns, difficulties in daily activities, number of regular leisure activities, somatic symptoms of distress, social networks, recent negative life events, and defensive response styles. Methodological controls were incorporated to test the prognostic significance of these variables and included a) exclusion of deaths attributable to ""unnatural"" causes; b) multivariate statistical controls for physical and demographic determinants of survival; c) widely used standardized psychosocial instruments; and d) temporally aggregated psychosocial measurements to enhance reliability. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses identified four variables as significant and independent predictors of increased survival times in ESRD: a) comparatively fewer serious nonrenal comorbid illnesses; b) younger age; c) regular involvement in an increased number of leisure activities; and d) overall life happiness described as ""an even mixture of unhappiness and happiness"" (as compared with ""very happy""). However, no evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that increased depressive symptoms and/or moods contribute to compromised survival in ESRD.",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,1990 Feb,United States,1990,90
2295384,Psychosocial factors are associated with health care seeking rather than diagnosis in irritable bowel syndrome.,"The objective of this prospective study was to test the hypothesis that 6 reportedly important psychosocial factors were useful criteria for diagnosing the irritable bowel syndrome. Ninety-seven new patients with entry complaints of abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, or both underwent full evaluation by board-certified or -eligible gastroenterologists in an outpatient setting. The independent measures were 6 questionnaires concerning anxiety, depression, stress, lack of social support, somatization, and abnormal illness behavior. The dependent measure, irritable bowel syndrome, was defined as the absence of an organic disease explanation for patients' entry complaints. Two other board-certified gastroenterologists, independent of the study, made this determination. Their rating was based on full review of transcripts of patients' clinic visits, laboratory data, and the results of a 9-mo telephone follow-up to patients and their physicians. Sixty-five percent of the sample had no organic disease explanation for the entry symptoms, thereby representing irritable bowel syndrome. The psychosocial predictors did not show a significant association with irritable bowel syndrome; the power of the study was 0.86. Post hoc analysis revealed that patients with organic disease, as well as patients with irritable bowel syndrome, had significantly more (p less than 0.01) psychosocial abnormality than normal subjects, which likely contributed to the inability of the psychosocial predictors to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease. It was concluded that psychosocial criteria were of limited value in differentiating irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease but that they were determinants of health care seeking for the entire study group.",Gastroenterology,1990 Feb,United States,1990,90
23511722,Safety and risk in a context of cultureAn anthropological perspective on the relativity of health and care.,"The question of safety and risk in people's ideas about health and care is approached here from an anthropological perspective. One strength of such an interpretive approach which seems especially important in this context, is that, although the researcher provides an account of the beliefs and actions of other people, the exercise is undertaken with an awareness that the interpretation is itself a product of particular historical and cultural determinants.Cultures, including those of industrial-capitalistic societies like Sweden, form systems of meanings which provide explanations of how the world works, of what is thought of as real and what is designated as natural and inevitable as well as what is morally right. These meanings link people to one another and form the basis for social action. It is thus within this framework that the notion of risk and safety get their content and meaning.In this line of thought a description is provided of what happens when people meet in joint health care encounters where their interests do not coincide, their understanding of what is going' on is not the same, or their expectations of what the other should or should not do differ. How considerations of safety and risk in our health care may be interpreted by people with other health theories and views or other understandings about such things as what life is, what is a person, what is good health, a good life or a normal body, and what death means, are also discussed. An attempt is made to profile the need to define variations in the notions of risk and safety in health care over cultural boundaries with examples from cross-cultural studies.",The International journal of risk & safety in medicine,1990,Netherlands,1990,90

16840148,Spirituality: the silent dimension in addiction research. The 1990 leonard ball oration.,"Researchers currently recognize and incorporate psychological, biomedical, and social determinants in the study of addictive behaviors. Yet spiritual aspects of addiction and recovery remain virtually unstudied, despite the fact that spirituality is given central importance in Alcoholics Anonymous and in the lives of many individuals. Traditional spiritual concepts have been relabelled to remove their transcendent dimension, and addiction researchers have acted as though spirituality plays no role in the lives of those they study. Consequently an entire class of potentially important variables is being overlooked. A majority of variance in addictive behaviors and treatment outcomes remains unexplained, a portion of which might be accounted for through the study of spiritual dependent, moderator, and independent variables. Behavioural scientists have begun to acknowledge the role of complex spiritual, moral, and decisional processes in the addictive behaviours. Though uncomfortable in some ways for both believers and unbelievers, the scientific study of spiritual processes may improve our understanding of the addictive behaviours, and our ability to prevent and treat these enduring problems.",Drug and alcohol review,1990,Australia,1990,90

Data employed in the period analysis were mainly from the years 1944 to 1985, while women born between the years 1935 and 1960 were the subjects of the cohort analysis. An examination of selected indices, namely, age-specific first-birth fertility rates, median ages of women at first-order birth and cumulative first-order birth rates shows that there is an overall trend for women to postpone the initiation of childbearing until late twenties or early thirties....

""It is shown that, in general, higher tax rates reduce distributive inequality as long as the rate of interest is exogenously given. In steady state, however, where the rate of interest is determined endogenously, increasing taxation and higher social security payments both diminish the capital labor ratio so that the rate of interest rises. If this interest effect is strong enough then it may outbalance the tendency toward more equality because higher interest rates enhance initial differences in the distribution of both income and wealth and, eventually, the inequality in the distribution of income and wealth in the society.""

2408154,Determinants of active self-care behaviour of insulin treated patients with diabetes: implications for diabetes education.,"The most important aim of diabetes education is to alter the self-care behaviour of patients with diabetes. In order to change their behaviour its determinants must be known. The pretest of a multicentre evaluation study with 558 participating insulin treated patients with diabetes was analysed to test the usefulness of the attitude-behaviour theory of Fishbein & Ajzen in explaining and possibly changing diabetes related active self-care behaviour. The theory of Fishbein & Ajzen is based on the assumption that human behaviour is reasoned behaviour. The theory views a person's intention as the immediate determinant of action. Determinants of intention are attitude and social norm. The results showed that the attitude was the most important determinant of active self-care, while a sufficient level of knowledge and a low orientation on the powerful others health locus of control scale were prerequisites for a positive attitude. The influence of the social environment was detrimental; although people tried to motivate patients to active self-care, they could not provide any real help in performing this desired behaviour. According to the results of this study, diabetes education should first aim at improving the level of knowledge and the health locus of control of the patients and second, at a positive attitude to active self-care. It is necessary to educate the social environment to create a more supportive atmosphere for the patient with diabetes.",Social science & medicine (1982),1990,England,1990,90
2384283,Individual or social responsibility for premature death? Current controversies in the British debate about health.,"This article uses the current controversies in the British debate about health to illustrate the need to theorize, and therefore critically evaluate, the links between medicine and health policies, including health care policies. The medical model of health is deeply embedded in institutional practices in many countries, and while this model has attracted deserved criticism in recent years, an alternative social model, or one that incorporates indispensable aspects of the medical model, has attracted much less attention and requires sustained development. Comparative study of patterns of inequality in health, and especially of the correlation between material deprivation and premature mortality, necessarily reveals causal determinants of both health and ill-health in populations and invites ambitious programs to develop a social model.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1990,United States,1990,90
2373593,"Stress, social support, and symptoms of depression in spouses of the medically ill.","This study investigated the level and frequency of depressive symptoms in spouses of dialysis patients, as a function of a) severity of patient disease, b) level of stress experienced by the spouse, and c) perception of support from the ill partner. The subjects were forty patients who had begun dialysis in the last year and their spouses. Measures of depression, impact on family, perceived social support, and disease severity were applied. Significant depressive symptoms were reported by 20 percent of spouses. Symptom severity was not correlated with age, sex, or occupation of the spouses, nor with level of depression or functional impairment of the dialysis patients. The amount of social support received from the ill partner accounted for 37 percent of the variance in spouse depression, while social and financial stressors reported by the spouse explained 13 percent of the variance in spouse symptoms. These findings suggest that depressive symptoms in spouses of dialysis patients are associated with the social and economic consequences of the illness for the family but even more so with the amount of perceived support from the patient. The determinants of this perceived support need further exploration.",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,1990,United States,1990,90
2363060,"Malaria among gold miners in southern Para, Brazil: estimates of determinants and individual costs.","As malaria grows more prevalent in the Amazon frontier despite increased expenditures by disease control authorities, national and regional tropical disease control strategies are being called into question. The current crisis involving traditional control/eradication methods has broadened the search for feasible and effective malaria control strategies--a search that necessarily includes an investigation of the roles of a series of individual and community-level socioeconomic characteristics in determining malaria prevalence rates, and the proper methods of estimating these links. In addition, social scientists and policy makers alike know very little about the economic costs associated with malarial infections. In this paper, I use survey data from several Brazilian gold mining areas to (a) test the general reliability of malaria-related questionnaire response data, and suggest categorization methods to minimize the statistical influence of exaggerated responses, (b) estimate three statistical models aimed at detecting the socioeconomic determinants of individual malaria prevalence rates, and (c) calculate estimates of the average cost of a single bout of malaria. The results support the general reliability of survey response data gathered in conjunction with malaria research. Once the effects of vector exposure were controlled for, individual socioeconomic characteristics were only weakly linked to malaria prevalence rates in these very special miners' communities. Moreover, the socioeconomic and exposure links that were significant did not depend on the measure of malaria adopted. Finally, individual costs associated with malarial infections were found to be a significant portion of miners' incomes.",Social science & medicine (1982),1990,England,1990,90

Unsafe induced abortion is responsible for perhaps one-quarter of these deaths. In this article, the author reviews the legal, medical, and social contexts in which women in developing countries resort to clandestine abortion. Despite intensified international concern with reducing high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, national policy makers and participants at international conferences on maternal health--with a few important exceptions--have not recommended that safe, legal services for terminating unwanted pregnancies be offered as an essential element of basic reproductive health care. United States international policy on funding abortion-related activities in maternal health and family planning programs is especially restrictive. A new policy approach is clearly needed if unacceptably high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in many countries are to be reduced.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1990,United States,1990,90
2331859,Recent trends and socio-demographic determinants of exercise participation in Australia.,"Although sentiments about the positive health benefits of regular exercise have been expressed for many centuries, it is only in the past three decades that epidemiologic evidence has provided scientific support for the health benefits of being physically active. The evidence for the protective effect of physical activity is particularly strong with reference to cardiovascular disease, with the relative risk of being ""inactive"" compared to 'active' estimated to typically lie between 1.5 and 2.0. Despite the popular view that exercise participation has increased in recent years, estimates of trends in physical activity in Australian (and other) populations have been difficult to interpret because of the different measurements and surveys used. We examined data from population surveys using well validated, standardised methods to assess exercise participation, through National surveys between 1984 and 1987 conducted by the Commonwealth Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT). Over the period in which the surveys were conducted, there appears to have been a slight increase in the proportion of Australians who participated in regular physical activity. There was a significant decline in the proportion who reported being totally sedentary--from 32.9 per cent in 1984 to 25.4 per cent in 1987. The data from all of the surveys were then pooled to give an overall sample size of 17053, and socio-demographic variables were examined in relation to exercise participation. Women, older people, the less well educated, and those on lower incomes were less likely to perform regular physical activity. Inequalities in the social distribution of exercise participation parallel those found for other health risk factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Community health studies,1990,Australia,1990,90

In coping with this, she is left to the support of the caring medical staff. Therefore, the aim of the present study was 1. to ascertain, to what extent mothers of children with cleft lip and palate are given information on the malformation, and receive emotional support by the medical staff; and 2. to determine the effect such experiences have on their ability to cope. For this purpose we developed a special questionnaire, which was completed by 154 mothers of such children. Retrospectively, a relevant part of them criticised not only the communication and the contents of information, but also the emotional support as deficient. A correlation between these determinants and largely insufficient coping was statistically confirmed.

The goal of this paper is to document the eating patterns and problems of single homeless women and to locate the determinants of nutritional adequacy in their diets. Our findings are based on a random sample of 84 single homeless women using hostels and drop-in centers. For 85.5% of the women food was provided primarily by hostels and supplemented by the drop-ins. When their daily food intake was compared to the Canada's Food Guide recommendations, the average number of servings in each of the four food groups was below the recommended. The women in our sample indicated that their problems with food consumption were rooted in their poverty and further analysis indicated that the provision of food by social agencies was an important factor in the nutritional adequacy of their diets. Hostels and drop-in centers not only provide shelter, they have also assumed most of the responsibility for feeding the homeless. It is their poverty which burdens these women and structures their eating patterns.",Women & health,1990,United States,1990,90

2287933,Temporal lobe asymmetries as the key to the etiology of schizophrenia.,"With evidence that determinants of psychosis are present early and influence brain development, and in the absence of a significant environmental contribution, schizophrenia may be regarded as a genetic encephalopathy. Morphological abnormalities are particularly apparent in the temporal lobe and on the left side of the brain, and in a number of studies significant diagnosis x side interactions have been detected. Such interactions suggest an intimate relationship between the disease process and the mechanisms that determine asymmetrical brain development. These mechanisms presumably relate to the human capacity for speech and communication, and they may have played a critical role in the evolution of the human brain. A candidate locus for an asymmetry determinant and the psychosis gene within the exchange region of the sex chromosomes is proposed. Some sex differences in schizophrenia (e.g., with respect to age of onset and brain structure) may relate to subtle differences in the rate of asymmetry development in the two sexes.",Schizophrenia bulletin,1990,United States,1990,90

Skinfold thicknesses were found to increase with age almost linearly in women, while in men they increased only before age 40 to 45. Subcutaneous fat was, but fat distribution was not, highly correlated with relative weight in both sexes. Alcohol consumption, healthy dietary habits (inversely), and exercise (inversely) were all significantly related to subcutaneous fat in men, while the relatively strongest predictors of female skinfold thicknesses were smoking (inversely), coffee consumption, and education (inversely). In multivariate analysis, environmental factors explained up to 10% of skinfold variance in male subjects and between 10 and 15% in females. Fat distribution was more influenced by environmental factors in men (about 8% of explained variance) than in women (about 4%). In men, truncal fat depended more on lifestyle that did upper arm fat, with smoking (directly) and exercise (inversely) being relatively most predictive of abdominal fat. We conclude that, although relative weight, subcutaneous fat, and fat distribution correlate intra-individually, they are not equivalent and interchangeable anthropometric characteristics. This is reflected by the varying associations of the three fatness indicators with age and environmental factors such as smoking, diet, exercise, and education. Gender seems to be an important modifying factor of environment-body fat-associations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1990,Switzerland,1990,90
2273218,Physician-management relationships at HCA: a case study.,"The questions of whether Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), a for-profit hospital company, fostered an environment detrimental to the physician-patient relationship during the period of implementation of the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) was explored. The transition to PPS provided an opportunity to evaluate whether hospital ownership differences affected responses to a payment system which encouraged institutional intervention in the practice of medicine. A case study approach was used to observe the influence of the then largest for-profit hospital corporation upon physicians' medical practice in four owned hospitals. Findings indicated that HCA hospital managers were most directly influenced by the local competitive environment and their own personal agendas in responding to PPS incentives. Corporate influence actually softened payment system incentives to intervene in medical practice by providing a generous supply of capital, and by fostering a corporate culture conducive to cooperative relationships with physicians. Better public understanding of the determinants of hospital behavior is needed to preserve or enhance important social goals such as the physician-patient relationship; easily measurable characteristics such as ownership or bed size explain little about hospital behavior or motivation.","Journal of health politics, policy and law",1990 Fall,United States,1990,90
2270509,Assessing the reproductive behavior of on- and off-reservation American Indian females: characteristics of two groups in Montana.,"Only limited fertility and general reproductive health data exist on American Indians. Using data from the 1987 Montana American Indian Health Risk Assessment, we found that the fertility of American Indians in Great Falls and on the Blackfeet Reservation was similar to blacks in the U.S. and relatively high when compared with fertility of whites in the United States. The influence of the direct determinants of fertility (nuptiality, contraceptive use, and lactation) was very different for the populations examined in this study. Great Falls American Indians and the U.S. black population were similar regarding age at first sexual intercourse (very young), breastfeeding (low prevalence and short duration), planning status of pregnancies (high unplanned), and contraceptive use (only moderate use). In contrast, Blackfeet women on the reservation and the U.S. white population married relatively late, had very high contraceptive use, used effective methods of contraception, and had moderately high levels of breastfeeding. However, Blackfeet fertility was much higher than that of whites. Three interrelated reasons are suggested as possible explanations. Blackfeet couples either wanted high fertility, were relatively poor users of family planning methods, or used less effective methods until they had exceeded their desired family size after which time they turned to sterilization. These finds raise numerous questions concerning the social and economic factors that may account for these group similarities and differences. Further studies with much larger data sets are needed to address these issues adequately.",Social biology,1990 Spring-Summer,United States,1990,90
2265661,Some determinants of attrition in prospective studies on aging.,"Demographic measures, psychosocial variables, and objective and subjective measures of physical impairment were assessed in elderly men twice at intervals of 12 to 18 months. Canonical discriminant function analysis of the relationship between these predictor variables on the first testing and whether participants (a) returned for retesting, (b) did not return because of apparent disinterest, or (c) did not return because of illness or death, revealed two significant canonical variates. The first, characterized by decreased mental and physical capacity, discriminated between the deceased/ill group and the other two groups. The second was characterized by decreased social interaction and life satisfaction, and increased life events, and distinguished between the disinterested group and the other two groups. However, both groups that failed to return for retesting showed evidence of impaired physical health and a general disengagement from social and personal activities, compared to the retested group.",Experimental aging research,1990 Spring-Summer,United States,1990,90
2259740,[Social determinants of attempted suicide].,"With the case histories as a basis, the sociodemographic characteristics were analyzed of patients admitted to the Clinical Toxicology Centre, Institute of Occupational Medicine, Lodz, with drug-involving self-poisonings. Besides, the most prevalent reasons for and motives of suicidal attempts were determined. The majority of patients were between 15 and 29 years of age. The suicidal attempts were found to be more frequent in women and the highest rate (48%) was reported in married couples. Among the reasons, the family problems dominated. The majority of patients regarded the suicidal attempt as an instrument; only a few reported a strong will to die. The case study indicate that in seeking reasons for suicidal attempts the family status and social situation should be considered.",Przeglad lekarski,1990,Poland,1990,90
2239512,[Psychophysical status of high school graduates. Results of sociologic studies].,"This article intends to describe the present state and development of the psychophysical state of health of GDR graduates. Special attention is given to various quantities influencing the state of health, above all job-related determinants. The empirical basis is an interval study, carried out by the Zentralinstitut fur Jugendforschung Leipzig; this study registered and attended hundred of people from the beginning of their studies in 1970 during the following 15 years in seven intervals. Preferably social factors and determinants were studied empirically and partly problematical interrelations between health and working conditions and contents as well as critical development trends of health were pointed out. In this way important starting points for taking measures to influence exogene health determinants were fixed: especially questions of working contents, of correct appointment of graduates corresponding to their profession and qualification, of a permanent training of psycho-physical capabilities.",Arztliche Jugendkunde,1990,Germany,1990,90
2237002,Personal control and other determinants of psychological well-being in nursing home elders.,"The purpose of this correlational study was to identify predictors of psychological well-being in nursing home elders. Predictors considered were two dimensions of personal control, physical health, functional health, socioeconomic status, length of stay in the nursing home, and interaction variables. The nonrandom sample consisted of 302 cognitively intact nursing home elders with poor to excellent self-rated physical health. Instruments used included the Life Satisfaction Index A, Affect Balance Scale, Desired Control Measure, The Index of Activities of Daily Living, and The Two Factor Index of Social Position. Regression analysis demonstrated that dimensions of personal control and self-rated physical health explained 33% (p less than .001) of the variance of psychological well-being. Findings suggested predictor variables to guide the promotion and maintenance of psychological well-being in the subjects of this sample.",Scholarly inquiry for nursing practice,1990 Summer,United States,1990,90
2218623,Levels of health development: a new tool for comparative research and policy formulation.,"Levels of health development are formed by mathematically clustering countries using six health status indicators: crude birth, crude death, infant mortality and child death rates, and male and female life expectancy. Stratifying two international samples of 128 and 163 countries into levels of health development--groups with similar health status profiles--improves the results of regression analyses used to identify economic, political, social, educational, health and other health determinants. For this reason, health development levels are a systematic framework for delineation of health determinants. Earlier large scale statistical studies have been limited in their success in part because they did not partition their data sets prior to analysis, or used inappropriate criteria that blurred rather than heightened developmental differences in underlying social systems. These developmental differences regulate the way in which health status inputs are converted into health status outputs, defining the relative importance of health determinants at various developmental levels. At lowest health development levels (countries with poorer health status), the under-development of economic, health and educational infrastructures creates a vacuum which allows international intervention (aid, investment, export/import activities) to play a dominant role in health status determination. At middle health development levels, health and educational infrastructures are better developed, but still secondary in importance as health status determinants to basic economic infrastructure. Demographic problems are particularly apparent at these levels. At higher health development levels, education, women's status, and political structure are especially important health status determinants. This research has facilitated the identification of health status determinants for use in health policy analysis. Recommendations for future research include use of findings in health policymaking by individual countries and by comparative researchers, and development of appropriate health systems models for each level of health development.",Social science & medicine (1982),1990,England,1990,90
2204604,Caregivers for Alzheimer's patients: what we are learning from research.,"The research literature on adjustment by family members to providing care to victims of Alzheimer's disease is new and expanding rapidly. The purpose of this review is to summarize the categories and methods of that research; to evaluate critically the state of knowledge these studies are producing; and to suggest ways of strengthening future investigations. The review is organized around psychological, social, and health factors as antecedents or correlates of similar categories of outcomes for caregivers. While there are some emerging relationships involving caregiver burden, depression, and psychological well-being, it is difficult to generalize about the determinants or correlates of the consequences of meeting caregiver responsibilities; this difficulty probably results from a failure to deal adequately with key concepts and circumstances of the caregiver. These conceptual and methodological shortcomings are discussed and suggestions for refinement made.",International journal of aging & human development,1990,United States,1990,90
2185515,Drug use and its social covariates from the period of adolescence to young adulthood. Some implications from longitudinal studies.,"This chapter presents a review and discussion of the dynamic relationship between drug use, especially the use of illicit drugs, and its social covariates from the period of adolescence to young adulthood. The discussion is based primarily on longitudinal studies. In particular, I include a review and discussion of my collaborative studies with Kandel, in which we employ life-course perspectives for the analysis of natural drug and life histories of individuals based on event-history models. Specifically, I discuss five covariates: (1) age, (2) onset age of drug use, (3) historical period, (4) family and work roles, and (5) influence of significant others, with the dynamic interdependence between drug use and family and work roles as the major topic of discussion. The discussion also includes some insights into the issue of causation vs. selection effects regarding the influence of drug use on life-course pattern, and presents a novel aspect of indirect effects in the analysis of the determinants of drug use progression.","Recent developments in alcoholism : an official publication of the American Medical Society on Alcoholism, the Research Society on Alcoholism, and the National Council on Alcoholism",1990,United States,1990,90
2178896,Adherence to diabetes regimens: empirical status and clinical applications.,"Adherence to diabetes treatment regimens has proved to be a conceptual and empirical enigma. Consequently, reliable and valid applications to the clinical practice of diabetes care and education have been wanting. Rates of nonadherence are staggeringly high, regardless of the methodology employed, and verification of self-reports is complicated by social desirability to appear compliant. Low intertask correlations further complicate our understanding of adherence-metabolic control relationships. Studies relating to the Health Belief Model, social learning theory, and the psychology of interpersonal relationships that have sought to identify determinants of adherence behaviors have specific relevance to the clinical practice of diabetes education.",The Diabetes educator,1990 Jan-Feb,United States,1990,90
2093232,Women's status and infant mortality in rural Colombia.,"This paper investigates the effects of maternal demographic characteristics and social and economic statuses on infant mortality in rural Colombia. Demographic characteristics include the age of the mother, parity and length of preceding interbirth interval, and sex of infant. Measures of women's status at the time of birth include education, wage labor and occupation, economic stratum, place of residence, and whether the mother is living with a husband. The life history data for the study (involving 4,928 births) were collected in 1986 from a representative sample of two cohorts of women resident in rural central Colombia. Overall differentials in infant mortality by measures of women's status are small and are in good part associated with the differing reproductive behaviors of the women and variations in breastfeeding practices. The sharp declines in infant mortality recorded in rural Colombia in recent years appear less related to improved status of women than to reductions in fertility that enhance infant survivorship and to public health interventions shared by all segments of the population.",Social biology,1990 Fall-Winter,United States,1990,90
2090618,Perceived control and acceptance of the decision to enter a nursing home as predictors of adjustment.,"A longitudinal study of newly admitted nursing home residents examined the effects of perceived control over the relocation decision and acceptance of the relocation in general as determinants of changes in functional health and morale. Perceived control had positive effects on health during the first month of residency but negative effects on health and morale between the second and fourth months. On the other hand, acceptance had positive effects on both health and morale between the second and fourth months. Perceived control over the relocation process appears to have short-term benefits but long-term costs, whereas acceptance appears to be a separate and important coping function.",International journal of aging & human development,1990,United States,1990,90
2087849,[Psychosocial determinants of alcohol and nicotine consumption by students].,"Based upon research on the reasons why the legal drugs alcohol and nicotine are consumed there was tried to find out whether the reasons for drinking and smoking, found in studies on different groups of people, are also valid for students or if there are other reasons because of the special way of life of the students. 146 students were asked with a questionnaire that was constructed for this study. Results show that some of the reasons found in other studies are also important to the students of the investigated sample, so the relation between consumption and health behavior or between consumption and behavior of the friends. Other reasons that are described in the literature could not be confirmed. Results suggest that drug researchers should not draw conclusions about small groups from very mixed samples but try to study the smoking and drinking behavior of homogeneous samples to identify possibilities for specific preventive or therapeutic help.","Zeitschrift fur klinische Psychologie, Psychopathologie und Psychotherapie",1990,Germany,1990,90
2083264,HIV prevention: current health promoting behaviour models for understanding psycho-social determinants of condom use.,"The application of current health promoting behaviour models for understanding psycho-social determinants of condom use is discussed. It was concluded that their utility is reduced because they are individualistic models and do not take into account interaction between couples, and contextual factors. Systemic AIDS counselling and relapse prevention approaches to invervention may provide a better basis for developing an appropriate methodology for studying condom use because they incorporate contextual factors. Some future directions for research into the determinants of condom use and the implications for health education and counselling are proposed.",AIDS care,1990,England,1990,90
2082463,Determinants of fat consumption in a general population.,"In a random sample of the adult population (aged 25-64 years) from Ghent and Charleroi in Belgium, dietary fat consumption was estimated using both qualitative and quantitative dietary methods. A fat consumption score (FCS) was constructed from the qualitative method, and it correlated significantly with the dietary polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids (P/S) ratio calculated from the quantitative method (r = -0.48; p less than 0.001). Differences in FCS were then studied using univariate and multivariate analyses. In both men and women, FCS was higher in Charleroi than in Ghent. In men, FCS was inversely related with educational level and with age. In women, significant correlations were observed with marital status. No differences were found in FCS by smoking behaviour. With the coronary risk factors, low-order relationships were found, but only in men. In the middle-aged group, significant correlations were found between FCS and the fatty acid composition of the serum cholesteryl esters, in particular with the linoleate/oleate ratio.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1990,France,1990,90
