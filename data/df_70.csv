521899,Environmental determinants of memory improvement in late adulthood.,"Two studies were conducted with nursing home residents to determine whether memory could be improved. This was accomplished by increasing the cognitive demand of the environment and then varying the extent to which residents were motivated to attend to and remember these environmental factors. In Study 1, motivation to practice recommended cognitive activities was manipulated by varying the degree of reciprocal self-disclosure offered by interviewers in a series of dyadic interactions. In Study 2, motivation to practice recommended cognitive activities was manipulated by varying whether positive outcomes were contingent on attending to and remembering these activities, which increased in demand over time. Whether as a function of interpersonal (Study 1) or practical (Study 2) incentives, engaging in cognitive activity resulted in improvement on standard short-term memory tests, including probe recall and pattern recall, as well as in improvement on nurses' ratings of alertness, mental activity, and social adjustment for experimental groups relative to controls.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1979 Nov,United States,1979,70
508073,Epidemiologic profile of long-term stroke disability: the Framingham study.,"One hundred forty-eight long-term stroke survivors and 148 control persons matched for age and sex, from the Framingham Study cohort, were examined for residual functional disability. Prevalence rates for 9 specific types of functional deficit ranged from 15% for institutionalization, to 63% for decreased vocational function in the group of stroke survivors. The comparable rates in the control group were significantly lower. Cardiovascular comorbidity was greater in stroke survivors than in controls. Removal of its apparent effects on function decreased the magnitude, but not the overall pattern, of documented disability in both groups. The most severe disabilities, institutionalization, dependence in mobility, and dependence in self-care, were the least prevalent. The more frequently documented types of functional deficit were those in which psychosocial and environmental factors are significant determinants.",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,1979 Nov,United States,1979,70
499795,The psychiatrist's role in behavioral pediatrics training programs.,"Behavioral pediatric fellowships are available in 15 major medical institutions in the United States. In general, these programs focus on the psychologic, social, and biologic determinants of behavior and learning disabilities in children. Child psychiatry's participation in the formulative stages of these programs is considered vital. The authors caution psychiatry to avoid concentrating its energies upon these socially and developmentally inclined behavioral pediatricians to the detriment of all pediatric house staff.",General hospital psychiatry,1979 Sep,United States,1979,70
452223,Psychologic effects of vasectomy in voluntarily childless men.,"Forty-four childless men and 51 vasectomized parents were compared as to their childhood backgrounds, marital satisfaction, social/emotional adjustment, physical and emotional problems attributed to the vasectomy, and attitudes toward vasectomy as a means of birth control. The findings suggested that for young married men, firmly committed to childlessness and in agreement with their wives regarding the necessity of the operation, vasectomy appears to be as physically and psychologically safe as in married parents for at least a two-year period. There were differences in the childfree men and fathers in styles of adjustment, with the childfree reporting themselves to be more independent, mobile, and less tied to tradition; these differences were seen as being more related to choosing a childfree life style than to the choice of vasectomy as a contraceptive method.",Urology,1979 Jul,United States,1979,70
462150,[Socioeconomic aspects of lung cancer].,"The socio-economic aspects of lung cancer are briefly considered, first, with regard to the causes conditioning its occurrence and clinical progress. Tobacco smoking, occupational exposure and air pollution are (in decreasing order of importance) the main determinants of lung cancer occurrence, which differs as between social classes. Social class also appears to be related to clinical progress of the disease. The economic consequences of lung cancer may be tentatively estimated, for a country like Switzerland, at 40 million Swiss francs per year, a sum which can be greatly reduced if a sustained collective effort at prevention is implemented.",Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,1979 Jun 2,Switzerland,1979,70
476369,The course and determinants of reactions to myocardial infarction.,"The growth of speculative theories about response to physical illness has not been backed by quantitative information. The introduction of standardized measures of psychological and social adjustment has allowed description and analysis of disability for 100 patients and their spouses two and twelve months after a first myocardial infarction. (1) Global measures of social outcome were found to be inadequate and misleading and therefore work, leisure, marriage and family relationships, sex and compliance were separately examined. (2) There was considerable continuity in individual reactions throughout convalescence and it was possible (3) to identify factors in the premorbid psychosocial state predictive of outcome and (4) to describe characteristic patterns of coping. (5) Outcome for spouses can be similarly described and understood. The findings have clinical applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, treatment and the evaluation of medical care. The conclusion also extend our understanding of the basic principles underlying response to physical illness.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1979 Jun,England,1979,70

221759,Psychosocial determinants of immunization behavior in a swine influenza campaign.,"A prospective design was used to study factors which predisposed individuals to receive vaccination in response to the anticipated outbreak of swine influenza in the fall and winter of 1976. Data were obtained from a telephone survey of 286 adults in Oakland County, Michigan. Predictor variables included Health Belief Model (HBM) variables as well as measures of behavioral intention, social influence, physician's advice, socioeconomic status and past experience with flu shots. In multivariate analysis, over 40 per cent of the variance in inoculation behavior was explained by the predictors used. Path analysis revealed that most of the HBM variables' influence on behavior was mediated through behavioral intention. While behavioral intention was an important predictor of inoculation behavior, other psychosocial factors played a significant role in explaining variance in the dependent variable.",Medical care,1979 Jun,United States,1979,70
439171,Economic stress and mental health.,"This paper correlates economic stress with minority status, resource allocations for mental health programs, and vulnerability to mental disability. Several hypotheses are advanced:1. A major and recurring psychological pattern of the American national character is prowhite, antiblack paranoia.2. Mental health fiscal allocations and programmatic determinations in ghetto, lower socioeconomic, minority-populated urban areas are predicated on political and racist considerations, the underlying motivation being to keep minorities at greater risk of mental disability.3. Economic privation and stress increase vulnerability to mental illness, especially in a minority population for whom health, mental health, educational, and social services are grossly inadequate.4. Poverty and economic stress combine with health systems that are unresponsive to the needs of blacks and other minorities, resulting in the perpetuation of disabilities and other conditions in blacks that are potentially preventable.5. Health and mental health resources should be increased rather than diminished during periods of economic stress, especially in the public sector.6. In order to provide each citizen with access to quality health and mental health care regardless of race and/or economic status, there must be enacted a national health insurance program based on tax-levy monies that will cover all aspects of health and mental health care.7. Racism and social status will continue to be powerful determinants of the quality of service that white professionals render to black patients and to poor white patients, unless our training institutions mount a massive campaign to train appropriately and to include significant numbers of minority candidates and trainees in the effort. To date this effort is virtually nonexistent.",Journal of the National Medical Association,1979 Apr,United States,1979,70

45183,Interactions of pharmacological agents which alter biogenic amine metabolism and depression--an analysis of contributing factors within a primate model of depression.,"The observation that the biogenic amine depleting agent, reserpine, could induce severe depression in a small proportion of the patients treated with it has proved to be seminal finding in what is now a much larger field of research relating the function brain biogenic amine systems to emotions and behavior. A review of the human reserpine literature suggests, however, that factors other than pharmacologically produced alterations in brain biogenic amine metabolism must have been critical determinants of the eventual mood alterations observed in conjunction with reserpine treatment. While some of these factors, such as previous history of depression, ongoing psychosocial and environmental stress, can be intuitively identified, there are practical as well as ethical problems involved in actually testing the relative contribution of these factors in precipitating human depression and thereby determining their importance in a quantitative fashion. In the present paper we have attempted to examine, in a nonhuman primate model of depression, the degree to which factors such as prior rearing condition, repeated peer separation, and housing environment can intact with the behavioral effects produced by biogenic amine depleting agents. Major emphasis will be placed on studies utilizing alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, to ostensively reduce levels of the catecholamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. The results of these studies provide quantitative estimates, in terms of dose-effect relationships, of the degree to which a number of factors can combine to produce despair-like behavior in rhesus monkeys. These data may be of practical importance in evaluating the contribution of similar factors to the precipitation of human depression. Analysis of some of the existing literature relating alterations in behavior to changes in biogenic amine metabolism in animals suggests that there are important differences between rodent and primate species. These differences, when fully established, may indicate that additional research examining the mechanisms whereby modest alterations in biogenic amine metabolism can interact with environmental and social stress is needed.",Journal of affective disorders,1979 Mar,Netherlands,1979,70

388153,La menespausie--the birth of a syndrome.,"The prevalent assumption that climacteric disturbances appeared when the expectation of life of women assured survival past the menopause cannot be supported demographically. These disorders are largely conditioned by sociocultural factors and, therefore, may be expected to have been initiated when these factors became stressful. Historical examination shows that medicine, or its marginal practitioners, were always involved in the postponement of ageing whenever the status of women depended more on their attractiveness than other social determinants, a logical ""geriatric"" extension of its traditional cosmetic activities. No menopausal disturbances are however recorded until the social convulsions of the French Revolution, and the regimes which followed, seem to have crystalized the various complaints of the climacteric into a disease-expression, which reified the social stress to which women were subject. This is dramatically reflected, both in the medical writings published in France around the year 1800, and in the naming, for the first time, of this phase of woman's life: La Menespausie, soon shortened to Menopause.",Maturitas,1979 Feb,Ireland,1979,70
215853,Factors associated with utilization of the swine flu vaccination program among senior citizens in Tompkins County.,"The health belief model is tested in the context of the swine flu vaccination program for senior citizens. Analysis is based on 232 responses to a questionnaire mailed to a simple random sample of 500 senior citizens in Tompkins County, New York. Social and psychologic variables identified by the model as important in determining utilization of preventive health services are: perceived susceptibility and severity of disease, perceived efficacy and danger associated with the preventive action, and general health motivations. Differences of means between users and nonusers for these variables are computed and compared with the results of a more sophisticated analytic technique--logit analysis--for use with dichotomous dependent variables. Results reveal that the health belief model accounts for 34 per cent of the variance in use of the vaccine by senior citizens. Perceived susceptibility to the disease and amount of danger associated with receiving the swine flu immunization are found to be the most important determinants of utilization.",Medical care,1979 Feb,United States,1979,70

The findings indicated that the externals scored higher on symptomatology than did the internals. A multivariate analysis further compared the predictive utility of locus of control with other determinants of psychiatric symptoms, i.e., sex, marital status, SES, kinship and friendship tie, and amount of life change. The evidence showed that locus of control is an important determinant of Chinese-Americans' symptomatology. It accounted for a greater proportion of the variance in the two indices of psychological distress than did the other independent variables.",The International journal of social psychiatry,1979 Autumn,England,1979,70
484315,"Self-injury behavior, economic status and the family anomie syndrome among adolescents.","Only recently has there been a focus upon the psychosocial environment of the family that surrounds the suicide-prone individual. The purpose of this research was to learn more about the association of economic status and family anomie, operationationalized by family normlessness and powerlessness scales, to the differential vulnerability of adolescents to suicide potential. The research design called for a detailed interview with the persons attempting suicide and members of their families. The study samples consisted of 30 low economic and 25 high economic status families. It was predicted that social anomie could be translated into behavioral (attempted suicide) and attitudinal (normlessness and powerlessness) determinants when viewed with regard to its impact upon the family. Significant differences in the degree of normlessness and powerlessness were found for suicidal and nonsuicidal adolescents and their families. These differences appear to be part of a family anomie syndrome.",Adolescence,1979 Summer,United States,1979,70

437936,Comparative social policy and political conflict in advanced welfare states: Denmark and Sweden.,"There has developed an abundant literature on the social and political determinants of social policies, but few have addressed the question of how state policies, once implemented, affect the system of stratification in civil society. This article examines the political consequences of social policy in Denmark and Sweden, countries in which a social democratic labor movement has predominated for decades. Superficially, these two highly developed welfare states appear very similar. Yet the political and social contexts in which their social policies have evolved differ substantially. I shall demonstrate the argument that the traditional welfare state approach may be conducive to a new and powerful political conflict, which directly questions the legitimacy of the welfare state itself, unless government is successful in subordinating private capitalist growth to effective public regulation. In Denmark, where social democratic governments have failed to match welfare state growth with more control of private capital, social policy has tended to undermine the political unity of the working class. Consequently, the Social Democratic Party has been weakened. Social welfare programs, in effect, have helped create new forms of stratification within the working class. In Sweden, social democratic governments have been quite successful in shifting a decisive degree of power over the private market to the state. This has helped avert a crisis of the welfare state, and has also been an important condition for continued social democratic hegemony and working-class unity. I conclude that social reform politics tend to be problematic from the point of view of the future power of social democratic movements.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1979,United States,1979,70
422729,Follow-up research in primary prevention: a model of adjustment in acute grief.,"Investigated the effects of preventive intervention that followed the life crisis of sudden death in the family. Two bereaved groups of families (one of which received preventive intervention service) and one non-bereaved group were compared in an outcome design and were assessed for indices of illness, psycho-social disturbance, and general quality of life. The results revealed that sudden death has a two-stage impact upon family survivors and that subsequent adjustment can be predicted from a knowledge of facts at the time of death. A preventive intervention service had little or no impact and may have been harmful. Discussion centered on possible intervention strategies with a focus upon the complex determinants of environmental stresses and family/individual variables.",Journal of clinical psychology,1979 Jan,United States,1979,70
422717,Locus of control and therapists' occupational role as determinants of clinical prognoses.,"Clinical studies that used the internal-external locus of control model developed by Rotter (1967) have shown a marked preference among clinicians for clients with an internal locus of control. In the belief that occupational roles can affect such preferences, this study examined clinicians' (sychiatrists, psychologists, social workers) prognoses for clients who had described their problems in terms of either an internal, external, or no locus of control. As hypothesized, a 5 X 3 X 3 replicated Latin Square design found that while clients who attributed their problems to an internal locus of control were given better prognoses, clinicians differed along occupational role dimensions in their prognoses for the same client. The implications of those occupational differences for professional practice were discussed.",Journal of clinical psychology,1979 Jan,United States,1979,70
369551,Teaching medical students psychosomatic medicine: of substances and approaches.,"The author describes a curriculum in which the emphasis is on teaching of medical students a general systems approach to health and illness from the first year of medical school through the fourth year. In the first year, a three-part course in behavioral science includes: Introduction to the Patient; Social and Ethical Issues in Medicine; Exercises in Decision-Making; and a didactic lecture series, Determinants of Behavior. This is followed in the second year by a course in psychopathology taught from environmental, psychological and social perspectives. The third-year clerkship emphasizes a liaison approach where students return to the medical and surgical services to work-up patients from a broad multidimensional perspective. The formal program in psychiatry and behavioral science is supported by more than 40 electives in human development, biological, social and psychological psychiatry, including behavior. During these phases the student has experience in working as a member of a team. She/he approaches the health of an individual in terms of the life phase of the individual, the present life of the individual, his/her past experiences, previous personality, reaction to the current illness phenomenon while following the illness through the hospital phase of the present illness, studying coping and adaptational processes.",Bibliotheca psychiatrica,1979,Switzerland,1979,70
573286,Experiential determinants of postpartum aggression in mice.,"The objective of this research was to explore the experiential determinants and the social controls of postpartum aggregation in mice. In Experiment 1, a group of seven lactating females was tested repeatedly from Day 2 to Day 22 postpartum against male mice; attacks by the females continued through Day 18. Two other groups of seven females tested only once showed diminished attacks against males by Day 14 postpartum. In Experiment 2, eight females were paired with a male for a week prior to parturition; they showed reliably fewer attacks on Day 2 postpartum than a group of nine females that were isolated prior to parturition. All of these results were obtained in a standard 3-min test. A 24-hr test on Day 4 of Experiment 2 revealed that in both groups female attacks dropped to near zero after 30 min. After female attacks declined, males initiated social behavior which occasioned vocalizations by the females. Further, males attacked in 65% of the tests and destroyed the litters of the females in 53% of the tests. The behavior of the male exerted important influences on the structure of extended female-male interactions.",Journal of comparative and physiological psychology,1978 Dec,United States,1978,70
720820,Some determinants of temporal experience in the retired and its correlates.,"The effects of physical health status, attitude toward retirement, and social class on temporal experience were studied in 70 male Ss, aged 52--74. A semistructured interview was utilized, and a content analysis by independent raters was performed on the resulting interview material. In general, it was found that chronic illness had a differential effect on experience, depending upon social class, for certain temporal variables. Among the healthy retirees it was also found that willingness to retire interacted with social class, and that blue collar workers who had resisted retirement resembled the chronically ill in terms of affect and temporal experience. The possibility for adjustment in retirement was linked to variations in temporal experience, and implications were drawn for preretirement intervention with specific social class target populations. Finally, psychological and behavioral consequences of variations in temporal experience were discussed, and the possibility of developing methods of altering temporal experience as a means of helping the elderly to adjust to life transitions was explored.",Genetic psychology monographs,1978 Nov,United States,1978,70
280584,Factors affecting patient completion of treatment within a student dental clinic.,"Failure of dental patients to complete their treatment challenges the efficient use of human and clinic resources, expectations of improved patients' health, and the dentist's effective management of his patients. Accordingly, the present study was undertaken to explore factors which might account for adult patients not completing their treatment at the University of North Carolina dental school. These factors were simultaneously considered as determinants of completed treatment. Possible explanations were considered from providers' (dental students') as well as inactive patients' points of view. Results revealed substantial agreement between patients and students, and yielded the following general determinants of treatment completion: patient's availability for treatment, how cooperative or treatable the patient was, and the patient's satisfaction with treatment. Demographic explanations were minimal. The findings can guide efforts to refine present methods of patient screening and patient management as practiced by dental students and their preceptors.",Journal of dental education,1978 Nov,United States,1978,70
689592,Management of innovation and change in mental health services.,"In recent years the mental health field has been characterized by innovation and change. All changes are not sound or necessary, and the most common approach to implementing change, that of power, can have unfortunate consequences. However, the incidence of innovation and change and the growing technology on planning for the adoption of innovations indicates that change can be managed more effectively. One approach to managing change is the decision determinants analysis model, a group of eight factors that influence whether a change will be successfully adopted; they are ability, values, information, circumstances, timing, obligation, resistance, and yield. The author discusses the factors and gives suggestions related to each for increasing the probability of successful adoption of a change.",Hospital & community psychiatry,1978 Oct,United States,1978,70
10238943,A canonical quality of life model.,"A five equation model was developed which related measurements of quality of life (QOL) to policy variables and to economic and social characteristics. The model was used to i) determine the jointness, or interdependency, of components of QOL, ii) demonstrate the usefulness of canonical correlation for measuring the marginal products of determinants of QOL, and iii) construct QOL indexes of social indicators. The model's parameters were estimated from state data for the U.S.A. Among the determinants of QOL educational attainment, investments in transportation facilities, region size and urbanization were most important. Expenditures on higher education, health care, and law enforcement had very little effect on socio-economic well being. Most of the differences in QOL between states were due to economic factors.",American journal of economics and sociology,1978 Oct,United States,1978,70
700226,Toward a general theory of fertility: a causal modeling approach.,"A general theory of fertility is derived hypothesizing that the demand for children is primarily an outcome of social psychological processes within the family, subject to certain socioeconomic constraints. Two broad social psychological processes are posited as determinants of fertility. The first suggests that the attitudes or tastes of family members influence the demand for children. The second maintains that the nature of the husband-wife interaction (in terms of power, conflict, decision making, and marital satisfaction) determines family size. Socioeconomic variables, in the form of the normative social structure and social stratification, and economic constraints, such as income and price, are hypothesized to influence fertility through their impact on social psychological processes within the family. The overall theory is tested on two independent samples--one in Ankara, Turkey, the second in Mexico City, Mexico--using a structural equation methodology.",Demography,1978 Aug,United States,1978,70
12265626,An economic analysis of migration in Mexico.,"This paper analyzes internal migration in Mexico over the 1960-70 period. A model of the determinants of migration is specified and estimated for aggregated interstate migration flows. Results show that distance serves as a significant deterrent to migration, that higher destination earning levels are attractive to migrants, and that regions with high unemployment rates experience lower rates of inmigration. An unanticipated finding is that regions with higher earning levels have greater rates of outmigration. The data are disaggregated to examine separate migration relationships for each state. The results are that distance is a lesser deterrent for those migrants with more accessible alternatives, that higher earning levels reduce the deterring effects of distance, and that regions with higher earning levels have lower associated elasticities of migration. It is concluded that economic factors have played a crucial role in internal migration and thus in the changing occupational and geographic structure of the Mexican labor force.",The Annals of regional science,1978 Jul,Germany,1978,70

It is more frequent in middle-aged postmenopausal women who thereby tend to express all three determinants of illness--the biologic, the psychological, and the social. Such a triple assessment of the determinants, together with a thorough physical examination, brings the SOC into the diagnostic category of hypochondria. Therefore, it should be treated by the family dentist or by the general internist, with reassurance, local measures, and minor tranquilizers.","Oral surgery, oral medicine, and oral pathology",1978 Jul,United States,1978,70

10308625,"Does health planning work anywhere, and if so, why?","Beginning in 1976 the Department of Health Education and Welfare of the United States Government (DHEW) and the Pan American Health Organization, which is the regional office of the World Health Organization (PAHO-WHO), jointly developed a study of health planning as currently practiced around the world. This thrust to extend our understanding and capability of application of health planning was recognized at PAHO-WHO and DHEW as being long overdue, given the diversity of health planning efforts, the thinness of theory and the frequently unsatisfactory results of health sector planning in so many countries. In 1976 a series of descriptive-analytical studies were commissioned from 17 countries representing nearly every continent and every stage of development. These studies were further analyzed and abstracted and became the basis for a 5-day discussion in Copenhagen in 1977 among 35 practicing and academic health planners gathered from 16 countries, WHO, and DHEW. The thrust of the first assembly was to identify the determinants of (1) the establishment of formal health planning machinery, (2) the scope and content of concerns assigned to health planning, (3) the participants in the process, and (4) the relationships of planners to policy makers and implementors. In 1978 the second 5-day meeting was held in New Orleans to analyze the methodologies of health planning and to determine what could be generalized and disseminated as guidance to all countries. This was based on a new series of methodologically focused case studies which were abstracted and made available to each of the 53 health planning participants from 22 countries, PAHO-WHO, and DHEW. The four major foci of this conference were (1) the state of the art in health planning methodology, (2) how methods are being developed and adapted, (3) identification of major methodological shortcomings or constraints, and (4) surmounting the difficulties facing health planning in affecting major health-influencing forces which lie outside the territory traditionally considered to be part of the health sector. This article is a report on some of the things the author learned from participating in what he considers the two most informative planning meetings he ever attended.",American journal of health planning,1978 Jul,United States,1978,70

681060,'The analgesic abuse syndrome': an epidemiological perspective.,"Mild analgesics are freely available, widely used, and generally safe. Nevertheless a proportion of the population takes excessive quantities, of whom some develop chronic renal failure in consequence. A syndrome of analgesic abuse has been proposed, definable by characteristics other than analgesic intake. To examine this concept, a population study of analgesic consumption was carried out; the distribution was clearly unimodal and no association could be found between the quantity of analgesics taken and social class, marital status, working or not working, tea or coffee consumption or the number of cigarettes smoked. The principal determinants appeared to be sex, with females reporting a higher intake, and the presence of painful conditions. It was concluded that analgesics abuse cannot be defined other than by the number of analgesics consumed, and that the concept of an analgesic abuse 'syndrome' is not helpful in the design of preventive programmes.",International journal of epidemiology,1978 Jun,England,1978,70

Using data from the Social Security Administration's 1973 national survey of low-income aged and disabled, the study demonstrates that the prevalence of many chronic disorders and impairments is significantly greater among the rural aged than for their cohorts in more urban areas. These differences persist after controls for age, sex, and race are introduced. No significant differences between rural and urban elderly were apparent in the utilization of health services. The determinants of chronic health status of the elderly have already occurred, by and large, and an explanation of disorders and impairments cannot be found by examining current sociodemographic status. Such an explanation is contained in the accumulated effects of years of residence in differing social, economic, and physical environments.",Social security bulletin,1978 Jun,United States,1978,70
670952,Reactions of infants and young children to a stranger in an unfamiliar setting.,"Reactions of infants and young children to a stranger in an unfamiliar laboratory setting were examined to determine (a) variability in responses at six, 12, 24, and 36 months; (b) consistency of six and 12 month infants' responses to specific stranger behaviors; and (c) possible determinants of responses to strangers. The reactions of 136 male and female infants and children to a female stranger were recorded both when the stranger was actively trying to interact with the child and when the stranger sat quietly nearby after giving him a toy to play with. Both positive and negative reactions were observed at all ages, with one-year-olds showing greater distress than other age groups. Consistency was found in infant reactions to intrusive stranger behaviors. It was suggested that stangers are more likely to elicit curious-affiliative than cautious-avoidance behaviors from chidren if they are both attentive and appropriately to the child on the basis of his communications.",The Journal of genetic psychology,1978 Jun,United States,1978,70

658557,"The determinants of marital fertility in the United States, 1968-1970: inferences from a dynamic model.","Criticizing the static assumptions of previous socioeconomic and microeconomic models of marital fertility, particularly regarding the sequential and stochastic facets of family building, this paper advocates a dynamic perspective. Of particular concern is the assumption of equilibrium family size made by those who employ the static perspective. The equilibrium family size assumption implies that the parameters relating social and economic variables to fertility will be similar for all births, regardless of order. To test this assumption of constancy, a two-equation model of fertility and female employment is introduced. Contrary to the static perspective's implication of constant effects, substantial parity differences in the estimates of parameters for both equations are reported, as are several differences between blacks and whites. On the basis of this evidence, I conclude that the static decision-making framework should be replaced by a dynamic approach to marital fertility.",Demography,1978 May,United States,1978,70
26265,[Psychological determinants of motivation in adult education (author's transl)].,"The psychology of motivation in adult education has been mostly confined to the assessment of superficial causes for attending courses and seminars. The findings were not integrated in a ced in a conclusive theory of motivation elaborated for instance by American and German psychologists. Besides that the verbalized ""motives"" to attend courses were hardly correlated with other psychological and social context variables. An investigation of the relationship between verbalized ""motives"" to attend courses, certain personality dimensions (Freiburg Personality Inventory) and some aspects of the ""life space"" (occupational and non-occupatoinal) revealed that the motivation to participate in adult education is embedded in the context of psychological and socio-demographic factors and that the motive structure depends on the relevance of life-long learning, for example, to keep or improve the occupational status or to meet people involved in creative activities.",Aktuelle Gerontologie,1978 Apr,Germany,1978,70
630303,The psychological and social effects of myocardial infarction on wives.,"Eighty-two wives of men suffering a first myocardial infarction were interviewed while their husbands were in hospital, and again two months and a year after they went home. The wives had substantial and persistent psychological symptoms, and the husbands' illness had continuing effects on their work, leisure and social activities, and family life and marriage, their psychosocial disability being comparable to that of the patients. Measures of psychosocial adjustment before the illness and the quality of the marriage and of family life were good predictors of outcome for the wives. The women had a major role in the patients' readjustment during convalescence, and their attitudes and behaviour as well as the general quality of family life were important determinants of the rate and extent of the patients' recovery. The wives of patients with myocardial infarction should have more practical help and advice during the hospital period, and the whole family should be given advice and help throughout the convalescence.",British medical journal,1978 Mar 18,England,1978,70
256827,"Male homosexuality: perversion, deviation or variant?","Male homosexuality has complex determinants: biological, psychological, social, cultural and situational factors may be relevant, either inhibiting hetereosexuality or leading towards homosexuality. Environmental factors seem paramount, particularly significant early relationships, usually within the family. Especially implicated are the personalities and interaction of the parents, recent interest being especially in the father's role. Also relevant is the family as a complex social system and the modes of communication within it, both verbal and non-verbal. Social research and sociopolitical pressures have helped to liberalize attitudes to homosexually 'deviant' behaviour but have not added significantly to its understanding. Many factors are involved in determining whether homosexual men seek therapy and reach a particular therapist. These factors relate to the patient's and therapist's personalities; to different therapeutic philosophies and therapeutic goals; and to the formal and informal referral networks in society.",Ciba Foundation symposium,1978 Mar 14-16,Netherlands,1978,70
641537,Implications for concepts of psychopathology of studies of economic principles in behavior therapy programs.,"In several studies of token economies, it has been observed repeatedly that chronic psychiatric patients conform to the same economic principles as explain the activities of presumably normal participants in the national consumer economy. Such observations are consistent with behavior therapy's assumptions that those labeled mentally ill follow the same psychological and social lows as those considered normal and that behavior is responsive to specific situational determinants. Although they disprove nothing, these observations may pose problems for more traditional approaches which view psychopathology as the result of central disorders or deficits with diffuse effects across a wide range of ordinary life situations.",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,1978 Mar,United States,1978,70
629222,"Nutrition and infant behavior: a replication study in the Katmandu Valley, Nepal.","As a cross cultural comparison with an earlier study done in West Bengal, behavioral observations were made in the Katmandu Valley of 36 well-nourished and 38 undernourished children, 7 to 18 months of age, and their mothers. Undernourished children showed lowered levels of exploratory activity and attachment behavior, especially distance interaction, and a heightened need for physical closeness to the mother. Moreover, among the undernourished children the level of intellectual performance and the overall time spent in play were decreased, while time spent sucking at the breast was increased. In contrast to the West Bengali study, maternal behavior showed no differences between the two nutritional groups, and the intercorrelations between maternal and child scores showed similar or parallel patterns of reciprocity for the well-nourished and the undernourished children. No sex or age differences were found. The findings were interpreted to support Levitsky and Barnes' hypothesis of ""functional isolation"" as a mechanism between undernutrition and environmental stimulation to produce long-term behavioral changes. In addition, hunger as a motivational state, expressed as increased sucking, may interfere with other motivational determinants that might lead to exploration and/or increased social contacts.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1978 Mar,United States,1978,70

Social workers are frequently involved in activities designed to influence individuals and groups to use preventive services or engage in health-maintaining practices. Understanding the determinants of preventive health behavior should contribute to the effectiveness of these social work activities. Therefore, this article reviews numerous empirical studies of preventive health behavior and attempts to integrate them into a theoretical framework. A series of factors that may serve as barriers or supports to preventive health behavior are identified, and their implications for social work intervention are discussed.",Social work in health care,1978 Spring,United States,1978,70

The form of obsessions and compulsions seemed to be affected primarily by intrinsic factors (age, sex, I.Q.) while their content was affected equally, if not more, by extrinsic factors (religion, locality, social class). Patient's age at the onset of illness seemed to be an extremely relevant factor insofar as it affected both the form and the content of symptoms. Some socio-cultural explanations have been offered these findings. The data is important insofar as it provides a baseline for cross-cultural studies of the phenomenology of obsessional illness.",The International journal of social psychiatry,1978 Autumn,England,1978,70

631961,The economic and political determinants of human (including health) rights.,"This paper presents an analysis and critique of the U.S. government's current emphasis on human rights; and (a) its limited focus on only some civil and political components of the original U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, and (b) its disregard for economic and social rights such as the rights to work, fair wages, health, education, and social security. The paper discusses the reasons for that limited focus and argues that, contrary to what is widely presented in the media and academe: (1) civil and political rights are highly restricted in the U.S.; (2) those rights are further restricted in the U.S. when analyzed in their social and economic dimensions; (3) civil and political rights are not independent of but rather intrinsically related to and dependent on the existence of socioeconomic rights; (4) the definition of the nature and extension of human rights in their civil, political, social, and economic dimensions is not universal, but rather depends on the pattern of economic and political power relations particular to each society; and (5) the pattern of power relations in the U.S. society and the western system of power, based on the right to individual property and its concomitant class structure and relations, is incompatible with the full realization of human rights in their economic, social, political, and civil dimensions. This paper further indicates that U.S. financial and corporate capital, through its overwhelming influence over the organs of political power in the U.S. and over international bodies and agencies, is primarily responsible for the denial of the human rights of the U.S. population and many populations throughout the world as well.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1978,United States,1978,70
311513,The prognosis of schizophrenia: rationale for a multidimensional concept.,"Three main ways of viewing schizophrenia exist that have different prognostic, practical, and conceptual implications. The mixed cross-sectional/longitudinal view of Kraepelin and others states essentially that there is a disease, schizophrenia, that can be identified by considering both characteristic symptoms and course. Prognosis in the disorder so defined is guarded, but because of the composite diagnostic criteria used, the characteristics most important for relating to outcome remain unknown. The second view defines schizophrenia primarily in terms of the cross-sectional symptom picture alone. It has been shown empirically that defining a disorder in this way has relatively limited prognostic implications. The third approach identifies schizophrenia in terms of several ""axes,"" such as type of schizophrenic symptoms, their duration, the person's social relations, and his work function. These axes are viewed as relatively independent processes with somewhat different determinants, implying the need for different specific treatments. The authors believe this last view is the one most supported by currently available data.",Schizophrenia bulletin,1978,United States,1978,70
308401,Healthy family functioning: a cross-cultural appraisal.,"It is increasingly recognized that rapid cultural, social, economic, and technological changes are imposing increasing stress on family structures, traditional values, and the ability to adapt to new environments in different societies. For the purposes of this paper, ""healthy family functioning"" is defined in terms of a family unit (however it is conceived in any given culture) effectively coping with cultural, environmental, psychosocial, and socioeconomic stresses throughout the family life cycle. While a review of international literature in the behavioural and biomedical sciences yields little data on comparative studies, there is growing awareness of the need for cooperative international research on family coping mechanisms and determinants of self-reliant communal coping behaviour, as well as more efficient utilization of already available knowledge. After consideration of methodological pitfalls of assessment procedures, there is a presentation of an evolving theory of healthy family functioning with the suggestion that studies of young married couples constitute a particularly promising vehicle for developing needed cooperative cross-cultural research.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,1978,Switzerland,1978,70
299610,Determinants of consumer influence in a health systems agency.,"An 18-month study of consumer participation and influence in a Health Systems Agency (HSA) found consumer board members to be less influential than provider board members in agency decision-making. In an effort to investigate causes of the influence deficit experienced by consumer HSA board members three issues were studied: staff attitudes toward consumer participation; board member degree of representative accountability; and board member attitudes concerning commitment to consumer participation, commitment to health planning, health services attitude, and feelings of social powerlessness. Results indicated that staff members were favorable toward the concept of consumer participation. They recognized a lack of low-income minority participation, but they did not provide support or allocate resources to enhance consumers' ability to participate. Providers were less committed to consumer participation, felt more socially powerful, and had greater representative accountability than did consumers. Several strategies for increasing consumer influence in HSA decision-making processes are proposed.",Health education monographs,1978 Winter,United States,1978,70

Psychological aspects].,"The present paper is based on the analysis of congress reports and gerontological journals and points up new trends in gerontological research. Quantitatively, there was an increase in the number of psycho-gerontological publications. However, relatively seen, they represent an almost unchanged percentage of the contributions to gerontological literature on the whole. Predominant themes in USA and West Germany are discussed. There is, on the one hand, an increasing differentiation and specialization of methodical contribution and, on the other hand, an increasing number of contributions which neglect the methodical aspect. A trend toward practically oriented research is shown, as can be seen in intervention gerontology. Aging is seen as a phanomena with biological, social, and ecological determinants. In conclusion the universality and generality of aging is questioned, the concept of a differential gerontology is proposed and so a greater consideration of the individuality of the aging process is found to be necessary.",Aktuelle Gerontologie,1978 Jan,Germany,1978,70

Three-mode data of semantic differential ratings of 11 ego-related concepts on a representative set of scales were obtained from a homogeneous group of 29 male college sophomores. Results for the scale mode indicated that after Osgood's three affective components were recaptured, three other orthogonal dimensions were interpretable denotative features. The concept mode consisted of five distinctive factors representing the multidimensional nature of self concepts. Differences among four types of subjects in their interactions between meaning systems and concept factors were highlighted by the rotated core matrix. Characteristics of subject-type homogeneities were further identified by regressions of their factor coefficients on a set of variables representing personality development, social behaviors, and attitudes.",Perceptual and motor skills,1977 Dec,United States,1977,70
22091912,Fertility decline in Germany: An econometric appraisal.,"Summary A re-analysis of Knodel's data provides some new results for the fertility decline in Germany and a new approach to testing hypotheses about the demographic transition. Two formulations of transition theory are compared: one emphasizing the importance of changing social and economic structure for fertility decline; the other, the changing relationships between fertility and its determinants over time. To evaluate these formulations, multivariate time series cross-sectional models are developed. The statistical models permit the estimation of relationships both cross-sectionally and over time. As a consequence, the ability of the independent variables to explain cross-sectional as against temporal differences is evaluated. Industrialization, urbanization, religious composition, migration, infant mortality and marriage patterns satisfactorily explain the fertility decline once regional differences have been taken into account. Persisting characteristics of regional units account for much of the unexplained variance. Industrialization is the main explanatory variable of fertility decline in Germany. In the period considered, its impact on fertility increased substantially.",Population studies,1977 Nov,England,1977,70

Using a multivariate cross-sectional time-series design with several controls, the lives and works of 10 classical composers were analyzed into consecutive 5-year age periods. Two independent measures of productivity were operationalized (works and themes), with each measure subdivided into major and minor compositions according to a citation criterion. It was consistently found across both productivity measures that (a) quality of productivity is a probabilistic consequence of productive quantity and (b) total productivity, while affected by age and physical illness, is otherwise free of external influences (viz., social reinforcement, biographical stress, war intensity, and internal disturbances). Due to the more selective nature of the thematic productivity measure, the criterion of total themes alone was affected by competition and a time-wise bias. The article closes with a brief discussion of the broad substantive utility of the methodological design.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1977 Nov,United States,1977,70

914025,[Population problems of the present (author's transl)].,"At present objective predications on the trend of the population development at give economic and social conditions are very difficult since neither the axiom to report the facts correctly nor the axiom of neutrality in reporting determine what should or should not be included into the description of a situation. Common expressions such as population politics, marriage fatigue, contraction of the birth rate, generative behavior, contraception, termination of pregnancies, birth corntol capitalist economic order are loaded with emotions and can therefore not be considered to be neutral determinants in the description. In the field of demography and sociology no exact methodology and theory comparable to the natural sciences is existent. The solution to the described problem is probably linked to the question whether increasing technology and increasing intricacy of the organizations and increasing productions are compatable with the improvement of individual life expression. Temporarily attention is diverted by theoretical fashion trends, however old interest in finding the truth is not eliminated and the realization that the wish for a scientific solution is not within the realm of possibility, leads to resignation. Clarification of the basic factors requires a lot of individual thought. Demography and sociology are in danger when the demographer and sociologic identify with a certain economic or sociologic system, since this threatens to eliminate logical thought. Divergent opinions are given factors in any demographic or sociologic problem and must be accepted although they should always be criticized.",Geburtshilfe und Frauenheilkunde,1977 Sep,Germany,1977,70

More women in the case group had used contraception at one time. Nevertheless, the prevalence of current contraceptive use was identical in the two groups. More women in the control group had undergone one or more spontaneous or induced abortions. Although the women in both groups were selected from the same neighborhoods, there is evidence to suggest that the the women in the control group may have had higher family incomes. The higher incomes could well account, at least in part, for the difference in parity between the two groups as well as for the difference in nutritional status in the preschool children of the mothers of these groups.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",1977 Sep-Oct,United States,1977,70

Differences in behavior due to gender and environment were tested by analysis of variance. The results do not support the hypothesis that innate sex differences exist in baboons aged 0-3 months.

Anthropologists have shown that a society's specific infant training practices are adaptive to survival and cultural values. The different expectations of infant behavior of the East African Digo produces a markedly different toilet training approach than the current maturational readiness method recommended in America. The Digo believe that infants can learn soon after birth and begin motor and toilet training in the first weeks of life. With a nurturant conditioning approach, night and day dryness is accomplished by 5 or 6 months. The success of early Digo training suggests that sociocultural factors are more important determinants of toilet training readiness than is currently thought.",Pediatrics,1977 Aug,United States,1977,70

From an initial sample of 659 intellectually gifted 12- and 13-year-olds, 58 students with the highest SAT-V scores were selected for study. From a later sample of 506 equally gifted 13- and 14-year-olds, 120 students were selected using measures of verbal intelligence (DAT), social insight, and creative potential, as well as academic and nonacademic achievement. On the basis of a variety of personality and cognitive measures the students in both samples were found to be unusually mature and well adjusted but to vary considerably in sociopolitical intelligence. These results suggest in partial agreement with Terman's earlier findings concerning the gifted, that above a certain level of tested intelligence the critical determinants of effective, practical performance may be personality and biographical variables.",Journal of youth and adolescence,1977 Jun,United States,1977,70
864175,Intra-hospital transfer: effects on chronically ill psychogeriatric patients.,"Since the Vermont State Hospital was approaching a major transition period, it was decided to study systematically the effects of intra-unit and inter-unit transfer on its psychogeriatric patients. Ten patients were assessed by means of four standardized measures in the intra-unit study, specifically investigating the effects of integrating wards previously devoted either to chronic or to acute psychiatric illness. Twenty-five patients from a specialized geriatric unit were evaluated, by separate investigators, with respect to changes occuring as a result of their transfer to regional mixed units. The critical incident log, the problem classification form, and the clinical global impression showed some changes, for which there were several possible explanations. None of the changes was as dramatic as predicted by staff members holding divergent views prior to the study. The optimists predicted a ""blossoming"" of the psychogeriatric patients in the mixed, regional units, whereas the pessimists prophesied dire consequences. The group of patients studied was not completely homogeneous with respect to the effect to transfer. Clinical assessment after transfer could be relied on to detect improvement in some of these psychogeriatric patients and deterioration in others. Some understanding of the complexity of the multifactor determinants of change developed along with increased cooperation among the investigators and the nursing staff. A middle ground of mutual respect for fresh ideas and an appreciation for years of experience was reached.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,1977 Jun,United States,1977,70

20790,"[Continuity of life situation and ""successful"" aging (author's transl)].","The determinants of ""successful"" aging have been a main concern in social gerontological research. The Continuity Hypothesis suggests that there is a relationship between an older person's life satisfaction and the similarity of his social life situation in middle adulthood and in old age. The old person is the more likely to score low in life satisfaction the less similar his old age situation to his life situation in middle adulthood. This hypothesis has been tested in summer 1973 in Cologne with a sample of 406 people aged 65 and over. Findings indicate that continuity of life situation may be an important variable accounting for life satisfaction in old age. Moreover, it could be shown that the various negatively experienced life changes since adulthoood formed a complex of interacting variables, thereby increasing the negative effect on the old person's life satisfaction.

Patients admitted to these two services (both staffed by the same Department of Psychiatry) were compared in a variety of factors relating to admission determinants, diagnosis, length of hospitalization, and type of treatment. The two patient groups differed in a number offactors, including presenting problems, diagnoses, and.psychological concept of their illnesses. The public hospital patients were less likely to receive somatic treatments (especially psychotropic drugs) and more likely to be hospitalized for longer periods than were the private hospital patients.

64761,Vaccination against whooping-cough. Efficacy versus risks.,"Calculations based on the mortality of whooping-cough before 1957 predict accurately the subsequent decline and the present low mortality. Notifications of incidence, though variable and incomplete, follow the same pattern of steady decline in the United Kingdom and are unaffected either by small-scale vaccination beginning about 1948 or by nationwide vaccination beginning in 1957. When valid comparisons can be made, attack-rates may be lower and complications fewer in vaccinated children, but allowance has to be made for overcrowding and socio-economic differences which may be more important as determinants of attack-rates. No protection by vaccination is demonstrable in infants. Adverse reactions and neurotoxicity following vaccinations were studied in 160 cases. In 79, the relationship to pertussis vaccine was strong. In 14 of these cases, reaction was transient but characteristic of a syndrome of shock and cerebral disturbance, which, in the other 65 cases, was followed by convulsions, hyperkinesis, and severe mental defect. It seems likely that most adverse reactions are unreported and that many are overlooked. Precise information about the efficacy and safety of this vaccine is lacking, because existing provisions, national and international, for epidemiological surveillance and evaluation are inadequate. The claim by official bodies that the risks of whooping-cough exceed those of vaccination is questionable, at least in the U.K.","Lancet (London, England)",1977 Jan 29,England,1977,70

914436,"Impotence, frigidity and depersonalization.","A review of important psychoanalytic literature in the perplexing area of depersonalization focuses primarily on its phenomenology and genesis. Case material from two patients elucidates a relatively neglected, specific substate. These two analyses center about prominent complaints of impotence and frigidity which are seen as equivalents of, or screens for, underlying depersonalization. Only by understanding and working through the genesis of the masked depersonalization could these sexual dysfunctions be adequately treated. Depersonalization was also manifest outside the sexual sphere, but its presence there led to a more thorough elucidation of its etiology, in which actual childhood observations of the primal scene were of paramount importance. A comprehensive description of depersonalization phenomenology is offered which considers this state as a compromise formulation with contributions from each structure of the mental apparatus. Normal and pathological determinants of the sesation of a split within the self into observing and participating aspects are described, as is the genesis of feelings of alienation and estrangement.",International journal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy,1977,United States,1977,70
402883,Genetic and environmental determinants of growth of school-aged children in a rural Colombian population.,"Parent-offspring correlations and heritabilities of body measurements from midparent-offspring regressions are presented for school-aged children from the village of Tenza, Colombia (N = 403 families). Parent-child correlations and midparent regressions in this subsistence farming sample, are similar in magnitude to those for well nourished, urban industrial samples, suggesting that the environmental component of variability in body size is the same regardless of the environment. Tenza children are significantly shorter and lighter than upper class Bogota children, and Tenza parents have mean heights and weights similar to those of other lower class Colombian samples. Thus, chronic undernutrition has affected the growth of parents and continues to affect the growth of the present generation. Although it has been hypothesized that heritability of growth might be reduced in samples experiencing malnutrition and its sequelae, such a reduction may only be observable where environment of parents during their development is different from that of their offspring, which is not the case here. The pattern of heritabilities with respect to different body measurements in Tenza, is similar to that seen in well nourished samples, except that measurements of breadth (biacromial, bicristal, bicondylar) have heritabilities similar in magnitude to those of linear measurements (height, sitting-height, subischial length) especially in males; and heritabilities of some measurements related to adiposity are significantly higher in daughters than in sons.",Annals of human biology,1977 Jan,England,1977,70
144719,Some determinants of the reinforcing and punishing effects of timeout.,"Some determinants of the reinforcing and punishing properties of timeout were investigated in two experiments. Experiment I began as an attempt to reduce the frequency of tantrums in a 6-yr-old autistic girl by using timeout. Unexpectedly, the result was a substantial increase in the frequency of tantrums. Using a reversal design, subsequent manipulations showed that the opportunity to engage in self-stimulatory behavior during the timeout period was largely responsible for the increase in tantrums. Experiment II was initiated following the failure of timeout to reduce the spitting and self-injurious behavior of a 16-yr-old retarded boy. Using a multiple-baseline design, the nature of the timein environment was shown to be an important determinant of the effects of timeout. When the timein environment was ""enriched"", timeout was effective as a punisher. A conception of timeout in terms of the relative reinforcing properties of timein and timeout and their clinical implications are discussed.",Journal of applied behavior analysis,1977 Fall,United States,1977,70
981073,Marihuana use. Biologic and behavioral aspects.,"More than 70 male chronic marihuana users were studied under research ward conditions for a 31-day period consisting of 5 days of baseline assessment, 21 days of marihuana availability, and 5 days of postsmoking assessment. Biological findings were for the most part within normal limits. Blood chemistry studies showed no abnormalities. Plasma testosterone levels for all subjects at all times during the study were well within normal limits, suggesting that previous reports of testosterone suppression by marihuana may have statistical but not biologic singificance. A significant reduction in baseline vital capacity was observed in six subjects, a compromise in pulmonary function similar to that characteristically produced by chronic inhalation of substances, such as tobacco smoke, which are irritants to the lung. Increased caloric intake and weight gain occurred in virtually all subjects and were causally related to marihuana smoking. The weight gain may be attributable to water retention as well as increased caloric intake. Behavioral findings indicated that no uniform alteration in mood is produced by marihuana smoking--all subjects reported becoming ""high"", but experienced no consistent degree of euphoria. Mood changes which occurred were relatively mild and were largely dependent on group determinants rather than individual experience. No relationship could be established between marihuana use and motivation to work or engage in socially desirable activities. Evidence that pulmonary function may be compromised as a function of marihuana smoking suggests the need for alerting individuals to this potential health hazard. As was true of cigarette smoking, the eventual public health consequences of marihuana use may become apparent only after large numbers of individuals have smoked marihuana for two or three decades.",Postgraduate medicine,1976 Nov,England,1976,70
993963,Conservatism as a determinant of sexual experiences.,An examination of the relationship of conservatism to reports of sexual experiences and reasons for nonparticipation was conducted using 64 male and 50 female introductory psychology students. Conservatism was found to be inversely related to the frequency and variety of sexual behaviors. High conservative subjects gave the reason that it was morally wrong more often than any other reason for not engaging in coital activities and more intimate forms of petting. Results were in accord with previous research and were interpreted as supporting the notion that the fear of loss of control of one's impulses and hence the basis for conservative attitudes are determinants of sexual experiences.,Journal of personality assessment,1976 Oct,England,1976,70
976916,[Dimensions of experience in encounter groups. Empirical studies on client-centered group activities].,"The experiencing of participants of client-centered encounter groups served to demonstrate possibilities and limits of current models of the group process. This was done by analyzing the correlations between 5 dimensions of experiencing and aims of group participation, personality variables, modus of participation i.e. patient, student, therapist, time of participation, and group setting. The experiencing dimensions included 1. sympathy, trust, understanding, and help between members, 2. freedom from anxiety and stress, 3. openness, controversy and feedback, 4. momentary strong and basic feelings in one's self and others, 5. understanding, help and closeness of the group facilitator. The results show: Successful group participation was to the extent of maximal 50% determined by the experiences immanent in the client centered group process concept. Personality variables measured by tests determined the experiencing in the group to an extent of maximal 10%, supposedly less than the group experiencing was influenced by special characteristics of the group development for example the initial phase of group formation, member characteristics like age, attitudes concerning group work, and conventions of social behaviour. Even less relevant as determinants of group experiencing were differences of group setting and social pressure in the direction of uniform experiences at least within the first 20 hours of group participation.",Fortschritte der Medizin,1976 Sep 16,Germany,1976,70
963363,Socio-cultural determinants of attempted suicide among West Indians in Birmingham: ethnic origin and immigrant status.,"The author studied the significance of ethnic origin and immigrant status in attempted suicide. Epidemiological data (1969-72) indicated that self-poisoning among West Indian immigrants in Birmingham was less prevalent than among natives there but more prevalent than in the West Indies. The association of recent pregnancy with attempted suicide among young immigrant patients was noteworthy. Attempted suicide among immigrants was often relatively benign; few abused alcohol or drugs or made repeated attempts. The markedly lower male rate of attempted suicide, and its rarity in older persons, confirms previous findings.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1976 Sep,England,1976,70
958801,Determinants of personal space in young children: perception of distance cues.,"Two methods of assessing personal space in young children were examined in a group of 24 boys and 24 girls, aged 3 to 6 yr. When sex of peer figures and affect attributed to them were varied, 3-yr.-olds made distance-cue judgements based on affect but failed to use affect cues in structuring personal space. However, 4- to 6-yr.-olds readily perceived and used distance to communicate the affective quality of peer relations. On both measures, perception of distance cues increased with age. Only girls also used sex of figures as a social cue in depicting appropriate distances.",Perceptual and motor skills,1976 Aug,United States,1976,70

Sixth-grade students' general and physical spontaneous self-concepts were elicited in their classroom settings. The distinctiveness within the classroom of each student's characteristics on each of a variety of dimensions was determined, and it was found that in a majority of cases the dimension was significantly more salient in the spontaneous self-concepts of those students whose characteristic on thedimension was more distinctive. Also reported are incidental findings which include a description of the contents of spontaneous self-comcepts as well as determinants of their length and of the spontaneous mention of one's sex as part of one's self-concept.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1976 Jun,United States,1976,70

Data were colleted during 2 6-hour naturalistic home observations using a modified time-sampling technique. The sample consisted of 4 equal-size subgroups of same and opposite sex sibling pairs. Results suggested that interaction between a mother and her infant varied depending on the birth order and gender of the infant. Mothers spent significantly less time in social, affectionate, and caretaking interaction (except for feeding activities) with their second borns than they had with their firstborns; this difference was greater if the second born was female. Certain patterns of maternal behaviors appeared to be stable from one sibling to the other. Different types of interaction between the mothers and their younger infants were related to attention-seeking behavior in the firstborn male and female siblings.",Child development,1976 Jun,United States,1976,70
955763,Suicide and self-poisoning in Great Britain and Ireland.,"Reported national rates of suicide remain fairly stable from year to year and considerable differences persist between countries. Reported rates of suicide also differ from actual rates according to the social influences and the legal procedure both in attributing suicide and also in how the death is recorded and coded. This paper compares the rates of suicide and non-fatal self-poisoning in Scotland, England and Wales, and Ireland, and also examines suicide rates in people born in Ireland but now resident in England and Wales. The rise in overdose admissions to hospital which is continuing in relative degrees in all communities of Great Britain and Ireland, except Northern Ireland, does not seem to be correlated with trends in fatal suicide behaviour. Further studies on all aspects of the subject are needed to clarify the social determinants involved and to identify ways in which further increases can be contained.",International journal of epidemiology,1976 Jun,England,1976,70
1278577,The continuation of education after marriage among women in the United States: 1970.,"Data from the 1970 National Fertility Study are used to assess the extent and determinants of post-nuptial education among women in the United States. Over one-fifth of all women have attended high school or college since marriage; over one-third either have returned to school or anticipate returning to an academic institution sometime in the future. This phenomenon is apparently increasing since women married less than five years have already attended school in as great a proportion as women married 15-19 years. Examination of differentials reveals for both blacks and whites that post-nupital education is higher among women who: (1) attended college before marriage, (2) married early, (3) are currently separated or divorced, (4) support egalitarian sex-role attitudes, or (5) whose most recent occupation is in the professional, managerial, or administrative category. Post-nuptial trends in education undoubtedly reflect the much broader social phenomenon of changing sex-role perceptions.",Demography,1976 May,United States,1976,70

The recursive model of ten equations is predicated on the notion that the dominant determinant is need, measured as activity limitation caused by chronic conditions and restricted activity days. Age, sex, income, education, and other variables are seen both as direct determinants and as acting through their effects on morbidity. The results demonstrate a complex set of relationships among the variables not identifiable in less complex analyses. Both income and education are shown to have pervasive effects. The measure of chronic disability is shown not only to affect utilization directly but to have an even larger indirect effect through its association with increased incidence of acute conditions.",Medical care,1976 May,United States,1976,70
1261976,The impact of the community mental health movement on psychiatric practice and training.,"The three basic concepts of community mental health will have profound impact on many aspects of traditional psychiatric theory and practice, the author believes, and must be taken into account in psychiatric residency programs. The catchment-area concept means that psychiatrists are obligated to provide help for far larger numbers of people, including those who have problems and attitudes psychiatrists are not accustomed to dealing with. Psychiatrists must also work in partnership with communities that demand a voice in defining and labeling problems and specifying treatment modalities. The concept of promoting health as well as treating illness means that psychiatry becomes involved with broader concerns about improving the quality of life. The third concept, that behavior has family, community, social-class, and other sociocultural determinants, has already affected psychiatric practice and education, but it continues to generate friction.",Hospital & community psychiatry,1976 Apr,United States,1976,70

Prior to the ""opening up"" of the highlands, evidence suggests that malaria had existed in an endemic and very unstable form in only a few lower altitude areas and in the populations of the perimeter villages who had contact with lowland areas. This paper traces the changes in the distribution and determinants of malaria that occurred pari passu with the development process in the highlands of Papua New Guinea between 1930 and 1970.",Annals of tropical medicine and parasitology,1976 Mar,England,1976,70

1271211,Biographical determinants of achieved eminence: a multivariate approach to the Cox data.,"Ranked eminence of creators and leaders was hypothesized to be a function of both substantive (developmental and productive) variables and methodological artifacts. Cox's sample of 301 geniuses was reexamined using multiple-regression techniques. The results indicated that ranked eminence is (a) a curvilinear inverted-U function of education for creators but a negative linear function for leaders, (b) a positive linear function of versatility for leaders only, and (c) a curvilinear U-shaped function of life span for creators but a ""backwards-J"" function for leaders. Although creators are more intelligent than leaders, the correlation that Cox found between intelligence and ranked eminence was shown to be an artifact of data reliability and, especially, a timewise sampling bias. It was also shown that father's status has no direct impact on ranked eminence.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1976 Feb,United States,1976,70
1259553,Formal and informal sex education as determinants of premarital sexual behavior.,"Controversies exist regarding the effects of sex education in the schools and informal sex education obtained from parents, peers, the mass media, and other sources. Similarly, there is widespread interest in premarital sexual behavior, especially its determinants. This study presents several issues reflecting these concerns which have been the subject of much speculation but which have received little attention by researchers. The purpose of this study was to investigate--through the use of respondent reports--how formal and informal sex education influences premarital sexual behavior during college. A national probability sample of 1177 college students was studied using face-to-face interviews with approximately equal numbers of males and females. These interviews, which were conducted for the Institute for Sex Research, included questions about past and present sexual involvement and other attitudinal, behavioral and background variables. Accordingly, the data about sexual behavior and attitudes are based on the interviewees' self-reports. Indices were created which operationalized independent variables such as familial sexual conservatism, exposure to eroticism, perceived sex knowledge, and sexual exposure and assault during childhood and adolescence. Individual items reflecting childhood sex play, masturbation, current religiosity, religiosity while growing up, social class, sources of sex information, sex education in classrooms, and high school and college dating were used. The dependent variable, premarital sociosexual involvement, is a composite measure of incidence and prevalence of premarital heterosexual involvement which meets Guttman scaling criteria. An Automatic Interaction Detector analysis was used to determine the relative influences of reported sexualization variables on premarital sexual behavior. Major findings can be summarized as follows: Heterosexual behavior progresses in stepwise fashion from elementary to advanced levels of involvement, with each level representing a threshold. Reports of current influences and pressures explain more variance in premarital sexual behavior than reports of past informal sexualization influences, which, in turn, explain more variance than reported formal sex-education experiences. Limited success was reported with the use of a four-stage AID analysis which attempted to ascertain whether variables represented in later stages of the sexualization process ""mask"" the effects of variables in earlier stages and whether a development process can be identified. It may be concluded that these data do not support the belief that exposure to sexuality through formal sex education influences premarital sexual behavior. Informal sex education has significantly more impact on premarital sexual behavior, but there are indications that pressures and experiences confronting young people in a given dating or peer group situation take precedence over all past sexual socialization influences.",Archives of sexual behavior,1976 Jan,United States,1976,70

Questionnaire data collected from 70 older industrial workers indicate that workers who can expect a positive retirement experience in terms of finances, friends, social activity, and level of preparedness are likely to have a positive attitude toward retirement. No relationship was found between commitment to work and attitude toward retirement.",Journal of gerontology,1976 Jan,United States,1976,70

Psychological hypotheses, treatment considerations.","Several basic psychological hypotheses about multiple drug abuse are examined, i.e., social determinants, the effect of availability on extent of abuse, that drug abuse is a symptom rather than a disease, the relationship of social class to psychopathology, the lack of specificity of psychodynamics or psychopathology to drug choice, and the use of drugs to facilitate or obliterate concern with assertion, relieve neurosis, or provide homeostasis. There is a need for a variety of comprehensive, directive treatment approaches from which an individual treatment plan can be chosen. Such plans must consider which of the complex factors that can lead to multiple drug abuse are most prominent and can be remedied in each case.",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,1976,England,1976,70

State Commission to Evaluate the Drug Laws concluded with a report which documented pervasive controversy and discrimination in employing rehabilitated or ex-addicts. To analyze local attitudes to this issue, the present study targeted the audience of a recent Symposium ""Employment of the Ex-Addict"", held in Westchester County, New York, October, 1973. Ss (N = 83) completed a questionnaire to assess the nature and extent of proponent views, degree of commitment, and motivational components of support and opposition. The data strongly supported belief in the urgency of the need to employ. Educational and community measures of moderate activism were preferred to antidiscrimination legislation. Significant correlations were found between urgency and age, size of plant, and occupational group. Appeals to human rights and social rights were judged to be important positive reinforcers to employment, and the economic argument a greater deterrent than fear or prejudice. Study limitations, findings, and need for further behavioral organizational research were discussed.",The International journal of the addictions,1976,United States,1976,70

The socialization process includes the domestic pattern of division of labor, occupational models encountered in person and in the various media, and parental and social pressures, including vocational counseling. Ecuational access is a critical determinant of the extent and type of participation in the labor force as well as attitudes toward work. Although Poland has made major attempts to improve the socialization process and acces by type of program, disparties are still encountered in pay received for similar work, and for work in positions that cannot be explained by differences in productivity or education. Employment policies being undertaken or considered include measures to improve working conditions and occupational position, to socialize a larger number of ""domestic"" tasks, and to provide more flexibility via part-time work and longer maternity leaves.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1976,United States,1976,70

It was found that underweight children showed significantly less favourable indices in all of the above categories except stool parasitology suggesting an extremely intricate and complex interaction of a host of ecological variables in the causation of undernutrition. Using the discriminate analysis on readily available social variables, it was found that caste affiliation and, less so parental income were the two most significant variables distinguishing between the two groups.

Because firstborns, exposed to more positive social interaction within the family within the first year of life, were more positive towards strangers than were the later borns, the authors concluded that by the end of the first year of life the nature of the infant's social interaction within the family, rather than the number of perceptual encounters, is the major determinant of infants' reaction to novel persons in their enviornment.",The Journal of genetic psychology,1975 Dec,United States,1975,70
1185154,Individual differences and setting as determinants of acute adverse reactions to psychoactive drugs.,"The relationship between setting and individual differences in determining acute adverse reactions to psychoactive drugs was examined using retrospective data from 483 drug users. Five dimensions of setting were identified. Although there were some small setting main effects, these effects failed to reach significance when shared variance with individual difference variables was considered. For acute adverse reactions to LSD, however, there were seven independent interaction effects between setting and individual difference variables. There were two interaction effects of smaller magnitude related to acute adverse reactions to marijuana. The significance of these results for the current controversy over the relative importance of situational vs. personality determinants of behavior was discussed.",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,1975 Nov,United States,1975,70

The present report explores the structure of experience within the therapeutic dyad -- conjoint experience. Seven factors were derived from the reports of 28 patient-therapist pairs. One factor reflected the therapist's approach to his role as a help-giver, and another reflected the patient's approach to her role. Other patterns showed convergent perceptions, while still others showed conjoint experiential processes -- inter-experience. Determinants of these experiences were sought among the personal and social characteristics of the participants.

Ss named stimuli present in motion pictures of real world scenes or in animated cartoon controls during a 15-sec. exposure period. Regardless of the type of presentation that they saw, Ss tended to name large and/or moving stimuli more often than small and/or nonmoving stimuli. Also, small human stimuli were named more frequently than small nonhuman stimuli, while there were no differences between the frequencies with which large human and nonhuman stimuli were named. The order in which Ss named stimuli was not related to either the size, movement, or human content variables.

1177089,Informational determinants of females' self-attributions and observers' judgments of them in an achievement situation.,"A female (A) received feedback about both her own and a male or female other's (B's) performance on an achievement task, and then estimated the likelihood that she and B possessed each of several attributes related to competence, likeableness, and physical attractiveness. The situation was witnessed by a male or female observer who then judged B's attributes and predicted A's and B's ratings of one another. A formulation of social inference processes developed by Gollob was used to identify and compare the informational cues used by actors and observers in making these attributions. The contributions of these cues depended substantially on the type of attribute being inferred, the judge (A or the observer), and whether the judgment was made of A or of B. A's behavior (i.e., her performance on the achievement task) contributed less to her self-attributions than it did either to her predictions of how B would rate her or to observers' actual judgments of her attributes. A's self-attributions tended to be relatively more influenced by her experiences before participating in the experiment. Whereas A appeared to use B's performance as a comparative standard when judging her own competence and expected B to do likewise, observers did not use B's performance in this manner when judging A. Moreover, A did not use her own performance as a standard when judging attributes of B. The article discusses theoretical implications of these results for attribution and self-perception processes.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1975 Sep,United States,1975,70

Results hypothesized from previous studies of sex-role stereotypes and theoretical conceptions of the attribution process and social learning influences on personality were obtained: the adult stimuli yielded predictable sex-role stereotypy; the undergraduate stimuli produced no differential attributions; and the graduate student stimuli generated greater masculine attributions for the female. The results were interpreted in terms of the significance of situationally specific stimuli as determinants of attributions about men and women.",The Journal of psychology,1975 Sep,United States,1975,70
1239499,The nature of extraversion: a genetical analysis.,"A biometrical-genetical analysis of twin data to elucidate the determinants of variation in extraversion and its components, sociability and impulsiveness, revealed that both genetical and environmental factors contributed to variation in extraversion, to the variation and covariation of its component scales, and to the interaction between subjects and scales. A large environmental correlation between the scales suggested that environmental factors may predominate in determining the unitary nature of extraversion. The interaction between subjects and scales depended more on genetical factors, which suggests that the dual nature of extraversion has a strong genetical basis. A model assuming random mating, additive gene action, and specific environmental effects adequately describes the observed variation and covariation of sociability and impulsiveness. Possible evolutionary implications are discussed.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1975 Jul,United States,1975,70

However, there has been little or no research into possible determinants of prescribing behaviour, for example, age, social background, work load, the nature of the practice, education and colleague networks. Nor have the attitudes, expectations, values or information levels of general practitioners been studied. The overseas literature in this field is confusing and scanty. There would seem to be good reason to investigate these aspects in Australian practices.

1232765,[Introduction to psychosomatic medicine (author's transl)].,"Psychosomatic medicine is a ""holistic"" conception of pluricausal medicine which has as an objective to study not the isolated disease, but the sick man, that is the humanised patient in his most complete nosological and ecological perspective. Numerous arguments seem to indicate the reality of clinical and experimental links between emotional life, psychic troubles and the dysfunctioning of organs or the apparition of visceral lesions. Anatomical and physiological studies play a capital role at the level of the hypothalamus, limbic system and at different neuroendocrinological systems (pituitary, corticoadrenal and medulloadrenal). On the experimental level, beside confining ulcers obtained by different technics on the laboratory rat, one must insist on the experiments of Weiss who showed that the peptic ulcers of the rat, under certain conditions, depend on two variables: the number of stimuli which the animal must face and the informative feedbacks more or less useful, which it receives in return. The investigations undertaken on the sick man show the importance of functional troubles with respect to anomalies of the autonomic nervous system or anomalies of intramural ganglions, which explain perhaps the notion of target organs for the troubles. Considering the most recent concepts which valorise the role of genetic factors in the determination of psychosomatic diseases, one can conceive that psychological determinants, affective or environmental, are cofactors which integrate themselves with somatic, genetic, constitutional and nutritional factors to produce the final morbid picture.",Acta psychiatrica Belgica,1975 Jun-Jul,Belgium,1975,70
1178795,Studies on how early maternal separation produces behavioral change in young rats.,"Previously published studies point to the behavioral interaction between the mother and her litter as the origin of the processes responsible for the behavioral hyperactivity following maternal separation in 2-week-old rats. The following experiments explore (1) the time course over which behavioral hyperactivity develops, (2) environmental and social determinants, (3) the role of sensory stimulation in the regulation of behavior and (4) the olfactory sensory system as a mediator of separation effects. The hypotheses supported best by the data are (1) that tactile and olfactory stimulation repeatedly provided by the mother act to reduce levels of behavioral arousal of the infants and (2) that maternal separation exerts its effect by withdrawal of this regulating influence, allowing a new level of behavioral arousal, more intrinsic to the infant, to be revealed.",Psychosomatic medicine,1975 May-Jun,United States,1975,70
1178794,Presidential Address-1974 from explanation to action in psychosomatic medicine: the case of obesity.,"Psychosomatic medicine began as a social movement within medicine, designed to counteract the mechanistic and impersonal features that had accompanied the introduction of science into medical education. In its early days, therapeutic inefficacy led to a concentration upon understanding the origins of disorders in which emotional determinants played a role. To a large exten, psychosomatic medicine is still identified with such understanding. Within recent years, however, the development of increasingly effective therapeutic techniques has changed the emphasis in psychosomatic medicine from understanding to action. These developments are particularly well exemplified by the case of obesity. Social investigations have revealed that the prevalence of obesity within populations is determined to a very high degree by social factors, operating in an unplanned and uncontrolled manner...",Psychosomatic medicine,1975 May-Jun,United States,1975,70

In the present series of experiments, a number of behavioural correlates of aggression and dominance are examined in male and bisexual groups. These include the effects of group arousal level on rates of agonistic encounters, the relationship between an individual's habitual level of activity and its relative dominance, aggressiveness and position on the perch in a resting ""flock"". The temporal patterning of encounters is analysed and the reasons why encounters tend to clump in time determined. The relationship between dominance in encounters over individual-distance infringements and dominance in encounters over access to a restricted food source is investigated and the effects of this on loss of weight in males and females determined. The results are discussed in relation to Ward's (1965) finging that in the wild females suffer higher mortality than males during the dry season and in relation to the general determinants of aggression in Quelea.",Animal behaviour,1975 May,England,1975,70
1056816,The use of dental services among Norwegian adults in 1973.,"The dental treatment pattern and its determinants were surveyed in 1973 by interviews with a sample comprising 1,632 persons drawn to cover the total Norwegian population aged 15 and above. In all, 58% of the interviewees stated having visited a dentist during the year prior to the interview. In contrast, 16% had not consulted a dentist for at least 5 years. Fifty-five percent of the sample reported having received fillings at the last dental visit and 15% reported having received some periodontal and/or preventive treatment. Regular (at least annual) treatment attendance was claimed by 52% of the sample. However, some respondents had seemingly embellished their treatment behavior, and a relatively valid estimate for the current proportion of regular treatment attenders was considered to be 40% of the adult population in Norway. Sex and geographic region were found to be the most influential predictors of the recent treatment pattern, whereas school dental treatment had a major influence in youth. Dental conditions including the wearing of dentures was the reason most often given for not seeing a dentist on a regular basis.",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,1975 May,Denmark,1975,70

""Undesirable vices (excessive gambling, drinking, etc.)"" ranked first as contributing to marital unhappiness while their absence was ranked 27.5 by the husbands and 9.5 by the wives as contributing to marital happiness. The elimination of undesirable habits may resolve much marital misery but it does not necessarily follow that as unhappiness decreases happiness will increase.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1975 May,United States,1975,70
1117913,Politics in the development of a migrant health center. A pilgrim's progress from idealism to pragmatism.,"New methods of health-care delivery have been recommended to correct the inequities in the distribution of health services to rural and urban poor. A migrant health center developed in 1970 to accomplish this aim illustrated the many attendant problems. The award of the grant to an outside consumer group rather than to the country health department resulted in political pressures during the center's development. Other factors isolated the center. These included categorical funding specifically directed to a community's ethnic minority and the lack of a regional network of health care. Confusion was created when legitimate spokesmen of the target group, other segments of the local community or interested private and governmental agencies were not defined. Although a program for curative and preventive medicine was established for a minority, the center was less successful in becoming self-supporting and in affecting the social and economic determinants of health.",The New England journal of medicine,1975 Apr 24,United States,1975,70
1090426,Vector analysis of postcardiotomy behavioral phenomena.,"The classification of postcardiotomy behavioral phenomena in Figure 1 is proposed for use as a clinical instrument to analyze etiological determinants. The utilization of a vector analysis analogy inherently denies absolutism. Classifications A-P are presented as prototypes of certain ratio imbalances of the metabolic, hemodynamic, environmental, and psychic vectors. Such a system allows for change from one type to another according to the individuality of the patient and the highly specific changes in his clinical presentation. A vector analysis also allows for infinite intermediary ratio imbalances between classification types as a function of time. Thus, postcardiotomy behavioral phenomena could be viewed as the vector summation of hemodynamic, metabolic, environmental, and psychic processes at a given point in time. Elaboration of unknown determinants in this complex syndrome appears to be task for the future.",Diseases of the nervous system,1975 Apr,United States,1975,70
1199285,[Biological basis of behavior regulation].,"A changing of the information is taken as basis for the behaviour of the organism. While the metabolism produces a connective relation with the environment, the changing of the information delivers an informational relation. The two processes are essential constituents of the organism as an open system for the maintenance and the increase of the negentropy. The informational connection with the environment is primarily non-communicative (the recipient performs the verification of the meaning of the signs with meaning). On the basis of the changing of information three environments may be differed: (1) the own environment (telereceptoric informations on the own body), (2) the informational environment and (3) the communicative environment (common alphabet). The most important determinants of the behavior which connect the organism with its informational environment are pretensions to space, time, metabolism and changing of form. In the communicative environment there may be pretensions to territory, sex, care and social ones. In organism the behaviour is above all determined by vigilance, emotion, motivation, memory (storage), selector (and receptor) as well as operator (and effector). The comparative behavioural sciences allow certain universal evidence on the basis of such parameters. Here also constituents of the human behaviour can be seized.",Zeitschrift fur die gesamte innere Medizin und ihre Grenzgebiete,1975 Apr 1,Germany,1975,70
1159611,"Components of ""authority"" as determinants of compliance.","This study investigated factors affecting compliance, to orders from a formal authority. The design created a two-level status hierarchy in which subjects occupied identical low-status positions and responded to demands from a simulated high-status leader. Four components of authority-normativity,coervice power, collective justification, and success-failure-were manipulated as independent variables. Another component, the endorsement accorded the leader, was included in the design as a measured variable. Results indicated that compliance increased significantly when coervice power was high (rather than low), when justification was collective (rather than partisan), and when demands were normative (rather than counternormative). Contary ti the theoretical expectation, endorsement did not affect compliance by low-status members. The findings show that the normative aspect of legitimacy serves as a compliance-gaining base even when stripped of enforcing sanctions and under-lying goals and that the distinction between normativity and endorsement is valid for research on social power.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1975 Apr,United States,1975,70
22091802,Social and demographic determinants of abortion in Poland.,"Summary Most abortions in Polish hospitals and clinics are performed on social indications. In the 22 administrative areas of Poland, the high rates of divorce and large proportions of total population employed in non-agricultural pursuits reflect the individualistic approach to family planning which is characteristic of present-day urban society. Industrialization is disruptive to the normal functioning of the country's traditionally large families. In addition, the gross reproduction rate increases directly with the proportion of the peasant population in 17 voivodships and five large cities of Poland, whereas in the urban sector the gross reproduction rate has fallen below replacement level in the past few years. Rural birth rates will continue to decline. In view of increasing needs for future manpower, population policy aimed at increasing births through incentives to prospective mothers may achieve a limited degree of success in cities only among the educated segments of the female population.",Population studies,1975 Mar,England,1975,70
1123717,Leader effectiveness and leadership conferral as determinants of helping in a medical emergency.,"This study investigated the contribution of an individual's qualification for discussion group leadership (LGD) and the method of leadership conferral, election versus appointment, upon his group's response to a medical emergency. Five-person, face-to-face groups with high LGD leaders responded more frequently and more rapidly to a confederate member's diabetic reaction than did groups with low LGD leaders. Low LGD leaders were frequently overthrown, while groups with high LGD leaders experienced continuity of leadership. Conferral process had no discernible effect on helping or overthrows. It was concluded that a victim is the more fortunate if his group's leader is assertive.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1975 Feb,United States,1975,70
1091527,Research approaches in illicit drug use: a critical review.,"Research approached and substantive findings pertaining to determinants of the nonmedical use of illicit psychoactive drugs are reviewed. Discussion focuses upon the dimensions of drug use as a behaviorial phenomenon, the findings and limitations of four basic approaches to research in the ares--sociocultural, psychopathological, functionalist, and social learning-- and upon methodological problems. Drug use must be treated as a multidimensional phenomenon, with analyses extending well beyond simple user vs. nonuser comparisons or arbitrary categories of users. Research must be conducted within a coherent field-theoretical conceptual framework, directed toward the formulation of nomothetic laws concerning patterns of drug use. Inadequacies in sampling and measurement and the absence of longitudinal design have compromised the utility of a vast research literature.",Genetic psychology monographs,1975 Feb,United States,1975,70
1201874,Social determinants of alcohol and marijuana effects: a systematic theory.,"Based on the sociological perspective on recreational drug effects, three social determinants are propositionally related to the normal effects of alcohol and marijuana. Effects vary across drugs, users, and situations along an experimental-behavioral dimension termed ""effect-orientation."" The content of normative expectations toward effects and the interactional characteristics of drug-using situations are conceptualized as direct determinants of effect-orientations. The relative clarity of normative expectations indirectly influences effect-orientations through its relationship to the other two social determinants. The theory stresses the importance of comparative research on the normal uses of alcohol and marijuana.",The International journal of the addictions,1975,United States,1975,70

The sample consisted of 1,999 white children from kindergarten through fifth grade who were in regular classes. Three conclusions may be drawn from the study. The first is that grade and the interactions of grade with sex and social class are determinants of scores on the BPCL, but that no particular trends are characteristic of the relationships between these and the dependent variables. The second is that sex and social class are also determinants of scores on the BPCL, with boys and children from the lower social classes having more problems and girls and children from the higher social classes having fewer problems. The third is that the differences between schools and between teachers are responsible for more of the variance on the BPCL than grade, sex, and social class.",Journal of abnormal child psychology,1975,United States,1975,70
1150466,A theoretical analysis of selected factors important to health education strategies.,"Based on the theoretical work of Dulany and Fishbein, two major problems for understanding health behaviors were delineated: (1) the identification of those variables that determine an individual's intention to perform a health behavior; and (2) the extent to which these intentions are predictive of behavior. An analysis of factors affecting the relation between health intentions and behavior was presented and its implications for health education discussed. A social psychological model specifying two major determinants of behavioral intentions was contrasted with the Health Belief Model.",Health education monographs,1975 Summer,United States,1975,70
1123808,"The effects of self-concept, trust, and imagined positive or negative self-disclosures on psychological space.","This study focused on some of the determinants of schematic interactional distance based on an analysis of social learning processes. It was hypothesized that closer interpersonal constructions would be associated with a more positive rather than negative self-concept, a greater rather than lesser degree of trust, and a covert positive rather than negative self-disclosure to a significant other. One hundred fifty-nine male and female undergraduate students were administered the Tennessee Self Concept Scale and Jourard's Self-Disclosure Questionnaire. Of these Ss, 82 were also given either positive or negative covert self-disclosure conditions. Interactional distances consisted of ""Self"" placements in relation to several key social target representations. The results supported the hypothesis regarding the relationship between self-concept and psychological distance, but only for females. There was also a tendency for more trusting females to produce closer distances than less trusting females. These results, as well as the obtained significant sex differences in distancing responses and in renditions of vertical displacements, were discussed within the context of culturally determined sex role differences.",The Journal of psychology,1975 Jan,United States,1975,70
1089182,Sociobehavioral determinants of compliance with health and medical care recommendations.,"Over the past two decades, hundreds of articles, editorials, and commentaries have been published describing the considerable disruptive effects on quality of care of individuals noncompliance with health and medical advice. While much research has been directed at determining factors responsible for poor compliance, past studies have tended to focus upon easily measured characteristics of the patients, regimen, or illness which, unfortunately, are usually neither predictive nor alterable. This paper systematically reviews the literature on patient acceptance of recommended health behaviors, attempting to find social-psychological and related variables which have proven to be consistent predictors of compliance. The review suggests that certain health beliefs (especailly personal estimates of vulnerability to, and seriousness of, the disease, and faith in the efficacy of care), health-related motivations, perceptions of psychological and other costs of the recommended action, various aspects of the doctor-patient relationship, and social influence are the most productive dimensions for present intervention and further exploration. Building upon an earlier formulation, an hypothesized model is presented which combines these elements for explaining and predicting compliance behavior. Further research should, with standardized questionnaires and analysis techniques, employ prospective, experimental designs for a variety of population groups, settings, and regimens, to evaluate the ability of practical attempts to modify the model variables and thus enhance compliance.",Medical care,1975 Jan,United States,1975,70
820651,Research in health economics: a survey.,"This paper surveys the types of issues with which health economists have been concerned. It is intended to introduce noneconomists to the kinds of questions that economists have regarded as important. Economists' work in the health economics area may be usefully divided into ""positive"" and ""normative"" studies. Positive studies are those designed to describe, or make predictions about, how the health care system, or parts of it, actually operate. Conversely, normative studies are intended to provide statements as to how the health care system should operate. The major areas surveyed include the concept and estimation of the ""production function"" for health, the distinction between private and social costs, determinants of prices of medical inputs, and benefit-cost analysis.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1975,United States,1975,70
24179076,Participants in urban Mexican male homosexual encounters.,"Preliminary data are presented on 53 urban Mexican males interviewed during 1970-1971 in a study of homosexual encounters in a large Mexican city. These data are compared with data from recent studies in the United States and England of male homosexual behavior. Although preliminary and limited, the Mexican data indicate that cultural factors are important determinants of life styles and sex practices of homosexual males. Forty-eight of the 53 (90%) preferred and usually practiced anal intercourse, four preferred oral contacts, and one preferred mutual masturbation. Interviewees were also grouped according to major type of sex activity during the first sustained year of homosexual activity after puberty. One intragroup comparison indicates significant differences between anal active and anal passive interviewees. For example, as children anal passive subjects had significantly more homosexual contacts with adults; they also considered themselves more effeminate and as children were more involved with female sex-typed activities. Comparison of data from the English and United States studies with the present data suggests that preference for a particular sexual technique is not as developed in the former two countries; when there is a preference, it is not usually for anal intercourse.",Archives of sexual behavior,1971 Dec,United States,1971,70
22070105,Population policy: Personal notes.,"Abstract These are the population years: throughout the world, in both developing and developed countries, there has been a growing debate on population policy. In this paper population policy refers to governmental actions that are designed to alter population events, or that do alter them. The concern with policy seems to center in the relationships between four demographic variables (size, rates, distribution, composition) and four 'quality of life' categories as both determinants and consequences (comprehended here as economic, political, ecological/environmental, social). As to policy means, they can be seen as being five in number (information, voluntary programmes, change in social institutions, incentives and disincentives, and coercion) with the potential of affecting the three factors of fertility, mortality, and migration. The relationships and effects of these conceptual cross tabulations are illustrated.",Population studies,1971 Jul,England,1971,70
22091721,"Plague mortality rates by age and sex in the parish of St. Botolph's without Bishopsgate, London, 1603.","Abstract The Bills of Mortality for London were instituted at least as early as 1528 but only a few figures survive before the extant annual series that begins in 1603. Ages at death, even in broad groups of ages, are not generally available until 1728, which is more than 50 years too late to give us any inkling of the ages, if any, at which people were specially susceptible to plague. There are reports, it is true, that suggest that children suffered from plague more severely than adults, at least on certain occasions (as in 1361 or 1418 for example), but nothing more precise. The legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin may be a folk-memory of a plague (possibly in 1284) that killed mainly the children of the town, for the connection between infestation of rats and the loss of children suggests some kind of plague outbreak. Pollitzer concludes that no particular age group is specially liable to plague, and attributes all differences observed to different risks of exposure. The determinants of the severity of an outbreak would therefore be the environmental details and social customs.",Population studies,1971 Mar,England,1971,70
26771774,THE THERAPIST'S EXPERIENCE OF PSYCHOTHERAPY: SOME DIMENSIONS AND DETERMINANTS.,"Eleven dimensions of therapists' experiences during psychotherapy ses- sions were derived, factor analytically, for a sample of 17 therapists. These therapists completed a standard questionnaire after each of 8 or more sessions with 31 female patients. In general, the 11 dimensions reflected various experiences of (a) being helpful towards patients, (b) attempting to deal with difSicult patients, (c) making non-therapeutic responses to patients, and (d) entrapment in personally distressing situations with patients. Personal-social characteristics of patients and therapists were examined as possible determinants of therapist experience. Among other characteristics, patients' employment and marital status, diagnosis and previous treatment, influenced certain therapist experience dimensions-as did therapists' profession, marital status, and personal psychotherapy.",Multivariate behavioral research,1970,United States,1970,70
22091651,"Altitude, fertility and mortality in Andean countries.","Abstract Using the census data for Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, previous writers have investigated some possible determinants of inter-regional differences in fertility; language spoken, female participation rates, and altitude. This paper points out the many sources of inaccuracy in the census data used. It argues that the indicators of unusually low fertility in the highland, predominantly Indianspeaking areas fail to control effectively for the very high levels of infant mortality in these regions. Fragmentary survey results give some indication of the scale of infant mortality, and appear to refute the idea that fertility is exceptionally low in areas of high altitude. In an attempt to explain why such high mortality rates persist in the Andean region the main health problems of Bolivia are examined. It seems that the causes are economic and social, rather than physiological. Unfortunately a change of policy which reduced death rates would produce grave new social problems.",Population studies,1968 Nov,England,1968,70
21279781,Sources of geographic mobility among professional workers: A multivariate analysis.,"Using the 1960 Census of Population one-in-a-thousand sample, this study investigates determinants of geographic mobility among professional, technical, and kindred workers. Multiple regression analysis reveals that age accounts for most of the explained variance in mobility, followed by income, education, regional location, sex, family size, and marital status. Additional variables-class of worker, race, nativity, professional type, size of place and industry-add no significant increments to explained variance.More specifically, low income and high education stimulate mobility and increases in family size and age slacken it. Young married professionals move the most and farthest, males somewhat more than females. Mobility is greatest in the West, least in the Northeast. Age reduces or reverses contrasts between single and married, large and small families, high and low incomes, little and much education, and residents of East and West.Factor analysis suggests that migration is part of two orderly processes-occupational career mobility and family life cycle. The bearing of these findings on the relationship between geographic mobility and social integration for the middleclass in the United States is considered.",Demography,1967 Mar,United States,1967,70
21279761,A quantitative study of the determinants of fertility behavior.,"Recent literature shows great interest in the quantitative study of the determinants of fertility. In a similar way, this study takes an across-country approach to specify independent variables, to separate economic from social and political variables, to make distinct comparisons of fertility responses in developed and underdeveloped countries, and to examine a wide range of hypotheses. The key is empirical analysis by separate regressions. This permits direct comparisons of countries at different levels of development, increases the probability of obtaining statistically significant regression coefficients, and standardizes the analysis for factors which vary with level of development.In this way, the authors determine positive and statistically significant relations between fertility and illiteracy, child mortality, proportion of agricultural population, proportion of nonfarm selfemployment, and overcrowded housing and show a negative significant relationship between fertility and communism. The study does not establish statistically significant relations, however, for population density, social mobility, substitutes for sexual intercourse, achievement motivation, protein in the diet, and religion.In general, the signs of the regression coefficients for the separate levels of development are the same as those for all countries combined. Any failure to attain statistical significance may be explained by small sample size and insufficient variation in the variables for separate levels of development.",Demography,1967 Mar,United States,1967,70
6039186,Community psychiatry and the population explosion.,"Although excessive population has long been a dilemma in certain areas of the world, current rates of growth present a global threat to all nations. Arguments based on economics, world peace, individual freedom, humanism and the preservation of life's amenities all point to the urgent need for programs to control birth rates. This applies to the United States also, although we have the advantage of a relatively high cultural and economic level from which to attack the problem. Modern psychiatry is increasingly committed to the Community Mental Health concept, which in part implies greater involvement with the element of the population that is socially and economically at a disadvantage. Effective treatment cannot ignore the effects on the patient of intolerable reality situations, often produced by successive unwanted pregnancies. In addition, a positive approach to family planning by psychiatrists and social workers will provide the structure needed for truly preventive psychiatry; as our knowledge of the determinants of psychosis, delinquency and mental retardation expands, selective counseling can do much to prevent these family and social tragedies. Both as world citizens and as practitioners of a profession, psychiatrists cannot afford to delay pledging their resources to the solution of so compelling a problem.",California medicine,1967 Mar,United States,1967,70
