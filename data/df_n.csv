These protocols were tested against usual service delivery practices in a study involving 1,261 patients under 18 years of age at six nonmetropolitan family planning clinics. A comparison with teenagers obtaining services at control sites found that six months after their first clinic visit, patients at the experimental sites were more likely to be using a method, were less likely to experience difficulty in dealing with problems, were more likely to continue using their method despite problems and had learned more during the educational session. Teenage patients at the experimental clinics were also less likely to have become pregnant within one year than those who went to control clinics. Attrition during the year following the first study visit was similar among both groups; patient satisfaction was very high, and equivalent at experimental and control sites. The data show that the extra time and effort required to meet the special needs of teenagers is justified by their improved contraceptive use, greater knowledge and lower pregnancy rates.","['Winter, L', 'Breckenmaker, L C']","['Winter L', 'Breckenmaker LC']","['Family Health Council of Central Pennsylvania, Inc., Camp Hill.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Fam Plann Perspect,Family planning perspectives,0241370,IM J,"['Adolescent', 'Family Planning Services/*methods', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Education/methods']","['IND: 8017620', 'PIP: 065265', 'POP: 00213018']","['The results provided in this evaluation study of teenage family planning (FP)', 'services pertain to 3 components of intervention: the knowledge patients', 'acquired, their feelings about the clinic, and their FP experiences', '(contraceptive use, clinic attendance, and unintended pregnancy).

The important determinants of self-management are transient situational factors such as psychological stress and social pressure to eat. Interventions to promote better self-management have reported initial improvements in blood glucose control, but the long-term effects are unclear. We conclude that self-management has been inadequately assessed and that attempts to improve self-management have relied excessively on providing information.

Mental illness scores were most strongly associated with stress in that the odds of experiencing 6 or more stressful life events in the past year were 2.7 times greater for neurotics and 2.1 times greater for psychotics. In addition, neuroses and psychoses were significantly associated with a family history of mental illness and with being divorced, separated or widowed.

In this article we explore how the intersection of traditional culture with the colonial legacy and present-day political economy has influenced family structure and sexual relations, and particularly the social position of women. Drawing on Zimbabwe's historical experience, we show how land expropriation, rural impoverishment, and the forcible introduction of male migrant labor fostered new patterns of sexual relations, characterized by multiple partners. Traditional patriarchal values reinterpreted in European law resulted in further subjugation of women as even limited rights to ownership were withdrawn. For many women, sexual relations with men, either within marriage (for the majority) or outside, become inextricably linked to economic and social survival. In this setting, all sexually transmitted diseases became rampant, including genital ulcer, which facilitates transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Intervention programs to halt the spread of AIDS need to take into the account the epidemic's historical roots and social nature. For example, efforts to reduce risk of HIV transmission should seek to expand women's limited options, both technically (e.g., by providing alternatives to condoms) and socially (e.g., by promoting employment).","['Bassett, M T', 'Mhloyi, M']","['Bassett MT', 'Mhloyi M']","['Department of Community Medicine, Avondale, Harare, Zimbabwe.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Health Serv,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1305035,IM J X,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Adult', 'Africa/epidemiology', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Family', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/epidemiology/transmission', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases/complications', 'Social Conditions', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Transients and Migrants', 'Urbanization', '*Women', 'Zimbabwe/epidemiology']","['PIP: 071803', 'POP: 00222310']","['The pattern of promiscuous sexual activity that places men and women in', 'sub-Saharan Africa at risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection must', 'be understood as a result of historically produced social conditions if such', 'behavior is to be modified.

Long-term projects facilitate institutionalization by providing a setting where work teams can be developed and career tracks defined. Academics and universities institutionalize OR by sponsoring training in applied research and developing high-level research leadership.

Overall stopping ratios or ""quit ratios"" (i.e., ratios between ex- and ever-smokers) were 20.5% for males and 9.0% for females in the 1983 survey, and rose to 23.2 and 11.9% respectively in 1986-87. With reference to age, stopping rates were slightly higher for females than for males below age 35, but considerably higher for males in each subsequent age group, particularly in middle age. Ratios were apparently higher for the most recent survey for both sexes and each subsequent age group. After standardisation for age, ""quit ratios"" in both sexes were directly related with education. Cessation of smoking was more common in northern (and richer) areas of the country, and positively associated with the prevalence of smoking-related chronic diseases. The major, and most discouraging, finding from these analyses is the absolute low rate of stopping in Italy as compared to northern America or northern Europe, although some positive tendency towards increasing cessation was evident between the early and the late 1980s. These tendencies, together with some recent drops in smoking prevalence in younger women, first observed after decades of increase, indicate a change at least in attitudes towards reporting smoking, and hence social acceptance of the habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['La Vecchia, C', 'Negri, E', 'Pagano, R', 'Ferraroni, M']","['La Vecchia C', 'Negri E', 'Pagano R', 'Ferraroni M']","['Istituto di Richerche Farmacologiche, Mario Negri, Milano.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Soz Praventivmed,Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,7502479,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Demography', 'Educational Status', 'Female', '*Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Surveillance', '*Smoking Cessation']",,,,,,,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soz Praventivmed. 1991;36(3):154-8. doi: 10.1007/bf01352694.,,,,['10.1007/bf01352694 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

More females than males were smokers, because females had higher rates for the early stages of smoking adoption. Specifically, females were more likely to have tried smoking at least once and, among those who had tried smoking, females were more likely to have smoked more than once or twice. Gender differences in smoking varied, depending on the students' characteristics. For example, the female excess in the early stages of smoking adoption was small or absent among rural students or very religious students, apparently because traditional values inhibit smoking adoption more among females than among males. We estimated the contributions of gender differences in students' characteristics to gender differences in smoking adoption. For example, males were more involved in sports, and this appears to be one reason why males had lower rates of smoking adoption than females. On the other hand, males had more deviant behavior and attitudes, and this would be expected to contribute to greater smoking adoption by males. The findings of this study indicate important gender differences in the determinants of smoking adoption.","['Waldron, I', 'Lye, D', 'Brandon, A']","['Waldron I', 'Lye D', 'Brandon A']","['University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104-6018.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Women Health,Women & health,7608076,IM,"['*Adolescent', 'Attitude', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Sex Factors', 'Smoking/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Social Behavior Disorders', 'Social Values', 'Sports', 'Students/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,,,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Women Health. 1991;17(2):65-90. doi: 10.1300/J013v17n02_04.,,,,['10.1300/J013v17n02_04 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The data for the study were derived from in-depth interviews conducted between December 1988 and January 1989 in a Yoruba community, Nigeria. The diseases covered in the study include diarrhoea, measles, tetanus, pertussis and fever. It was observed that teething and food related causes were believed to be responsible for diarrhoea; the cause of measles and pertussis was generally unknown; tetanus was usually associated with convulsions; and fever was believed to be caused by roaming in the sun and by constipation. Herbal tea, modern drugs and prayers were the most commonly prescribed treatments for these diseases. It was observed that most mothers used alternative sources of health care, rather than hospitals, clinics and maternity centres, in their treatment of diseases among children. Prominent among the alternative sources were patent medicine stores where there were personalistic social interaction between clients and operators, free consultancy and flexible pricing. Parents' location at the time of a child's sickness, access to good advisers, the perceived seriousness of the sickness and religious beliefs of mothers were important determinants of their response. Avoidance of blame was noted to be a major motivating force in parents' search for potential sources of health care. The paper concludes that although some of the practices might have negative health implications, they could be usefully adapted to the goal of self-reliance in medical care as a strategy for attaining health for all by the year 2000.","['Adetunji, J A']",['Adetunji JA'],"['Graduate Programme in Demography, Australian National University, Canberra.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Child', 'Child Health Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child, Preschool', 'Complementary Therapies', '*Cultural Characteristics', '*Diarrhea, Infantile/etiology/therapy', '*Fever/etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Measles/etiology/therapy', 'Nigeria', '*Parents', '*Tetanus/etiology/therapy', '*Whooping Cough/etiology/therapy']",,,,,,,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1991;32(12):1379-87. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(91)90198-l.,,,,['10.1016/0277-9536(91)90198-l [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

A critical aspect of this phenomenon is the degree to which individuals who abuse one substance are likely to abuse other substances. The extent to which several pharmacologically distinct drugs will come to serve as positive reinforcers within genetically defined subjects defines their community with respect to abuse liability. Questions in this area are directed at determining whether reinforcement from and abuse of alcohol and other drugs define variations within a single behavioral phenomenon, or whether reinforcement and abuse must be individually defined for each substance involved. Previous studies have shown that ethanol can be readily established as a positive reinforcer in LEWIS rats and C57BL/6J mice. In low ethanol preferring F344 rats, ethanol maintains significant but low levels of responding. Ethanol does not maintain behavior in BALB/cJ or DBA/2J mice. These genotypic patterns of reinforcement from ethanol appear to correlate highly with patterns of reinforcement from cocaine and opiates. Other studies suggest that some aspects of drug self-administration may be mediated in part by common dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms, and animals which differ in ethanol drinking behavior show substantial differences in parameters of serotonergic function. Thus, there may exist important genetic determinants of drug reinforced behavior.","['George, F R', 'Ritz, M C']","['George FR', 'Ritz MC']","['Preclinical Pharmacology Branch, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Addiction Research Center, Baltimore, MD 21224.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Alcohol Alcohol Suppl,"Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire).

The health achievements of this country are product of political and socioeconomic circumstances as well as of right public health policies. Until about 1970 the features of Costa Rica mortality, although somewhat better than the Latin American average, evolved in a similar way to the rest of the region. In particular, the decades of 1940s and 1950s saw dramatic improvements in life expectancy, thanks mainly to the import of low-cost, high-effectiveness health technologies. In the 1970s, however, Costa Rica departed from a regional pattern of stagnation and managed to close the gap with developed countries in terms of mortality levels. A dramatic decline in the infant mortality rate from 60 to 19 per 1,000 took place in this decade. The main determinants of this breakthrough were health interventions, notably a primary health care program, even though favorable socioeconomic conditions and a reduced fertility also played a role. Ecological data and other evidence suggest that up to three fourths of the mortality decline was accounted for contemporary improvements in public health services, with about 40 percent attributable to primary health care interventions. Furthermore, by targeting interventions on the less privileged population, these interventions had the merit of reducing geographic and socioeconomic differentials in child mortality.","['Rosero-Bixby, L']",['Rosero-Bixby L'],"['Department of Population Planning, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Sweden,Scand J Soc Med Suppl,Scandinavian journal of social medicine.

Subjects were classified as not sexually active (n = 50), sexually active/noncontracepting (n = 20), or sexually active/contracepting (n = 72). Not sexually active subjects tended to be younger, more career motivated, to have a father at home, to be more influenced by family values, and to have more conservative attitudes regarding adolescent sexuality than did sexually active subjects. Sexually active/noncontracepting subjects tended to report fewer benefits and more barriers to the use of contraception.

This article examines a remarkable case of massive sterilization of approximately 1,500 workers in Costa Rica, due to exposure to a toxic nematicide called DBCP 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane), applied in large commercial banana plantations. Although the product was used during the 1970s, sterile victims have continued to be diagnosed through the 1980s. The effects include psychological trauma as well as permanent infertility. The case has international repercussions because several hundred workers have filed law suits against the U.S.-based transnational DBCP manufacturers, and because DBCP use was continued during the 1980s in other developing nations. The author analyzes the causes behind this serious impairment. It is argued that the contributing factors include not only biomedical processes and technical dimensions (i.e., how DBCP was used), but most importantly, political-economic factors that explain how and why DBCP was used despite the severe hazard. The crucial determinants pertain to the dominance of short-term profit motives, and the control over information and technology by the manufacturers (who concealed early toxicological research evidence of the reproductive hazards) and by the managers of the banana producer-companies. This case well illustrates problems and injustices from labor exploitation and resource extraction from transnational agro-industries. The article concludes with a brief summary of policy implications from the case.","['Thrupp, L A']",['Thrupp LA'],"['World Resources Institute, Washington, DC 20006.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Health Serv,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1305035,IM,"[""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*chemically induced/economics"", 'Agriculture/legislation & jurisprudence/*standards', 'Costa Rica', '*Fruit', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/*chemically induced/economics', 'Insecticides/*adverse effects/standards', 'Male', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Propane/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/standards', 'Social Responsibility', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States']",,,,,,,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Health Serv. 1991;21(4):731-57. doi: 10.2190/25B9-QFMV-Y28P-L736.,"['0 (Insecticides)', '96K0FD4803 (1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane)', 'T75W9911L6 (Propane)']",,,['10.2190/25B9-QFMV-Y28P-L736 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Generally a similar level of functional capabilities can be observed after one year for working and non-working patients except for manual dexterity. Early admission to rehabilitation (within the first 12 weeks) favours return to work. A high school degree qualifying for university entrance and a well paid and better qualified profession as well are correlated with a higher percentage of patients regaining their employment. An other determining factor of employment after CVA is the physical requirement of the former work.

A descriptive analysis of behavior under natural conditions indicated that bizarre vocalizations occurred most often in the presence of task-related demands and in the absence of adult attention. Further, bizarre speech occurring during tasks was followed frequently by the cessation of task demands by staff or the subject's voluntary disengagement from task-related activities; bizarre speech observed during noninteractional periods (i.e., in the absence of adult attention) was frequently followed by staff attention. The escape and attention hypotheses were tested under analogue conditions. Results of the experimental analysis supported only the attention hypothesis; that is, bizarre speech appeared to function as an attention-producing behavior. The functional analysis data were used to select two different yet functionally equivalent treatments. The first treatment provided the subject with noncontingent scheduled attention. The second intervention taught the subject social language skills in the form of initiation and expansion statements. Both interventions were effective in suppressing maladapted speech.

Decision making can be viewed in a number of ways: as pure information processing, as an interaction with various stimuli, including financial penalties and incentives, and as social behavior, interacting with and reacting to peer and leadership influence. The model that accounts for the greatest amount of the available data is a multifactorial one that takes all of these views into account. The most successful behavior change efforts use a variety of mutually reinforcing approaches, and must be present constantly or behaviors revert to highly variable (lower quality) actions and decisions. This appears to be a behavioral version of the second law of thermodynamics (entropy increases spontaneously). The best practice model to manage costs and quality appears to be one in which physicians and administrators have adequate up to date information available, make group decisions, develop and continuously improve agreed upon methods of practice, interact and think before acting, and have rewards for such behavior.","['Harris, J S']",['Harris JS'],"['Harris Associates, Nashville, TN 37205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Occup Med,Journal of occupational medicine. : official publication of the Industrial Medical Association,7502807,IM,"['Behavior', '*Decision Making', 'Fees, Medical', 'Health Services Needs and Demand/*economics', 'Inflation, Economic', 'Physicians/*psychology', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*economics"", 'United States']",,,,,,,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Occup Med. 1990 Dec;32(12):1207-20. doi: 10.1097/00043764-199012000-00016.,,,111,['10.1097/00043764-199012000-00016 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The stroke patients reported fewer non-threatening events and events with only a short-term threat, while difficulties were reported with equal frequency by the two groups. However, events which were severely threatening in the long-term were significantly more common in the stroke patients (in the 52 weeks before stroke 26% versus 13%, odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.9). The increased rate was apparent throughout the year and not just in the weeks immediately before stroke onset. The number of stroke patients experiencing severe events in the follow up year fell to the level found in the control group.

Recent literature from sport and exercise psychology is presented on these variables, their determinants, and their consequences for choice, effort, persistence, and performance behavior in exercise and sport contexts.","['Lewthwaite, R']",['Lewthwaite R'],"['Department of Human Kinetics, School of Allied Health Professions, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee 53201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Phys Ther,Physical therapy,0022623,AIM IM S,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Goals', 'Humans', 'Models, Psychological', '*Motivation', 'Motor Activity/physiology', 'Movement/*physiology', 'Orientation', 'Perception', 'Self Concept', 'Social Environment']",['NASA: 91046328'],,,,,,1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Phys Ther. 1990 Dec;70(12):808-19. doi: 10.1093/ptj/70.12.808.,,,98,['10.1093/ptj/70.12.808 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

These correlations ranged from 0.12 to 0.31 with a median value of 0.18. The association between family social background and childhood outcomes was modelled using LISREL modelling methods which assumed that this association was mediated by common non-observed vulnerability processes.

DESIGN: Data from practicing physicians attending a continuing medical education course were obtained by questionnaire. After adjustment for sociodemographic differences, data from the physician population were compared with similar data previously obtained from a patient population. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-one physicians (94% of the study population) agreed to participate. Ninety percent were primary care physicians. Fifty-eight percent practiced in the eastern United States. MAIN RESULTS: The physicians, like the regular patients, preferred that the principal role in decision making for their own illnesses be handled by their providers, not by themselves. As illness severity increased, physicians indicated significantly less desire for making decisions (p less than 0.01). The magnitudes of the effects of increasing illness severity upon the decision-making preferences of physician and regular patients were comparable (p = 0.53). Physician-patients, however, were slightly more interested than regular patients in making decisions (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: although physician-patients are slightly more interested than regular patients in making decisions, for the most part their preferences for autonomy resemble those of regular patients. These results suggest that medical knowledge and sociocultural factors are only minor determinants of patient attitudes towards autonomy. Rather, patients' preferences to be relieved of decision-making responsibility are better understood as part of the phenomenology of illness.","['Ende, J', 'Kazis, L', 'Moskowitz, M A']","['Ende J', 'Kazis L', 'Moskowitz MA']","['Evans Memorial Department of Clinical Research, Boston University School of Medicine, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Gen Intern Med,Journal of general internal medicine,8605834,E IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Participation', '*Personal Autonomy', 'Physicians/*psychology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Social Values']",['KIE: 35171'],,,['KIE'],"['Empirical Approach', 'Professional Patient Relationship']","['KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: professional patient relationship', 'KIE: Full author name: Ende, Jack', 'KIE: Full author name: Kazis, Lewis', 'KIE: Full author name: Moskowitz, Mark A']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Intern Med. 1990 Nov-Dec;5(6):506-9. doi: 10.1007/bf02600881.,,,,['10.1007/bf02600881 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Titova Mitrovica, Yugoslavia, is the site of a large lead smelter, refinery, and battery factory. At midpregnancy, 602 women in T. Mitrovica and 900 women in Pristina, a non-lead-exposed control town, were interviewed. Blood was obtained for blood lead (PbB), hemoglobin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and serum ferritin measurements. Women were seen again at delivery, at which time maternal and umbilical cord blood samples were obtained. While many demographic and social characteristics were similar across the two towns, women in Pristina were more likely to report employment outside the home, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use during pregnancy. As expected, PbB levels were substantially higher in the smelter town. At midpregnancy, PbB geometric means were 17.1 micrograms/dL in T. Mitrovica and 5.1 micrograms/dL in Pristina; 86% of the pregnant women in T. Mitrovica, compared to 3.4% of those in Pristina, had PbB levels greater than 10 micrograms/dL. Within T. Mitrovica, distance between the home and the smelter was the most important predictor of PbB at mid-pregnancy and delivery.

DESIGN: The study was a prospective investigation on a two phase sample. SETTING: The study involved women attending the antenatal clinic at a district general hospital. PATIENTS: A group of pregnant Caucasian women, selected because they were heavy smokers (15+ cigarettes/day) (n = 94) and a randomly selected sample of never smokers (n = 112) were studied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data on social factors were collected by interviewer administered questionnaire. A 7 day weighed intake method was used to determine dietary intake at 28 weeks gestation. In univariate analyses, income, housing tenure and social class had significant effects on intakes of both macro- and micronutrients, and maternal education and smoking had significant effects on intakes of micronutrients. Using a stepwise multivariate analysis with income, smoking and maternal education, income was a significant factor in the intake of most nutrients but this effect disappeared when social class and housing tenure factors were entered into the model. Only social class and housing tenure had any significant effect on intakes of macronutrients--energy, protein and fat. Smoking and maternal education were the most important determinants of quality of diet (nutrient density); other factors had only negligible effects.

CONCLUSIONS: Smoking, being renters of accommodation, and being of minimum education and low social class are risk factors for poor dietary intake.

These models can both reveal the causes of conflicts of judgment and may help resolve them in a way that unaided discussion cannot. Revealing experts' models to students speeds learning of diagnostic skills. Clinical judgment analysis offers a method of probing the judgments not just of students and doctors but also of patients who have shown systematic differences in their perceptions of risk and benefit.

The results showed that environmental variables were more important than personal variables for sugar consumption. In particular, degree of peer orientation was closely linked to sugar consumption (beta = 0.29).

An attempt was therefore made to identify aspects of individuals' environments that might be responsible for lability of neuroticism and symptoms.

We investigated the determinants of cancer symptom recognition and delay in seeking medical care in a population-based sample of 625 newly diagnosed lung, breast and colorectal cancer patients. Although the majority (79.5%) of patients reported noticing symptoms prior to diagnosis, one quarter of these patients (24.7%) delayed longer than three months in seeking medical care. Contrary to the findings of research based on clinic samples, logistic regression analysis revealed that no demographic or social support factors were predictive of symptom recognition or delay, with the exception that older colorectal cancer patients were less likely to notice symptoms, but also less likely to delay. Lung and colorectal patients diagnosed with advanced disease were more likely to notice symptoms than patients with local disease. Results of a content analysis of patients' remarks indicate that breast cancer patients were significantly more likely than lung or colorectal cancer patients to attribute their symptoms to cancer (p less than .001). Symptoms common to lung and colorectal cancer appear to be attributed to other, less serious causes. Given the lack of demographic predictors of symptom recognition and delay in seeking care, we suggest that education programs address risk groups for specific cancers, rather than the general public as a whole, grouping together all cancers and cancer symptomatology.","['Mor, V', 'Masterson-Allen, S', 'Goldberg, R', 'Guadagnoli, E', 'Wool, M S']","['Mor V', 'Masterson-Allen S', 'Goldberg R', 'Guadagnoli E', 'Wool MS']","['Brown University Center, Gerontology and Health Care Research, Providence, RI 02912.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Community Health,Journal of community health,7600747,IM,"['Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis', '*Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Community Health. 1990 Aug;15(4):253-66. doi: 10.1007/bf01350291.,,,,['10.1007/bf01350291 [doi]'],['CA 36560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Contact influences are shown to be mediated by nonopioid pathways, whereas gustatory influences are shown to be opioid mediated. Specifically, naltrexone (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) did not at all diminish quieting exerted by contact with an anesthetized dam but completely reversed the quieting effects of morphine in isolated rats. Naloxone (5 mg/kg) did not affect the latencies with which nondeprived or 8-hr deprived rats 9, 12, 15, and 18 days of age attached to the nipples of anesthetized dams, nor did naloxone (5 and 10 mg/kg) cause any systematic change in nipple attachment in 10- and 18-day-old rats that had been deprived of their dam for either 0, 8, or 24 hr. In a 3rd experiment, naloxone (5 mg/kg) did not significantly reduce milk intake by 9-, 12-, 15-, or 18-day-old rats from the nipple when milk letdown was induced by oxytocin. Moreover, naloxone (5 and 10 mg/kg) did not reduce milk intake in Day-10 rats that, while suckling, received milk via a cannula placed in the posterior portion of the tongue at the level of the intermolar eminence or in rats that obtained milk directly from their awake mother. In contrast, milk intake was significantly reduced by naltrexone (0.25-1.0 mg/kg) in Day-10 rats that obtained milk (a) by licking it off a saturated substrate or (b) through an indwelling cannula located in the anterior portion of the lower jaw. (Milk delivered at this placement is thought to engage feeding systems by its taste and texture.) In a final set of experiments in Day-10 rats, intake of milk delivered via anterior jaw cannulae was reduced by naloxone (5 and 10 mg/kg) in rats that were either isolated, in contact with an anesthetized dam, or attached to her nipples. On the basis of resistance to naloxone and naltrexone administration, these experiments demonstrate that behavioral influences of the tactile (and possibly olfactory) qualities of the mother are not mediated by opioid systems. Implications for understanding the means through which mothers can influence their young and the infantile mediators of these maternal influences are discussed.","['Blass, E M', 'Fillion, T J', 'Weller, A', 'Brunson, L']","['Blass EM', 'Fillion TJ', 'Weller A', 'Brunson L']",['Johns Hopkins University.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Behav Neurosci,Behavioral neuroscience,8302411,IM,"['Affect/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Arousal/*physiology', 'Brain/physiology', 'Endorphins/*physiology', 'Female', 'Male', '*Maternal Deprivation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Opioid/*physiology', '*Social Environment', 'Sucking Behavior/physiology', 'Vocalization, Animal/physiology']",,,,,,,1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Behav Neurosci. 1990 Aug;104(4):625-36. doi: 10.1037//0735-7044.104.4.625.,"['0 (Endorphins)', '0 (Receptors, Opioid)']",,,['10.1037//0735-7044.104.4.625 [doi]'],"['1 F31 MH09628-01A1/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 18560/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'MH 00524/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The conceptual framework applied here is based on the synthesis framework of fertility control developed by Easterlin and Crimmins. The data came from the 1974 Korean National Family Survey, which was conducted as part of the World Fertility Survey. The study focuses on the relative importance of the socioeconomic factors and intervening variables in the determination of fertility control. The most interesting finding is that there are only small differentials in fertility control by socioeconomic factors. The analysis emphasizes the importance of examining the determinants of fertility control in terms of the intervening variables, which include the components of natural fertility, desired family size, and costs of fertility control. These intervening variables provide general support for the theoretical predictions. Moreover, most of the coefficients for these variables are statistically significant at the .05 level. The analysis also shows that motivation for fertility control is an important factor in determining use of fertility control.","['Chung, S H']",['Chung SH'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korea J Popul Dev,Korea journal of population and development,101084651,J,"['*Age Factors', 'Asia', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Contraception', '*Contraception Behavior', 'Decision Making', 'Demography', 'Developing Countries', '*Economics', '*Educational Status', '*Family Characteristics', 'Family Planning Services', 'Far East', '*Fertility', '*Infant Mortality', 'Korea', 'Longevity', 'Marital Status', '*Marriage', 'Mortality', '*Motivation', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', '*Population Dynamics', '*Psychology', '*Regression Analysis', 'Reproduction', 'Research', '*Sexual Behavior', '*Social Class', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Survival Rate']","['IND: 8017738', 'PIP: 066126', 'POP: 00203016']",,,['PIP'],"['*Age Factors', 'Asia', 'Behavior', '*Child Survival', 'Contraception', '*Contraceptive Usage--determinants', '*Currently Married--women', 'Data Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Developing Countries', 'Eastern Asia', 'Economic Factors', '*Educational Status', 'Family And Household', 'Family Characteristics', 'Family Planning', 'Family Size', '*Family Size, Desired', '*Fecundity', 'Fertility', '*Fertility Determinants', 'Fertility Measurements', 'Fertility Surveys', '*Intermediate Variables', 'Korea', '*Korea, Republic Of', 'Length Of Life', 'Marital Status', 'Mortality', '*Motivation', '*Natural Fertility', 'Nuptiality', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Population Dynamics', 'Psychological Factors', '*Psychosocial Factors', 'Reproduction', '*Reproductive Behavior', 'Research Methodology', '*Socioeconomic Factors', '*Socioeconomic Status', '*Statistical Regression', 'Survivorship', '*Utility Theory', '*World Fertility Surveys']",['PIP: TJ: KOREA JOURNAL OF POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT'],1990/07/01 00:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Korea J Popul Dev. 1990 Jul;19(1):27-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Utilization of restorative services was measured by calculating the percentage of surfaces that needed and received treatment, as identified by the DLS examiners by clinical and radiographic examination. Oral examinations were initiated in 1969 with subsequent examinations occurring at approximately 3-year intervals. Personality measures for these individuals were obtained using the EPI-Q, a shortened form of the Eysenck Personality Inventory. A plot of neuroticism versus the utilization measure yielded a curvilinear relationship suggesting that participants seeking the most dental care scored moderately on the neuroticism scale while those scoring lowest and highest on this scale sought less treatment. In contrast, the introversion/extraversion scale showed no apparent relationship with dental care utilization. Results from the regression analysis suggest that dentition and socioeconomic status are strong determinants of utilization and that need for restorative treatment influences utilization.","['Kennedy, B D', 'Aldwin, C M', 'Bosse, R', 'Douglass, C W', 'Chauncey, H H']","['Kennedy BD', 'Aldwin CM', 'Bosse R', 'Douglass CW', 'Chauncey HH']","['Veterans Administration Outpatient Clinic, Boston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Spec Care Dentist,"Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",8103755,D,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Dental Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Dental Restoration, Permanent/statistics & numerical data', 'Extraversion, Psychological', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Services Needs and Demand/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Introversion, Psychological', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurotic Disorders/psychology', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', '*Personality', 'Personality Inventory', 'Regression Analysis', 'Social Class', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs']",,,,,,,1990/07/01 00:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Spec Care Dentist. 1990 Jul-Aug;10(4):102-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1754-4505.1990.tb00770.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1754-4505.1990.tb00770.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Three hundred and fifteen Dutch males aged 28 and 29 were located via the Army registry. Their diets were assessed through a dietary history questionnaire plus oral cross-check, and blood was sampled twice at a 1-week interval. Height, weight, skinfolds, and waist and hip circumference were measured to estimate amount and location of body fat. Physical activity, social status and smoking were estimated through questionnaires. The range of cholesterol values predicted from differences in dietary fatty acid and cholesterol intake as summarized by the Keys equation score was 5.11 to 6.29 mmol/l, while the actual levels ranged from 3.30 to 9.28 mmol/l. Multiple regression analysis showed a weak but significant association of the Keys score with total cholesterol (slope 0.83, P less than 0.05), LDL cholesterol (slope 0.71, P less than 0.05), and the HDL/total cholesterol ratio (slope -0.04, P less than 0.01). The percentage of energy from alcohol was strongly and independently associated with both total and HDL cholesterol (slopes 0.04 and 0.02, P less than 0.001). Body fat parameters were strongly associated with all serum lipids and lipoproteins. We conclude that the contribution of dietary differences to differences in serum lipids and lipoproteins within this population is real but small.","['Berns, M A', 'de Vries, J H', 'Katan, M B']","['Berns MA', 'de Vries JH', 'Katan MB']","['Department of Human Nutrition, Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Clin Nutr,European journal of clinical nutrition,8804070,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Cholesterol/blood', '*Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Fats/administration & dosage', 'Dietary Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Lipids/*blood', 'Lipoproteins/*blood', 'Male', 'Military Personnel', 'Netherlands']",,,,,,,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Nutr. 1990 Jul;44(7):535-44.,"['0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Dietary Proteins)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The available evidence suggests that the relationship is probably not a simple one. In particular, the research shows that social, cultural, and environmental factors may all play some part in explaining the relationship. It is suggested that something might be gained by focusing on the various situational factors which link drug/alcohol use and crime. Some help might be forthcoming for this endeavour from criminology which has in recent years developed a body of knowledge on the role of situational determinants of crime. Research from within this perspective has been helpful in informing strategies for intervention over a wide range of crimes and crime settings. In particular, attention is drawn to the wealth of crime prevention ideas that has arisen out of situational analyses of alcohol-related public disorder. It is proposed that further research is conducted which draws on this approach in an attempt to increase our understanding of the micro social processes involved.","['Bennett, T']",['Bennett T'],"['Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Addict,British journal of addiction,8804404,IM,"['*Crime/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Environment', 'Substance-Related Disorders/*psychology']",,,,,,,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Addict. 1990 Jul;85(7):833-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1990.tb03709.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1360-0443.1990.tb03709.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Matching clients with community environments.,415-22,"The need for permanent housing for the chronically mentally ill has received a great deal of attention over the last several years. One response to the problem has been the development of supportive housing, that is, non-facility-based permanent homes with placement based on clients' functional capabilities and preferences. However, little research has focused on assessing the match between clients and environmental requirements. This study begins to identify the social and clinical characteristics of clients that contribute to selection into different types of housing environments. Ninety-one clients were sampled from the supportive housing services of a major provider in two New England states. Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability that clients will be placed into apartments vs. other, more restricted settings, based on their clinical and social characteristics. Findings show that the primary determinants of placement were clinical severity, early family history, and adequacy of family support. The less severely ill and better functioning the client, the more likely that he or she was placed in an apartment. This was mitigated, however, by the availability and adequacy of family support. In addition, clients with early family disruptions were also less likely to be placed in apartments. Findings are discussed in light of their implications for providing permanent housing placements for chronically mentally ill persons and for factors in future research to evaluate the success of placement.","['Goldstein, J M', 'Dziobek, J F', 'Clark, R', 'Bassuk, E L']","['Goldstein JM', 'Dziobek JF', 'Clark R', 'Bassuk EL']","['Bigel Institute for Health Policy, Heller Graduate School, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02254-9110.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nerv Ment Dis,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,0375402,AIM IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Community Mental Health Services/organization & administration', 'Family', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Massachusetts', '*Mental Disorders/classification', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Residence Characteristics', '*Residential Facilities/organization & administration', 'Rhode Island', '*Social Environment', '*Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nerv Ment Dis. 1990 Jul;178(7):415-22. doi: 10.1097/00005053-199007000-00002.,,,,['10.1097/00005053-199007000-00002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Each student in the dyad was asked to defend one of these solutions and was given four written arguments in favour of it. The students were instructed to give up the discussion if they were convinced that the partner's position was a better solution. At the end of the discussion the students independently of each other indicated what solution they really thought was the better. Low achievers in school gave up the discussion and claimed to believe that the opposite solution was the better more frequently than did high achievers.

Factors that may influence an individual's use of a particular coping strategy, however, are not well understood. Coping consistency within individuals and across situations was examined in a longitudinal study of 74 independently living elderly persons, as were the effects of the type of event experienced, appraisal of its degree of threat, and demographic variables on coping behaviour. Correlational analyses indicated that coping responses were more a function of event type than of an individual's consistent style. A number of distinct life-events were associated with particular types of coping responses. The degree of threat, one's expectation of the changeability of an event, and one's appraisal of possible courses of action were also correlated with specific coping behaviours. Age was negatively correlated with problem-focused coping and total number of coping responses. This study suggests that the type of stressful event an individual experiences may be a more important general determinant of one's coping response than is one's overriding propensity to cope in a particular way.","['Patterson, T L', 'Smith, L W', 'Grant, I', 'Clopton, P', 'Josepho, S', 'Yager, J']","['Patterson TL', 'Smith LW', 'Grant I', 'Clopton P', 'Josepho S', 'Yager J']","['VA Medical Center, San Diego, CA 92161.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Med Psychol,The British journal of medical psychology,0370640,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Aged/*psychology', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Defense Mechanisms', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Internal-External Control', '*Life Change Events', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Personality Tests', 'Problem Solving', 'Social Support']",,,,,,,1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Med Psychol. 1990 Jun;63 ( Pt 2):149-60. doi: 10.1111/j.2044-8341.1990.tb01608.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.2044-8341.1990.tb01608.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Anxiety was significantly associated with negative/restrictive attitudes towards HIV positives and gay men and with low levels of knowledge about HIV transmission and less education about HIV/AIDS. Negative/restrictive attitudes towards HIV positives were associated both with less knowledge regarding HIV transmission and fewer contacts with HIV positives. Similar associations were found regarding gay men.

By application of the model, the decrease of TFR of 2.78 between 1971 and 1981 was estimated to be contributed by widespread of contraception (68%), later marriage (49%), and increase of induced abortion (28%), through shortening of the length of postpartum breastfeeding showed negative effects (-32%), on the assumption that local data could be substituted for some national data. Compared with other countries, China was characterized by coexistence of strong fertility-inhibiting effects of nonmarriage, contraception, induced abortion, and relatively strong fertility-inhibiting effects of breastfeeding. It strongly suggested that the fertility transition in China was realized by powerful population policies in the context of insufficient socioeconomic development to lead to the transition.","['Sato, R', 'Hayashi, K']","['Sato R', 'Hayashi K']",,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Minzoku Eisei,[Minzoku eisei] Race hygiene,18730350R,J,"['*Abortion, Induced', 'Asia', '*Birth Rate', '*Breast Feeding', 'China', 'Contraception', '*Contraception Behavior', '*Demography', 'Developing Countries', 'Economics', 'Family Planning Services', 'Far East', '*Fertility', 'Health', 'Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', '*Marriage', 'Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Population', '*Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', '*Public Policy', 'Research', '*Socioeconomic Factors']","['IND: 8017446', 'PIP: 065766', 'POP: 00202930']",,,['PIP'],"['*Abortion, Induced--changes', 'Asia', '*Breast Feeding--changes', 'China', 'Contraception', '*Contraceptive Usage', 'Demographic Factors', 'Developing Countries', 'Eastern Asia', 'Economic Factors', 'Family Planning', 'Fertility', 'Fertility Control, Postconception', '*Fertility Decline', '*Fertility Determinants', 'Health', 'Infant Nutrition', 'Marriage', '*Marriage Postponement', 'Nuptiality', 'Nutrition', '*Period Analysis', 'Policy', 'Population', '*Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', '*Population Policy', 'Research Methodology', 'Social Policy', '*Socioeconomic Factors']",['PIP: TJ: MINZOKU EISEI'],1990/05/01 00:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Minzoku Eisei. 1990 May;56(3):131-41. doi: 10.3861/jshhe.56.131.,,,,['10.3861/jshhe.56.131 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

All consenting women were interviewed in the hospital within 2 days after delivery, using standardized measures of child-rearing attitudes, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, social support, and cognitive ability. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that depressive symptoms, cognitive ability, and two demographic characteristics (maternal age and spoken language) accounted for 42.4% of the variance in negative childrearing attitudes during the postpartum period. The contributions of social support and self-esteem were no longer significant when the effects of the other psychosocial factors were taken into consideration simultaneously. The utility of early assessment of maternal attitudes as a marker for maternal risk status is addressed.

The Ajzen-Fishbein theory of reasoned action was used as the conceptual framework. Nursing behaviors toward the dying included in the ASBID were developed from interviews with bereaved family members. Three hundred seventy-two registered nurses caring for dying patients were used as the sample population for testing the ASBID. Internal consistency reliability coefficients for the ASBID achieved satisfactory standards. Factor analysis suggested three factors were being measured: general acute care measures for the dying, open communication with the dying, and continuing care for bereaved family members. Results supported the Ajzen-Fishbein theory that attitudes and subjective norms were major determinants of intentions. Findings indicate that educational programs planned to influence nursing care of the dying should focus on the consequences of specific behaviors of nurses rather than on death anxiety in nurses, and they should include nursing supervisors as well as nurses providing direct care for the dying.","['Waltman, N L']",['Waltman NL'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,N,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Attitude to Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nursing Care/*standards', 'Nursing Staff/*psychology/standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Social Desirability', 'Social Values', 'Surveys and Questionnaires/standards', '*Terminal Care']",,,,,,,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 1990 May-Jun;17(3 Suppl):55-60; discussion 60-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address gaps in the literature, data from a 1984 national survey were used to compare drinking patterns and their sociocultural correlates among male, black (n = 723) and male, white (n = 743) Americans. Findings from the survey indicate that, at the aggregate level, black and white men exhibit very similar drinking patterns. The proportion of abstainers, infrequent, frequent and heavier drinkers is very similar for the two groups of men. However, major black-white differences occur when the relationship between drinking rates and major social characteristics is considered. Bivariate tables suggest that frequent heavier drinking among whites is associated with youthfulness, high-income status and residing in ""wetter"" areas, whereas among blacks these patterns are reversed or absent. Log-linear analysis confirmed some of these findings. When drinking behavior was modeled with respect to race, age, income and region, race emerged as an independent predictor and the effects of age and income varied by race. When the two groups of men were analyzed separately, age and region were the only significant determinants of heavier drinking among whites. Among blacks, income and age emerged as significant variables and the influence of age differed from the findings for whites. The results suggest that there may be important differences in the cultural environments of drinking in black and white men.","['Herd, D']",['Herd D'],"['Institute of Epidemiology and Behavioral Medicine, Medical Research Institute of San Francisco, Berkeley, California 94709.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Stud Alcohol,Journal of studies on alcohol,7503813,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans/*psychology', 'Age Factors', 'Alcohol Drinking/*psychology', 'Alcoholism/*epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Social Environment', 'Social Values', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,,,1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Stud Alcohol. 1990 May;51(3):221-32. doi: 10.15288/jsa.1990.51.221.,,,,['10.15288/jsa.1990.51.221 [doi]'],"['AA0559-06/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'AA06050/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The purpose is two-fold: to determine whether the structure of the relationship between the caregiving network, and stress and burden is uniform across rural, small city, and urban samples; and, to assess whether stress and burden are explained by a similar set of variables within area of residence categories. The data are drawn from a matched sample of 1,388 impaired elders and their primary caregivers from the 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey and the National Survey of Informal Caregivers. In general, the analysis shows that several characteristics of the care-receiver and the primary caregiver have a differential effect on stress and burden across residential categories, and that, within rural, small city, and urban samples, the determinants of stress and burden are not homogeneous. When the frail elder is able to reciprocate by doing chores, babysitting, or providing some other type of assistance for the primary caregiver, however, both stress and burden are reduced in all three residential categories. Similarly, the increased provision of assistance with instrumental activities of daily living by the primary caregiver uniformly increases stress and burden. These findings suggest that interventions designed to alleviate primary caregiver stress and burden may be able to have some common components, but may also need to be tailored in some ways to specific residential environments.","['Dwyer, J W', 'Miller, M K']","['Dwyer JW', 'Miller MK']","['University of Florida, Gainesville 32610.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Rural Health,The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,8508122,H,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', '*Catchment Area, Health', 'Data Collection', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Home Nursing/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Rural Population', '*Social Environment', '*Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress, Psychological/*epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Urban Population']",,,,,,,1990/04/01 00:00,1999/04/02 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Rural Health. 1990 Apr;6(2):161-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1748-0361.1990.tb00197.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1748-0361.1990.tb00197.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The stress impacts of high-impedance commuting were examined in a study of 79 employees of two companies in the follow-up testing of a longitudinal study. Subjective impedance was overlapping but not isomorphic with physical impedance, and these two dimensions have differential relationships with health and well-being outcomes. The physical impedance construct received further confirmation in validational analyses and in predicted effects on various illness measures and job satisfaction. The newly constructed subjective impedance index was significantly related to evening home mood, residential satisfaction, and chest pain. Job change was also influenced primarily by commuting satisfaction. The results are discussed within an ecological framework emphasizing interdomain transfer effects and situational moderators of commuting stress.","['Novaco, R W', 'Stokols, D', 'Milanesi, L']","['Novaco RW', 'Stokols D', 'Milanesi L']","['University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Community Psychol,American journal of community psychology,0364535,IM,"['Adult', '*Affect', '*Arousal', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Male', 'Personality Tests', 'Psychophysiologic Disorders/psychology', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Environment', 'Stress, Psychological/*complications', '*Transportation', '*Travel', 'Type A Personality']",,,,,,,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Community Psychol. 1990 Apr;18(2):231-57. doi: 10.1007/bf00931303.,,,,['10.1007/bf00931303 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Between 1974 and 1985, over 1.3 million smokers quit during each of those years. However, 75% to 80% of those individuals resumed smoking within six months. This article describes the dynamic phenomenon of smoking relapse within the context of cyclical episodes of smoking and quitting during an individual's lifetime. Theories of the determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed and methods designed to prevent relapse are described. Smoking relapse is discussed in terms of three aspects of tobacco addiction: (1) biological-addiction mechanisms, (2) conditioning processes, and (3) cognitive-social learning factors. The major determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed, including nicotine withdrawal, stress, weight gain, social influences, conditioning factors, causal attributions, and environmental variables. A trans-theoretical-developmental model is explored in the longitudinal investigation of the natural history of slips (lapses) and relapse episodes. Relapse prevention interventions are described that emphasize self-awareness, self-regulation, self-efficacy, affect regulation, social support, and lifestyle balance. Recent developments in pharmacological adjuncts to treatment are also examined. It is concluded that innovative relapse prevention methods need to be designed for hard-core smokers with histories of cessation failures, substance abuse and/or psychiatric impairment. These and other recommendations for future research on smoking relapse and relapse prevention are discussed.","['Carmody, T P']",['Carmody TP'],"['Psychology Service, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California 94121.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Psychoactive Drugs,Journal of psychoactive drugs,8113536,IM,"['Humans', 'Recurrence', 'Smoking/psychology/*therapy', 'Smoking Prevention']",,,,,,,1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Psychoactive Drugs. 1990 Apr-Jun;22(2):211-38. doi: 10.1080/02791072.1990.10472545.,,,127,['10.1080/02791072.1990.10472545 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The results regarding cardiovascular disease are unpublished, as yet. DESIGN: Cross sectional population study. SETTING: City of Gothenburg, Sweden. SUBJECTS: 639 Men from a population sample of 1016 men aged 50 in 1983. They were all employed and had no history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Fibrinogen values were available for all of them. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Fibrinogen concentration in relation to socioeconomic state according to occupation, and other social influences determined as number of people in the household and scores of social activities and activities in and outside the house. RESULTS: Men with low scores for activities at home had a mean plasma fibrinogen concentration of 3.34 g/l (95% confidence interval 3.21 to 3.47), whereas those with an intermediate score had a mean concentration of 3.16 (3.00 to 3.32) g/l and those with a high score 3.02 (2.95 to 3.10) g/l. Similar inverse relations were noted for the two other activity scores and for occupational class (class 1 being unskilled and semiskilled workers and class 5 professionals and executives) and the number of people in the household. Smoking exerted a strong influence on fibrinogen concentration, the relations between fibrinogen concentration and social factors being evident only in non-smokers. The mean difference in fibrinogen value between the non-smokers with the lowest activity scores at home and those with the highest scores was 0.36 (0.19 to 0.54) g/l, and similar differences were seen for the two other activity scores. Multiple regression analyses showed smoking, body mass index, the sum of all activities (inverse relation), and diabetes to be independently associated with fibrinogen value, whereas occupational class (p = 0.81) and the number of people in the household (p = 0.09) were not. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial influences seem to influence the coagulation system in the body in a way that is associated with cardiovascular disease and premature death.","['Rosengren, A', 'Wilhelmsen, L', 'Welin, L', 'Tsipogianni, A', 'Teger-Nilsson, A C', 'Wedel, H']","['Rosengren A', 'Wilhelmsen L', 'Welin L', 'Tsipogianni A', 'Teger-Nilsson AC', 'Wedel H']","['Department of Medicine, Ostra Hospital, Gothenburg University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,AIM IM,"['Body Mass Index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diabetes Mellitus/blood', 'Exercise', 'Family Characteristics', 'Fibrinogen/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leisure Activities', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking', 'Social Class', 'Social Support', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Sweden']",,,,,,,1990/03/10 00:00,1990/03/10 00:01,['1990/03/10 00:00'],"['1990/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMJ. 1990 Mar 10;300(6725):634-8. doi: 10.1136/bmj.300.6725.634.,['9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)'],,,['10.1136/bmj.300.6725.634 [doi]'],,,PMC1662451,,,,,,,,

Key questions explored were a) whether people believed that their personal physician thought that they should exercise, and b) the level of motivation to comply with these perceived expectations. Subjects were drawn from four independent populations: 1) parents of junior high school students (N = 479); 2) university employees (N = 190); 3) lower-limb disabled adults (N = 62); and 4) pregnant women (N = 68). Questionnaire-based physical activity scores were transformed into Z-scores and the data sets for activity and beliefs were pooled. Multiple regression models were developed for each individual data set and for the combined data. The proportion of the variance in reported physical activity explained by the normative belief regarding the physician and the level of motivation to comply with the perceived physician's expectations was very low (adjusted R(2) = 0.026 for the combined data sets). In general, healthy adults thought that their personal physician wanted them to exercise and were motivated to comply with such advice. In contrast, disabled adults saw their personal physician as opposed to exercise which they were motivated to undertake. These findings are discussed in terms of the importance of social norms as determinants of exercise behavior and the position that physicians should adopt when seeking to enhance exercise behavior.","['Godin, G', 'Shephard, R J']","['Godin G', 'Shephard RJ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Health Promot,American journal of health promotion : AJHP,8701680,,,,,,,,,1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['2011/12/30 06:00'],"['2011/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Am J Health Promot. 1990 Mar;4(4):255-9. doi: 10.4278/0890-1171-4.4.255.,,,,['10.4278/0890-1171-4.4.255 [doi]'],,,,,,10.4278/0890-1171-4.4.255 [doi],,,,,

No rural relative was rated as high EE at follow-up. Of the patients included in the one-year follow-up, 86% were followed for two years. In contrast to the one-year findings, the global EE index at initial interview did not predict relapse of schizophrenia over the subsequent two years.

Results confirmed that unknown control emerged as a distinct dimension of perceived control in both dispositional and attributional measures, and was consistently associated with poor achievement in school. Attributions of test outcomes to unknown causes were strongly related to dispositional unknown control, and were not affected by success or failure. In contrast, dispositional and attributional internality were unrelated, and did not predict achievement. It is argued that internal beliefs reflect internalised social-educational norms, and as a result have less impact on motivation than perceptions of unknown control. The implications of these findings for educational practice and motivational interventions are discussed.","['Butler, R', 'Orion, R']","['Butler R', 'Orion R']","['School of Education, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Educ Psychol,The British journal of educational psychology,0370636,IM,"['*Achievement', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Internal-External Control', 'Male', 'Personality Tests', '*Teaching']",,,,,,,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Educ Psychol. 1990 Feb;60 ( Pt 1):63-75. doi: 10.1111/j.2044-8279.1990.tb00922.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.2044-8279.1990.tb00922.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Rats at 5, 11, and 22 days of age preferred the odor previously associated with CCK, compared with vehicle-injected littermates. In contrast, CCK failed to support olfactory conditioning in 28-day-old rats, whether they were (a) weaned and independently housed, (b) residing with the dam and suckling, or (c) fed only milk. Adult rats also did not establish an odor preference with CCK as the unconditioned stimulus.

Management of the real environmental determinants (home, work, social) of pain and disability should improve the effectiveness of behaviorally based interventions and make these treatments more accessible. Over a 6 year period, 261 patients having various chronic somatic complaints (e.g., pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints) underwent interdisciplinary outpatient treatment based on medical and behavioral sciences. Comparison of patients having field management with patients receiving office-based treatment found a significantly greater reduction in disability with field management. 84% of field managed patients had a successful outcome as defined by: (a) return to regular work, or (b) reduced limitations on work, exercise, and daily living activities, depending on functional status at assessment. Only 61% of patients with office-based treatment were successful. Compliance, defined as the frequency with which treatment was mutually terminated, was significantly higher with field management. The availability of long-term disability benefits was highly predictive of a poorer outcome. However, field management remained effective for improving functional status regardless of the availability of benefits. Finally, determination of the cost of non-institutional treatment indicated that field management is a cost-effective modality. Implications of these findings for the treatment of disability in chronic pain and other chronic illness syndromes are discussed.","['Cott, A', 'Anchel, H', 'Goldberg, W M', 'Fabich, M', 'Parkinson, W']","['Cott A', 'Anchel H', 'Goldberg WM', 'Fabich M', 'Parkinson W']","[""Department of Medicine, St. Joseph's Hospital/McMaster University, Hamilton, Ont., Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pain,Pain,7508686,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Ambulatory Care', '*Behavior Therapy', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/psychology/rehabilitation', '*Pain Management', 'Sick Role']",,,,,,,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pain. 1990 Feb;40(2):183-94. doi: 10.1016/0304-3959(90)90069-p.,,,,"['0304-3959(90)90069-P [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3959(90)90069-p [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Five fertility adjustment responses were identified: sperm-banking awareness (SBA); adoption awareness (AA); fertility testing (FT); trying to father children (TFC); and fertility distress (FD). Although responses to infertility are multidetermined, these data demonstrate there is a distinct sociodemographic and clinical profile for the subgroups of men who engage in different fertility-related behaviors. Multivariate analysis results show that men most likely to be concerned with banking sperm are those who at diagnosis are younger (less than 35 years), childless, college educated, and whose relationships have become strained. Men who sought fertility tests were childless, college graduates, and able to ejaculate. The only factor predicting adoption was childlessness. Those married men attempting to father children were also less than 35 years of age at diagnosis and without ejaculatory dysfunction. The men at greatest risk for continued distress about infertility were those who remained childless and had posttreatment ejaculatory dysfunction. Residual infertility distress also was significantly associated with treatments that included extensive retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) surgery, indicating that the latter is a ""risk factor"" in survivors' long-term distress. These data, while not definitive, show that the prerogative to have children is very important to men and that losing it sets into motion a range of both adverse emotions and adaptive responses. Adjustment to infertility is a complex process that begins at diagnosis and extends long after treatment is completed.","['Rieker, P P', 'Fitzgerald, E M', 'Kalish, L A']","['Rieker PP', 'Fitzgerald EM', 'Kalish LA']","['Division of Cancer Control, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption/psychology', 'Adult', 'Attitude', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Fathers/psychology', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/etiology/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', '*Social Adjustment', 'Sperm Banks', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*complications/psychology']",,,,,,,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Feb;8(2):347-55. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.2.347.,,,,['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.2.347 [doi]'],['CA 06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Ninety-seven new patients with entry complaints of abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, or both underwent full evaluation by board-certified or -eligible gastroenterologists in an outpatient setting. The independent measures were 6 questionnaires concerning anxiety, depression, stress, lack of social support, somatization, and abnormal illness behavior. The dependent measure, irritable bowel syndrome, was defined as the absence of an organic disease explanation for patients' entry complaints. Two other board-certified gastroenterologists, independent of the study, made this determination. Their rating was based on full review of transcripts of patients' clinic visits, laboratory data, and the results of a 9-mo telephone follow-up to patients and their physicians. Sixty-five percent of the sample had no organic disease explanation for the entry symptoms, thereby representing irritable bowel syndrome. The psychosocial predictors did not show a significant association with irritable bowel syndrome; the power of the study was 0.86. Post hoc analysis revealed that patients with organic disease, as well as patients with irritable bowel syndrome, had significantly more (p less than 0.01) psychosocial abnormality than normal subjects, which likely contributed to the inability of the psychosocial predictors to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease. It was concluded that psychosocial criteria were of limited value in differentiating irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease but that they were determinants of health care seeking for the entire study group.","['Smith, R C', 'Greenbaum, D S', 'Vancouver, J B', 'Henry, R C', 'Reinhart, M A', 'Greenbaum, R B', 'Dean, H A', 'Mayle, J E']","['Smith RC', 'Greenbaum DS', 'Vancouver JB', 'Henry RC', 'Reinhart MA', 'Greenbaum RB', 'Dean HA', 'Mayle JE']","['Department of Medicine, Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, East Lansing.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,AIM IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Colonic Diseases, Functional/diagnosis/*psychology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Sick Role']",,,,,,,1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 1990 Feb;98(2):293-301. doi: 10.1016/0016-5085(90)90817-k.,,,,"['0016-5085(90)90817-K [pii]', '10.1016/0016-5085(90)90817-k [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

One strength of such an interpretive approach which seems especially important in this context, is that, although the researcher provides an account of the beliefs and actions of other people, the exercise is undertaken with an awareness that the interpretation is itself a product of particular historical and cultural determinants.Cultures, including those of industrial-capitalistic societies like Sweden, form systems of meanings which provide explanations of how the world works, of what is thought of as real and what is designated as natural and inevitable as well as what is morally right. These meanings link people to one another and form the basis for social action. It is thus within this framework that the notion of risk and safety get their content and meaning.In this line of thought a description is provided of what happens when people meet in joint health care encounters where their interests do not coincide, their understanding of what is going' on is not the same, or their expectations of what the other should or should not do differ. How considerations of safety and risk in our health care may be interpreted by people with other health theories and views or other understandings about such things as what life is, what is a person, what is good health, a good life or a normal body, and what death means, are also discussed. An attempt is made to profile the need to define variations in the notions of risk and safety in health care over cultural boundaries with examples from cross-cultural studies.","['Sachs, L']",['Sachs L'],"['Department of International Health Care Research (IHCAR), Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int J Risk Saf Med,The International journal of risk & safety in medicine,9100907,,,,,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['2013/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Int J Risk Saf Med. 1990;1(4):255-65. doi: 10.3233/JRS-1990-1402.,,,,"['R7030T2W37667536 [pii]', '10.3233/JRS-1990-1402 [doi]']",,,,,,10.3233/JRS-1990-1402 [doi],,,,,

Yet spiritual aspects of addiction and recovery remain virtually unstudied, despite the fact that spirituality is given central importance in Alcoholics Anonymous and in the lives of many individuals. Traditional spiritual concepts have been relabelled to remove their transcendent dimension, and addiction researchers have acted as though spirituality plays no role in the lives of those they study. Consequently an entire class of potentially important variables is being overlooked. A majority of variance in addictive behaviors and treatment outcomes remains unexplained, a portion of which might be accounted for through the study of spiritual dependent, moderator, and independent variables. Behavioural scientists have begun to acknowledge the role of complex spiritual, moral, and decisional processes in the addictive behaviours. Though uncomfortable in some ways for both believers and unbelievers, the scientific study of spiritual processes may improve our understanding of the addictive behaviours, and our ability to prevent and treat these enduring problems.","['Miller, W']",['Miller W'],"['University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87131, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Drug Alcohol Rev,Drug and alcohol review,9015440,,,,,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Alcohol Rev. 1990;9(3):259-66. doi: 10.1080/09595239000185341.,,,,"['H9237X606552721L [pii]', '10.1080/09595239000185341 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

In order to change their behaviour its determinants must be known. The pretest of a multicentre evaluation study with 558 participating insulin treated patients with diabetes was analysed to test the usefulness of the attitude-behaviour theory of Fishbein & Ajzen in explaining and possibly changing diabetes related active self-care behaviour. The theory of Fishbein & Ajzen is based on the assumption that human behaviour is reasoned behaviour. The theory views a person's intention as the immediate determinant of action. Determinants of intention are attitude and social norm. The results showed that the attitude was the most important determinant of active self-care, while a sufficient level of knowledge and a low orientation on the powerful others health locus of control scale were prerequisites for a positive attitude. The influence of the social environment was detrimental; although people tried to motivate patients to active self-care, they could not provide any real help in performing this desired behaviour. According to the results of this study, diabetes education should first aim at improving the level of knowledge and the health locus of control of the patients and second, at a positive attitude to active self-care.

Current controversies in the British debate about health.,373-92,"This article uses the current controversies in the British debate about health to illustrate the need to theorize, and therefore critically evaluate, the links between medicine and health policies, including health care policies. The medical model of health is deeply embedded in institutional practices in many countries, and while this model has attracted deserved criticism in recent years, an alternative social model, or one that incorporates indispensable aspects of the medical model, has attracted much less attention and requires sustained development. Comparative study of patterns of inequality in health, and especially of the correlation between material deprivation and premature mortality, necessarily reveals causal determinants of both health and ill-health in populations and invites ambitious programs to develop a social model.","['Townsend, P']",['Townsend P'],"['Department of Social Policy and Social Planning, University of Bristol, England.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Health Serv,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1305035,IM,"['Delivery of Health Care/*standards/trends', 'Health Policy/*trends', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Social Responsibility', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'State Medicine/*standards', 'United Kingdom']",,,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Health Serv. 1990;20(3):373-92. doi: 10.2190/9Q6H-2KE7-X6FN-3DK8.,,,,['10.2190/9Q6H-2KE7-X6FN-3DK8 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Significant depressive symptoms were reported by 20 percent of spouses. Symptom severity was not correlated with age, sex, or occupation of the spouses, nor with level of depression or functional impairment of the dialysis patients. The amount of social support received from the ill partner accounted for 37 percent of the variance in spouse depression, while social and financial stressors reported by the spouse explained 13 percent of the variance in spouse symptoms. These findings suggest that depressive symptoms in spouses of dialysis patients are associated with the social and economic consequences of the illness for the family but even more so with the amount of perceived support from the patient.

The current crisis involving traditional control/eradication methods has broadened the search for feasible and effective malaria control strategies--a search that necessarily includes an investigation of the roles of a series of individual and community-level socioeconomic characteristics in determining malaria prevalence rates, and the proper methods of estimating these links. In addition, social scientists and policy makers alike know very little about the economic costs associated with malarial infections. In this paper, I use survey data from several Brazilian gold mining areas to (a) test the general reliability of malaria-related questionnaire response data, and suggest categorization methods to minimize the statistical influence of exaggerated responses, (b) estimate three statistical models aimed at detecting the socioeconomic determinants of individual malaria prevalence rates, and (c) calculate estimates of the average cost of a single bout of malaria. The results support the general reliability of survey response data gathered in conjunction with malaria research. Once the effects of vector exposure were controlled for, individual socioeconomic characteristics were only weakly linked to malaria prevalence rates in these very special miners' communities. Moreover, the socioeconomic and exposure links that were significant did not depend on the measure of malaria adopted. Finally, individual costs associated with malarial infections were found to be a significant portion of miners' incomes.","['Vosti, S A']",['Vosti SA'],"['International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington, DC 20036-1998.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Brazil/epidemiology', '*Gold', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Malaria/diagnosis/*economics/epidemiology', '*Mining', 'Prevalence', 'Recurrence', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1990;30(10):1097-105. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(90)90296-5.,['7440-57-5 (Gold)'],,,['10.1016/0277-9536(90)90296-5 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the popular view that exercise participation has increased in recent years, estimates of trends in physical activity in Australian (and other) populations have been difficult to interpret because of the different measurements and surveys used. We examined data from population surveys using well validated, standardised methods to assess exercise participation, through National surveys between 1984 and 1987 conducted by the Commonwealth Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT). Over the period in which the surveys were conducted, there appears to have been a slight increase in the proportion of Australians who participated in regular physical activity. There was a significant decline in the proportion who reported being totally sedentary--from 32.9 per cent in 1984 to 25.4 per cent in 1987. The data from all of the surveys were then pooled to give an overall sample size of 17053, and socio-demographic variables were examined in relation to exercise participation.

Morphological abnormalities are particularly apparent in the temporal lobe and on the left side of the brain, and in a number of studies significant diagnosis x side interactions have been detected. Such interactions suggest an intimate relationship between the disease process and the mechanisms that determine asymmetrical brain development. These mechanisms presumably relate to the human capacity for speech and communication, and they may have played a critical role in the evolution of the human brain. A candidate locus for an asymmetry determinant and the psychosis gene within the exchange region of the sex chromosomes is proposed.

Skinfold thicknesses were found to increase with age almost linearly in women, while in men they increased only before age 40 to 45. Subcutaneous fat was, but fat distribution was not, highly correlated with relative weight in both sexes. Alcohol consumption, healthy dietary habits (inversely), and exercise (inversely) were all significantly related to subcutaneous fat in men, while the relatively strongest predictors of female skinfold thicknesses were smoking (inversely), coffee consumption, and education (inversely). In multivariate analysis, environmental factors explained up to 10% of skinfold variance in male subjects and between 10 and 15% in females. Fat distribution was more influenced by environmental factors in men (about 8% of explained variance) than in women (about 4%). In men, truncal fat depended more on lifestyle that did upper arm fat, with smoking (directly) and exercise (inversely) being relatively most predictive of abdominal fat. We conclude that, although relative weight, subcutaneous fat, and fat distribution correlate intra-individually, they are not equivalent and interchangeable anthropometric characteristics. This is reflected by the varying associations of the three fatness indicators with age and environmental factors such as smoking, diet, exercise, and education. Gender seems to be an important modifying factor of environment-body fat-associations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Puig, T', 'Marti, B', 'Rickenbach, M', 'Dai, S F', 'Casacuberta, C', 'Wietlisbach, V', 'Gutzwiller, F']","['Puig T', 'Marti B', 'Rickenbach M', 'Dai SF', 'Casacuberta C', 'Wietlisbach V', 'Gutzwiller F']","['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Zurich.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Soz Praventivmed,Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,7502479,IM,"['*Adipose Tissue', 'Adult', 'Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', '*Body Weight', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Switzerland', 'Urban Population']",,,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soz Praventivmed. 1990;35(6):193-200. doi: 10.1007/bf01369085.,,,,['10.1007/bf01369085 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The transition to PPS provided an opportunity to evaluate whether hospital ownership differences affected responses to a payment system which encouraged institutional intervention in the practice of medicine. A case study approach was used to observe the influence of the then largest for-profit hospital corporation upon physicians' medical practice in four owned hospitals. Findings indicated that HCA hospital managers were most directly influenced by the local competitive environment and their own personal agendas in responding to PPS incentives. Corporate influence actually softened payment system incentives to intervene in medical practice by providing a generous supply of capital, and by fostering a corporate culture conducive to cooperative relationships with physicians. Better public understanding of the determinants of hospital behavior is needed to preserve or enhance important social goals such as the physician-patient relationship; easily measurable characteristics such as ownership or bed size explain little about hospital behavior or motivation.","['Campbell, P', 'Kane, N M']","['Campbell P', 'Kane NM']",['Harvard School of Public Health.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Health Polit Policy Law,"Journal of health politics, policy and law",7609331,IM,"['Economic Competition/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Proprietary/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Income/statistics & numerical data', 'Multi-Institutional Systems/*organization & administration', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Ownership', 'Physician Incentive Plans/standards', '*Physician-Patient Relations', 'Prospective Payment System/*organization & administration', 'Tennessee', 'United States']",,,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Health Polit Policy Law. 1990 Fall;15(3):591-605. doi: 10.1215/03616878-15-3-591.,,,,['10.1215/03616878-15-3-591 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Using data from the 1987 Montana American Indian Health Risk Assessment, we found that the fertility of American Indians in Great Falls and on the Blackfeet Reservation was similar to blacks in the U.S. and relatively high when compared with fertility of whites in the United States. The influence of the direct determinants of fertility (nuptiality, contraceptive use, and lactation) was very different for the populations examined in this study. Great Falls American Indians and the U.S. black population were similar regarding age at first sexual intercourse (very young), breastfeeding (low prevalence and short duration), planning status of pregnancies (high unplanned), and contraceptive use (only moderate use). In contrast, Blackfeet women on the reservation and the U.S. white population married relatively late, had very high contraceptive use, used effective methods of contraception, and had moderately high levels of breastfeeding. However, Blackfeet fertility was much higher than that of whites. Three interrelated reasons are suggested as possible explanations. Blackfeet couples either wanted high fertility, were relatively poor users of family planning methods, or used less effective methods until they had exceeded their desired family size after which time they turned to sterilization. These finds raise numerous questions concerning the social and economic factors that may account for these group similarities and differences. Further studies with much larger data sets are needed to address these issues adequately.","['Warren, C W', 'Goldberg, H I', 'Oge, L', 'Pepion, D', 'Friedman, J S', 'Helgerson, S', 'La Mere, E M']","['Warren CW', 'Goldberg HI', 'Oge L', 'Pepion D', 'Friedman JS', 'Helgerson S', 'La Mere EM']","['Division of Reproductive Health, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Soc Biol,Social biology,0205621,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Birth Rate', 'Female', '*Fertility', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Indians, North American/*statistics & numerical data', 'Montana', 'Pregnancy', '*Social Environment']",,,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Biol. 1990 Spring-Summer;37(1-2):69-83. doi: 10.1080/19485565.1990.9988748.,,,,['10.1080/19485565.1990.9988748 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Stratifying two international samples of 128 and 163 countries into levels of health development--groups with similar health status profiles--improves the results of regression analyses used to identify economic, political, social, educational, health and other health determinants. For this reason, health development levels are a systematic framework for delineation of health determinants. Earlier large scale statistical studies have been limited in their success in part because they did not partition their data sets prior to analysis, or used inappropriate criteria that blurred rather than heightened developmental differences in underlying social systems. These developmental differences regulate the way in which health status inputs are converted into health status outputs, defining the relative importance of health determinants at various developmental levels. At lowest health development levels (countries with poorer health status), the under-development of economic, health and educational infrastructures creates a vacuum which allows international intervention (aid, investment, export/import activities) to play a dominant role in health status determination. At middle health development levels, health and educational infrastructures are better developed, but still secondary in importance as health status determinants to basic economic infrastructure. Demographic problems are particularly apparent at these levels. At higher health development levels, education, women's status, and political structure are especially important health status determinants. This research has facilitated the identification of health status determinants for use in health policy analysis. Recommendations for future research include use of findings in health policymaking by individual countries and by comparative researchers, and development of appropriate health systems models for each level of health development.","['Hunter, S S']",['Hunter SS'],"['Institute of Statistics and Applied Economics, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Cross-Cultural Comparison', '*Health Policy', 'Health Services Research/*methods', '*Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Life Expectancy', 'Models, Statistical', 'Mortality']",,,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1990;31(4):433-44. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(90)90038-t.,,,,['10.1016/0277-9536(90)90038-t [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The review is organized around psychological, social, and health factors as antecedents or correlates of similar categories of outcomes for caregivers. While there are some emerging relationships involving caregiver burden, depression, and psychological well-being, it is difficult to generalize about the determinants or correlates of the consequences of meeting caregiver responsibilities; this difficulty probably results from a failure to deal adequately with key concepts and circumstances of the caregiver.

Recent studies do not support the finding of Masters and Johnson (1966) that there is a mid-trimester rise in sexual responsiveness. Sexual behaviour decreases towards the end of pregnancy and a number of studies have found that in the majority of mothers there is only a slow return to pre-pregnancy levels in the first postnatal year. Some of the factors influencing the rate of return are discussed. Breast-feeding is important because of the hormonal changes it produces and it has been said to stimulate sexual feelings in both mother and baby. There is some evidence that breast-feeding has an adverse effect on sexuality in the first postnatal year. It is not clear whether this could be related to differences in hormone levels or differences in feeding behaviour. Fatigue and contraception have largely been ignored in studies of factors influencing postnatal sexual behaviour. Women who went on to breast-feed were found to be very similar on antenatal measures of sexual behaviour to those who went on to bottle-feed. The method of feeding is the major influence on the hormonal status, and the experience of painful intercourse reported by breast-feeding mothers may be related to low oestrogen levels.

These are mainly generalized attitudes of persons toward self and their environment (e.g. optimism, internal locus of control, self-efficacy, commitment).

DESIGN: The study was a survey of data derived from the General Household Surveys conducted by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS). SETTING: The OPCS data are derived from samples of households throughout Great Britain. PARTICIPANTS: OPCS data for 1983 and 1984 were used, comprising approximately 60,000 individuals, of whom 793 were single mothers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five different health outcomes were examined, two on perceived morbidity and three on the use of health services. The chief determinants of health and health services use among single mothers were housing tenure, employment status and the age of the youngest child. Single mother status did not consistently contribute to self reported morbidity and uptake of care when adjusted for other social variables, but there was a difference between categories of single mother, with those who were separated/divorced and those who were widowed reporting more acute illness than those who were married. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that single mothers do not form a homogeneous group and that, if special consideration is to be given to them when planning and allocating health service resources, this needs to be taken into account in the context of other socioeconomic factors.","['Beatson-Hird, P', 'Yuen, P', 'Balarajan, R']","['Beatson-Hird P', 'Yuen P', 'Balarajan R']","['Epidemiology and Public Health Research Unit, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Health Services/*statistics & numerical data', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Marriage', 'Middle Aged', 'Morbidity', '*Mothers', '*Single Parent', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United Kingdom']",,,,,,,1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1989 Dec;43(4):385-90. doi: 10.1136/jech.43.4.385.,,,,['10.1136/jech.43.4.385 [doi]'],,,PMC1052879,,,,,,,,

A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour.","['Lydeard, S', 'Jones, R']","['Lydeard S', 'Jones R']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J R Coll Gen Pract,The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,7503107,IM,"['Anxiety/etiology', 'Dyspepsia/complications/etiology/*psychology/therapy', 'Educational Status', '*Family Practice', 'Female', '*Health Behavior', 'Humans', '*Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sampling Studies', 'Social Class', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J R Coll Gen Pract. 1989 Dec;39(329):495-8.,,,,,,,PMC1712216,,,,,,,,

It has been reasoned that the intensity of sperm competition may be reflected in the relative testicular sizes of animals. Among males residing in multimale breeding systems, testicular size is relatively larger than among males residing in unimale mating systems. Information on whether differences in testicular size within a species can account for differences in male reproductive success is unavailable for natural populations of primates. A population of six troops of savanna baboons in Kenya was surveyed for morphometric analysis, and one of these troops was the subject of extensive behavioral observations afterwards. Testicular weights could not be obtained, but measurements of linear dimensions were transformed into volumetric estimates. Male weight accounted for 30% of the variance in testicular volume. Neither body size nor testicular volume was associated with differences in male reproductive activity. The outcome of fights over access to females could not be related to male body size, and ejaculatory patterns of males were independent of testicle size. Both sperm competition and aggressive competition intensified during the four-day optimum conception period, but fights over access to consort females were infrequent. Among savanna baboons, the probability of an ejaculation resulting in a conception is fairly low, which may account for the infrequency of injurious fights. Although testicle size influences sperm production, it does not influence either the timing of mating or the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa, and both of these factors probably account for a substantial fraction of the variance in male baboon paternity. Sperm competition is an adjunct to agonistic competition as a mechanism affecting male baboon reproductive success. It is concluded that male reproductive success in baboons is affected more by social factors than by morphological traits associated with size.","['Bercovitch, Fred B']",['Bercovitch FB'],"['Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, 1223 Capitol Court, Madison, WI, 53715.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Evolution,Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,0373224,,,,,,,,,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['1988/03/02 00:00 [received]', '1989/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Evolution. 1989 Nov;43(7):1507-1521. doi: 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1989.tb02600.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1558-5646.1989.tb02600.x [doi]'],,,,['(c) 1989 The Society for the Study of Evolution.'],,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1989.tb02600.x [doi],,,,,

Differences in stature between the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the reference populations were minor prior to adolescence and could be entirely attributed to the greater poverty of Mexican-Americans. However, differences increased during adolescence (ie, median stature was less than the 25th percentile of the NCHS reference population at 17 years of age) and, in contrast with earlier ages, were independent of poverty. Similar growth patterns were observed in samples of upper-class subjects from Mexico and Guatemala. Nonetheless, the extent to which the short stature of Mexican-American adolescents is genetic is unclear because there is an apparent time trend toward greater stature in the Mexican-American population. In conclusion, the NCHS reference curves are appropriate growth standards for preadolescent Mexican-American children. Whether they are valid for Mexican-American adolescents remains unclear.","['Martorell, R', 'Mendoza, F S', 'Castillo, R O']","['Martorell R', 'Mendoza FS', 'Castillo RO']","['Food Research Institute, Stanford University, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,AIM IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Height/genetics', 'Body Mass Index', 'Body Weight/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Growth/genetics', 'Guatemala', '*Hispanic Americans', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mexico/ethnology', 'Poverty', 'Social Class']",,,,,,,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 1989 Nov;84(5):864-71.,,,,,['MCJ-060518-01-0/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

This emphasis served us reasonably well when morbidity was high throughout society and when interventions at the community level were able to achieve massive reductions. It is not faring as well now that the major shared environmental determinants of disease have been controlled. The present situation calls for changes in individual health-related behaviour and individual clinical interventions to achieve comparable progress. As difficult to win as collective commitments to community-level interventions have been, compliance in a free society by often unmotivated persons in numerous individual instances of decision making in daily life is even more difficult. Health promotion offers the promise of a quantum leap in improving the health status of the community by participating in behaviour perceived as not only responsible but appropriate and desirable, providing positive reinforcement rather than anxiety-provoking caution. Favourable social trends, such as physical conditioning and dietary changes may be encouraged through media interventions. There are biological limitations to this approach, however. Many healthful practices confer little benefit on large groups of people and a few may be harmful to selected groups. Vigorous promotion of weight reduction and obesity control, for example, may lead to profound dissatisfaction with body image and to severely self-destructive behaviour among those prone to eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, and obsessive eating. Health promotion activities may fit well with social trends but their adverse potential can be aggravated because failure to comply can be penalized by peer disapproval in a way that disease prevention strategies usually are not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Guidotti, T L']",['Guidotti TL'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Can J Public Health,Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,0372714,IM,"['*Health Behavior', 'Health Promotion/methods/*trends', 'Humans', '*Patient Participation', 'Quality of Life', 'Social Behavior']",,,,,,,1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Can J Public Health. 1989 Nov-Dec;80(6):400-5.,,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the children of the wealthier families are taller and heavier than the children measured 20 years ago at the same location, whereas the poorer children are not.

A factor analysis of six CT measurements yielded two significant factors. One factor reflected multisite neural deficits as evidenced by abnormality of the cerebellar vermis and widening of the sylvian and interhemispheric fissures and cortical sulci. The other factor reflected periventricular damage as evidenced by enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles. Because all of the subjects had schizophrenic mothers, the major source of genetic variation is contributed by the diagnostic status of their fathers. In a stepwise multiple-regression analysis, it was determined that the multisite neural deficits factor was significantly related to genetic risk for schizophrenia (as measured by schizophrenia spectrum illness in the subjects' fathers) but was unrelated to pregnancy or delivery complications or to weight at birth. Periventricular damage was highly and significantly correlated with the number of complications suffered at delivery, but only among subjects with an elevated genetic risk. Although limited by a small sample size, these results suggest that the two types of CT abnormalities in schizophrenia may reflect partially independent processes based on different combinations of genetic and perinatal influences.","['Cannon, T D', 'Mednick, S A', 'Parnas, J']","['Cannon TD', 'Mednick SA', 'Parnas J']","['Social Science Research Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Gen Psychiatry,Archives of general psychiatry,0372435,AIM IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Birth Weight', 'Brain/*diagnostic imaging', 'Brain Diseases/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Denmark', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Obstetric Labor Complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*genetics', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,,,,,,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1989 Oct;46(10):883-9. doi: 10.1001/archpsyc.1989.01810100025005.,,,,['10.1001/archpsyc.1989.01810100025005 [doi]'],"['1 K05 MH 00619-01/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', '5 R01 MH 37692-02/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Findings suggest that there is a relation between exposure to both acute and chronic war events and coronary artery disease in this patient population. The reporting of exposure to acute war events was significantly higher in cases compared with both visitor controls (odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.17-4.90) and arteriographic controls (OR = 2.8, 95% Cl 0.93-8.47).

The relation observed between wartime stress and coronary artery disease could not be explained by possible overreporting of stressful events in patients with suspected coronary artery disease or by an increase in clinical awareness for the disease for those under continuous stress.

The sample of 150 subjects was drawn from 2 populations of persons with chronic low back pain: 87 individuals who were receiving care at a university low back pain clinic, and 63 individuals who had applied for (but not yet received) Social Security compensation on the basis of low back pain. All subjects had worked at least 3 months prior to their latest unemployment period and were currently out of work. Initial assessment included a medical history, physical examination, biomechanical testing, psychiatric interview, and MMPI testing. All subjects were followed up 6 months later to determine whether they had returned to work. Cross-sectional group comparisons at the time of initial assessment showed that, after controlling for the effects of age, the two samples differed on several physical and biomechanical measures, the Social Security group reflecting a more chronic picture. Group differences on physical variables were found, but most significant differences disappeared when adjusted for length of time out-of-work. Longitudinal analyses showed that few objective physical or biomechanical measures were associated with return-to-work at 6 months, while a number of psychosocial variables were significant predictors of 6-month work status. The data suggest that exclusive reliance on the physical examination to determine level of disability, without consideration of psychosocial conditions, and without adjusting for the confounding effects of age and length of time out-of-work, is not empirically justified. Logistic regression analysis was used to ascertain the relative contribution of each predictor to outcome and to illustrate the hypothetical effects of changes in the levels of selected risk factors on the likelihood of return-to-work. Implications for interventions with low back pain patients are discussed and future research directions suggested.","['Gallagher, R M', 'Rauh, V', 'Haugh, L D', 'Milhous, R', 'Callas, P W', 'Langelier, R', 'McClallen, J M', 'Frymoyer, J']","['Gallagher RM', 'Rauh V', 'Haugh LD', 'Milhous R', 'Callas PW', 'Langelier R', 'McClallen JM', 'Frymoyer J']","['Department of Psychiatry, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pain,Pain,7508686,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Back Pain/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Employment', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lumbosacral Region', 'MMPI', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', 'Social Behavior']",,,,,,,1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pain. 1989 Oct;39(1):55-67. doi: 10.1016/0304-3959(89)90175-9.,,,,"['0304-3959(89)90175-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3959(89)90175-9 [doi]']",['BRSG5-23325/RS/DRS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cross sectional study of children aged 5.0-7.0 years who had blood pressure measurements and for whom parental questionnaires were completed. SETTING: School based survey. SUBJECTS: 3591 Children aged 5.0-7.5 years selected by stratified random sampling of primary schools in nine British towns (response rate 72%); 3591 were examined and their parental questionnaires were completed. Data were complete for birth rank in 3559, maternal age in 3542, maternal history of hypertension in 3524, and paternal history in 2633. RESULTS: Birth weight was inversely related to mean systolic blood pressure but only when standardised for current weight (weight standardised regression coefficient -1.83 mm Hg/kg (95% confidence interval -1.31 to -2.35). Mean diastolic pressure was similarly related to birth weight. Maternal age, birth rank, and a parental history of hypertension were all related to blood pressure. After standardisation for current weight a 10 year increase in maternal age was associated with a 1.0 mm Hg (0.4 to 1.6) rise in systolic pressure; first born children had systolic blood pressure on average 2.53 mm Hg (0.81 to 4.25) higher than those whose birth rank was greater than or equal to 4; and a maternal history of hypertension was associated with a systolic pressure on average 0.96 mm Hg (0.41 to 1.51) higher than in those with no such history. The effects described were largely independent of one another and of age and social class. The relation for birth rank was, however, closely related to that for family size. CONCLUSIONS: Influences acting in early life may be important determinants of blood pressure in the first decade. The relation between birth weight and blood pressure may reflect the rate of weight gain in infancy. The reasons for the relation with birth rank and maternal age are unknown; if confirmed they imply that delayed motherhood and smaller family size may be associated with higher blood pressure in offspring.","['Whincup, P H', 'Cook, D G', 'Shaper, A G']","['Whincup PH', 'Cook DG', 'Shaper AG']","['Department of Clinical Epidemiology and General Practice, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,AIM IM,"['Birth Order', 'Birth Weight', '*Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/genetics', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Random Allocation', 'United Kingdom']",,,,,,,1989/09/02 00:00,1989/09/02 00:01,['1989/09/02 00:00'],"['1989/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMJ. 1989 Sep 2;299(6699):587-91. doi: 10.1136/bmj.299.6699.587.,,,,['10.1136/bmj.299.6699.587 [doi]'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,PMC1837466,,,,,,,,

Better understanding of this complex association could help elucidate the pathophysiology of essential hypertension.","['Trevisan, M', 'Krogh, V', 'Dorn, J', 'De Santo, N G']","['Trevisan M', 'Krogh V', 'Dorn J', 'De Santo NG']","['Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, State University of New York, Buffalo 14214.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Nephrol,Seminars in nephrology,8110298,IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Child', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*metabolism', 'Lithium/metabolism', 'Sodium/*metabolism']",,,,,,,1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Nephrol. 1989 Sep;9(3):253-9.,"['9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)']",,78,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few would doubt that the emotional climate and the development of trusting relationships to significant others, in the first year of life, are essential determinants of the healthy personality. Hence the quality of the day care experience of small children is an essential area of study for the child psychiatrist which is as yet insufficiently recognized.

One plausible biological mechanism suspected of contributing to increased risk of CHD is sympathetic nervous system-mediated hyperresponsivity to environmental stressors. The present study evaluated cardiovascular reactivity among young men with high versus low Ho scores during performance of an anagram task with or without harassment. Compared to performing the task alone, harassment led to increased cardiovascular arousal that was more pronounced for the high Ho subjects than the low Ho subjects. Moreover, harassment produced increases in self-rated anger, irritation, and tension, but it was only among those subjects with high Ho scores that increased anger and irritation were associated with enhanced cardiovascular arousal. While suggesting a role for anger- and irritation-induced cardiovascular arousal in pathogenesis of CHD, these findings indicate that situation characteristics mediate the relationship between Ho scores and cardiovascular reactivity, and that there may be a differential biological link between anger/irritation and cardiovascular responses in men with high and low Ho scores.","['Suarez, E C', 'Williams, R B Jr']","['Suarez EC', 'Williams RB Jr']","['Department of Psychiatry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Psychosom Med,Psychosomatic medicine,0376505,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anger', '*Arousal', 'Blood Pressure', '*Conflict, Psychological', 'Coronary Disease/*psychology', 'Heart Rate', '*Hostility', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Irritable Mood', '*MMPI', 'Male', 'Problem Solving', 'Risk Factors', '*Social Environment']",,,,,,,1989/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Psychosom Med. 1989 Jul-Aug;51(4):404-18. doi: 10.1097/00006842-198907000-00004.,,,,['10.1097/00006842-198907000-00004 [doi]'],"['P01 HL036587/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'MH71487/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-HL35687/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Ethical choices often reflect personal values as well as professional role proscriptions and are difficult to resolve for a number of reasons. It often is not clear to whom the interventionist should be accountable, or what the long-range impact may be of specific programs that seem to have short-term benefit. Value clashes can occur between consultants and consultees, even when both groups believe that they represent the best interests of vulnerable client groups. Since personal values are important determinants of ethical choices, whenever possible, they should be communicated openly so community groups can understand the interventionist's values before community projects begin. It also is important to share ethical dilemmas with professional colleagues in order to provide community psychologists with constructive feedback from their professional peers, and to help others anticipate similar value conflicts in their own work. These points are illustrated by discussion of the vignettes presented by O'Neill (1989) and by additional examples drawn from my own experience.","['Heller, K']",['Heller K'],['Indiana University.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Community Psychol,American journal of community psychology,0364535,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child, Exceptional/education', '*Community Mental Health Services', '*Ethics, Professional', 'Goals', 'Humans', 'Psychology', '*Referral and Consultation', 'Residential Facilities/economics', 'Schools', 'Social Values']",,,,,,,1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Community Psychol. 1989 Jun;17(3):367-78. doi: 10.1007/bf00931045.,,,,['10.1007/bf00931045 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and six adolescents, their parents and a same-sex best friend of the adolescent each completed measures that tapped actual and perceived drinking behaviour, and normative standards for alcohol use. Of methodological interest was that adolescents of both sexes provided accurate reports of their parents' and peer's drinking, as well as drinking norms. Path analyses revealed different effects for male and female adolescents. Strongest predictors of alcohol use for males were their perceptions of their father's and mother's drinking, and their father's actual drinking. Best friend's drinking was positively related to the adolescent males' perceptions of themselves as a drinker. The single predictor of their internalized norms was the perception adolescent males had of their friend's drinking. Significantly, the adolescent male's own norms predicted how much and what they drank. For adolescent females, how much they believed their best friend drank, and their friend's normative standards, were the strongest predictors of alcohol use. Father's drinking also influenced the drinking practices of daughters, but mothers had no impact on their daughters' alcohol use. In contrast to young males, females' personal preferences or liking of alcohol successfully predicted most of their drinking behaviour.","['Wilks, J', 'Callan, V J', 'Austin, D A']","['Wilks J', 'Callan VJ', 'Austin DA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Addict,British journal of addiction,8804404,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alcohol Drinking/*psychology', 'Female', 'Gender Identity', 'Humans', '*Imitative Behavior', 'Male', '*Peer Group', 'Risk Factors', '*Social Facilitation']",,,,,,,1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Addict. 1989 Jun;84(6):619-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1989.tb03477.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1360-0443.1989.tb03477.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval.

DESIGN: Infants were participants in a prospective randomised controlled trial of feeding practices in families with a history of atopy. SETTING: Infants were recruited in two maternity hospitals in S Wales and followed up in the community for 1 year. PARTICIPANTS: Mothers of 519 infants agreed to participate, but 36 were excluded (mainly for moving home or failing to attend for follow-up), leaving 483 in the study (253 male, 230 female). Infants were followed up and examined for evidence of allergic disease at 3, 6, and 12 months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At each examination, mothers were questioned about episodes of illness in the infant, and the data presented relate to (reported and observed) eczema and nasal discharge, and (reported) wheeze, prolonged colds, diarrhoea and vomiting. Mothers kept a diary with details of feeding for the first 6 months. All homes were visited by a nurse who took samples of dust for dust mite antigen analysis. Extensive socio-demographic data were collected. None of the factors studied showed a convincing relationship with eczema. In a multiple logistic regression analysis breast feeding appeared to protect against wheeze, nasal discharge, colds, vomiting and diarrhoea. Having more siblings increased the likelihood of prolonged colds, and (together with overcrowding) of wheeze and nasal discharge. Maternal smoking and low social class were associated with wheeze, and house dust antigen with prolonged colds. Respiratory symptoms were associated with some aspects of housing but these could not be distinguished clearly from other social factors. Babies born in Autumn were at increased risk of wheeze, vomiting and diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental factors play an important part in determining risk of symptoms in potentially atopic babies. These factors are in principle open to manipulation.","['Burr, M L', 'Miskelly, F G', 'Butland, B K', 'Merrett, T G', 'Vaughan-Williams, E']","['Burr ML', 'Miskelly FG', 'Butland BK', 'Merrett TG', 'Vaughan-Williams E']","['MRC Epidemiology Unit, Cardiff.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,"['Allergens/*adverse effects', 'Breast Feeding', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Diarrhea, Infantile/etiology', 'Eczema/etiology', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*etiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Random Allocation', 'Respiratory Sounds/etiology', 'Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Class', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects', 'Vomiting/etiology']",,,,,,,1989/06/01 00:00,1989/06/01 00:01,['1989/06/01 00:00'],"['1989/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1989 Jun;43(2):125-32. doi: 10.1136/jech.43.2.125.,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)']",,,['10.1136/jech.43.2.125 [doi]'],,,PMC1052814,,['J Epidemiol Community Health. 1990 Jun;44(2):174.

We used the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) to generate DSM-III and RDC diagnoses to estimate lifetime depressive disorders, and established (via corroborative reports) the likely accuracy of those data. Despite lifetime depression being a relatively common experience, no significant sex differences in depressive episodes were demonstrated, suggesting the possible irrelevance of biological factors in determining any sex difference. As there was not major social role divergence over the five year study, we interpret the lack of a sex difference as a consequence, and suggest that findings support the view that social factors are of key relevance in determining any female preponderance in depression described in general population studies.","['Wilhelm, K', 'Parker, G']","['Wilhelm K', 'Parker G']","['School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Psychol Med,Psychological medicine,1254142,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/*psychology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gender Identity', 'Humans', '*Identification, Psychological', 'Male', 'Psychological Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Concept']",,,,,,,1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Psychol Med. 1989 May;19(2):401-13. doi: 10.1017/s0033291700012447.,,,,['10.1017/s0033291700012447 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

A case is also made for continuing to incorporate the observation of individual-level behavior into any comprehensive research design.

Interaction between developmental history and behavioral context.,203-10,"Mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) inhibit their vocal behavior upon hearing the maternal alarm call of their species. The present study assesses the interaction of the ducklings' experiential history with the environment in which they are tested. If ducklings are reared and tested to the alarm call in small social groups, they respond by dramatically inhibiting their vocalizations. If, however, socially reared ducklings are tested to the alarm call individually in an open field, responsiveness drops precipitously. In addition, individually reared ducklings respond at a far greater level to the alarm call when tested individually, not in groups. Thus, there is an interaction between the rearing history and the testing environment such that the same rearing history leads to different behavioral outcomes depending on the context in which the ducklings are observed.

These findings were maintained in multiple-regression models controlling for physical health and seven demographic characteristics. Second-order regression models revealed interaction by race, employment status, and sex. Blacks showed no effect of confidant support on office visits. Poor confidant support resulted in $201 more in total charges for the unemployed (P = 0.003) versus $49 more for the employed (P = 0.15). Women with low affective support had $119 more in charges (P = 0.001) versus $16 less for men (P = 0.82). The results suggest that low functional social supports are important determinants of increased medical service utilization and that they may have differential effects by race, sex, and employment status, all of which should be considered independently in future studies.","['Broadhead, W E', 'Gehlbach, S H', 'deGruy, F V', 'Kaplan, B H']","['Broadhead WE', 'Gehlbach SH', 'deGruy FV', 'Kaplan BH']","['Department of Community and Family Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Care,Medical care,0230027,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Family Practice/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Health Services/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'North Carolina', 'Office Visits/economics/statistics & numerical data', '*Social Environment', '*Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Unemployment']",,,,,,,1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Care. 1989 Mar;27(3):221-33. doi: 10.1097/00005650-198903000-00001.,,,,['10.1097/00005650-198903000-00001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

These variables pose a challenge for behavior genetic analysis since they do not conform to the assumptions of traditional linear models. For example, there is a dependent relationship between the honors and the performance variables; one cannot obtain honors without performance. Several methods were employed to deal with these relationships, and the following conclusions appeared regardless of the method used. First, twin correlations were always high, ranging from 0.44 to 0.90 in monozygotic (MZ) twins and from 0.34 to 0.83 in dizygotic (DZ) twins.

It is suggested that the rapid increase in blood pressure observed with acculturation in this study constitutes a new dynamic model for the early phase of human essential hypertension. Analysis of data derived from this study indicates that increases in dietary sodium, weight gain and sympathetic tone (possibly reflecting acute environmental stress) are important determinants of the early blood pressure rise. It is proposed that a defence reaction occurs in response to environmental stress which maintains or increases cardiorenal sympathetic outflow, thereby overriding the negative feedback inhibition of sympathetic activity which otherwise occurs when dietary sodium is suddenly increased. The antinatriuretic response results in an early volume-dependent rise in blood pressure. We also propose that variation in individual blood pressure responses to migration may be explained not only by quantum differences in the two environmental factors, but also by a genetically-determined failure of adaptation to the combined effects of these stimuli on renal tubular reabsorption of sodium.","['Sever, P S', 'Poulter, N R']","['Sever PS', 'Poulter NR']","[""Department of Clinical Pharmacology, St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hypertens Suppl,Journal of hypertension.

Contraceptive use was recorded on a subsample of 167 mothers of 5-year old children. Following factor analyses, three variables were selected for analysis: Years of schooling of the father and the mother and the type of fuel used for cooking. Father's education and type of fuel were significantly related to maternal fertility, while only the educational attainment of the mother was related to child mortality and survival. When contraceptive use was included in the ANCOVA in the subsample, it was a significant determinant of fertility, while father's education became nonsignificant. In terms of mortality, contraceptive use was a significant determinant, while the significance of the mother's education fell to a borderline value (P = 0.084).","['Johnston, Francis E', 'Reid, William', 'de Baessa, Yetilu', 'Macvean, Robert B']","['Johnston FE', 'Reid W', 'de Baessa Y', 'Macvean RB']","['Department of Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6398.', 'Department of Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6398.', 'Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, Apartado Postal No. 82, Guatemala, Guatemala, C.A.', 'Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, Apartado Postal No. 82, Guatemala, Guatemala, C.A.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hum Biol,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,8915029,,,,,,,,,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['2017/05/18 06:00'],"['1988/05/26 00:00 [received]', '1988/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Am J Hum Biol. 1989;1(1):25-30. doi: 10.1002/ajhb.1310010107.,,,,['10.1002/ajhb.1310010107 [doi]'],,,,"['Copyright (c) 1989 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company.']",,10.1002/ajhb.1310010107 [doi],,,,,

While the recommendations of the International Conference on Population called attention to the importance of changes in population structure, this paper recommends urgent government action in planning social programs for the aged because of the greater eminence of population aging in many settings.

Subjects were 175 pregnant adolescents, ages 14 through 22, who intended to carry their pregnancies to term.

Higher levels of negative affect were related to lower levels of perceived family cohesion, independence, expressiveness, and intellectual-cultural orientation.

The study of alimentary habits of adolescents is of particular importance since these determine whether nutritional needs will be met. Whereas an epidemiologic approach seeks to determine the number, the role, and the weight of the multiple determinants of these behaviours, a psycho-social approach leads to the consideration of factors much more difficult to quantify. This paper is based on a local pilot study covering 161 male and female apprentices 15 to 21 years of age, as well as on data available from the recent literature. First, a review of common behaviours such as skipping meals, snacking between meals, and concerning food preferences and aversions is presented. We then review in greater depth two recent publications. The first concerns the attraction that soft drinks have for young people and its consequences for micronutrient balance. The second illustrates the relationship between self-body image and various adolescent attitudes and habits involving caloric restriction. Overall, it appears that data currently available to epidemiologists and ""preventologists"" concerning adolescent feeding behaviour would not allow them either to reassure those pessimists or worry those optimists whose opposing views on the subject appeared in publications prior to the 1980s. Indeed, there have been but few longitudinal studies of the kind which could let one confirm which subgroups of adolescents are truly at risk of particular health problems as a result of specific types of feeding behaviour.","['Jeanneret, O']",['Jeanneret O'],"['Institut de medecine sociale et preventive, Universite de Geneve.']",['fre'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Soz Praventivmed,Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,7502479,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Adolescent Behavior', 'Adult', 'Body Image', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutrition Surveys', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Pilot Projects', 'Self Concept', 'Switzerland']",,,,,,,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soz Praventivmed. 1989;34(2):85-93. doi: 10.1007/bf02080089.,,,,['10.1007/bf02080089 [doi]'],,Comportements alimentaires des adolescents d'aujourd'hui: aspects epidemiologiques et psychosociaux.,,,,,,,,,

Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants.

Concurrently, utilization characteristics were recorded in Belgian reference patients. With increasing acculturation the demand for preventive care decreased, vague complaints became more prevalent, the delay before consulting for a curative problem shortened and the prognosis improved. There was no correlation between the occurrence of psychological problems and acculturation but, except for 15-44 year old female migrants, the rate of social problems was negatively associated with this study factor. Migrants with an urban background consulted earlier and presented more frequently vague complaints than migrants from rural provenance. We observed no significant influence of length of residence on utilization characteristics and only a marginal influence on morbidity pattern. Although acculturation seems to be a strong determinant of the migrant's utilization pattern of primary health care services, it does not consistently lead to a decrease of utilization differentials with the Belgian reference population. This may imply that there is a need for public health interventions targeted at ethnic minorities.","['Van der Stuyft, P', 'De Muynck, A', 'Schillemans, L', 'Timmerman, C']","['Van der Stuyft P', 'De Muynck A', 'Schillemans L', 'Timmerman C']","['Department of Epidemiology, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['*Acculturation', 'Belgium', '*Emigration and Immigration', 'Female', 'Health Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Italy/ethnology', 'Male', 'Mental Health Services/statistics & numerical data', 'Morocco/ethnology', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', '*Primary Health Care', 'Turkey/ethnology']",,,,,,,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1989;29(1):53-60. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(89)90127-5.,,,,['10.1016/0277-9536(89)90127-5 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

This poses the problem of constructing a measure of longevity that: (1) will make subjects in the sample comparable regarding survival time, independent of their age and sex; (2) is suitable for long-term follow-up studies; (3) can be used to check the absence or presence of selectivity of the sample with regard to longevity; (4) improves the comparability of studies with different designs and sampling schemes; (5) can take the mortality development over time into account. An individual measure of survival time is presented that satisfies these requirements: the realized probability of dying (RPD). Its construction is described. The RPD is derived from population life tables based on age, year of birth, and sex. For each subject, the relative position on the survival curve within the birth cohort is determined. In an illustration, the RPD is applied to data from a 28-year follow-up study of the elderly in the Netherlands. A comparison is made with other survival measures commonly used in this type of study. It is concluded that the RPD is a powerful and valid measure of longevity in elderly subjects, and that it can be useful in the study of determinants of longevity.","['Deeg, D J', 'van Oortmarssen, G J', 'Habbema, J D', 'van der Maas, P J']","['Deeg DJ', 'van Oortmarssen GJ', 'Habbema JD', 'van der Maas PJ']","['Department of Public Health and Social Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Epidemiol,Journal of clinical epidemiology,8801383,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Longevity', 'Mortality', 'Netherlands', 'Probability', 'Research Design', 'Sex Factors']",,,,,,,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Epidemiol. 1989;42(6):541-9. doi: 10.1016/0895-4356(89)90150-9.,,,,"['0895-4356(89)90150-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0895-4356(89)90150-9 [doi]']",,,,,['J Clin Epidemiol. 1990;43(6):623-5.

Methodological and conceptual variations and problems in previous studies have led to considerable confusion as to the determinants of this important social problem. A more rigorous research design was used in this study than has been previously employed. Fifty-nine abused elders from a model project site for the study of elderly abuse were compared with forty-nine non-abused clients from a home care program in the same agency. Using a research instrument designed by the authors, data related to the following aspects of the lives of the elders and their caregivers were collected: psychological status, stressful life events, social networks, mutual dependency, and the nature of their relationships. The study indicates that members of abusive families are more likely to have emotional problems which contribute to interpersonal difficulties. Abused elders are not more dependent on caregivers for many of their daily needs. However, the abused elderly and their caregivers have become increasingly interdependent prior to the onset of abuse because of the loss of other family members, increased social isolation, and the increased financial dependency of the perpetrator on the elderly person.","['Godkin, M A', 'Wolf, R S', 'Pillemer, K A']","['Godkin MA', 'Wolf RS', 'Pillemer KA']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01605.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Aging Hum Dev,International journal of aging & human development,0370033,IM,"['Aged', '*Elder Abuse', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Isolation', 'Stress, Psychological']",,,,,,,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Aging Hum Dev. 1989;28(3):207-25. doi: 10.2190/WW91-L3ND-AWY3-R042.,,,,['10.2190/WW91-L3ND-AWY3-R042 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

A significantly larger proportion of the mothers of the diabetic children were older than 40 years compared to those of the referent children (33% and 24%, p = 0.01 respectively). A smaller percentage of mothers of the diabetic children had a high educational level compared to mothers of referent children (10% and 15%, p = 0.03 respectively) and 39% of the fathers of the diabetic children were manual workers compared to 31% of the fathers of referent children (p = 0.03).

Coronary heart disease (CHD), a mass disease of twentieth century industrialized society, has a predominantly environmental aetiology. Although the major biomedical risk factors appear to have been identified over the past 40 years of epidemiological research, we are not certain why CHD is now on the wane in most Western nations. In Australia, CHD death rates have, since 1968, declined much more in professional and white-collar men than in blue-collar men. Any substantial reduction in CHD rates will require a generalized population shift towards a lower CHD risk profile. Numerically, the greatest gains should come from reducing the CHD risk of the bulk of the population, who are currently at medium risk of CHD. Notions of risk need, in the first instance, to be based on up-to-date knowledge of biomedical risk factors and mechanisms in order to develop optimal intervention strategies. A population-based strategy can be achieved via community education and structural modification of the social environment. The latter approach will require public health research into broader questions of the social-environmental influences on population cardiovascular health: for example, research into the social, political, and economic determinants of national food and nutrition policies; and into the various environmental (including workplace) changes that will facilitate risk-lowering behaviour. Hopefully, intervention strategies in such areas, set within a community development context, will be developed within the incipient National Program for Better Health.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['McMichael, A J']",['McMichael AJ'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Community Health Stud,Community health studies,7808693,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Australia', 'Coronary Disease/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality/prevention & control', '*Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Control, Informal']",,,,,,,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Community Health Stud. 1989;13(1):5-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1753-6405.1989.tb00171.x.,,,42,['10.1111/j.1753-6405.1989.tb00171.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The authors emphasize the importance of epistemological analysis related to scientific and technical production. They focus on the theoretical and methodological contributions of the principal Latin American groups in the field of epidemiology, stating their main accomplishments, issues and potentials. When reviewing those conceptual and practical innovations, the authors analyse the effects of broader historical conditions on scientific work. To them, Latin American contemporary innovative epidemiological research and production have developed clearly differentiated principles, methods and technical projections which have led to a movement of critical or 'social' epidemiology. The functionalist approach of conventional epidemiology, characterized by an empiricist viewpoint, is being overcome by a more rigorous and analytical approach. This new epidemiological approach, in which the authors as members of CEAS (Health Research and Advisory Center) are working, has selectively incorporated some of the technical instruments of conventional epidemiology, subordinating them to a different theoretical and logical paradigm. The new framework of this group explains the need to consider the people's objective situation and necessities, when constructing scientific interpretations and planning technical action. In order to accomplish this goal, epidemiological reasoning has to reflect the unity of external epidemiological facts and associations, the so-called phenomenological aspect of health, with the underlying determinants and conditioning processes or internal relations, which are the essence of the health-disease production and distribution process. Epidemiological analysis is considered not only as a problem of empirical observation but as a process of theoretical construction, in which there is a dynamic fusion of deductive and inductive reasoning.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Breilh, J', 'Granda, E']","['Breilh J', 'Granda E']","['Investigadores del Centro de Estudios y Asesoria en Salud, Quito, Ecuador.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Delivery of Health Care', '*Epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Latin America', 'Social Class', '*Social Conditions', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1989;28(11):1121-7. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(89)90004-x.,,,12,['10.1016/0277-9536(89)90004-x [doi]'],,Epidemiologia y contrahegemonia.,,,,,,,,,

The present review suggests using a social epidemiological approach in a third way; to promote efforts directed toward family-oriented primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is presented which shows an association between three family social factors (marital status, family socioeconomic status, family size) and risk for cardiovascular disease. The real determinants of risk, however, may be the underlying health-related behaviors indicated by each of these factors. Evidence is also presented which shows the importance of a fourth family social factor (family age) in promoting effective health education efforts to modify risk.

This paper looks at some of the ways in which state, class and health may be related in southern Africa. The region provides useful comparisons because of the starkness of the relationships between class and race and disease patterns and health care in much of the sub-continent; the different types of state and class structure within southern Africa; and the changes in ideology and to some extent health practice which came with the political independence of some of its component parts. Using both historical and contemporary data, it pinpoints the importance of analysing the specific and changing form of the state in the different countries of the region, in order to understand the social determinants of disease and the allocation of health resources, and looks at the significance of class, race, ethnicity and gender in the incidence of health and the state's response. It highlights the specific colonial legacies, continuing imperial linkages and location of countries in the international division of labour which inhibit changes in health care. Within the region, the migrant labour system and South Africa's aggressive policies of destabilisation create particular problems for weak states and for individuals within them attempting to implement more progressive health care programmes. The paper also argues that the ideological role played by health care has to be understood, and shows the diverse uses to which it is put across the region. The paper concludes that while the position of the state in the international and regional economy, its specific form and the nature of its class relations are predictors in some sense of health and health care, a variety of micro-level political and social decisions and mediations have also to be taken into account. While most of the countries of the region are in some sense part of the 'periphery', and a product of colonialism, these labels are insufficient to explain the differences between them in terms of disease patterns and health care systems. The specificities of internal social dynamics, local class ethnic and gender struggles and political conflicts are also crucial.","['Andersson, N', 'Marks, S']","['Andersson N', 'Marks S']","['School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,E IM,"['Africa, Southern', 'Health Policy/trends', 'Health Resources/*supply & distribution', 'Humans', '*Political Systems', '*Resource Allocation', '*Social Class']",['KIE: 28755'],,,['KIE'],['Health Care and Public Health'],"['KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: health care/foreign countries', 'KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: resource allocation', 'KIE: Full author name: Andersson, Neil', 'KIE: Full author name: Marks, Shula']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1989;28(5):515-30. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(89)90104-4.,,,110,['10.1016/0277-9536(89)90104-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Patients whose attributions conformed to those of the compensatory model sought more information (F = 5.1, (P = .03), were satisfied with the information supplied (F = 3.5, P = .07), and expressed the belief that a greater percentage of prescribed medications needed to be taken if a cure was to result (F = 4.1, P = .05). Side effects were more often experienced by patients whose responsibility attributions exemplified the medical model (F = 5.09, P = .03).

Type A behavior among men was studied as a function of various occupational positions [blue-collar, white-collar, civil (public) servants, self-employed], controlling for age, educational level, marital status, and interaction effects. In those analyses it was found that the occupational position 'self-employed' was the best predictor of Type A behavior (odds ratio 3.0 compared to blue-collar employees). Since most of the employed women were white-collar employees (a very homogeneous group) Type A behavior among women was studied as a function of full-time and part-time employment, with the same control variables as were included in the analyses for men. Taking into account the statistical significant interaction effect age by employment, it could be shown that the odds of being Type A for a 50 yr old woman was 3.5 compared to a housewife at the same age.

Of the reference sample, 83.6% were using contraceptives at the time of the interview--mostly oral contraceptives (O.C.). Of the abortion sample, 90.7% said they had used contraception earlier in their reproductive life. Approximately one third conceived in spite of contraception (most frequently the condoms). O.C. was the contraceptive method used most recently (by 43.6%). Thus, a pause in an effective contraceptive often precedes an unintended pregnancy, pointing to the need for follow-up counselling when O.C. is prescribed to teenagers. Only the minority could state the total number of times they had experienced sexual intercourse. Significantly more females in the abortion sample were in an alliance with a male partner with whom they had regular sexual intercourse. However, they also reported a higher average number of different sexual partners, indicating an association between changing sexual relationships and undesired pregnancy. In the abortion sample significantly more pregnancies prior to the index pregnancy were reported during a corresponding period of risk of conception lasting only a few years. Taking the widespread use of contraception into account, it is possible that an increased fecundity might be a co-factor behind unsuccessful contraception.","['Wielandt, H', 'Hansen, U M']","['Wielandt H', 'Hansen UM']","['Department of Social Medicine, University of Odense, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,0370343,IM J,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Contraception Behavior/statistics & numerical data', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy in Adolescence', '*Pregnancy, Unwanted', '*Sexual Behavior', 'Sexual Maturation']","['PIP: 060336', 'POP: 00193904']",,,['PIP'],"['Adolescents', '*Adolescents, Female', '*Age Distribution', 'Age Factors', 'Barrier Methods', 'Behavior', '*Condom', 'Contraception', '*Contraception Failure--determinants', 'Contraceptive Methods', '*Contraceptive Usage', 'Demographic Factors', 'Denmark', 'Developed Countries', 'Europe', 'Family Planning', 'Fertility', '*Incidence', '*Iud', 'Measurement', 'Northern Europe', '*Oral Contraceptives', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Population Dynamics', '*Pregnancy, Unplanned', 'Reproductive Behavior', 'Research Methodology', 'Scandinavia', '*Sex Behavior', 'Youth']",['PIP: TJ: ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA.'],1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 1989;68(3):255-9. doi: 10.3109/00016348909020998.,,,,['10.3109/00016348909020998 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Between the early 1960s and the early 1980s, the number of governments supporting these programs increased from 7 to approximately 120. Today, 52 governments in developing countries provide support to family planning programs because of the demographic rationale, and 65 governments do so because of human rights and health considerations: The effective use of family planning significantly diminishes infant, child, and maternal mortality and morbidity. Forty-five percent of married women of reproductive age worldwide are practicing contraception today; however, 69% do so in East Asia and only 11% in Africa. Female sterilization and use of intrauterine devices are the most popular methods in developing countries, and oral contraceptives and condoms, in developed countries. Of the 400 million women of reproductive age, 140 million (35%) are relying on family planning methods requiring male cooperation and less than 60 million (15%) are using oral contraceptives. More than half of these oral contraceptive users live in four countries: the United States, Brazil, France, and the Federal Republic of Germany. On the other hand, the percentage of currently married women, aged 15 to 19 years, who have never used any form of contraception is as high as 85% to 90% in Bangladesh, Sudan, and Pakistan. In many developing countries, there is a statistically significant correlation between women's use of contraception and years of education. Other important factors influencing contraceptive prevalence include the established or perceived side effects of currently available methods, the status of women, the political climate, and a number of behavioral and social determinants.","['Diczfalusy, E']",['Diczfalusy E'],"['WHO Special Program of Research on Human Reproduction, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Int J Fertil,International journal of fertility,0374717,IM J,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Contraception/methods/*trends', 'Contraceptives, Oral/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans']","['PIP: 073487', 'POP: 00212338']",,,['PIP'],"['Contraception', '*Contraception Research', '*Contraceptive Usage', '*Demographic Factors', '*Developed Countries', '*Developing Countries', 'Economic Factors', 'Family And Household', 'Family Characteristics', '*Family Planning', 'Family Size', '*Family Size, Desired', '*Government Sponsored Programs', 'Health', '*Infant Mortality--statistics', '*Maternal Health', 'Measurement', 'Mortality', 'Organization And Administration', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', '*Population Growth', '*Prevalence', 'Programs', 'Research Methodology', '*Socioeconomic Factors', ""*Women's Status""]",['PIP: TJ: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FERTILITY.'],1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Fertil. 1989;34 Suppl:56-63.,"['0 (Contraceptives, Oral)']",,22,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon this questionable foundation he proceeds to develop his own position concerning the theory of medical science. He claims that scientific knowledge is at no time exempt from cultural, historical and social conditions, of which scientific knowledge itself is a function. These conditions find expression in the style of thought of a particular epoch (""Denkstil"") as well as in the interaction of the participating scientists (""Denkkollektiv""). Flecks merits for having explicated the conditionality of the process of scientific knowledge over against positivistic thought have been honourably elaborated in many studies. The present study offers an analysis of the manner in which the Fleck position attempts to serve as an explanation of change in the content and style of thought in history. It will be made clear that these changes and developments can only be explained as the result of the interaction and competition among the collectives of scientists and thinkers. Fleck deprives his socio-historical position of its logical foundation by radicalizing these conditions in such a manner that they become fundamental determinants of human thought generally and for the individual scientist particularly. As a consequence, from the perspective in which the thought of the individual is thus determined, he can neither establish a convincing theory for changes in thought in history nor for the human relations obtaining within the collective of scientists and thinkers.","['Neumann, J']",['Neumann J'],,['ger'],"['Biography', 'English Abstract', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Sudhoffs Arch,Sudhoffs Archiv,0240376,IM Q,"['Austria', 'Germany', 'History, 20th Century', 'Microbiology/history', 'Philosophy, Medical/*history', 'Research Design/*history', '*Systems Theory']",,,,,,,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sudhoffs Arch. 1989;73(1):12-25.,,,,,,Der historisch-soziale Ansatz medizinischer Wissenschaftstheorie von Ludwik Fleck (1896-1961).,,,,,,,['Fleck L'],"['Fleck, L']",

While insurance benefits are largely standardized, these differences are widely regarded as a problem for the state's social policy. The health insurance bodies often offer hasty interpretations to justify the differences of contribution rates. These interpretations, however, cannot be checked on the basis of data from the annual reports of the health insurance. In reality, there is a number of determinants of the contribution rate which lie as well inside as outside the sphere of influence of the health insurance bodies. In order to estimate the respective impact of single determinants it is important to differentiate the health expenditures by age and sex of all insured persons (both the contribution paying members and their co-insured dependents). A further disentanglement of health expenditures into prices, quantities and structural components allows to identify the reasons of increases in health costs. This is also a necessary precondition for creating and implementing suitable measures that are directed to control health costs. At the same time, the improved information system of the statutory health insurance would contribute to a better understanding of the performance of the health system in general.","['Jacobs, K']",['Jacobs K'],"['IGES-Institut fur Gesundheits- und Sozialforschung, Berlin (West).']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Soz Praventivmed,Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,7502479,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Cost Control', '*Fees and Charges', 'Female', 'Germany, West', 'Health Expenditures', 'Humans', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance, Health/*economics', 'Male', 'Public Policy']",,,,,,,1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soz Praventivmed. 1989;34(6):256-9. doi: 10.1007/bf02083219.,,,,['10.1007/bf02083219 [doi]'],,Determinanten der Einnahmen- und Ausgabenentwicklung in den Jahresberichten der Krankenkassen der Bundesrepublik Deutschland.,,,,,,,,,

The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods.

Health Education, or Information, Education and Communication (IEC) strategies have been developed to achieve these objectives. Yet few evaluations of health education programmes have been carried out, and the intimate relationship between AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases is often ignored. Behaviour has a multitude of determinants, and consequently no simple approach focusing on one aspect of behaviour can be expected to be successful. Not only does knowledge need to be imparted, but attitudes, beliefs, social- and peer-group norms need to be addressed. The development of IEC programmes is hampered by the specific routes of transmission of the HIV, involving sensitive areas of human behaviour, and by a lack of knowledge about these behaviours. Nevertheless, a number of seemingly successful programmes have been carried out. Active participation of the target groups appears to be a key factor in success.

A multivariate regression model is estimated for 47 states and nine years. The minimum legal driving age and curfew laws are found to be important determinants of fatalities. Driver's education and learning permits have smaller effects. The relationship between rates of licensure and driving age, education, and curfew laws is also examined. In each case, a more restrictive policy is found to reduce licensure of 15-17 year olds. The results suggest that the imposition of curfew laws and higher minimum driving ages are particularly effective traffic safety policies.","['Levy, D T']",['Levy DT'],"['Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Risk Anal,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,8109978,IM,"['Accidents, Traffic/*mortality', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age Factors', 'Automobile Driver Examination', '*Education', 'Humans', '*Legislation as Topic', 'Licensure', 'Regression Analysis', 'Social Control, Informal', 'United States']",,,,,,,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Risk Anal. 1988 Dec;8(4):569-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01200.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01200.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement.","['Weissert, W G', 'Cready, C M']","['Weissert WG', 'Cready CM']","['Department of Health Policy and Administration, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Health Serv Res,Health services research,0053006,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Diagnosis', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Female', 'Hospitals, General/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Medicaid', 'North Carolina', 'Nursing Homes/*statistics & numerical data', 'Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data', 'Pilot Projects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Support', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",,,,,,,1988/12/01 00:00,1988/12/01 00:01,['1988/12/01 00:00'],"['1988/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Serv Res. 1988 Dec;23(5):619-47.,,,,,,,PMC1065528,,,,,,,,

The problem is not that teens are sexually active but rather that they have little preparation and guidance in developing responsible sexual behavior. Developmentally, adolescents reach physical maturity before they are cognitively able to appreciate the consequences of their behavior. A teenager's primary source of information regarding sexuality is his or her peer group, all of whom are experiencing and reinforcing the same behaviors. The family, the major socializer of other behaviors, is not as powerful a force in shaping responsible sexual behavior because of parental discomfort with sex education and sexual discussions. This is the result of a social milieu in which sex is frequently portrayed but rarely linked with responsible behavior or accurate, nonjudgmental information. The pediatric practitioner is in an ideal position to intervene in these dynamics. In the office, the practitioner can provide accurate sexual information to both parents and adolescents, support parental-child communication on sexual issues, and provide appropriate services or referral. In the community, the practitioner can advocate for school-based sex education as well as act as an information resource. Finally, the practitioner can advocate for the health care needs for adolescents on a national level, supporting legislation that provides adolescents with information and access to services necessary to make responsible sexual decisions.","['Grant, L M', 'Demetriou, E']","['Grant LM', 'Demetriou E']","['Boston University School of Medicine, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Clin North Am,Pediatric clinics of North America,0401126,AIM IM J,"['Adolescent', '*Family Planning Services', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Physician-Patient Relations', '*Psychosexual Development', 'Sex Education', '*Sexual Behavior']","['PIP: 058744', 'POP: 00210351']","['Responsible teenage sexual behavior can be promoted by the pediatric practitioner', 'through contact with adolescent patients, parents, and community outreach.

The Belgian situation was investigated in detail. Increases were most pronounced in 20-24 year-old males.

Early research has indicated that the core elements involving affect, perceptual and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia are highly similar in form in most cultures of the world. Much of the cross-cultural literature emphasizes, however, strong differences in the ways in which schizophrenia is actually expressed and manifested in different settings. The basic methodology for psychiatric description and diagnosis in the WHO program was the Present State Examination. In five of the field centers a method for investigating the expressive quality and the social behavior of patients in their own communities through the eyes of significant others was applied. This method was then subjected to psychometric tests of cross-cultural applicability and found to be valid for comparing behavior across settings. The expressive patterns of the Indian and Nigerian patients were studied from two perspectives. Indian schizophrenics were described by family members as manifesting a more affective and ""self-centered"" orientation; the Nigerian patients presented with a highly suspicious, bizarre, anxious quality to the basic behavioral pattern. The main features of pathology were in general accord with the descriptions of indigenous psychiatrists. The special qualities of the psychosis in the two cultures were interpreted against the background of traditional psychopathological and anthropologic theories concerning the psychodynamics and the influence of differing social conflictual themes in the two cultures. Analysis of psychopathology in this manner was found to enhance understanding of underlying mechanisms and the role of cultural conflicts in its expression.","['Katz, M M', 'Marsella, A', 'Dube, K C', 'Olatawura, M', 'Takahashi, R', 'Nakane, Y', 'Wynne, L C', 'Gift, T', 'Brennan, J', 'Sartorius, N']","['Katz MM', 'Marsella A', 'Dube KC', 'Olatawura M', 'Takahashi R', 'Nakane Y', 'Wynne LC', 'Gift T', 'Brennan J', 'Sartorius N', 'et al.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cult Med Psychiatry,"Culture, medicine and psychiatry",7707467,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Psychometrics', 'Schizophrenia/*ethnology', 'Schizophrenic Language', '*Schizophrenic Psychology']",,,,,,,1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cult Med Psychiatry. 1988 Sep;12(3):331-55. doi: 10.1007/bf00051973.,,,,['10.1007/bf00051973 [doi]'],"['P01 MH30322/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R12 M31016/PHS HHS/United States', 'U01 MH35883/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

These results are consistent with the view that social influences are strong determinants of patterns of adolescent smoking behaviour.","['Mittelmark, M B', 'Pallonen, U E', 'Murray, D M', 'Luepker, R V', 'Pechacek, T F', 'Pirie, P L']","['Mittelmark MB', 'Pallonen UE', 'Murray DM', 'Luepker RV', 'Pechacek TF', 'Pirie PL']","['Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Department of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Scand J Prim Health Care,Scandinavian journal of primary health care,8510679,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Adolescent Behavior', 'Child', '*Decision Making', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', '*Peer Group', 'Smoking/*psychology', '*Social Behavior']",,,,,,,1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Prim Health Care. 1988 Sep;6(3):131-5. doi: 10.3109/02813438809009305.,,,,['10.3109/02813438809009305 [doi]'],"['N01-HD-9-2831/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-HL-07328/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

This paper reports a follow-up study of the same groups of students when they had reached senior years in their respective courses. While medical student conservatism on general social issues continues to be no greater than other student groups there is a marked increase in conservatism of attitudes towards government involvement in health care and regulation of costs. Attitudes to allied health professions and preventive care remain unchanged but senior medical students are significantly less likely to recognize social factors as determinants of illness than they were when they commenced the study of medicine. Specific curricular attention to social and behavioural medicine does not appear to counteract the predominantly biomedical perspective students experience in teaching hospitals, the major venue for their clinical education.","['Ewan, C']",['Ewan C'],"['School of Health Sciences, University of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Med Educ,Medical education,7605655,IM,"['*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Attitude to Health', 'Education, Medical, Undergraduate', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'New South Wales', '*Sociology, Medical', '*Students, Medical']",,,,,,,1988/09/01 00:00,1988/09/01 00:01,['1988/09/01 00:00'],"['1988/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Educ. 1988 Sep;22(5):375-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2923.1988.tb00770.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1365-2923.1988.tb00770.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Additional possibilities--living alone, living with other nuclear-family relatives, and living with others--are also recognized, providing a varied range of household-structure opportunities for older women. The approach allows us to identify individual child attributes associated with the propensity to coreside with the older unmarried mother. The results confirm earlier findings regarding the importance of income, age, and disability status as determinants of the household composition of older women. We find, however, that unmarried children, especially sons, are more likely to share a household with an elderly mother than are married children. Working reduces the likelihood that a married daughter will live with her older mother. Overall, the findings suggest that the attributes, more so than the sheer numbers, of living children influence the household structure of their mothers.","['Wolf, D A', 'Soldo, B J']","['Wolf DA', 'Soldo BJ']","['Population Program, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Demography,Demography,0226703,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*psychology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Decision Making', '*Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Probability', 'Single Person/*psychology', '*Social Environment', 'United States']",,,,,,,1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Demography. 1988 Aug;25(3):387-403.,,,,,['AGO513/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Intended respirator use was more strongly associated with beliefs than was past use. The most important beliefs concerned discomfort or inconvenience. Other determinants that were associated with respirator use were respirator availability, cigarette smoking, and social influences. It was concluded that the most effective intervention strategy to increase respirator use would be multidimensional and that efforts to change only a worker's beliefs may have limited success.","['White, M C', 'Baker, E L', 'Larson, M B', 'Wolford, R']","['White MC', 'Baker EL', 'Larson MB', 'Wolford R']","['Occupational Health Program, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Occupational Medicine', 'Paint/*adverse effects', '*Protective Devices', '*Respiratory Protective Devices', 'Smoking']",,,,,,,1988/08/01 00:00,1988/08/01 00:01,['1988/08/01 00:00'],"['1988/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 1988 Aug;14(4):239-45. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.1926.,,,,"['1926 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.1926 [doi]']","['1 RO1 CA34919-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 RO3 CA41131-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32ES07069/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In support of this proposition, the contemporary use of systems thinking in medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, family therapy, and the understanding of emotions was stressed. Emotional reactions to the evaluations of physical appearance by self and others were shown to be inevitable, involving appraisal and feedback processes affecting different systems in the person's life. The person's self-image and self-esteem were stressed as underlying determinants of outcome in health and in illness.

The main objective of the present paper is to compare samples from the three towns in terms of the factors affecting weight gain. Four hundred and thirty-nine infants were recruited at birth and home visited every 2 weeks. At each visit weight was measured and it was recorded whether any supplements had been given and whether the child had been ill. Length was measured every 4 weeks. There were significant differences between the samples from the three towns in attained weights and weight increments. Weight gains were lowest in the Khartoum North sample in the first 3 months, but from 3 to 6 months were highest, almost equalling the NCHS reference. In the Khartoum and Omdurman samples growth from 0 to 3 months exceeded the reference but from 3 to 6 months was less than the reference. Fifty per cent of infants were supplemented by 13 weeks in the Omdurman sample; the median time of supplementation in the other two samples was 17 weeks.

Differentials investigated are those by age at marriage, relative age of bride and groom, marital status prior to marriage, relative marital status of bride and groom, pregnancy status of the wife at marriage, timing of the first birth, religion, country of birth and socioeconomic status. Several findings of overseas studies, such as the special proneness to divorce of very youthful marriages and remarriages following previous divorces, are verified for New Zealand.

Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects.

Clinical pharmacokinetic considerations.,217-40,"Drugs ingested by a lactating mother would be expected to appear in human milk to some extent and be ingested by a breast-feeding infant. Drugs pass from maternal plasma into milk by passive diffusion and are distributed within the aqueous, protein and lipid phases of milk. Distribution into milk will be affected by physiochemical characteristics of the drug: acid-base characteristics, relative protein binding in plasma and milk, and lipid solubility, as well as milk composition. The milk-to-plasma concentration ratio is the most commonly quoted index of drug distribution into human milk. However, calculation of the daily infant dose of drug ingested in milk, and from this the dose in milk relative to the maternal dose on a weight-adjusted basis, is a more relevant indicator of infant exposure to a drug. This is particularly true for drugs with a high volume of distribution, for which only a small proportion of the mother's dose is contained within the plasma and available for distribution into milk. A better indication of infant exposure to a drug is the steady-state plasma drug concentration in a breast-feeding infant, the major determinants of which are the dose rate (via milk) and the oral availability and clearance in the infant. Although in neonates the rate of absorption may be different from adults, there is little evidence that its extent is significantly different. Clearance, however, is impaired in very young infants, particularly if premature. The decreased clearance would result in a proportional increase in steady-state plasma concentrations in the breast-feeding infant. Consideration of the dose ingested in milk and the approximate clearance in infants of different ages allows estimation of likely steady-state plasma concentrations in breast-feeding infants. From these considerations, recommendations regarding the safety of drugs during breast-feeding can be made. Drugs which are very toxic or have dose-independent toxicity should be considered separately. Recommendations regarding 'social' drugs such as nicotine, alcohol, caffeine and theobromine are particularly difficult, as doses are uncontrolled and vary variable.","['Atkinson, H C', 'Begg, E J', 'Darlow, B A']","['Atkinson HC', 'Begg EJ', 'Darlow BA']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Christchurch Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,IM,"['*Breast Feeding', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Milk, Human/*analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/*administration & dosage', '*Pharmacokinetics', 'Pregnancy']",,,,,,,1988/04/01 00:00,1988/04/01 00:01,['1988/04/01 00:00'],"['1988/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 1988 Apr;14(4):217-40. doi: 10.2165/00003088-198814040-00003.,['0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)'],,254,['10.2165/00003088-198814040-00003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Significant social-psychological factors at each step of the loop process contribute to the development of migration streams along a predictable pattern. The general model of the loop process shows that the migration stream is 1st sparked when labor is recruited from less developed countries for work in developed industrialized countries. Once the social process of migration has begun, it tends to acquire a self-feeding character. Social and economic change in sending and receiving societies brought about by migration make further migration more likely. The case of the Mexico-US-Mexico loop process is analyzed. This case illustrates the effects of socioeconomic stratification that occurs in communities where the migration loop process reaches a certain level of maturity. The majority of a town's population may become committed to migration as a way of life. Eventually, wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of those that are most able to migrate. Thus, migrants may become a new elite segment of rural populations that were once relatively homogenous societies. Further research of the migration loop process should be conducted. At least in the case of Mexico, the socioeconomic stratification in the villages and towns acting as sources of migration loops with destinations in the US have significant internal economic, social, and political implications.","['Garcia, P R', 'Jutila, S T']","['Garcia PR', 'Jutila ST']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int Migr,"International migration (Geneva, Switzerland)",9882227,J,"['Americas', 'Behavior', 'Central America', 'Demography', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', '*Economics', '*Emigration and Immigration', 'Income', 'Latin America', 'Mexico', '*Motivation', 'North America', 'Population', '*Population Characteristics', 'Population Dynamics', 'Psychology', '*Rural Population', '*Social Behavior', '*Social Class', '*Socioeconomic Factors', '*Transients and Migrants', 'United States']","['CPC: S-11113-040-3', 'IND: 8008082', 'POP: 00175224']",,,['PIP'],"['Americas', 'Behavior', 'Central America', 'Demographic Factors', '*Destination', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Economic Factors', 'Income', '*International Migration--determinants', 'Latin America', '*Macroeconomic Factors', 'Mexico', 'Microeconomic Factors', '*Migrants', '*Migration', '*Motivation', 'North America', '*Northern America', '*Origin', 'Population', '*Population Characteristics--changes', 'Population Dynamics', 'Psychological Factors', 'Remittances', '*Return Migration', '*Rural Population', '*Social Behavior', '*Social Class', '*Socioeconomic Factors', '*Socioeconomic Status--changes', '*Temporary Migration', 'United States']",['PIP: TJ: INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION'],1988/03/01 00:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['1988/03/01 00:00'],"['1988/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '1988/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Migr. 1988 Mar;26(1):57-69. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2435.1988.tb00611.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1468-2435.1988.tb00611.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the fact that we used a relatively wide gamut of potential determinants (such as parental age, geographic origin, occupation, current residence, or family size) of trait variability, the results of multiple regression analysis (N = 300 families) indicate an almost complete absence of significant factors and studied variables of development.

The empirical literature is reviewed to examine the structure of dental markets, to assess the major determinants of market equilibrium, and to examine the social and health consequences of dental-care markets. Results reveal that while dental markets are imperfectly competitive, it is unclear whether prices exceed competitive levels. Little is known about the effects of dental markets on public oral health and society. Future research is proposed in two broad areas: 1) updating early studies conducted when few Americans had dental insurance benefits; and 2) path-breaking research to advance our knowledge of dental-care markets in particular and medical-care markets in general.","['Grembowski, D', 'Conrad, D', 'Weaver, M', 'Milgrom, P']","['Grembowski D', 'Conrad D', 'Weaver M', 'Milgrom P']","['Department of Dental Public Health Services, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Care,Medical care,0230027,IM,"['Community Participation', 'Data Collection', 'Dental Health Services/*economics', 'Dentists/supply & distribution', '*Economic Competition', '*Economics', 'Fees, Dental', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Dental', 'Licensure, Dental', 'United States']",,,,,,,1988/02/01 00:00,1988/02/01 00:01,['1988/02/01 00:00'],"['1988/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Care. 1988 Feb;26(2):132-47. doi: 10.1097/00005650-198802000-00005.,,,91,['10.1097/00005650-198802000-00005 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Demography, ranging patterns, and activity budgets provide insight into some of the proximate determinants of fission-fusion social organization in this species and illustrate the different strategies used by males and females to gain access to critical resources. Longitudinal data on known individuals provide evidence for male natal philopatry and female emigration at sexual maturity in this population. Interbirth intervals are long (mean = 34.5 months) in comparison with most other primate species, and 5 of 15 infants seen within a few days of birth died or disappeared before they were a year old. Home ranges are large (150-250 ha) and fairly discrete; overlap with neighboring groups is on the order of 10-15%. Males and females differed substantially in their ranging patterns; females, particularly those with infants, restricted much of their ranging to a ""core area"" 20-33% the size of the total group range, whereas males ranged more evenly over the entire area occupied by the group. Daily path length varied over almost an order of magnitude from 465 m to 4,070 m, with a mean of 1977 m. Males spent more time traveling and less time feeding than most females. These results are compared with those obtained in previous studies of Ateles and with similar data from other primate species to assess their implications for the evolution of fission-fusion sociality in spider monkeys. The ecological factors responsible for the evolution of very similar social organizations in spider monkeys and chimpanzees are discussed.","['Symington, M McFarland']",['Symington MM'],"['Department of Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Primatol,American journal of primatology,8108949,IM,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ateles', 'chimpanzee', 'social organization', 'spider monkey']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['1987/09/25 00:00 [received]', '1988/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Am J Primatol. 1988;15(1):45-67. doi: 10.1002/ajp.1350150106.,,,,['10.1002/ajp.1350150106 [doi]'],,,,"['Copyright (c) 1988 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company.']",,10.1002/ajp.1350150106 [doi],,,,,

Certain anthropoid primates including rhesus monkeys do not show heat but may copulate throughout the menstrual cycle, especially when pairs are isolated from conspecifics. In social groups, however, mating mostly occurs around midcycle. We wished to test the hypothesis that copulations are more closely linked to ovulation when males have simultaneous access to several females in different cycle phases. Artificial menstrual cycles were therefore induced by giving hormones to ovariectomized female rhesus monkeys observed in small social groups that each consisted of four females and one male. The cycles of two hormone-treated femlab in each group were either made to synchronize or be offset by 7-day increments so that the estradiol peak of one female occurred 7 days before, and 7 and 14 days after, the estradiol peak of the other. Radioimmunoassay of plasma samples (N = 224) confirmed the timing of the estradiol peaks. Results from eight unique male-female groups (4 males, 8 females, 16 male-female pairs, 718 tests) fully supported the hypothesis. Compared with synchronized cycles, the amplitudes of rhythmic changes in offset cycles were reduced for ejaculations made by males but greatly enhanced for ejaculations received by females. We propose that this socio-hormonal integration of behavior in the group is highly adaptive and enhances the reproductive success of both males and females.","['Michael, Richard P', 'Zumpe, Doris']","['Michael RP', 'Zumpe D']","['Department of Psychiatry, Emory University School of Medicine and The Georgia Mental Health Institute, Atlanta.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Emory University School of Medicine and The Georgia Mental Health Institute, Atlanta.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Primatol,American journal of primatology,8108949,IM,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['behavioral rhythms', 'hormones', 'mate choice', 'menstrual cycle']",,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['2020/01/24 06:00'],"['1987/09/21 00:00 [received]', '1988/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Am J Primatol. 1988;15(2):157-170. doi: 10.1002/ajp.1350150208.,,,,['10.1002/ajp.1350150208 [doi]'],,,,"['Copyright (c) 1988 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company.']",,10.1002/ajp.1350150208 [doi],,,,,

Congenital factors include inherited characteristics and perinatal experiences. Evidence for inherited characteristics in criminal behavior is approached through family studies, the study of twins, and adoption studies. Of those three, adoption studies provide the most fertile ground for study. Predisposition toward criminal behavior is noted to be limited to property crime. The second congenital factor is the perinatal experience. Minor physical anomalies appear to be strongly related to hyperactivity and later criminal involvement, but only if the offender was reared in an unstable, nonintact family. Indices of perinatal problems relate to later violent crime, rather than to property crime, and may have as their basis some form of trauma occurring very early in life.","['Mednick, S A', 'Kandel, E S']","['Mednick SA', 'Kandel ES']","['University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90089.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Bull Am Acad Psychiatry Law,The Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,7503424,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', '*Crime', 'Female', 'Genetics, Behavioral', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Social Environment', 'Specialization', 'Twins', '*Violence']",,,,,,,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Am Acad Psychiatry Law. 1988;16(2):101-9.,,,,,['1 KO5 MH00619-01/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

To be sure, envy reactions to any patient are significant, whether they simply distort the therapist's perception or contribute to a deeper understanding of the patient. In the case of the religious patient, envy reactions in the therapist may serve as an additional instrumentality for under-standing the ways in which the dynamic determinants of religious behavior and metaphor become enmeshed in and also transform the pathology of the patient as well as the therapeutic process itself. Both the constructive and destructive object relational implications of envy must be borne in mind by the therapist in order to adequately explore the range of reciprocating forces between therapist and patient. Primitive mechanisms such as projective identification and psychotic transference are particularly prone to evoke envy reactions of surprising intensities, yet an empathic attitude will usually enable the therapist to differentiate the true source of his envy as he more carefully comprehends the quality of object relational and dynamic needs such envy serves.","['Spero, M H', 'Mester, R']","['Spero MH', 'Mester R']","['School of Social Work, Bar-Ilan University, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Psychoanal,American journal of psychoanalysis,0372630,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Conflict, Psychological', '*Countertransference', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Jealousy', 'Judaism', 'Male', 'Object Attachment', 'Professional-Patient Relations', '*Psychotherapy', '*Religion and Psychology', 'Social Isolation']",,,,,,,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Psychoanal. 1988 Spring;48(1):43-55. doi: 10.1007/bf01252921.,,,,['10.1007/bf01252921 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Meals were identified, using five different definitions, and their composition of total calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein was estimated from a computer file of the nutritive value of foods. These data were analyzed by intercorrelating meal sizes with intermeal intervals, estimated stomach contents and self-reported hunger with univariate and multiple correlation techniques. Human feeding was found to be regulated on the basis of preprandial factors; the premeal interval, estimated premeal stomach content, and self-reported hunger significantly correlating with the meal size. These correlations were significant regardless of whether the meal was evaluated as spontaneous or constrained by external factors, but were stronger when the meals occurred without other people being present. The postprandial relationship between the meal size and the duration of the postmeal interval, which is present in nonhuman species, was only present in humans when meals that were eaten alone were considered separately. This suggests that the species differences may be due to the social context of observation. The intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein was found to have a suppressive effect on subsequent intake and subjective hunger through their contributions to total food energy ingested. Protein, however, was found to suppress subsequent intake and subjective hunger independent of its contribution to total calories, suggesting that the macronutrients have differing satiating properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['de Castro, J M']",['de Castro JM'],"['Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, Atlanta 30303.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Physiol Behav,Physiology & behavior,0151504,IM,"['Adult', 'Circadian Rhythm', '*Drinking', '*Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Feeding Behavior/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hunger/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychophysiology', '*Social Environment']",,,,,,,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Physiol Behav. 1988;44(4-5):651-9. doi: 10.1016/0031-9384(88)90331-9.,,,,"['0031-9384(88)90331-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0031-9384(88)90331-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Demographic transition takes place in countries where there are effective programmes of disease control which allow for survival during the early years of childhood and adolescence. This results in an increase in life expectancy which places larger proportions of the population in the age range (60 years and older) in which chronic degenerative diseases become the major determinants of health status. Epidemiological transition in diseases may also be brought about by shifts in social and economic patterns which favour detrimental changes in risk factors for the chronic degenerative diseases. Such changes may include health-related behaviour which augments dietary consumption of fats and alcohol, increases obesity, increases smoking and decreases physical activity. Such changes in risk-factor levels increase the prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases which manifest themselves at later ages, and for which early preventive actions could be cost-effective. In order to illustrate the impact of both demographic and risk-factor effects, analyses are made of the impact of increases in life expectancy on cause-specific mortality in both developing and developed countries. It is shown that there is great similarity in the effect of major noncommunicable diseases on the life expectancy of adults in both developed and developing countries. The major differences are seen to be in the proportions of deaths expected from such diseases as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cirrhosis; but not in the distribution of age at death which is the better measure of disease impact. Demographic analyses, computing indirect estimates of mortality, also demonstrate that there are currently more chronic disease deaths in developing than developed countries and that as expectation of life increases in developing countries the global chronic disease burden will be greatly concentrated in the developing countries. Analyses of risk-factor reduction by feasible intervention strategies, e.g. smoking cessation campaigns, treatment of high blood pressure, using relationships between risk factors and diseases established in longitudinal studies carried out in developed countries, point out that the effect of risk-factor control in long-living populations can be hidden by the dependency of risk factors and various related causes of death, e.g. smoking has an impact on lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease and emphysema, but at different ages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Manton, K G']",['Manton KG'],"['Center for Demographic Studies, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,World Health Stat Q,World health statistics quarterly.

On the average, both ratings were clearly reduced compared with pre-MI levels even as long as 3-5 yr after the MI. Females and older patients indicated lower MPA before and after the MI, whereas PGH was not related to any sociodemographic variable. The severity of the MI appeared to be of relatively limited importance for self-evaluated health. Heart-related symptoms before and after the MI were more strongly related to lower MPA, whereas non-cardiac health problems and psychological distress more clearly influenced PGH.

The data show that seropositivity for HIV is not associated with elevated levels of social or emotional impairment. Clinical signs lead to impairment in baseline data, but these effects do not persist at a second wave. This weakening suggests that the effects are mediated by psychological pathways rather than biologic ones. This suspicion is confirmed in further analyses, which show that the effects of clinical signs are mediated by subjectively perceived symptoms. These results show that neither social nor emotional impairment is likely to be a prodromal sign of HIV infection in otherwise healthy homosexual men. The substantial levels of distress found among these men is more directly influenced by psychological determinants than biologic ones.

In univariate analyses the PCB concentration on fat basis was most strongly associated with pre- versus post-pregnancy weight gain, age and occupation. After multiple regression analysis PCB concentration on fat basis remained significantly associated with weight gain changes and remained borderline (p less than 0.10) significantly related with occupation. The pre-pregnancy Quetelet Index of the mother (height/weight) and the estimated PCB content of the diet (primarily fish) were strongly correlated with the PCB concentration on milk basis. Only the Quetelet Index remained significantly related after multiple regression analysis.","['Drijver, M', 'Duijkers, T J', 'Kromhout, D', 'Visser, T J', 'Mulder, P', 'Louw, R']","['Drijver M', 'Duijkers TJ', 'Kromhout D', 'Visser TJ', 'Mulder P', 'Louw R']","['Institute of Social Medicine, University of Leiden, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Acta Paediatr Scand,Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,0000211,IM,"['Adult', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactation/metabolism', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Milk, Human/*analysis', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*analysis', 'Pregnancy']",,,,,,,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr Scand. 1988 Jan;77(1):30-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1988.tb10593.x.,['DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)'],,,['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1988.tb10593.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

This paper argues that the popularity of compliance and the uncertainty over its determinants can be understood if compliance is analyzed as an ideology that assumes and justifies physician authority. I explore compliance as a problematic concept, looking at its assumptions and its influences on clinical practice. The concept of patient compliance has a social history linked to the struggle to create and maintain physician control over infant feeding technology earlier in this century. But while physicians were successful in that struggle, they have never exercised complete control over health care products. Compliance must be reconceptualized and its research reoriented if it is accurately to portray medication usage and related health behaviors outside the clinic.","['Trostle, J A']",['Trostle JA'],"['Harvard Institute for International Development, Cambridge, MA 02138.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,E IM,"['*Authoritarianism', 'Behavior Control', '*Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Information Dissemination', '*Patient Compliance', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Patient Participation', ""*Physician's Role"", 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Power, Psychological', '*Role', 'Self Care', 'Social Values']",['KIE: 27596'],,,['KIE'],['Professional Patient Relationship'],"['KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: patient care/drugs', 'KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: professional patient relationship', 'KIE: Full author name: Trostle, James A']",1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1988;27(12):1299-308. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(88)90194-3.,,,58,['10.1016/0277-9536(88)90194-3 [doi]'],['MH09039-01 TO -03/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Chi-square tests showed that Stage 1 was significantly associated with a younger age of the deceased sibling, more recent death (less than or equal to 6 months), and lower social class. With regard to the projective story themes, children whose siblings died suddenly (compared to those whose deaths were anticipated) had significantly higher loneliness themes. Children whose deceased siblings were of school age also gave significantly more death themes than children whose deceased siblings were younger.","['Manalo Atuel, T', 'Dauz Williams, P', 'Tamba Camar, M']","['Manalo Atuel T', 'Dauz Williams P', 'Tamba Camar M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Matern Child Nurs J,Maternal-child nursing journal,0350761,IM N,"['*Attitude to Death', 'Child', 'Denial, Psychological', 'Female', 'Grief', 'Guilt', 'Humans', 'Loneliness', 'Male', 'Philippines', 'Projective Techniques', '*Sibling Relations']",,,,,,,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Matern Child Nurs J. 1988 Summer;17(2):115-34.,,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,

Humans voluntarily drink alcoholic beverages or self-administer alcohol, more often than not, in a social setting. Environmental factors and how individuals react to them can, therefore, have powerful influences on drinking behavior. On the other hand, the neuropsychopharmacological actions of ethanol and how different individuals react to them can be important biological determinants. Ethanol's action is biphasic, i.e., it can be reinforcing (rewarding) in the low concentration range, but aversive at high concentrations. Perception by the individual of the reinforcing actions of ethanol might be expected to maintain alcohol-seeking behavior, whereas aversive effects would be expected to extinguish this behavior. Identification of the environmental and biological variables that promote and maintain alcohol-seeking or alcohol self-administration behavior is key to our understanding of the disorder alcoholism itself.","['Li, T K', 'Lumeng, L', 'McBride, W J', 'Murphy, J M', 'Froehlich, J C', 'Morzorati, S']","['Li TK', 'Lumeng L', 'McBride WJ', 'Murphy JM', 'Froehlich JC', 'Morzorati S']","['The Regenstrief Institute, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Adv Alcohol Subst Abuse,Advances in alcohol & substance abuse,8107172,IM,"['Alcoholism/*genetics', 'Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Ethanol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Serotonin/physiology', 'Reinforcement, Psychology', 'Self Administration']",,,,,,,1988/01/01 00:00,1988/01/01 00:01,['1988/01/01 00:00'],"['1988/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1988/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1988/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Alcohol Subst Abuse. 1988;7(3-4):73-86. doi: 10.1300/J251v07n03_11.,"['0 (Receptors, Serotonin)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",,43,['10.1300/J251v07n03_11 [doi]'],['AA-03243/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Small sample studies are advantageous because they offer the ability to examine the longitudinal interplay of a wide range of variables in individual patients. The small n approach is useful for delineating important new course variables, developing models of course change, and generating unique research hypotheses. In this article, small sample ""qualitative"" methodology is reviewed, and data derived from recent small n, intensive longitudinal studies are presented. Methodological issues related to addressing qualitative data in large sample, controlled studies are addressed, and specific research hypotheses generated by small sample studies for consideration in future large sample outcome studies are suggested.

However, such reports of support may reflect not only actual supportive interpersonal transactions but also the recipients' own personal and perceptual dispositions and comparatively transient mood states. This study examines these factors' independent effects on perceived support. Interpersonal transactions of social support were assessed in a longitudinal panel design using reports from 486 adult male respondents and their significant others (mostly wives).

Members of all social classes attributed considerable importance to psychosocial influences on health. In all social classes a substantial proportion of overweight people expressed a desire to reduce their weight, smokers to modify their smoking habits and sedentary people to increase the amount of exercise they took. However, there was less interest in dietary change or reduction of alcohol consumption. One third of the smokers and of those who were overweight had received advice from health professionals about behaviour modification, but less than 10% of those in the other risk groups reported receiving advice.

Data were obtained through interviews and medical records from a probability sample of 460 individuals aged 45-89 years old. Physical health measures were important predictors for both age groups, but there were differences in the relative importance of specific variables. The number of diagnoses was more important in predicting physician use for the middle-aged and bed days was more significant for the aged. Psychologic factors played a slightly greater role in predicting physician use for the aged, and enabling and predisposing variables were somewhat more important for the middle-aged. Utilization during the year before the interview was associated with subsequent physician use for both age groups, but the correlation was weaker among the aged. Age differences in the predictors of physician use are believed to result from the unique illness response elicited by chronic, as opposed to acute, illness.","['Levkoff, S E', 'Cleary, P D', 'Wetle, T']","['Levkoff SE', 'Cleary PD', 'Wetle T']","['Department of Social Medicine and Health Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Care,Medical care,0230027,IM,"['Age Factors', '*Aged/psychology', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chronic Disease/psychology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Middle Aged/psychology', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Office Visits/*statistics & numerical data', 'Physicians/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Factors', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Wisconsin']",,,,,,,1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Care. 1987 Dec;25(12):1148-60. doi: 10.1097/00005650-198712000-00004.,,,,['10.1097/00005650-198712000-00004 [doi]'],['MH33940/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Clarity of concept and definition is essential; we need several definitions for different purposes, and should distinguish global criteria defining groups in some way specifically 'retarded' and partial criteria defining groups not exclusive to retardation. Of global definitions, we can distinguish Intellectual Impairment based on IQ, Learning Disability based on educational criteria, and Mental Handicap or Retardation based on service or administrative criteria. The first and second may be co-terminous for children. The first and third are usually co-terminous below a certain IQ level, conventionally 50, as SII and SMH/R. This is not so for higher ability groups: MII and MMR are conceived and defined differently, and suit different research purposes. There may be much unknown need because there have been so few studies of total IQ defined groups above 50. Although organic and psychological factors are very important, the study of MMR needs to recognize its primarily social nature, reflecting determinants of selection into MMR status in legal, organizational and professional structures, activities and attitudes characteristic of particular communities and cultures. If the primary focus is on aetiological factors, natural history, and preventive possibilities, study group should be aetiologically defined and preferably not limited to MR. The same applies to specific impairments, disabilities, diseases, behaviours and disadvantages. The services are also susceptible to epidemiological approaches, descriptive, analytic, interventionist and evaluative, but little is yet available on agency structure and function, professional activities, attitudes and training, legal contexts, and financial constraints. Rigorous outcome studies would greatly benefit rapidly developing services. We know quite a lot about the distribution and associations of SII/SMR, though more is needed, especially to clarify issues of social class distribution. There is a dearth of good research in MII or MMR, and several large scale new studies could be justified. Work on the epidemiology of aetiological entities has progressed, though there are many gaps. Because of their rarity, we should be looking to bring together all the data on aetiological diagnosis now accumulating in good paediatric units throughout the UK.","['Fryers, T']",['Fryers T'],"['Department of Community Medicine, University of Manchester, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Ment Defic Res,Journal of mental deficiency research,0375401,IM,"['Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Intelligence']",,,,,,,1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Ment Defic Res. 1987 Dec;31 ( Pt 4):365-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2788.1987.tb01382.x.,,,94,['10.1111/j.1365-2788.1987.tb01382.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The measure is easy to use, reliable, and shows good evidence of construct validity. It detects differences among parents by gender, by parental education and occupational status, by cultural background of parents, by parental familiarity with a handicapped person, and by stimulus (physically disabled vs. mentally retarded child referent). Results are discussed in relation to determinants of parental attitudes toward handicaps.

Self-reported sexual behaviors for the previous 6 months generally had the next highest degree of reliability as measured by Kappa.

Genetic and cultural determinants of blood glucose were estimated utilizing a path model with 10 parameters to be estimated from a total of 16 correlations. Under a reduced model genetic heritability (h2) was estimated to be 0.18 +/- 0.08 and cultural heritability (c2) was 0.10 +/- 0.02.

Obviously, limiting the study to white families prevents generalization of our findings to other subgroups of the population. The findings demonstrate the importance and relevance of parental and adolescent attitudes in understanding adolescent sexuality. Premarital sexuality is a salient issue to both young people and their parents. There are, however, very important and substantial differences in the attitudes of parents and children. On average, the attitudes of young people today are much less restrictive than those of their parents, reflecting either life cycle differences or the impact of social change. The intergenerational difference is recognized by young people themselves and probably affects the ability of parents to assist their maturing children in adjusting to and dealing with their sexuality--a difficulty likely to be reflected in the relative lack of success sexually active young people have in preventing pregnancy. Our findings also add to the research literature in demonstrating that although children, on average, have more permissive attitudes than their parents, the attitudes of individual parents tend to be reflected in the attitudes of individual children. Children whose mothers have less restrictive attitudes have, on average, less restrictive attitudes themselves. Further, the attitudes of mothers are also reflected in the behavior of their children, so on average, mothers with more permissive attitudes have children who are more sexually active. The influence of maternal attitudes, however, is stronger for children's attitudes than for their behavior. Of course, variability in children's attitudes and behavior--and even their perceptions of maternal attitudes--can only be partially explained by the attitudes of their mothers; but presumably, if the attitudes of other important family members, including fathers and siblings, were known, the prediction of adolescent attitudes would improve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Thornton, A', 'Camburn, D']","['Thornton A', 'Camburn D']","['Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Demography,Demography,0226703,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Adolescent Behavior', '*Attitude', 'Child Rearing', 'Divorce', 'Educational Status', 'Employment', '*Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological', 'Male', '*Marriage', 'Models, Psychological', 'Mothers/psychology', 'Parents/psychology', 'Pregnancy', 'Religion and Sex', '*Sexual Behavior', 'Social Values']",,,,,,,1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Demography. 1987 Aug;24(3):323-40.,,,,,['HD-12798/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Fifty adult hypertensive patients at a health maintenance organization completed questionnaires and participated in home interviews over a 10-week period. Knowledge of medical regimens, information communication between the patient and the medical professionals, satisfaction with health-care providers, health locus of control, social support, and treatment disruption to life-style were assessed. Adherence was assessed through self-report and behavioral (i.e., pill-count ratio, percentage of kept medical appointments) indices. Finally, repeated blood-pressure measurements were obtained. Structural modeling procedures revealed that greater expectancy for internal control over health and hypertension, greater knowledge of the treatment regimen, and stronger social support were significant determinants of adherence; in turn, higher levels of adherence facilitated blood-pressure reduction.","['Stanton, A L']",['Stanton AL'],"['Department of Psychology, Auburn University, Alabama 36849.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Behav Med,Journal of behavioral medicine,7807105,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Attitude to Health', 'Consumer Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*drug therapy', 'Internal-External Control', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Psychological', '*Patient Compliance', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Professional-Patient Relations', 'Social Support']",,,,,,,1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Behav Med. 1987 Aug;10(4):377-94. doi: 10.1007/bf00846477.,,,,['10.1007/bf00846477 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

This model is applied to six-year longitudinal data on life events exposure for a sample of New Zealand women with school-aged children. The fitted model suggests that in the region of 30% of the variance in life-event reports over the six-year period was attributable to a common vulnerability factor. Modelling of this vulnerability factor suggested that two major determinants of vulnerability to life events were the level of social disadvantage of the woman and her level of neuroticism: women of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and women with high neuroticism scores showed a consistent tendency to report high life-event exposure during the six-year period.

The study population consisted of 154 spinal cord injured persons who were treated at our hospital between 1973 and 1979, and followed for seven years after injury. Demographic, social, and injury severity data were abstracted from each subject's hospital record. Motivation to work, employment history, and sources of postinjury financial support, were assessed by a vocational rehabilitation counselor. The study population was divided into four groups: persons continuously unemployed after injury, homemakers, students, and those employed at some time during the seven-year follow-up period. Stepwise discriminant analysis was used to develop a predictive model that ultimately included seven variables: gender, motivation to work, whether the patient's last job required ambulation, race, educational level, a functional ability score, and whether the patient had children. The model correctly classified 82% of those persons who were continuously unemployed, 100% of homemakers, 63% of students, and 72% of employed subjects. Overall, 79% of subjects were classified correctly. The most important classification errors were between the unemployed and employed groups. Seventeen percent of employed patients were incorrectly classified as unemployed, and 11% of unemployed patients were incorrectly classified as employed.

This society, which has been inaccessible to most Western researchers, offers a special site for studies of aging because of its sheer size as a world power, its relationship to Third World countries, and its population problem-a growing segment of elderly people. Available data from a variety of social science sources are utilized to compare how the sociocultural context of China and the United States impact differentially upon the older population in each society. Three major determinants specify the theoretical context: economic development (the level of production an economic system achieves); traditional cultural patterns (norms, roles, relationships); and the social control mechanisms (regulatory processes based upon the legal and sanctioning systems). These determinants provide a theoretical orientation for analyzing the outcome variables involved in the behavior and adaptation of the old. In American society, cultural norms and values are advantageous for active older persons in good health, particularly those with a favorable economic situation. In contemporary Chinese society, which blends traditional customs with the values of a revolutionary and changing society, there are advantages for the frail elderly.","['Streib, G F']",['Streib GF'],"['University of Florida, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Aging Stud,Journal of aging studies,8916517,,,,,,,,,1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['2014/09/09 06:00'],"['2014/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,J Aging Stud. 1987 Summer;1(2):95-112. doi: 10.1016/0890-4065(87)90001-6.,,,,"['0890-4065(87)90001-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0890-4065(87)90001-6 [doi]']",,,,['Copyright (c) 1987.

Competitive trait anxiety from the Sport Competition Anxiety Test was the best predictor of state anxiety. Perceived chance of winning was the only situational factor which was significantly related to state anxiety.

A factor-analysis of Averill's questionnaire items on anger revealed that motives involved in aggressive responses were clustered into two groups: the hostile and the instrumental. It was also clarified that an individual is likely to engage in aggression particularly when some hostile motives are evoked. Concerning the interpersonal functions, the author proposed that aggression might serve four principal goals. (1) Aggression can be generated as an avoidance response to an aversive stimulus, such as frustration, annoyance, or pain, and so on. It depends on the severity of the stimulus. It was however emphasized that aggression is also mediated by social cognition, such as an attribution of intent to a harm-doer. (2) Aggression can be used as a means of coercing the other person into doing something. An individual is likely to use such a power strategy if he/she is lacking in self-confidence or a perspective for influencing the target person by more peaceful strategies. (3) Aggression can be interpreted as a punishment when it is directed toward a transgressor. In this case, aggression is motivated by restoration of a social justice, and thus its intensity is determined by the perceived moral responsibility of the transgressor. Further, it was indicated that aggression is intensified if it is justified as a sanctional conduct against the immoral. (4) Aggression can be also evoked when an individual's social identity is threatened. It was suggested that impression management motives are involved in aggression by an unexpected finding that the presence of audience or the identifiability rather facilitated retaliative aggression. The aggression-inhibition effect of apology was also explained in terms of impression management. In conclusion, it was presented that aggression is a behavioral strategy as an attempt to resolve interpersonal conflicts including physical or psychological annoyance, the other person's disobedience, perceived injustice, and a threat to one's social identity. Whether one's aggression is performed or not depends on a number of intra- and inter-personal determinants, particularly on social cognitive processes such as attribution, inference, prediction and other judgements.","['Ohbuchi, K']",['Ohbuchi K'],"['Department of Psychology, Osaka University of Education.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Shinrigaku Kenkyu,Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology,0413571,IM,"['Aggression/*psychology', 'Anger', 'Coercion', 'Hostility', 'Humans', '*Interpersonal Relations', '*Motivation', 'Social Identification', 'Social Justice']",,,,,,,1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Shinrigaku Kenkyu. 1987 Jun;58(2):113-24. doi: 10.4992/jjpsy.58.113.,,,72,['10.4992/jjpsy.58.113 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Sociodemographic factors of education and income (except for active-cognitive coping), personality dispositions of self-confidence and an easy-going manner, and contextual factors of negative life events and family support each made a significant incremental contribution to predicting active and avoidance coping. Among both healthy adults and patients, active and avoidance coping were positively associated with negative life events. Individuals who had more personal and environmental resources were more likely to rely on active coping and less likely to use avoidance coping. Moreover, for both groups, most of the predictors continued to show significant relations with active and avoidance coping strategies even after the stable component in coping was controlled in a longitudinal design. A comprehensive framework to understand the determinants of coping can be of practical value in suggesting points for therapeutic interventions aimed at fostering more adaptive coping efforts.","['Holahan, C J', 'Moos, R H']","['Holahan CJ', 'Moos RH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pers Soc Psychol,Journal of personality and social psychology,0014171,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Defense Mechanisms', 'Depressive Disorder/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Personality Tests', 'Self Concept', 'Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pers Soc Psychol. 1987 May;52(5):946-55. doi: 10.1037//0022-3514.52.5.946.,,,,['10.1037//0022-3514.52.5.946 [doi]'],"['AA006699/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'AA02863/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Yet few studies have examined these social parameters. Another problem with life course research is its ahistoricity. Even specifically historical studies have often been unable to measure the dynamics of change because of their use of cross-sectional household data, which only measures a small portion of kinship relations. This case study of the Mennonite family of Cornelius and Helena Richert Voth, who migrated from Russia to the Kansas Plains in 1874, analyzes the role that religious and ethnic traditions and inheritance rules play in preserving family stability, providing security in old age, and shaping the family life course. It contributes to our understanding of the social determinants of life course change by illustrating how traditional Mennonite patterns of family organization and property transmission, formed during centuries of community life in Prussia and Russia, shaped the timing of life course transitions and how the differing social, political, and economic conditions the immigrants encountered on the American frontier altered those traditional patterns.","['Quadagno, J', 'Janzen, J M']","['Quadagno J', 'Janzen JM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Aging Stud,Journal of aging studies,8916517,,,,,,,,,1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['2014/09/09 06:00'],"['2014/09/09 06:00 [entrez]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,J Aging Stud. 1987 Spring;1(1):33-49. doi: 10.1016/S0890-4065(87)80021-X.

The survey examined the behaviors and attitudes of women who had chosen to nurse and who were still nursing at 2 weeks postpartum. Sixty percent of the mothers nursed their infants after delivery. However, by 10 weeks postpartum, only 34% of the babies were still breast fed. By self-report, the most significant factors associated with the maintenance of lactation at 10 weeks were related to perinatal hospital protocol, especially letting the infant suckle soon after birth. Other significant predictors of successful lactation outcome included early milk ""let down,"" little use of supplemental formula, the mother's expectation at parturition of an extended nursing period, her feeling well and being satisfied with her body weight, her previous successful experience with lactation, and her perception that she feeds her infant on demand. Few of the women who had stopped nursing after 2 weeks sought advice on breast feeding from anyone other than the pediatrician. Most coped with their nursing problems themselves. The data reinforce the importance of labor and delivery practices that support early maternal-infant contact. They also suggest the use of infant health indexes and weight and height percentile placement records rather than reliance solely on weight gain as the index of lactation adequacy. Further, they indicate the need for clinical intervention before 2 weeks postpartum.","['Ferris, A M', 'McCabe, L T', 'Allen, L H', 'Pelto, G H']","['Ferris AM', 'McCabe LT', 'Allen LH', 'Pelto GH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Am Diet Assoc,Journal of the American Dietetic Association,7503061,AIM IM,"['Attitude to Health', 'Breast Feeding', 'Connecticut', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interviews as Topic/methods', '*Lactation', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Social Support', 'Telephone']",,,,,,,1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Diet Assoc. 1987 Mar;87(3):316-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The duration of breast feeding affected the incidence of atopy only among the infants without family history for atopy: fewer in the short breast feeding group (1/18) had atopy than in the long breast feeding group (5/13).

The results indicate that the areas of smoking and drinking are sensitive and that specific communicative strategies are used for introducing these topics and for eliciting information. Smoking habits are addressed in 75% of the consultations and alcohol habits in 30%. In most cases, the information exchanged is shallow and gives only a fragmentary picture of patients' habits. There is little evidence of attempts to influence patients' attitudes and behaviours and the physicians do not contextualise possible relationships between such lifestyle habits and health in the light of their medical knowledge.

For 30 years, we have been doing research in this field and have been successful in identifying such risk factors as Type A behavior, social isolation, stressful life events, and various psychological patterns. However, our success in using this information to help prevent disease has been much more limited. One reason for this limited success is that we have focused virtually all of our attention on the study of individuals and almost no attention on the social environment within which people live. There are two major limitations of such a one-to-one approach: it is difficult for people to change their behavior and their life situation and even if some people do change, others enter the ""at risk"" population because no action has been taken to change those forces in society that stimulated the problem in the first place. In discussing the social determinants of disease, it is important that we develop a new approach that permits us to study not only individuals but also the social environment. An example of this approach is provided by researchers who were successful in preventing infectious diseases. The work of these researchers focused not on clinical entities or on individuals but on the environment. This resulted in a disease classification system that included concepts such as air-borne, food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne diseases.

In contrast, very little is known about the drinking habits and attitudes toward alcohol of teenagers in the world's developing countries. In this paper we propose that adolescents learn about alcohol as part of the socialization process, just as they learn other social behaviors. Central to this learning is the development of a set of expectancies within one's culture about the effects of alcohol upon the user. These expectancies are important determinants of subsequent drinking behavior. An understanding of the sociocultural environment in which these expectancies develop, and in which teenage drinking occurs, is essential for developing intervention strategies aimed at promoting responsible alcohol use and avoiding alcohol-related problems among young people.","['Callan, V J', 'Wilks, J']","['Callan VJ', 'Wilks J']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Pediatrician,Pediatrician,8511837,IM,"['Adult', 'Alcohol Drinking/*ethnology/psychology', 'Alcoholism/*epidemiology/psychology', '*Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Research', 'Set, Psychology', 'Socialization']",,,,,,,1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatrician. 1987;14(1-2):7-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Middle-aged women imagined that they had just discovered a particular change in their breast, and they completed a questionnaire that assessed variables specified by Ajzen and Fishbein's theory of reasoned action with respect to two alternative courses of action: immediately calling the doctor (i.e., prompt behavior) and monitoring the breast change on one's own (i.e., delay behavior). Also assessed were variables external to the theory that were drawn from previous research on cancer delay. Results showed that intentions to delay were positively associated with having favorable attitudes toward delay and with perceived social pressure to delay; the attitudinal factor, however, was more influential than the social factor in determining intentions. Underlying favorable attitudes toward delay were beliefs that delay would be likely to result in maintaining control over and avoiding the disruption of one's own and others' lives but would be unlikely to result in negative health outcomes. No external variable was found to contribute to intentions to delay above and beyond attitudinal and normative considerations.","['Timko, C']",['Timko C'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Health Psychol,"Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",8211523,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast', 'Breast Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Palpation', '*Patient Acceptance of Health Care', '*Referral and Consultation', 'Sick Role']",,,,,,,1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Psychol. 1987;6(4):305-28. doi: 10.1037//0278-6133.6.4.305.,,,,['10.1037//0278-6133.6.4.305 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to look at this issue and addressed the following two research questions: Is there a relationship between fulfillment of patient requests for services and patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter? and What degree of satisfaction is explained by the qualities of the encounter as compared to the characteristics of the patient, physician, and system of health care? Four newly-developed instruments were administered to a convenience sample of 144 adult patients and their physicians prior to and following actual visits to a University Family Practice Center. Meeting patients' requests increased their satisfaction with the encounter. At least 19% of the variance in patient satisfaction could be attributed to request fulfillment.

Classification systems based on the behavioral capabilities of retarded persons were criticized since there are so many noncognitive determinants of performance. It was proposed that mental retardation be defined solely by IQ scores at least 2 SDs below the population mean. This suggestion was predicated on the view that the behavioral sciences currently have no better way to assess intellectual functioning. Etiology was seen as such a significant predictor of group differences that the organic, familial, and undifferentiated categories would be used in classification. Social adaptation and expected performance were seen as correlates of class membership rather than defining features of retardation, since they have no reliable method of measurement.

Rather than sex being the influential factor, the model of best fit was a gender role by remembrance preference interaction. If subjects were masculine, they were more likely to choose athletic star than were feminine or androgynous subjects.

The present study argues that school counselors in affluent neighborhoods emphasize the meritocratic criteria, while those in poorer neighborhoods tend to focus on the more nonmeritocratic. This hypothesis is examined in a random sample of 210 male, primary school graduates from the 10 state schools of an Israeli town, 125 of whom are from schools in affluent neighborhoods, and 85 from schools in poorer neighborhoods. A path analysis of determinants of guidance to specific high school tracks shows that students' ethnicity and labeling as problematic directly affect guidance by counselors only in the poor neighborhoods.

A factorial design included social vs. solitary drinking conditions, laboratory vs. informal setting, and variable exposure to music. The amount of ethanol consumed (g/kg body weight) was used as an unobtrusive measure of preferred intake. The reciprocal relationship between mood and consumption was analyzed by LISREL. While euphoria has usually been perceived as a consequence of drinking, the only plausible fit to a LISREL model was obtained by assuming that the disposition to drink would be increased by positive mood changes occurring during the drinking session. An analogy between social drinking and adjunctive behaviour was supported, as alcohol consumption was directly affected by time-dependent environmental factors such as company and music. Since the presence of company also stimulated positive mood and alleviated boredom, consumption was precipitated by company indirectly as well as directly. These results emphasize the importance of direct as well as indirect environmental influences on spontaneous alcohol intake during social drinking.","['Lindman, R', 'Lindfors, B', 'Dahla, E', 'Toivola, H']","['Lindman R', 'Lindfors B', 'Dahla E', 'Toivola H']","['Department of Psychology, Abo Akademi, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Alcohol Alcohol Suppl,"Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire).

Research findings which span a 20 year period are summarized. Initially, Cheryl Rittenbaugh's concept of obesity as 'a culture bound syndrome' serves as a rationale for understanding sociocultural dimensions of body size perceptions. In this regard, the premise that perceptions of obesity and overweight have cultural determinants is substantiated in the reviewed literature. Societal preferences for body build and size and attitudes about weight are examined as a framework for understanding the impact that social perceptions have on individuals who are either overweight or obese. As a result of negative attitudes toward fatness, stigmatization of overweight people has been consistently documented. In related studies, investigators have centered on self-perceptions of obese and overweight individuals. According to the data, the existence of body image disturbance among extremely overweight individuals is a common phenomenon. However, evidence is also presented that suggests that normal weight individuals (especially women) may also have difficulty in accurately assessing their body size. The final focus of this paper is the relationship between body image and weight change behavior. As indicated in the discussion, this area of research has received the least amount of attention in the literature, and the present findings are contradictory. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research directions.","['Wright, E J', 'Whitehead, T L']","['Wright EJ', 'Whitehead TL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Community Health,Journal of community health,7600747,IM,"['*Body Image', 'Body Weight', 'Culture', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*psychology', '*Self Concept', 'Social Perception']",,,,,,,1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Community Health. 1987 Summer-Fall;12(2-3):117-29. doi: 10.1007/bf01323473.,,,51,['10.1007/bf01323473 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Signs and symptoms of prolonged food deprivation include loss of fat and subcutaneous tissue, depression, apathy, and weakness, which progress to immobility and death of the individual, often from superimposed respiratory or other infections. The social consequences of famines are disruption from mass migrations of people in search of food, breakdown of social behavior, abandonment of cooperative effort, loss of personal pride and sense of family ties, and finally a struggle for individual survival. Famines have been common ever since the development of agriculture made human settlements possible. Food shortages due to crop failures caused by natural disasters including poor weather, insect plagues, and plant diseases; crop destruction due to warfare; and enforced starvation as a political tool are by no means the only causative factors. Many of the worst famines have been due to poor distribution of existing food supplies, either because of inequities that result in a lack of purchasing power on the part of the poor or because of political interference with normal distribution or relief movements of food. Europe and Asia, which in the past experienced frequent severe famines, sometimes with deaths in the hundreds of thousands or millions, have now largely eliminated famines through social and technological change. However, in Africa, political and social factors have destroyed the capacity of many populations to survive drought-induced variations in local food supplies and prices. Thus, famines are due to varying combinations of inadequacy of food supplies for whatever reason and the inability of populations to acquire food because of poverty, civil disturbances, or political interference. Despite the role of natural causes, the conclusion is inescapable that modern famines, like most of those in history, are man-made.","['Scrimshaw, N S']",['Scrimshaw NS'],,['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Nutr,Annual review of nutrition,8209988,IM J Q,"['Demography', 'Disasters', 'Food Deprivation', 'Food Supply', 'History, 15th Century', 'History, 16th Century', 'History, 17th Century', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, Ancient', 'History, Medieval', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Politics', 'Protein Deficiency/etiology', 'Sociology', '*Starvation/etiology/history/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Warfare']","['PIP: 125808', 'POP: 00266373']","['Famines are sustained, extreme shortages of food among discrete populations', 'sufficient to cause high rates of mortality.

This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dekker, E']",['Dekker E'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Health Promot,"Health promotion (Oxford, England)",8700098,H,"['Europe', '*Health Policy', '*Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Mental Disorders/*prevention & control', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Social Environment', 'United States']",,,,,,,1986/12/11 00:00,1986/12/11 00:01,['1986/12/11 00:00'],"['1986/12/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/11 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Promot. 1987;2(2):139-47. doi: 10.1093/heapro/2.2.139.,,,,['10.1093/heapro/2.2.139 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network.

Analyzing these different kinds of material, the importance of a differential approach to the multidimensionally determined situation of men in old age was stressed; on the other hand, it seemed to be possible to identify certain ""typical"" characteristics at least for the present cohorts of old-aged men (e.g. importance of the quality of marital life, significance of being free of stress, tendency of experiential integration etc.).","['Fooken, I']",['Fooken I'],,['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Z Gerontol,Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie,0140107,IM,"['*Aged/psychology', 'Attitude', 'Family', 'Female', 'Gender Identity', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Men/psychology', 'Middle Aged', 'Role', 'Self Concept', 'Socialization', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Z Gerontol. 1986 Jul-Aug;19(4):249-75.,,,,,,Manner im Alter--Psychologische und soziale Aspekte.,,,,,,,,,

Table salt (7 per cent) and cooking salt (8 per cent) were found to account for only a small proportion of total sodium intake, the major part (89 per cent) being from non-discretionary salt present in foods. Subjects, divided on the basis of table salt use and total intake, were found to differ in the most preferred concentration of salt in soup, but not in their sensitivity to variations from their ideal. Table salt use was predicted very well by the individual's attitude, and to a lesser extent by perceived social pressure. The only other variable related to higher table salt use was a lower preference for fruit on the general food preferences questionnaire. The lower preference for fruit was also related to higher total salt intake, which was also predicted by a lower neuroticism score on the EPI.

We coded the videotapes for facial activity using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978b), and peer judges rated them for painful discomfort. Subjects exposed to a tolerant model reported no more discomfort than did subjects exposed to an intolerant model, despite receiving more intense levels of shock, but were judged by observers to be in more pain. Analyses of facial activity yielded consistent findings: Tolerant-model subjects, though reporting discomfort equivalent to that reported in other groups, displayed more pain-related facial activity (brow lowering, narrowing of the eye aperture from below, raising the upper lip, and blinking). There was a substantial direct relation between observer judgments of distress and discrete, pain-related facial actions (mean multiple R = .74 for the various shock levels rated).

A sample of 290 primary school students (155 boys and 135 girls, mean age 10.3) in grade four in Beijing were investigated using the Multi-Faceted Aggression Inventory. The children's parents were asked about child-rearing measures and day-care experience for the child. Teachers rated the children's aggression, school achievement level, and membership in the Young Pioneers. Despite acknowledged limitations, the findings in this study gave evidence that according to a person-environment interaction perspective, the Chinese children's individual differences in aggression were influenced by the restricted environment. As aggressive behaviour is undesired and suppressed in the Chinese culture in and outside the home, the Chinese children seemed to show lower levels and less variation of aggression behaviour than children in permissive environments (e.g., Sweden). However, when analysing sex differences in aggression environmental influences alone might not explain the differences.","['Ekblad, S']",['Ekblad S'],,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Acta Psychiatr Scand,Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,0370364,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Aggression', 'Child', '*Child Behavior', 'Child Day Care Centers', 'Child Rearing', 'China', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Peer Group', '*Personality Development', 'Sex Factors', 'Television']",,,,,,,1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Psychiatr Scand. 1986 May;73(5):515-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1986.tb02719.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1600-0447.1986.tb02719.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

In Experiment 1, neonatally androgenized females engaged in play soliciting at a level equal to that of male controls and greater than that of nonandrogenized female controls. In Experiment 2, males and females were reared in unisexual and bisexual groups in order to compare long-term sex-related social experience effects on juvenile play soliciting. Males exposed only to other young males engaged in greater play soliciting than males exposed to both sexes; females, in contrast, were unaffected by sex of cagemates. Within rearing conditions, however, males engaged in greater play soliciting than females.

It is likely that the elderly of the future will be better off financially, better educated, healthier, more politically connected and strident, but their social support systems will be less effective. The last stems from trends such as declining birth rate, an increasingly mobile society, diminished importance of the nuclear family, and the diminishing attractiveness of professions involved with providing maintenance care.

Along with the prosperity explosion of the past, the pattern of health problems has changed and is still changing. Moreover, the demand for health care has kept on rising, without much improvement of health status in general. Thus, there is a critical need to rethink policies, and to ensure that future changes occur within the limits of shrinking resources and the allotted time-span. In particular, the change in priorities envisaged by the Health for All 2000 (HFA 2000) strategies will need to take place against the background of an ageing population, social instability, and continuing development of new lifestyles and persistent economic scarcity. It is by analysing that background that this article seeks to make recommendations as to how health planning and management might successfully cope with the policy reorientation of the HFA 2000 strategy. The structure of this article is as follows. Firstly, the changes taking place in planning conditions will be reviewed, and form the basis of a framework for subsequent analysis of the planning environment. Following this framework, some of the conflicts likely to be faced in planning and management will be discussed, many of which are the consequence of economic stringency and instability. Also the requirements for an improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of planning will be identified. Finally, a limited number of approaches to planning will be considered, for their appropriateness to the present-day economic circumstances. The point of view elucidated throughout is that there is no single solution which is 'best' under all circumstances. The conclusion, rather, is that the selection of particular theory or method of planning and management should depend both on the objectives of the decision maker and on the determinants of the planning environment. General prescriptions should not be made. At the same time, some elements have to be stressed in all types of planning, namely: the orientation towards outcomes or outputs of problems; the attention to long-term strategic thinking; and, the application of more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic approaches.","['van der Werff, A']",['van der Werff A'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Health Plann Manage,The International journal of health planning and management,8605825,H,"['Decision Making, Organizational', 'Global Health', 'Health Planning/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Planning Techniques', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1986/03/11 00:00,1986/03/11 00:01,['1986/03/11 00:00'],"['1986/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Health Plann Manage. 1986 Apr-Jun;1(3):227-40. doi: 10.1002/hpm.4740010306.,,,,['10.1002/hpm.4740010306 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

This social proximity behavior persisted for at least 2 weeks of continual exposure to the window despite lack of further physical access to the female (Experiment 2) and was evident at all daylight hours (Experiment 3). Female Japanese quail stimulated more proximity behavior in male conspecifics than did other male Japanese quail or birds of other species (Experiments 4 and 5). However, many characteristics of the female quail were not critical. The female quail did not have to be previous sexual partners, familiar, sexually experienced, or reproductively competent to stimulate proximity behavior in males (Experiments 4 and 5). Experiment 6 demonstrated that the social proximity behavior was primarily a response to the visual aspects of the females. The results are discussed in relation to mate-guarding and surveillance behavior, and implications of the data for sexual classical conditioning of male Japanese quail are noted.","['Domjan, M', 'Hall, S']","['Domjan M', 'Hall S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Comp Psychol,"Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983)",8309850,IM,"['Animals', 'Coturnix/*physiology', 'Female', 'Male', 'Ovulation', 'Quail/*physiology', 'Sex Factors', 'Sexual Behavior, Animal', '*Social Behavior']",,,,,,,1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Comp Psychol. 1986 Mar;100(1):59-67.,,,,,['MH 38529-01/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Allocation to those groups appeared to be more likely to reflect constitutional levels of anxiety, rather than recent or current social stressors. Highly anxious mothers were distinguished on a number of presumed correlates of anxiety measured by clinical questions (e.g. terminating of anxious situations), hospital notes (e.g. mood problems noted by nursing staff) and blind rater assessments (e.g. unassertiveness). While highly anxious mothers were more likely to report more recent life events, less social support, and negative interpretations of the pregnancy, the hospital experience and the hospital staff, such variables were less discriminating when neuroticism levels were effectively controlled. This suggests an intrinsic perceptual bias, rather than that the factors were determinants. Highly anxious mothers had more delivery complications, while their babies were more likely to be dysmature and slow to suckle, features we interpret as consequences of the anxiety levels. In the postpartum period these mothers were more depressed, had more concerns about their baby, themselves and their marriage, and were less confident about coping and their parenting capacities.

Results indicate that: (1) mothers keep available and use for children a considerable variety of different medications and medical applicances; (2) a positive linear relationship exists between mothers' socioeconomic status (SES) and degree of MIMB; (3) mothers' attitudes toward medications and toward their children's health are associated with the number of categories of medications and applicances they possess and use; (4) the combination of SES and attitudinal characteristics accounts for substantial portions of the variance in MIMB; and (5) judges' ratings show only minimal-level support of MIMB (extending to mothers in all SES groups) and are linearly related to SES (P less than 0.001). These findings emphasize the need for health care providers to review MIMB, and to provide advice concerning use and misuse of mother-initiated treatments.","['Maiman, L A', 'Becker, M H', 'Katlic, A W']","['Maiman LA', 'Becker MH', 'Katlic AW']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Adult', 'Attitude to Health', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Maternal Behavior', 'Nonprescription Drugs/*therapeutic use', 'Social Class', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1986;22(1):41-51. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(86)90307-2.,['0 (Nonprescription Drugs)'],,,['10.1016/0277-9536(86)90307-2 [doi]'],"['1 K04 HD00538/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '5 R01 HD15357/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes.

A standard interview documented demographic variables, health problems, placements subsequent to hospitalization and additional psychological and medical treatment. Infants were divided into three groups dependent on medical and treatment factors. Means and percentages of occurrence of outcome variables were compared through either one-way ANOVAS or single sample chi-square tests with post hoc analyses. Correlational analyses were used to understand the relationships between outcome and relevant demographic, medical, and treatment variables. In general, the infants manifest persistent intellectual delays at follow-up despite maintenance of weight gains achieved during early hospitalization. More than half the group suffered from chronic health problems. A large percentage of infants had been removed from parental custody at the time of follow-up. Several demographic, medical, and treatment factors bore moderate relationships to developmental outcome. Infants who achieved more optimal growth tended to be full-term at birth, later born and without a question of physical abuse in their social histories. Intellectual functioning was related only to parental and caretaker socioeconomic status. Infants placed in foster care were unlikely to return to their families of origin.

In contrast to severity of disorder, however, these variables explain only a relatively small amount of the variance in utilization. A comparison of treated children and a control group matched for age, sex, psychiatric diagnosis and severity of disorder revealed no significant differences in psychiatric status 5 years later.

Findings from previous empirical research indicate that burnout among these nurses results from reactions to adversities inherent in the hospital work environment, and that burnout can lead nurses to change jobs and/or abandon the practice of nursing. This paper presents and discusses research findings on the effects of various aspects of the hospital work environment on burnout among nurses, and, in addition, evaluates the effects of social support in reducing and/or mitigating the relationship between negative aspects of the work environment and burnout. A multiple regression approach is employed to test the hypothesized model. The data were collected from a sample of nurses (n = 310) employed at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center (FAMC), Aurora, Colorado. The major determinants of burnout were found to be low job enhancement (autonomy, task orientation, clarity, innovation, and physical comfort); work pressure; and lack of supervisor support, along with the interaction term involving the combined effects of job enhancement and supervisor support. These predictors, in conjunction with demographic and job-related variables explained 53% of the variance in emotional exhaustion, a central component of the burnout syndrome.","['Constable, J F', 'Russell, D W']","['Constable JF', 'Russell DW']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Human Stress,Journal of human stress,7602457,IM,"['Burnout, Professional/*psychology', 'Humans', '*Job Satisfaction', 'Nursing Staff, Hospital/*psychology', '*Social Environment', '*Social Support', 'Stress, Psychological/*psychology']",,,,,,,1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Human Stress. 1986 Spring;12(1):20-6. doi: 10.1080/0097840X.1986.9936762.,,,,['10.1080/0097840X.1986.9936762 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Data on affiliation, coalitions, and social competition were collected by means of both focal observation and instantaneous time sampling. Whereas certain elements of the existing model were confirmed, its explanatory principles were not. Social competition did not result in more contact among close-ranking females (the opposite effect was found), and the relation between affiliative behavior and coalitions was more complex than predicted. Based on multivariate analyses and a comparison of theoretical models, we propose a simpler, more encompassing principle underlying interfemale attraction. According to this 'similarity principle', rhesus females establish bonds with females whom they most resemble. The similarity may concern genetical and social background, age, hierarchical position and social class. Effects of these four factors were independently demonstrated. The most successful model assumed that similarity factors influence female bonding in a cumulative fashion.","['de Waal, F B', 'Luttrell, L M']","['de Waal FB', 'Luttrell LM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Folia Primatol (Basel),Folia primatologica; international journal of primatology,0370723,IM,"['Aggression', 'Animals', 'Dominance-Subordination', 'Female', 'Grooming', '*Group Processes', 'Macaca/*physiology', 'Macaca mulatta/*physiology', 'Male', '*Object Attachment']",,,,,,,1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Folia Primatol (Basel). 1986;46(4):215-34. doi: 10.1159/000156255.,,,,['10.1159/000156255 [doi]'],['RR00167/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection.

Analyses of data from the first three waves of the study, which is to extend over 5 years after the onset of illness, are to be discussed in the paper. Marital status, the emotional quality of the spouse relationship and long-standing marital stressors were found to have direct and indirect effects on the two dimensions of the Bradburn Affect Balance Scale. The same is true of continuing problems associated with the heart attack relative to perceptions of having coped effectively with the after effects of illness. Differences in self-esteem and personal competence were suggested as mediators of socio-environmental and illness-related influences. The two-factor conception of well-being developed was found to be a useful framework for investigating positive and negative aspects of psychosocial rehabilitation. The same factors that explain differences between happy and unhappy people in social indicators research also appeared to be determinants of different trajectories of adaptation in the wake of a life-threatening illness. Previous research using theoretical models from stress research has overemphasized psychosocial morbidity and stress management and neglected positive processes of adaptation. The identification of love resources related to positive feeling states and life satisfaction has, therefore, not received the attention it deserves. This is especially the case regarding an overemphasis of the concept of social support as a buffer of stress. Instruments were developed to measure high and low marital intimacy, as well as chronic marital role strains, and these measures appeared to explain different trajectories of adjustment to cardiac disease. The two-factor model appears to be useful for future work on quality of life with chronic illness. The same is true of four marital contexts of rehabilitation that were identified in the study.","['Waltz, M']",['Waltz M'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Marriage', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction/*psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Concept', 'Self-Evaluation Programs', '*Social Environment', '*Social Support', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1986;22(8):791-805. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(86)90233-9.,,,80,['10.1016/0277-9536(86)90233-9 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The present survey explains the significance of an approach based upon the general systems theory and explores to what extent the early parent-infant interaction can function as a didactic system to support the development of thought and speech. Evidence of this function has been found in those forms of parental behavior that escape the parent's conscious awareness and control, as exemplified in the vocal communication with presyllabic infants. Parents unknowingly adjust the structure and dynamics of speech to the constraints of infant capacities, detach prosodic musicality from lexical structure, and use it in particularly expressive forms for the delivery of the first prototypical messages. In this and other similar ways, parents offer an abundance of learning situations in which infants can try out various integrative operations. A biological rather than cultural provenience of the support of communicative development indicates a potential relevance for the interpretation of speech evolution. In addition to qualities of the vocal tract and to complex symbolic capacities in humans, the early intuitive support of communicative development and its playful character are suggested as species-specific determinants of speech evolution. Implications for clinical research are suggested.","['Papousek, H', 'Papousek, M']","['Papousek H', 'Papousek M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Eur Arch Psychiatry Neurol Sci,European archives of psychiatry and neurological sciences,8411522,IM,"['*Communication', 'Culture', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Language Development', 'Mental Health', '*Parent-Child Relations', 'Speech']",,,,,,,1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur Arch Psychiatry Neurol Sci. 1986;236(1):21-5. doi: 10.1007/bf00641053.,,,28,['10.1007/bf00641053 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

With special reference to retinopathy and glycaemic control.,1-45,"In a quasi-experiment all diabetic children in a defined area were exposed either to an intense clinical treatment or served as a constructed control. The cohort of 146 diabetics was observed prospectively for at least 15 years as to diabetic control, mainly glycosuria, and cross-sectionally examined for microangiopathy on four occasions. Data on family background, social situation, smoking, blood pressure, biochemical status, anthropometry, HLA factors and mortality were also gathered. Throughout the analysis duration was considered and treated as a concomitant variable. Two different strategies have been followed in the analysis, one trying to predict microangiopathy at a fixed and predetermined duration, the other to study determinants of the pattern of microangiopathy occurrence over time. Multiple logistic regression and Cox analysis have been used to fit these strategies. The prevalence of microaneurysms or more advanced stages of retinopathy at 10 years duration was 30 per cent and within 20 years 81 per cent. About 52 per cent had haemorrhages after 20 years. Mild and severe nephropathy after 20 years have been contracted by 50 and 15 per cent respectively. No clear sex differences were seen. Variables significantly explaining retinopathy within 10 years were post-pubertal duration, blood pressure, place of medical supervision and the HLA/DR4 marker. The mean glycosuria was high during puberty irrespective of age at onset. The overall pattern of retinopathy occurrence seemed to be influenced by place of medical supervision, age at onset, blood pressure, family history of ischaemic heart disease and glycemic control. For the progression of retinopathy the role of factors reflecting medical supervision and control of diabetes seemed even greater. Even after accounting for degree of diabetic control the experimental group had a more favourable outcome, suggesting additional quality of care components. Mild nephropathy was less predictable from the above risk factors while previous findings of the important role of elevated blood pressure for severe nephropathy was confirmed. We estimate that half of retinopathy cases were preventable by the ""experimental"" care and conclude the near-normalization of glycaemia under routine conditions favourably influences the development of diabetic retinopathy.","['Sterky, G', 'Wall, S']","['Sterky G', 'Wall S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Acta Paediatr Scand Suppl,Acta paediatrica Scandinavica.

Withdrawal aggression was measured after the removal of a subcutaneous morphine pellet or after precipitation by naloxone in naive mice and after removal of a morphine pellet in mice with prior fighting experience. In naive mice, removal of a morphine pellet led to increases in attack bites and threats but naloxone-precipitated withdrawal led to decreases in these behaviors and to increases in defensive posturing, escape attempts and vocalizations. Prior fighting experience abolished the enhanced attack behaviors of resident mice following morphine pellet removal, but led to heightened defensive behavior in intruder mice. The behavior of intruder mice appeared more sensitive to naloxone administration than the behavior of resident mice; naloxone influenced not only intruder defensive behavior, but also other non-aggressive behaviors. The social role of the drug recipient and his prior history of aggressive behavior are important determinants of morphine and naloxone effects on aggression.","['Kantak, K M', 'Miczek, K A']","['Kantak KM', 'Miczek KA']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Psychopharmacology (Berl),Psychopharmacology,7608025,IM,"['Aggression/*drug effects', 'Agonistic Behavior/*drug effects', 'Animals', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Morphine/*adverse effects', 'Naloxone/adverse effects', 'Social Behavior/drug effects', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/etiology/*psychology']",,,,,,,1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Psychopharmacology (Berl). 1986;90(4):451-6. doi: 10.1007/bf00174059.,"['36B82AMQ7N (Naloxone)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)']",,,['10.1007/bf00174059 [doi]'],"['AA05122/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA02632/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

London judges rated the severity of dysfunction described in each item on an equal interval scale using the same methods of scaling and analysis employed in the Seattle study. A regression of English mean item values on US mean values yielded a slope of 1.00 and an intercept of -0.07, indicating that judges gave strikingly similar ratings to most items. Agreement was higher at the more severe end of the dysfunction continuum than at the least severe end, a finding consistent with the notion that what constitutes health is more difficult to define than what constitutes illness.

Total trait values are divided into phylogenetic values, inherited from an ancestral species, and specific values, the result of independent evolution. This allows a quantitative assessment of the strength of the phylogenetic inertia, or burden, displayed by a character in a lineage, so that questions concerning the relative importance of phylogenetic constraints in evolution can be answered. The separation of phylogenetic from specific effects proposed here also allows phylogenetic factors to be explicitly included in cross-species comparative analyses of adaptation. This solves a long-standing problem in evolutionary comparative studies. Only species' specific values can provide information concerning the independent evolution of characters in a set of related species. Therefore, only correlations among specific values for traits may be used as evidence for adaptation in cross-species comparative analyses. The phylogenetic autocorrelation model was applied to a comparative analysis of the determinants of sexual dimorphism in weight among 44 primate species. In addition to sexual dimorphism in weight, mating system, habitat, diet, and size (weight itself) were included in the analysis. All of the traits, except diet, were substantially influenced by phylogenetic inertia. The comparative analysis of the determinants of sexual dimorphism in weight indicates that 50% of the variation among primate species is due to phylogeny. Size, or scaling, could account for a total of 36% of the variance, making it almost as important as phylogeny in determining the level of dimorphism displayed by a species. Habitat, mating system, and diet follow, accounting for minor amounts of variation. Thus, in attempting to explain why a particular modern primate species is very dimorphic compared to other primates, we would say first because its ancestor was more dimorphic than average, second because it is a relatively large species, and third because it is terrestrial, polygynous, and folivorous.","['Cheverud, James M', 'Dow, Malcolm M', 'Leutenegger, Walter']","['Cheverud JM', 'Dow MM', 'Leutenegger W']","['Departments of Anthropology, Cell Biology & Anatomy, and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60201.', 'Department of Anthropology and Program in Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60201.', 'Department of Anthropology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, 53706.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Evolution,Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,0373224,,,,,,,,,1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['2017/06/01 06:00'],"['1984/10/22 00:00 [received]', '1985/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Evolution. 1985 Nov;39(6):1335-1351. doi: 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1985.tb05699.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1558-5646.1985.tb05699.x [doi]'],,,,['(c) 1985 The Society for the Study of Evolution.'],,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1985.tb05699.x [doi],,,,,

The model relies entirely on individual-level factors rather than macro-level factors as determinants of migration decision-making. The individual-level variables included in the model are: recent mobility history, urban social contacts, information about urban areas, evaluations of different locations, migration plans, and actual movements in the period subsequent to an initial interview. The empirical results indicate that with some exceptions there are relatively strong links of the type suggested in the model among these variables. The model was evaluated separately for two groups of villages for movement to Bangkok and for movement to Northeast Thai towns. Thus, four submodels were estimated, providing an opportunity to observe how robust the model is with respect to varying destinations and origins. Although certain differences are found among the four submodels, the overwhelming feature is their similarity. Where differences do exist, they generally reflect differences in the effectiveness of prior mobility as a predictor of other variables in the process. Clearly, a villager's previous history of movement is a key factor affecting subsequent movement and the entire decision-making process. The primary effect of having friends and relatives in a particular urban center is to increase the amount of information a villager has about that urban center. Information has a significant effect on evaluations and plans. Except in one submodel, evaluations have a significant effect on plans; and the existence of plans--which to some extent represent a culmination of social contacts, information, and evaluations--is the only factor other than previous mobility which has a significant direct effect on subsequent movement. Thai policy makers are searching for ways to stimulate the growth of regional urban growth centers and reduce the growth of Bangkok. From the standpoint of intervention, a key variable in this process would appear to be information. Not only is information level related to evaluations of an urban area and mobility plans, but, compared to other variables in the model, it appears to be relatively amenable to modification by inputs deriving from a source external to the village itself. It appears difficult to modify evaluations or migration plans directly, though both could be indirectly influenced by informational inputs. Movement history would be difficult, if not impossible, to manipulate; while villagers could be sponsored for short trips to town, this is not likely to produce much long-range effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Fuller, T D', 'Lightfoot, P', 'Kamnuansilpa, P']","['Fuller TD', 'Lightfoot P', 'Kamnuansilpa P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Demography,Demography,0226703,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Psychological', '*Population Dynamics', 'Rural Population', 'Thailand']",,,,,,,1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Demography. 1985 Nov;22(4):565-79.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the evolution of infant health in Costa Rica two paradigms were identified. One developed in the decades before 1970 and the other during the 1970s. The necessity of conceptualizing a third new paradigm compatible with health needs of the present and the immediate future is recognized. The first or ""malnutrition paradigm"" was orthodox in its derivation; it identified the lack of food as the underlying base for the major health problems and placed its emphasis on institutional medicine. The paradigm was influenced by foreign schools of nutrition and pediatrics and led to the development of an infrastructure for the delivery of medical services and the programs for food distribution.

This approach is based on the assumption that it is in fact an individual's behavior that most directly determines his or her health status. But how good is the evidence that supports this assumption? Specifically, is the evidence sufficient for this assumption to outweigh the long-standing finding that social and economic conditions have a strong relationship to health status? The major support for the behavior approach derives from the coronary heart disease risk-factor studies and the Alameda County Study. In a series of reports over time, the relationship between individuals' health practices and their health status generally, as well as that between heart disease and cancer specifically, have been established by these studies. These observations, however, have not been confirmed when deliberate efforts have been made to change those practices. The evidence in support of the importance of social and economic conditions to health status has been documented through a long series of studies in this country, which have found a direct relationship between individuals' socioeconomic status and their health status. This relationship, however, has not in this country been tested by intervention. Only a few studies have examined the interrelationship between these two approaches to health promotion, but the evidence to date has failed to suggest that either one is the mediator of the other. We must, therefore, conclude that pursuing a policy of health promotion based on either approach to the exclusion of the other would indeed be short-sighted health policy.","['Slater, C', 'Carlton, B']","['Slater C', 'Carlton B']","['University of Texas, Houston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Am J Prev Med,American journal of preventive medicine,8704773,IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control', '*Health', '*Health Policy', '*Health Promotion', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States']",,,,,,,1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Prev Med. 1985 Sep-Oct;1(5):25-33.,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present investigation was to develop a systematic framework for describing and assessing such relationship qualities. In the first study, upper elementary school children were interviewed about their perceptions of the qualities of their sibling relationships. These interviews yielded a list of 15 salient qualities. In the second study, a self-report questionnaire that assessed their perceptions of these qualities was administered to a sample of 198 fifth- and sixth-grade children. A principal components analysis yielded 4 underlying factors: (a) Warmth/Closeness, (b) Relative Status/Power, (c) Conflict, and (d) Rivalry. Relative Status/Power was found to be strongly related to the relative ages of the child and sibling. The other 3 factors were also related to various family constellation variables, but these relations were modest in size. Because family constellation variables and the qualities of sibling relationships are not isomorphic with one another, it is important to study relationship qualities directly, rather than simply examining family constellation variables. Some of the determinants of such qualities are discussed.","['Furman, W', 'Buhrmester, D']","['Furman W', 'Buhrmester D']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Child Dev,Child development,0372725,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Competitive Behavior', 'Dominance-Subordination', 'Family Characteristics', 'Humans', 'Object Attachment', 'Sex Factors', '*Sibling Relations', 'Social Perception']",,,,,,,1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Child Dev. 1985 Apr;56(2):448-61.,,,,,['1R01HD 16142/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Assessment of subjective state included measures of both mood and perceived physical sensations. The results demonstrated the complex determinants of subjective effects of alcohol and illustrated the difficulty of making strong generalizations concerning the subjective effects of alcohol.

Subjects performed a simple cognitive task while watching short films of adult actors. Two variables were manipulated: (a) The sound level was either loud or quiet, and (b) instructions to subjects were varied so that the behaviors shown were perceived as either appropriate or inappropriate. Results strongly supported the hypothesis.

The research was undertaken among 103 people from the Australian city of Perth. Qualitative data was obtained from a clinical sample of 27 and, on the basis of that, an interview schedule was constructed and administered to a survey sample of 76 self-reported arthritis sufferers. Data collected included comprehensive case histories, knowledge and beliefs about arthritis, types of practitioners consulted and treatments used and a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. On the basis of analysis, four basic treatment strategies were discerned. Named after their most salient characteristics and ranging from least to most inclusive these were 'general practitioner and/or self care', 'medical and paramedical care', 'medical and alternative care' and use of 'all sources of care'. The most important determinants of treatment strategy were characteristics of disease--severity, mode of onset and period since onset. The longer the period since onset, the wider the range of treatments utilized. When onset occurred at a relatively young age and when progression was rapid, the more frequently alternative services and treatments were employed. Disease characteristics were followed in importance by socioeconomic factors. Use of the less inclusive strategies was related to social class; with working class people relying primarily on 'general practitioner and/or self care' and middle class people using 'medical and paramedical care'. However, when onset and progression were rapid, the disease was severe and the person relatively young socioeconomic factors were of lesser importance and people from all classes made use of the more inclusive strategies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Gray, D']",['Gray D'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Arthritis/*therapy', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/therapy', 'Attitude to Health', 'Australia', 'Complementary Therapies', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Family Practice', 'Humans', 'Osteoarthritis/therapy', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Self Care', 'Social Class']",,,,,,,1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1985;21(5):507-15. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(85)90034-6.,,,,['10.1016/0277-9536(85)90034-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, it is generally proposed that baccalaureate trained nurses experience this person-role conflict more than the associate or diploma trained nurse because baccalaureate training instills more beliefs/expectations that conflict with the hospital nursing role. However, research has not sufficiently compared the effect of 'socialization' variables like education with other variables found to affect the work experience. This study uses path analysis to explore the relative effects of education, length of experience and the measured interpersonal work environment across types of person-role conflicts, on overall job satisfaction and on propensity to leave. The results show that the interpersonal factors are the paramount determinants of the measured person-role conflicts and, as well, have a greater effect than education and experience on job satisfaction. Also, education and length of experience have greater direct than indirect effects on propensity to leave, indicating that their effects are not via causality of job-related stress.

During face-to-face interactions, only one difference was found between adolescent and nonadolescent mothers: nonadolescent mothers showed more positive affect toward infants. During teaching, nonadolescent mothers talked more, showed more positive affect toward infants, and demonstrated tasks more often. Individual differences during face-to-face interactions were more related to mothers' ego development and support whereas teaching interactions were mostly associated with maternal age. Thus, maternal age was a stronger predictor of interactive style during teaching. This may partially explain noted cognitive deficits in infants of teenage mothers. However, individual differences among all mothers in ego development, education, and support were significantly related to interactions. Thus, teenage mothers with less education and support and lower ego development may represent a higher risk subgroup of adolescent mothers providing less optimal care-giving environments for their infants.","['Levine, L', 'Garcia Coll, C T', 'Oh, W']","['Levine L', 'Garcia Coll CT', 'Oh W']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,AIM IM,"['Adolescent', '*Adolescent Behavior', 'Adult', 'Child Care', 'Educational Status', 'Ego', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Maternal Age', '*Mother-Child Relations', 'Social Support', 'Teaching']",,,,,,,1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 1985 Jan;75(1):23-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Experiment 1, eight groups of food-deprived rats received injections of ethanol (175-1,400 mg/kg) in one environment and were later offered a choice between that environment and a different one previously associated with saline injections. Another eight groups were treated identically, except that food was available in both the saline and ethanol-paired environments. The groups given the drug without food showed no preference or aversion at low doses (175-700 mg/kg), but showed aversion at higher doses (1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg). When food was available, there was an increased preference for the environment paired with the 500 mg/kg dose and reduced aversion at the 1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg doses. In Experiment 2, placing two rats together increased each rat's preference for the environment associated with the other animal. However, rats pretreated with 500 mg/kg ethanol before being placed together showed a reduced preference for the environment associated with the drug and the other animal. Controls never paired with another rat showed no preference or aversion at the same ethanol dose. Thus, ethanol may interact with conditions such as the presence of food or another animal to determine final effects that are unique to those conditions.","['Stewart, R B', 'Grupp, L A']","['Stewart RB', 'Grupp LA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Psychopharmacology (Berl),Psychopharmacology,7608025,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Conditioning, Psychological/drug effects', '*Eating', 'Ethanol/*pharmacology', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Motivation/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Reinforcement, Psychology', 'Self Stimulation', '*Social Environment']",,,,,,,1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Psychopharmacology (Berl). 1985;87(1):43-50. doi: 10.1007/bf00431776.,['3K9958V90M (Ethanol)'],,,['10.1007/bf00431776 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Our implicit assumption has been that social factors in general, and stressors in particular, may play a causal role in the development of psychopathology. Yet the evidence is clear that the vast majority of people who are exposed to stressful life events or to chronic stress situations do not develop significant psychiatric impairments. For this reason, research interest over the past decade has shifted to factors like social support and coping strategies that may ameliorate the impact of stress. We have examined some of the important empirical results from recent studies of stress, support, and coping, and we have discussed ways in which these new understandings have informed long-standing attempts to explain group differences in emotional functioning. In each section of the review we have attempted not only to summarize existing results but also to provide some evaluation of the literature and suggestions for future research. It is important to recognize that the contributors to the work reviewed here do not all share a common research agenda. Some of them are primarily committed to unraveling the psychosocial determinants of a particular clinical disorder. Others are mainly concerned with the effects of a particular stressor. Still others are interested in the processes that link stress to health across a broad array of stress situations and health outcomes. In the face of these diverse interests, it is little wonder that our understanding of social factors in psychopathology is uneven. There is good reason to believe, however that these diverse strands of research are beginning to converge on a common conception of the stress process and on a common research design. The conception at present is only in rough form, but its outlines are nonetheless capable of description. At its center is the notion that stress exposure sets off a process of adaptation. It recognizes that this process unfolds over time, and it acknowledges that this process is modified by structural factors as well as by personal dispositions and vulnerabilities. There is growing recognition that the analysis of this process requires longitudinal methods. Also, it is becoming increasingly clear that experimental interventions are required to unravel the parts of this process that link stress and health. It is too early to know if this nascent convergence will lead to an integrative theory of adaptation, yet it is almost certain to promote methodological and conceptual rigor and facilitate replication and cumulation of findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kessler, R C', 'Price, R H', 'Wortman, C B']","['Kessler RC', 'Price RH', 'Wortman CB']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Psychol,Annual review of psychology,0372374,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'African Americans/psychology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognition', 'Depressive Disorder/psychology', 'European Continental Ancestry Group/psychology', 'Family', 'Humans', '*Life Change Events', 'Mental Disorders/*psychology', 'Models, Psychological', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Adjustment', 'Social Class', '*Social Environment', '*Social Support', 'Stress, Psychological/*psychology']",,,,,,,1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Annu Rev Psychol. 1985;36:531-72. doi: 10.1146/annurev.ps.36.020185.002531.,,,224,['10.1146/annurev.ps.36.020185.002531 [doi]'],"['1P50MH38330/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', '1R01MH37706/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'IK0A MH00707/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Four interrelated questions are examined: What individual attributes are especially important in the formation of friendships among adolescents? Which of two processes, selection or socialization, account for the similarity in values and behaviors observed in ongoing friendship dyads, and how important is similarity in friendship formation and dissolution? What is the nature of friends' influence as compared to parents', and in which domains of adolescent's life do these influences exert themselves? What mechanisms, role modeling or social learning, underlie processes of interpersonal influences? Relational dyadic and triadic samples of adolescents matched to a parent and/or a best friend and observed at one point in time as well as over time provide important and relatively rare sources of data on processes of interpersonal influence. Sociodemographic characteristics are the strongest determinants of friendship formation, with participation in illicit drugs following next in importance. Both selection (assortative pairing) and socialization contribute to observed similarity in friendship pairs. Adolescents coordinate their choice of friends and their values and behaviors, in particular the use of marijuana, so as to maximize congruency in the friendship dyad. If there is a state of unbalance such that the friend's attitude or behavior is inconsistent with the adolescent's, the adolescent will either break off the friendship and seek another friend or will keep the friend and modify his or her own behavior. Both parents and peers can have strong influences on adolescents, depending upon the arena of influence. Parents are especially important for future life plans, while peers are most important for involvement in illicit drug use. However, for drug use itself, there are different patterns of influence depending upon the stage of drug involvement. Peers are especially important for initiation into marijuana use, while parental factors gain in importance in the transition from marijuana use to the use of other illicit drugs. Interpersonal influences of peers on ongoing marijuana and alcohol use result from modeling and imitation more than from social reinforcement and the transmission of values.","['Kandel, D B']",['Kandel DB'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Adv Alcohol Subst Abuse,Advances in alcohol & substance abuse,8107172,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alcoholism/psychology', 'Female', 'Gender Identity', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Marijuana Abuse/psychology', 'Parent-Child Relations', '*Peer Group', '*Personality Development', 'Social Conformity', 'Social Environment', 'Social Facilitation', 'Substance-Related Disorders/*psychology']",,,,,,,1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Alcohol Subst Abuse. 1985 Spring-Summer;4(3-4):139-63. doi: 10.1300/J251v04n03_07.,,,,['10.1300/J251v04n03_07 [doi]'],"['DA00081/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA0064/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA01097/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Smoking behaviour and its determinants in 12-18-year-old subjects.,195-203,"The cross-sectional study of 1980 for atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents aimed at a wide coverage of the relevant relationships of the smoking behaviour to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. The initiation and establishment of the smoking habits were primarily viewed as a function of the youngsters' main socializing agents: the peer group and the family. A subpopulation comprising 1,790 children and adolescents aged 12, 15 and 18 years of the total sample was included in the study on smoking behaviour. The information on smoking habits was collected in connection with the medical examination in a solitary room where the youngsters could respond undisturbed. Data on the children's families were obtained by means of a general questionnaire filled out by the parents. The prevalence of daily smoking was 1% in the 12-year-old, 10% in the 15-year-old, and 30% in the 18-year-old subjects. The best friend's behaviour was the best predictor of an adolescent's smoking behaviour, although the family had retained its role as an important model as regards the learning of smoking behaviour. Quitting school turned out to be a major event leading to an increased risk of becoming a habitual smoker. No clear associations between socioeconomic status of the family and daily smoking were found, except that farmers' children had generally lower rates of daily smoking than children from other socioeconomic groups. First contacts with tobacco formed part of a normal behaviour pattern at a certain age, and this experimentation was unrelated to a later regular habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Byckling, T', 'Sauri, T']","['Byckling T', 'Sauri T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Sweden,Acta Paediatr Scand Suppl,Acta paediatrica Scandinavica.

Four independent variables are examined: social origin, medical school, place of internship, and assimilation to the internship hospital. The great majority of the interns expressed a preference for specialty practice, hospitals, and social security institutions. The role of social origin was to selectively direct students into different medical schools. From then on, the structural attributes of the school itself and of the place of internship, as well as the socialization experiences that took place there, emerged as the most important determinants of career preferences. Such a process, however, tended to produce a ""social specialization"" of interns in terms of the role they expect to play in the medical field. It is argued that this kind of specialization has negative implications for the professional status of physicians, although it also poses a challenge to the development of innovative theories about the process of professionalization in medicine.","['Frenk, J']",['Frenk J'],,['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",United States,Educ Med Salud,Educacion medica y salud,0070163,IM,"['*Career Choice', 'Hospitals, Proprietary', 'Hospitals, Public', 'Humans', '*Internship and Residency', 'Mexico', 'Schools, Medical/supply & distribution', 'Social Adjustment', '*Social Behavior', '*Social Class', '*Social Identification']",,,,,,,1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Educ Med Salud. 1985;19(4):426-51.,,,,,,Efectos del origen social y de la socializacion profesional sobre las preferencias vocacionales de los internos de medicina de Mexico.,,,,,,,,,

I cited, as the chief influence on the context of the relationship between the two, the psychological changes concomitant with the stellar transition from the Piscean to the Aquarian Age and the burdens these changes impose on the psyche of the individual. I talked a bit about the paradoxical nature of the psyche and how it relates to paradoxical psychotherapeutic approaches. I mentioned win, win negotiations as being skills necessary for coping in the Aquarian Age. I also mentioned that our own value system, although absolute for us, is not necessarily binding on the other unless it is mutually agreed upon beforehand. In addition, I spoke about the possibility of many theories and methods, each equally valid and workable in the solution of a particular problem. I said our approach to the patient will depend on our role conception as psychotherapist, our typology, and concomitant with that, our model of psychological processes and the theoretical framework in which it is couched. I have stated what I consider the four key points for all of us to be aware of in order to negotiate the new psychology. We need to differentiate between needs, wants, and entitlement: we are entitled to our needs, but we are ultimately responsible for their fulfillment (which does not necessarily mean that we have to fulfill them ourselves). We need to be aware of the two-pronged aspect of every bit of communication; i.e., the simultaneous factual and directional message contained in each, and yet the selectivity of the tuning in by the receiver. We also need to be aware that any communication can imply a message about the object discussed or about one's subjective relation to it, as well as the confusion and rage that can be caused by ambiguities and the misunderstanding of which of the two has been meant. We have to learn to live with the fact that all of us have one area of our personality that is reasonably well adapted and another one that is still young and needs all our (and others') help that it can get.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Ujhely, G B']",['Ujhely GB'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Perspect Psychiatr Care,Perspectives in psychiatric care,0401133,IM N,"['Astrology', 'Communication', 'Consciousness', 'Ego', 'Extraversion, Psychological', 'Humans', 'Introversion, Psychological', '*Nurse-Patient Relations', '*Psychiatric Nursing', 'Social Values', 'Symbolism']",,,,,,,1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Perspect Psychiatr Care. 1985;23(4):131-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1744-6163.1985.tb00269.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1744-6163.1985.tb00269.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

It was undertaken in a somewhat different drinking culture (Sweden) and with a group of alcoholics also containing patients relapsing after a longer period of abstinence than those in the Marlatt and Gordon study. The difference in drinking culture is reflected in the finding that most subjects in this study took their first drink at home. The group studied by Marlatt and Gordon in Seattle most frequently started to drink in a bar or restaurant. In spite of the differences between the groups, we arrive at a similar picture when it comes to the distribution of relapse determinants according to the model proposed by Marlatt and Gordon. The categories not only have face validity but also construct validity, reflected in meaningful correlations with results on an intelligence test and a personality inventory. A descriptive analysis shows that subjects with poorer results on the intelligence test and having a high tendency to muscle tension and somatized anxiety tended to relapse in intrapersonal situations. Patients who do not readily adjust to other persons' opinions relapsed in interpersonal conflicts, and patients who are more impulsive could not resist social pressure to drink.","['Sandahl, C']",['Sandahl C'],,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Addict,The International journal of the addictions,0123640,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Alcoholism/psychology/*rehabilitation', '*Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Personality Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Social Adjustment', 'Social Environment', 'Sweden']",,,,,,,1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Addict. 1984 Dec;19(8):833-48. doi: 10.3109/10826088409061989.,,,,['10.3109/10826088409061989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Females more than males believed alcoholics to be socially inadequate and anxious and that there was too much social pressure and not enough prohibitions against drinking. Middle-aged rather than younger or older people tended to explain alcoholism in terms of poor education, social and cultural pressures and biological or genetic mechanisms. However, there were few differences in the ratings of heavy, moderate, light and non-drinkers. Factor analysis revealed six factors labelled psychological stress, personal and social problems, psychoanalytic theories, sociocultural explanations, biological or genetic explanations and social desirability or pressure. The results are discussed in terms of the research on lay understandings of psychological and medical phenomena, and the relationship between explicit and implicit theories.","['Furnham, A', 'Lowick, V']","['Furnham A', 'Lowick V']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Med Psychol,The British journal of medical psychology,0370640,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Alcoholism/*psychology', '*Attitude', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Social Environment', 'Social Values', 'Stress, Psychological/complications']",,,,,,,1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Med Psychol. 1984 Dec;57 ( Pt 4):319-32. doi: 10.1111/j.2044-8341.1984.tb02597.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.2044-8341.1984.tb02597.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The different therapeutical strategies can be analysed in terms of behavior modification through an action upon the physical and social determinants of the environment. The authors present two complementary methods of revalidation: an individualised reeducation of necessary behaviors for a social autonomy (toilet, dressing, continence) and a program of physical and psychic activation, to maintain or reestablish social skills (management of the institutional environment, physical mobilisation, ergotherapy and sociotherapy). These methods are relevant to the functional analysis and behavior modification.

Performance on the learning task was scored for the number of correct responses (maximizing) and for the frequency of three-step sequences reflecting variability, systematic patterning, and perseveration. In general, the three curiosity factors related negatively to maximizing and perseveration and positively to variability. (The same effects were found for activity level.) Systematic patterning related positively to one curiosity type and negatively to another. Girls used less maximizing and more systematic patterning than boys. The response choices of girls were affected more by differences in conceptual curiosity and those of boys by differences in curiosity about the complex. Activity level was unrelated to gender but differed with SES. The findings demonstrate the role of different curiosity factors in shaping response sequences and suggest some reasons for children's choice of probability-learning strategies.","['Kreitler, S', 'Zigler, E', 'Kreitler, H']","['Kreitler S', 'Zigler E', 'Kreitler H']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Genet Psychol,The Journal of genetic psychology,2985112R,IM,"['Child', '*Child Behavior', 'Discrimination Learning', '*Exploratory Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Probability Learning', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Class']",,,,,,,1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Genet Psychol. 1984 Sep;145(1ST Half):61-75. doi: 10.1080/00221325.1984.10532251.,,,,['10.1080/00221325.1984.10532251 [doi]'],['HD-03009/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

As expected, we found differences in the subjective experiences of social and emotional loneliness, although both forms of loneliness were also characterized by a common core of experiences. The results generally supported Weiss's ideas concerning the determinants of social and emotional loneliness. Predictions concerning the affective and behavioral consequences associated with each type of loneliness, however, were only partly supported, although the two forms of loneliness were associated with different affective reactions and coping behaviors.

One possibility is that individuals determine their attitudes toward a social group by assessing their reactions to an imagined group representative who embodies the defining or central group characteristics--the prototypical group member. When they encounter a specific group member whose characteristics match well those of the ""attitude prototype"", individuals display attitude-behavior consistency; when the match is poor, they display attitude-behavior inconsistency. This proposition was tested in two experiments, and in each the attitude-behavior relationship was greater in relation to prototypical than to unprototypical group members. In addition, knowledge of an unprototypical group member had little or no effect on attitude prototypes. Rather, the unprototypical group member was dismissed as atypical, leaving the prototype intact to influence future social behavior. The implications for attitude change, and possible applications to more abstract attitudes, are discussed.","['Lord, C G', 'Lepper, M R', 'Mackie, D']","['Lord CG', 'Lepper MR', 'Mackie D']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pers Soc Psychol,Journal of personality and social psychology,0014171,IM,"['Adult', '*Attitude', 'Humans', '*Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', '*Personality', 'Set, Psychology', 'Social Desirability']",,,,,,,1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pers Soc Psychol. 1984 Jun;46(6):1254-66. doi: 10.1037//0022-3514.46.6.1254.,,,,['10.1037//0022-3514.46.6.1254 [doi]'],['MH36093/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Some researchers have argued that women who have more than one induced abortion are less well adjusted, others that they are less willing to use contraceptives, perhaps because of anxiety about sexuality. Still others have suggested that repeat abortion is unrelated to the psychology or attitudes of individual women, but rather is an inevitable result of imperfect contraceptives, imperfect contraceptive practice and the availability of legal abortion for the termination of unwanted pregnancies. A group of 580 women seeking abortions were interviewed at the Montreal General Hospital and given a number of psychological tests. About one in five of these women were having repeat abortions. The women having repeat abortions were older, less likely to be married and more tolerant of legal abortion than were women having their first abortions. They also had intercourse more frequently than the first-abortion patients. Women obtaining a repeat abortion were slightly more likely to have been using contraceptives at the time they became pregnant, but they did not differ from first-abortion patients in the types of methods that they used. On no other social or demographic characteristics, measures of psychological adjustment or attitudes about sexuality were there any important differences between the groups. A more complex statistical analysis reveals that the two most important factors differentiating first-abortion and repeat-abortion patients are age and coital frequency--both of which are variables that reflect added exposure to the risk of unintended pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Berger, C', 'Gold, D', 'Andres, D', 'Gillett, P', 'Kinch, R']","['Berger C', 'Gold D', 'Andres D', 'Gillett P', 'Kinch R']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Fam Plann Perspect,Family planning perspectives,0241370,IM J,"['*Abortion, Induced/psychology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Canada', 'Contraception/methods', 'Contraception Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Personality', 'Pregnancy', 'Psychological Tests', 'Reoperation', 'Sexual Behavior']","['PIP: 023510', 'POP: 00131323']",,,['PIP'],"['*Abortion Seekers', '*Abortion Seekers, Repeated--determinants', '*Abortion, Induced', 'Age Factors', 'Americas', '*Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Canada', '*Comparative Studies', 'Contraception', '*Contraceptive Usage--women', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Family Planning', 'Fertility Control, Postconception', 'Marriage Patterns', 'North America', '*Northern America', '*Psychological Factors', 'Psychology', 'Research Methodology', '*Research Report', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sex Behavior', 'Studies', '*Surveys', 'Testing']",['PIP: TJ: FAMILY PLANNING PERSPECTIVES.'],1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Fam Plann Perspect. 1984 Mar-Apr;16(2):70-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However 36% of the non-social class related excess involved rheumatic and hypertensive heart disease, nephritis, bronchiectasis, diabetes and tuberculosis which were all associated with a Maori mortality five or more times that for non-Maoris.

This relationship was conceptualized as a multi-faceted one which may be understood in terms of direct (main), protective (buffering) and compensatory effects. Hypotheses relating to these effects were evaluated in terms of spousal/community support and job strains (pressure, autonomy, opportunities) among a sample of 455 married males who were employed on a full-time basis. Results indicated that spousal support generally had more important implications for psychological well-being than did community support. However, the relative impact of these different sources of support appeared to be related to the degree to which the mental health symptomology reported was affectively defined. With respect to protective effects, spousal support was found to moderate the relationship between certain job strains (pressure) and mental health. No protective effects were found for community support. Tests of the hypothesis that community support compensates for low levels of spousal support were made in terms of both direct and protective effects. No direct effect compensation was observed. However, protective effect compensation was observed for certain job strains (opportunities) and was relevant to a wide range of symptomology. The overall results suggest a primary/secondary hierarchy of supports and strains in which primary supports (e.g. spousal) assume a protective function with respect to secondary strains (e.g. job) while secondary supports (e.g. community) do not protect individuals from primary strains (e.g. spousal). Secondary supports have a protective function for secondary strains in the absence of primary supports.

Social and psychological determinants are sought for these ""non-organic failure to thrive"" (N-O FTT) cases. Social and psychological differences between non-organic and organic cases are also explored here. With the introduction of the term, ""maternal deprivation,"" medical practitioners have implicated mothers' deficiencies as instrumental in the etiology of N-O FTT. However, these mothers are themselves usually deprived. Lack of cooperation in childcare by both parents is noted when classic clinical cases are reviewed. We suggest that the concept, ""parental deprivation,"" provides a more accurate model. Preliminary research findings support our hypothesis that mothers of FTT infants do not have good social support networks. Teen motherhood and socioeconomic status also appear to be important, but not necessary as determinants. An unexpected finding is that there are few differences in the social deficiencies of families of N-O FTT infants as compared to those failing for organic reasons. Two unanticipated findings appear noteworthy. First, infants failing for organic reasons are significantly smaller and thinner at birth, independent of pregnancy complications or prematurity. Second, infants failing for non-organic reasons are more likely to present during the period of infant-caretaker role development and less likely in the later toddler stage. Additional research into the feasibility of strengthening family supports as a basis of intervention is recommended.","['Gagan, R J', 'Cupoli, J M', 'Watkins, A H']","['Gagan RJ', 'Cupoli JM', 'Watkins AH']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Child Abuse Negl,Child abuse & neglect,7801702,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Birth Order', 'Child, Preschool', 'Failure to Thrive/*genetics/psychology', 'Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Mothers/*psychology', '*Psychosocial Deprivation', 'Risk', 'Social Environment', 'Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Child Abuse Negl. 1984;8(1):93-103. doi: 10.1016/0145-2134(84)90054-1.,,,,"['0145-2134(84)90054-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2134(84)90054-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

A program for malaria eradication has been in operation in Colombia since 1953, and the malaria incidence rate was falling until 1971. However, in recent years the rate has begun to rise again in affected areas of the country. The resurgence of the disease leads one to think that traditional methods of controlling it are approaching the saturation point, and a reassessment of the determinants of the problem is needed in order to identify social and economic factors that might be playing an important role by themselves or in association with epidemiological or health determinants of the disease. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology which is being applied to the analysis of social, economic and health determinants of malaria incidence in Colombia. The model is theoretically based on a home economics framework. However, an expansion of the original version is made to take into account social and organizational factors which are thought to be important in the Colombian case. Economic variables included in the testing of the model are income, wealth and occupation. Social variables include education and housing conditions. Health factors considered are nutrition and health services. The model is tested using data collected in July 1982 in one of the most malaria affected areas of Colombia, and preliminary results are presented.","['Banguero, H']",['Banguero H'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Colombia', 'Educational Status', 'Health Services/supply & distribution', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Malaria/economics/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Mathematics', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Sanitation', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1984;19(10):1099-104. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(84)90313-7.,,,,['10.1016/0277-9536(84)90313-7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Two specific theories are tested with these constructs. Each theory predicts a different structural arrangement among these latent factors with the fundamental difference being whether behavior predicts responsiveness or vice-versa.

Within the context of overall social and economic change, Mozambique has given priority to primary health care as the driving force in its newly developed National Health Service. The urban and rural health centres are intended to be the principal vehicles for PHC delivery, and in this study one of Maputo's recently opened health centres was investigated by observing all clinic sessions, interviewing all health centre workers and collecting data from health centre records. It was found that a dichotomy exists between the tasks ascribed to the health centre in the PHC framework, and the feasibility of their execution given existing personnel and material resources. This derives in part from lack of involvement of PHC practitioners in the organisation and planning of PHC, plus resource allocation which remains in favour of secondary and tertiary rather than primary care. Prevention is accorded priority in PHC theory, yet investigation showed that the major demand on the health centre is for curative care. The quality of both curative and preventive care was evaluated and the need for training in specialist diagnostic skills, and a more socially-based understanding of the determinants of health status and risk emerged, respectively for the groups of workers in the two sectors. The level of contact between the curative and preventive sectors was investigated as was the integration of the health centre into the health service as a whole. The problems arising in these areas must be viewed in the context of the very recent development of a National Health Service in a country where, previously, curative care was available only in urban areas and virtually no preventive programmes existed. This study shows that significant steps are being taken to develop a comprehensive PHC programme in Maputo. More important still will be the extension of this level of care provision to the country as a whole.","['Jelley, D', 'Madeley, R J']","['Jelley D', 'Madeley RJ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Soc Sci Med,Social science & medicine (1982),8303205,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Community Health Centers/statistics & numerical data', 'Community Health Nursing', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Female', 'Health Priorities', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mozambique', 'Preventive Health Services/organization & administration', 'Primary Health Care/*organization & administration/standards', 'Public Health Administration', 'State Medicine', 'Urban Health']",,,,,,,1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Soc Sci Med. 1984;19(8):773-82. doi: 10.1016/0277-9536(84)90392-7.,,,,['10.1016/0277-9536(84)90392-7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Hormonally, XYY men had significantly higher concentrations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than matched control groups. In contrast, XXY men had higher levels of LH, FSH, and prolactin, but low concentrations of testosterone. There was a significantly positive relation among all subjects as well as XY controls alone between plasma testosterone level and evidence of criminal convictions. A proportionate increase in testosterone levels was noted when subjects were divided into nondelinquents, delinquents without violent convictions, and delinquents with violent convictions. The relation between testosterone level and criminal behavior was not reflected in measures of aggression derived from the psychological interview and projective tests.

Positive results have been achieved with early education programming for developmentally disabled children, as well as with medical treatment for some genetically induced metabolic disorders. Results from longitudinal studies suggest that intelligence continues to develop in educable mentally retarded adolescents. New diagnostic methods have been developed; test of motor skills, visuomotor coordination, and a developmental test for young infants.

Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females.","['Aylward, E', 'Walker, E', 'Bettes, B']","['Aylward E', 'Walker E', 'Bettes B']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Schizophr Bull,Schizophrenia bulletin,0236760,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', '*Intelligence', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/psychology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia/genetics', '*Schizophrenic Psychology', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Class', 'Stanford-Binet Test', 'Wechsler Scales']",,,,,,,1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Schizophr Bull. 1984;10(3):430-59. doi: 10.1093/schbul/10.3.430.,,,96,['10.1093/schbul/10.3.430 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Two analysis procedures are used. In the first, respondents were asked to list strategies they use when they have problems. These responses are 'broken down' by drug use categories or 'taking pills'. In the second procedure, attempts are made to interpret the correlations between age, sex, marital status, education and drug use by introducing variables which measure how respondents were experiencing fundamental aspects of their lives (role stress items) and mental health variables. A substantial portion of the variance in drug use that is explained by demographic variables appears to operate through social role and mental health variables, that is, these latter variables interpret the demographic/drug use relationships in a way that is consistent with a coping perspective.

It was found that age at marriage was not related to a variety of socio-economic measures, to parental restrictions on courtship, nor to birth order or number of siblings. Direct economic motivations appear to have affected length of courtship but scarcely age at marriage. Ages at marriage differ in different areas of Madrid, even when key demographic and social variables are controlled; and evidence from a sub-sample of interviews suggests that it may be a characteristic of different families.

Frequently, health promotion focuses almost exclusively on intrapsychic determinants and on individual level behavior. Based upon Field Theory and attitude theories, this proposed model holds that in populations with comparable sociodemographic and biological status (exogenous variables) a health behavior is a function of direct and interaction effects of five key intrapsychic and external variables. These are: behavioral intentions, social support, accessibility of means for action, personal autonomy, and action situation. Empirical tests with cross-cultural studies in Venezuela, Kenya, and the Philippines provide substantial support for the model. The findings suggest that while health promotion strategies should deal with intrapsychic determinants of behavior, key extrapsychic factors (such as social support, quality and accessibility of health care measures, and situational factors) all have direct and independent effects on health behavior as well. Health promotion research and interventions which aim exclusively at intrapsychic determinants would thus have rather limited overall value. The article discusses key research and policy implications of the model presented.","['Kar, S B']",['Kar SB'],"['University of California, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int Q Community Health Educ,International quarterly of community health education,8010942,,,,,,,,,1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['2010/09/16 06:00'],"['2010/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Int Q Community Health Educ. 1983 Jan 1;4(4):311-41. doi: 10.2190/5N5Y-A1XU-7TN0-9E89.,,,,"['5N5YA1XU7TN09E89 [pii]', '10.2190/5N5Y-A1XU-7TN0-9E89 [doi]']",,,,,,10.2190/5N5Y-A1XU-7TN0-9E89 [doi],,,,,

Familial associations of measures in body habitus were assessed in two and three generation kindreds, in parents and their pediatric offspring (less than 20-yr-old), parents and their adult offspring (less than or equal to 20-yr-old), and in pediatric and adult siblings. The cohort included 177 randomly recalled probands and 202 probands from a hyperlipidemic recall group (top decile plasma cholesterol and/or triglyceride). In randomly recalled whites, significant associations of body mass indices in parents and pediatric offspring and in pediatric siblings, and the absence of significant correlations in parents and adult offspring and in adult siblings, emphasize the potency of common household environmental effects relative to within-family similarities for shared body habitus. In whites from the hyperlipidemic recall group, only the mother-pediatric and adult offspring correlations for body mass indices were significant. We speculate that mothers and their offspring from kindreds selected by hyperlipidemic probands are more likely than fathers and their offspring to share eating habits and relative ponderosity, with these communal behaviors outlasting the period of common household environment. Alternatively, and speculatively, in the hyperlipidemic recall group, determinants for ponderosity may be shared more by mothers and their offspring than by fathers and their offspring. Particularly in the random recall group, within-family associations of body mass indices primarily reflect shared common household environments, and probably secondarily, the outcome of genes held in common.","['Khoury, P', 'Morrison, J A', 'Laskarzewski, P M', 'Glueck, C J']","['Khoury P', 'Morrison JA', 'Laskarzewski PM', 'Glueck CJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Metabolism,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,0375267,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Family Characteristics', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lipids/blood', 'Male', 'New Jersey', 'Obesity/*genetics', '*Social Environment']",,,,,,,1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Metabolism. 1983 Jan;32(1):82-9. doi: 10.1016/0026-0495(83)90161-0.,['0 (Lipids)'],,,"['0026-0495(83)90161-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0026-0495(83)90161-0 [doi]']","['RR 00068-20/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00068-20-2/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Menarche, on average, occurs later in athletes, including ballet dancers, than in the general population. With few exceptions, the data are consistent across several countries. Swimmers are an exception to the tendency towards later menarche in athletes. In all samples of swimmers surveyed but one, menarche tends to approximate the average for the general population. The menarcheal data are consistent with other indices of biological maturity status, i.e., skeletal age and secondary sex character development. The data dealing with the effects of intensive physical training on menarche are reviewed and given the number of factors involved, it is difficult to implicate training as a factor which specifically delays menarche. A two-part hypothesis for the apparent maturity delay in athletes is thus suggested. The hypothesis combines biological selective factors (i.e., physique and skill) and social factors. Family size and composition, however, must receive more consideration. Family size influences the timing of menarche and such a trend is apparent in data for several groups of athletes.","['Malina, R M']",['Malina RM'],,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Hum Biol,Annals of human biology,0404024,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Anthropometry', 'Body Composition', 'Child', 'Diet', 'Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Menarche', 'Physical Education and Training', '*Sports Medicine', 'Swimming']",,,,,,,1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hum Biol. 1983 Jan-Feb;10(1):1-24. doi: 10.1080/03014468300006141.,,,,['10.1080/03014468300006141 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts.","['Gruber, K J', 'Jones, R J']","['Gruber KJ', 'Jones RJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Child Abuse Negl,Child abuse & neglect,7801702,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Child Abuse', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Juvenile Delinquency/psychology', 'North Carolina', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Peer Group', 'Rape', 'Risk', '*Sex Offenses', 'Social Environment']",,,,,,,1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Child Abuse Negl. 1983;7(1):17-24. doi: 10.1016/0145-2134(83)90025-x.,,,,"['0145-2134(83)90025-X [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2134(83)90025-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

An alternate position is put forth which explains those occupational health and safety policies as primarily the result of different degrees of political power of the two major classes (capital and labor) and the set of influences exerted on the regulatory agencies by the instruments (e.g., political parties, unions, trade organizations) of those classes. It is shown how an analysis of the historical evolution of those classes in Sweden and their conflict in both civil and political societies better explains the Swedish occupational health and safety policies than the mere analysis of the regulators' views. It is concluded that the occupational health and safety policies in Sweden are not identical to the U.S. policies--as the ""technocratic"" theorists assume--but rather they offer more protection to the workers than the U.S. ones. This situation is a result of labor's greater power in Sweden than in the United States.

Review of the literature.,375-407,"Since the Industrial Revolution there has been an almost continuous decline in breastfeeding in North-America and western Europe. But the last years numerous studies report that breastfeeding is regaining popularity. The social forces responsible for this are a back-to-nature movement, ecological concerns, breastfeeding support groups and a renewed interest by scientists, the health profession and national and international organizations. Many determinants of child feeding behaviour have been analyzed extensively: ethnic and cultural background, socioeconomic and employment status, maternal (age, parity, marital status) and child (sex, birthweight) characteristics, maternal knowledge and attitudes, health care management. Still the relative influence of these factors can only be estimated, partly because of a lack of an accurate methodology. The reasons mentioned with regard to weaning often indicate a lack of confidence intensified by deficiencies in information and support systems. The negative influence of the infant food industry on breastfeeding behaviour cannot be disregarded. Clearly the promotion of breastfeeding in our society is a policy matter, requiring positive action in the field of health education; legislation, research and the reorganization of health services.","['Reniers, J R', 'Peeters, R F', 'Meheus, A Z']","['Reniers JR', 'Peeters RF', 'Meheus AZ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,7608039,IM,"['Attitude', '*Breast Feeding', 'Culture', 'Ethnology', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Illegitimacy', 'Infant, Low Birth Weight', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Mothers/psychology', 'Parity', 'Postnatal Care', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Care', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States']",,,,,,,1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 1983;31(4):375-407.,,,127,,,,,,,,,,,,

Schools of thought in the health field].,363-97,"The article considers the answers given by different schools of thought to the fundamental questions about the degree of autonomy of medicine and the kind of articulation between medicine and society as a whole and in its ""parts."" The answers vary with the thinking in the different social sciences and the philosophic schools associated with them. The author divides his presentation in two broad chapters: The first covers schools of thought in the health field, and attempts to delineate the philosophical foundations underlying the principal current schools of thought in this field, without attempting a history of the philosophical schools or analyzing each of them in detail. Thus, two idealist currents are studied which have exerted great influence in the health field--neopositivism and neo-Kantianism--and marxism as the materialist school, which recognizes the primary of matter, nature, and objective reality, and views consciousness as a property of matter. The second chapter considers the theoretical contest now going on among the schools of thought discussed in the first chapter, which try to explain the relationship between medicine and the social structure; the effectiveness of medical action, and the social determinants of disease. Prior to the seventies, the author says, the dominant view of the autonomy of medicine, its effectiveness, the potential for social change of the medical institutions, and the benefits to health of economic development, was endorsed by the predominance of positivism among these schools of medical thought. The view that medicine was broadly autonomous and at the same level with other subsystems such as the economic, the political and the educational subsystems, assumed the possibility of changing society by an effort begun through any of these ""sectors."" The enormous growth of productive forces that took place in the developed capitalist countries during the fifties, and even more during the sixties, collided at the end of the latter decade with the existing social production relations, which checked the progress of the production forces and generated a series of challenges in civil society to the aims of economic development and the achievements of science in relation to the inequality of the distribution of wealth. In the health sector, this was a time of criticism of the positivist view and of pointing out the negative effects of medicalization, highlighting the ideological and self-perpetuating character of medical institutions, and proposals for the demedicalization of society.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Garcia, J C']",['Garcia JC'],,['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Educ Med Salud,Educacion medica y salud,0070163,IM Q,"['History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Philosophy', '*Philosophy, Medical', 'Public Health', 'Social Conditions/*trends']",,,,,,,1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Educ Med Salud. 1983;17(4):363-97.,,,,,,Medicina y sociedad.

As the major ""mental illness"" affecting human beings, it has defied all previous attempts to explain, predict or prevent its devastating clinical manifestations. In addition to unidentified nongenetic determinants, schizophrenia has genetic determinants in the absence of known specific neuropathological or biochemical correlates found in other entities conceptualized as genetic diseases. The fitness of schizophrenics is 0.7 of nonschizophrenics, and a 1% phenotypic population frequency is difficult to explain by mutation rate alone. An ethological theory of schizophrenia has been developed in which the genetic determinant is the nocturnal character of a postulated polymorphic trait termed when active. The nongenetic determinant is simply a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light. According to the author's theory, a schizophrenic individual could be processing information while awake and exposed to light with a brain that is processing information as though he were asleep. The empirical data from which the theory is constructed are presented. THe theory is capable of explaining clinical schizophrenia within an ethological paradigm and makes several predictions, the most significant of which is that the absence of a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light should ameliorate the major symptoms of clinical schizophrenia in individuals who possess its genetic determinant.","['Feierman, J R']",['Feierman JR'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Blindness/psychology', 'Catatonia', '*Darkness', 'Ethology', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Memory', 'Narcolepsy/psychology', 'Schizophrenia/*etiology/genetics', 'Seasons', 'Sleep/physiology', 'Social Isolation']",,,,,,,1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 1982 Nov;9(5):455-79. doi: 10.1016/0306-9877(82)90016-0.,,,,"['0306-9877(82)90016-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0306-9877(82)90016-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Subjects included residents, faculty members, and practitioners recruited from a variety of university-affiliated and community hospitals. It was hypothesized that physicians whose moral reasoning was more fully developed would less actively treat particular cases. Such cases might include those where a patient's family requested such a limit (designated ""negative family attitude"") or the quality of life likely to be led after therapy was so low as to preclude even a minimal degree of human activity or social interaction (designated ""unsalvageable prognosis""). The hypothesis was tested through the use of two questionnaires. The first questionnaire, devised by Crane, assessed the physician's reported degree of activism in treating six cases of infants born with severe defects. The structure of moral reasoning was measured by a second questionnaire, Rest's Defining Issue Test. Subjects were scored by the degree to which they use universal, ethical principles in resolving a series of moral dilemmas. Results of the absolute level of activism (Table 1) showed that among both residents and postresidents, the degree to which cases are actively treated depends, for salvageable patients, on the type of damage and on the possibility for research. Results involving moral reasoning showed a different pattern among residents and postresidents. Among residents, a significant correlation exists between principled reasoning and the absence of active treatment (r = - 0.41, Form A; r = - 0.23, Form B). As predicted, such correlations were strongest for cases of negative family attitude or of unsalvageable prognosis. The pattern of correlations among postresidents showed either no relationship to moral reasoning or the reverse of the residency pattern (r = -0.08, Form A; r = 0.30, Form B). The influence of the type of institution a resident operates within was assessed by analysis of variance. Inasmuch as moral reasoning and institutional type both had significant main effects (Form A), their magnitude differed.

The results indicated that no dose of PCA alone yielded mortality under individual housing, and similarly no environmental circumstance by itself yielded mortality in the absence of PCA. However, various drug-environment interactions produced a dose-related enhancement of PCA toxicity. For both 5.0 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg parachloroamphetamine dose levels, restraint-plus-shock generated the highest percent mortality, followed by restraint-only, with conspecific aggregation producing a mortality incidence lower still. Further, the mortality displayed under each of these environmental conditions was greater for the 10.0 mg/kg PCA treatment than for the 5.0 mg/kg treatment. The results are discussed in terms of the relative aversiveness of the environmental setting and it is suggested that stress-related drug toxicity may be further analyzed in non-social settings. It is proposed that toxic environment-PCA interactions may result from altered cardiovascular and/or thermoregulatory processes, mediated by enhanced catecholaminergic activity.","['Gallus, J A', 'Sewell, R G Jr', 'Nearchou, N I', 'Gault, F P']","['Gallus JA', 'Sewell RG Jr', 'Nearchou NI', 'Gault FP']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pharmacol Biochem Behav,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",0367050,IM S,"['Amphetamines/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Electroshock', '*Environment', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Restraint, Physical', '*Social Environment', 'p-Chloroamphetamine/*pharmacology']",['NASA: 83065499'],,,,,,1982/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1982 Sep;17(3):467-71. doi: 10.1016/0091-3057(82)90306-9.,"['0 (Amphetamines)', '64-12-0 (p-Chloroamphetamine)']",,,"['0091-3057(82)90306-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0091-3057(82)90306-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

The theoretical approach was to identify the elements of successful aging under the conditions of swiss society, which are: the quality and degrees of independence and self determination of personality, continuity of the manner of living and adequate handling of the changing conditions of life in the third age including physical, mental, communicational and economic mutations. To reach this goal the survey measured the socio-economic conditions of the investigated population, their psycho-physical ability, how old people compensate deficits: the conditions essential for life, integration in leisure, private contacts, public opinions and political participation. The results show that a great majority is satisfied with the conditions of dwelling, occupation and economic conditions. But in all dimensions of life we also found minorities oppressed, threatened or deprived. Psycho-physical fitness proved to be in good state for a great majority and only a few percent were in a physical or mental condition which did not grant them independence and self-determination.

Cellular immune responses are apparently suppressed, but high titer EBV-specific antibodies of IgG class may compensate. The antibodies cross the placenta and protect the infant against primary infection for many months. Reactivation of EBV in pregnancy and oral excretion of virus by normal pregnant women could be one explanation why young children in large sibships (among families of low social classes) become infected early in life. Infants are likely infected by EBV from their pregnant mothers who shed virus in saliva. Moreover, the natural protection for several months in the perinatal period against Burkitt lymphoma and fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases in congenitally immune deficient children is explained.

The findings were significant. For level of life expectancy the results of this present work conform by and large to results of other scholars in this area, although the present work is unique in that only developing countries were included. From the 1960's to the 1970's there has been a shift in the relative importance of economic indicators and general social indicators in favor of the social indicators. In the period 1960-65 some 70% of the variation in levels of life expectancy was associated with per capita income and literacy rates in a ratio of about three to two in favor of the economic variable. By 1970-75 the ratio has become six to one in favor of literacy. In addition, the multivariate model showed that the sanitation variables began to appear as significant correlates of levels of life expectancy in the more recent time period, playing a larger role than level of income per capita.

The help-seeking process is considered in two stages. The first stage starts from the recognition of initial symptoms and ends in the first contact with a mental health professional. The second stage is defined as that time between the first contact and actual participation in a planned treatment program. In both stages, patients typically go through phases of lay consultation, nonpsychiatric professional consultation, and referral. The multiple steps which are usually involved in help seeking often result in significant delay of both mental health contact and treatment. The help-seeking process was found to correlate strongly with ethnicity. Both Asians and Blacks showed more extended family involvement, and the involvement of key family members tended to be persistent and intensive in Asians. Ethnicity was also associated with the length of delay, with Asians showing the longest delay and Caucasians the least. These ethnic differences were also reflected in help-seeking pathway assignment using Lin's criteria. Although modernity and parochialism, as measured by the level of modernization and the cohesiveness of the social network system of the subjects, were also found to be correlated with delay, they appeared to exert an influence independent from that of ethnicity.","['Lin, K M', 'Inui, T S', 'Kleinman, A M', 'Womack, W M']","['Lin KM', 'Inui TS', 'Kleinman AM', 'Womack WM']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Nerv Ment Dis,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,0375402,AIM IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Community Mental Health Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Ethnic Groups/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Marriage', 'Mental Disorders/*therapy', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Alienation', 'Social Environment', '*Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1982/02/01 00:00,1982/02/01 00:01,['1982/02/01 00:00'],"['1982/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nerv Ment Dis. 1982 Feb;170(2):78-85. doi: 10.1097/00005053-198202000-00003.,,,,['10.1097/00005053-198202000-00003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

A review with applications for Israel.,197-209,"Health care systems throughout the world are being scrutinized because of their growing cost in relations to national wealth. At the same time, techniques for evaluating health care with respect to appropriateness, quality and resource allocation are being developed. These techniques are multifactorial since they must relate to all aspects of health care including: characteristics of the population being served; available health care resources; measures of the process and utilization of care; measures of health care outcomes; peer review, including quality assessment of health care providers; consumer attitudes, knowledge, and compliance; care provided for ""tracer"" or sample conditions; and economic cost-benefit studies. Evaluation in health care assumes that a health care system and the providers of health care within that system are responsible and accountable for the health status of the population. It must, however, recognize that health services are not the sole determinants of health status; social, economic and cultural factors also play key roles. A comprehensive approach to evaluation in health care is outlined in this review. Many of the components that are available in the Israeli health care system are described; others that remain to be developed are discussed. Evaluation is an integral part of a comprehensive health care system; the components of evaluation must be built into any national system.

That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting.","['Lebeau, A']",['Lebeau A'],,['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Canada,Sante Ment Que,Sante mentale au Quebec,9424773,,,,,,,,,1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sante Ment Que. 1982;7(1):57-74.,,,,['030125ar [pii]'],,Les grands utilisateurs des services psychiatriques d'urgence dans la region du Montreal metropolitain.,,,,,,,,,

For intercourse, primarily ADL-dependence and impaired cutaneous sensibility were major negative determinants. Moreover, subjects with previously known arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus had changed relatively less than those without these ailments, probably due to pre-stroke reductions.

The social psychological variables together were found to explain only a small proportion of the variance in satisfaction, although their contribution varied with the dimension of satisfaction. Expectations consistantly explained most of the variance in satisfaction ratings; particularly noteworthy was the direct effect of prior expectations of the doctor's conduct on subsequent satisfaction with that dimension of the care received. Values had little independent effect on satisfaction, and the combination of values and expectations (their interaction) was unrelated to satisfaction. Feelings of entitlement were also unrelated to satisfaction ratings. There was some support for the discrepancy model, which holds that the greater the discrepancy between perceived occurrences and prior expectations the less the satisfaction.

Recent research suggests that broader economic, social and environmental forces are the determinants of many diseases and of behaviours that contribute to ill health. Furthermore, health education programmes seeking only to change behaviour have not been particularly effective in making significant improvements in morbidity or mortality. Finally, behavior change strategies locate the problem within the individual, leading to a tendency to blame the victim for the disease. This paper offers an alternative approach to health education, an approach which seeks to involve citizens in identifying and addressing social and environmental threats to health. From the practices of the women's health movement, the movement for occupational safety and health and the environmental movement in the United States in the last decade, an expanded foundation for health education is suggested. The following principles are illustrated: 1. Health education programmes must include informational, behavioural, political, legal and economic components; 2. Health education for social change recognizes the political character of health and disease; 3. Health education efforts can be rooted in popular struggles for a more just and humane society. 4. Health education activities should address people's day-to-day concerns about their lives and their health. The paper concludes with some specific recommendations on how health educators can include action for social change in their practice.","['Freudenberg, N']",['Freudenberg N'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Health Educ,International journal of health education,0374721,IM,"['*Behavior', 'Ethics, Medical', '*Health Education', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Occupations/trends', '*Public Health', '*Social Change', 'United States', ""Women's Rights""]",,,,,,,1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Health Educ. 1982;24(3):138-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although such apparently diverse factors usually are analyzed independently, they might be combined to provide a more complete understanding of the determinants of health and disease. The paper reaches the conclusion that any substantive solutions to the problems of Lesotho will be found primarily in the wider southern Africa setting, and not within the context of small, dependent national states. At the same time, these small, dependent national states must make development decisions considering existing geopolitical realities. Foresightful decision making on these issues could both contribute immediately to the health of the people of Lesotho, and also increase in longer-term possibilities for a better life for all the people of southern Africa.","['Gish, O']",['Gish O'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Health Polit Policy Law,"Journal of health politics, policy and law",7609331,IM J,"['Agriculture', 'Decision Making', 'Delivery of Health Care/*economics', '*Health', 'Health Services/supply & distribution', '*Health Status', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Lesotho', 'Morbidity', 'National Health Programs', 'Socioeconomic Factors']","['CPFH: 10677cr982', 'POP: 00107365']",,,['PIP'],"['Delivery Of Health Care', 'Demographic Factors', '*Economic Development', 'Economic Factors', 'Education', 'Health', '*Health Services', 'Labor Force', 'Lesotho', 'Morbidity', '*Political Factors', '*Research Report', '*Social Development']","['PIP: TJ: JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLITICS, POLICY AND LAW.']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Health Polit Policy Law. 1982 Winter;6(4):762-79. doi: 10.1215/03616878-6-4-762.,,,,['10.1215/03616878-6-4-762 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Personal and job-related information was obtained for each nurse. Structural features of units, such as workload, were gathered from head nurse reports and hospital records. Findings indicated that nurses' perceptions of autonomy are influenced by both personal characteristics of the nurse and structural features of the units. The nurse's sense of personal efficacy and the relationship she has with her head nurse are two important determinants of autonomy across all units. Workload, primary nursing, and staffing patterns are influential factors in predicting autonomy for nurses who work in critical care areas.

For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points.","['Young, A']",['Young A'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cult Med Psychiatry,"Culture, medicine and psychiatry",7707467,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', '*Anthropology, Cultural', '*Attitude to Health', 'Cognition', 'Emotions', 'Humans', 'Models, Psychological', '*Sick Role', 'Verbal Behavior']",,,,,,,1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cult Med Psychiatry. 1981 Dec;5(4):317-35. doi: 10.1007/bf00054773.,,,,['10.1007/bf00054773 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expression. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppression of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotosexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiencies, or hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes.","['Money, J']",['Money J'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Q Rev Biol,The Quarterly review of biology,0376515,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Gender Identity', 'Hormones/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Object Attachment', 'Paraphilic Disorders/physiopathology', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Puberty', '*Sex', '*Sexual Behavior', 'X Chromosome', 'Y Chromosome']",,,,,,,1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Q Rev Biol. 1981 Dec;56(4):379-404. doi: 10.1086/412431.,['0 (Hormones)'],,112,['10.1086/412431 [doi]'],"['HD 00325/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 07111/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, statistics on causes of death from Cuba, particularly Havana, are used to investigate what may have been some of the principal determinants of mortality decline in the developing world before the arrival of modern drugs and insecticides. Trends in cause-specific mortality are examined in the light of Cuba's social, economic, medical and public health history. The Cuban experience strongly suggests that in this country public health and sanitary reforms and nutritional improvements were largely responsible for initial declines in mortality throughout the first half of the twentieth century. One important finding is that the impact of these reforms and improved nutrition was greatly influenced by prevailing economic conditions. Periods of economic prosperity facilitated declines in mortality; but in times of adversity, the reverse occurred. It appears that during prosperous periods the maintenance and expansion of public health and sanitary facilities were made possible by increased public and private revenues, and that individuals had access to a more abundant diet. The severe economic crisis of the Great Depression had the opposite effect. With the appearance of sulphonamides in the late 1930s, antibiotics, and residual insecticides and other specific measures at the end of the Second World War, the relevance of economic conditions as a determinant of mortality decline diminished. Although this analysis points to the aforementioned trends, the Cuban experience also suggests that other factors enter into the process of declining mortality and that this phenomenon can only be explained as the result of the complex interplay of many forces.","['Diaz-Briquets, S']",['Diaz-Briquets S'],"['a Population Reference Bureau, Inc. , 1337 Connecticut Ave. , N.W.

Cross-sectional analyses in another epidemiological study reveal the association to be independent of potential confounding factors such as smoking and body weight, and longitudinal analyses suggest that it is also not a result of certain unmeasured sources of confounding. A small experiment reveals a 15% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels among social drinkers who abstain from alcohol from a 2-week period.

The monkeys were paired daily for 20 min, and altogether 536 pairings were observed. The influence of the female's menstrual cycle and social factors of male sexual activity was determined. The reactions of the other monkeys during a pairing, and masturbation behavior of the males were observed and described. It was found that when a male and female were paired daily their sexual activity remained on a rather constant and high level for months provided the pair could not see, touch, or smell each other between pairings. In these conditions the most common copulatory behavior consisted of 3-4 ejaculations. When the couple lived continuously in adjacent cages, which allowed them visual, tactual, and olfactory communication between pairings, the male ejaculated, on the average, only once during five successive pairings. Thus separation and reunion was potent in triggering sexual activity. When the couple was visually separated between sessions the male's sexual activity did not depend on the menstrual cycle of the female. The males initiated copulation and the females were always willing, except in later stages of pregnancy, to cooperate. All males masturbated to ejaculation and it was often triggered by copulation, masturbation, or any happening causing arousal in the colony. The females were never seen to masturbate outside of the heterosexual context.","['Linnankoski, I', 'Hytonen, Y', 'Leinonen, L', 'Hyvarinen, J']","['Linnankoski I', 'Hytonen Y', 'Leinonen L', 'Hyvarinen J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Sex Behav,Archives of sexual behavior,1273516,IM,"['Animals', '*Copulation/physiology', 'Estrus', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Macaca/*physiology', 'Male', 'Masturbation', 'Penis/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Sex Factors']",,,,,,,1981/04/01 00:00,1981/04/01 00:01,['1981/04/01 00:00'],"['1981/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Sex Behav. 1981 Apr;10(2):207-22. doi: 10.1007/bf01542179.,,,,['10.1007/bf01542179 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The surrogate stimuli consisted of a rat-sized aluminum tube covered with soft fluffy synthetic fur, a tanned rat pelt, felt, and an aluminum sheet. The surrogate was either maintained at ambient temperature or heated to body surface temperature (37 degrees C). The 1st experiment revealed that both furriness (length and softness of fur) and temperature of the surrogate stimulus are important determinants of conspecific aggregation (huddling). The 2nd experiment demonstrated that preference for the soft, fluffy surrogate was not mediated by temperature conservation by showing that the same huddling behavior was obtained when ambient temperature was raised to thermoneutrality (33 degrees C).

The finding that amphetamine produces a steeper generalization gradient of approach to surrogate stimuli further confirms our previous hypothesis that amphetamine canalizes arousal toward salient environmental stimuli.

The three best predictors of contraceptive use are: specific contraceptive attitudes, social support, and accessibility of contraceptives. Their impacts on behavior are direct and additive; however, their impacts vary significantly by education and number of living children.

Analysis of sex by unit sex-type interaction for 60 residents' Person-Environment (P-E) congruence scores revealed that elderly females on sex-integrated units reported a higher level of P-E congruence than those residing on female-only units; males on sex-integrated units, in contrast, reported a poorer level of P-E congruence than males on sex -segregated units. Furthermore, behavioral observations of staff-resident verbal interactions confirmed the hypothesis that residents living on units with high staff-resident interaction perceived the environments more congruent with their preferences than residents on units low in verbal interaction. The observed relationships between the P-E congruence measure, resident-staff interaction, and unit sex-type were taken as further support for the relevance and value of the EPPIS measure as a tool for assessing and improving the institutional milieu.","['Sperbeck, D J', 'Whitbourne, S K', 'Nehrke, M F']","['Sperbeck DJ', 'Whitbourne SK', 'Nehrke MF']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Aging Res,Experimental aging research,7603335,IM,"['Aged', 'Consumer Behavior', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Models, Psychological', 'New York', 'Personality Development', '*Residential Facilities', 'Self Concept', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Dominance']",,,,,,,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Aging Res. 1981 Winter;7(4):381-92. doi: 10.1080/03610738108259819.,,,,['10.1080/03610738108259819 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology.","['Fischer, R E', 'Juni, S']","['Fischer RE', 'Juni S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Psychoanal,American journal of psychoanalysis,0372630,IM,"['Defense Mechanisms', 'Ego', 'Freudian Theory', 'Humans', 'Libido', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/psychology', '*Personality Development', 'Projection', '*Psychoanalytic Theory', '*Psychosexual Development', 'Sadism']",,,,,,,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Psychoanal. 1981 Spring;41(1):57-71. doi: 10.1007/bf01253042.,,,,['10.1007/bf01253042 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Health programmes are still in the process of institutionalisation. This means that unlike long established disciplines they do not yet have a well-established methodology, clear research evaluation criteria, or known laws or invariances. The social characteristics of health intervention programmes are considered. They may be regarded as action research. A basic dilemma in the aims of health intervention programmes is emphasized; on the one hand to produce a change in the behavior and health status of the population, and on the other hand to discover the laws or invariances, governing them. The solution of this conflict affects the goals, methods and organisation of the programme and is also important in the evaluation of the outcome. The North Karelia Project, like other health intervention programme was launched and given legal force for medical reasons based on epidemiological research into risk factors. However, behaviour affecting health involves many other dimensions than the medical one. The social determinants and functions of health behaviours, and the role of health intervention as an agent of social control are discussed. Finally, the results and evaluation of this community level health intervention programmes are discussed and their practical implications are considered.","['Vaskilampi, T']",['Vaskilampi T'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,7608039,IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/*prevention & control', '*Community Health Services', 'Female', 'Finland', 'Health Education', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preventive Health Services/*organization & administration', 'Public Health Administration', 'Social Behavior']",,,,,,,1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 1981;29(2):187-97.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Longitudinal data routinely collected in a mother and child clinic were analysed. At 24 months, 26% of cohort infants were at or below the 10th percentile for length (= 'small' infants); 98 of these were compared with 83 'medium' infants (between the 50th and the 75th percentile, for example). Excessive downward deviation of length percentiles was seen in 80% of 'small' infants. In 20% their birthweight was on the 10th percentile or below; 50% had a mother less than 155 cm tall; maternal stature was closely linked with socioeconomic factors. Of mothers with less than nine years of schooling, 70% had 'small' infants. In 95% of both groups growth attainment at two years could be predicted from data at 12 months. The known factors influencing deviant physical growth overlap with those of mental and social development. Growth deviation by itself may identify infants open to multiple risks, especially if their mothers have a low educational level. Further narrowing of the target group for specialised intervention strategies should be attempted.","['Geefhuysen, J', 'Adler, B', 'Palti, H']","['Geefhuysen J', 'Adler B', 'Palti H']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,"['Birth Weight', '*Body Height', '*Body Weight', 'Child, Preschool', 'Educational Status', 'Ethnic Groups', 'Female', '*Growth', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Israel', 'Male', 'Occupations', 'Parents', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,1980/12/01 00:00,1980/12/01 00:01,['1980/12/01 00:00'],"['1980/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1980 Dec;34(4):287-94. doi: 10.1136/jech.34.4.287.,,,,['10.1136/jech.34.4.287 [doi]'],,,PMC1052093,,,,,,,,

As the first step in the child-bearing process, age at first birth is a critical variable. Using data from the 1966-67 West Malaysia Family Survey, we formulate and test a model of the cultural, social and economic determinants of the timing of first birth among a sample of mothers, aged 30-44. Social origins, measured by the woman's father's occupation and the woman's birthplace are not important determinants, but education, early work experience, and ethnicity exercise very strong effects on the age at first birth. Age at first marriage mediates much of the effect of background variables, which suggest that there is little use of contraception to plan the first birth interval. The strong effect of ethnicity is consistent with a cultural interpretation, but important qualifications are noted.","['Hirschman, C', 'Rindfuss, R']","['Hirschman C', 'Rindfuss R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Popul Stud (Camb),Population studies,0376427,,,,,,,,,1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['2011/11/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Popul Stud (Camb). 1980 Nov;34(3):507-18. doi: 10.1080/00324728.1980.10410459.,,,,['10.1080/00324728.1980.10410459 [doi]'],,,,,,10.1080/00324728.1980.10410459 [doi],,,,,

Multivariable analysis was used to assess the relation of social, demographic, physical and behavioral characteristics for HDL cholesterol in each of the study populations and in subgroups defined by sex, age and gonadal hormone use. Characteristics associated with higher HDL cholesterol concentrations were a lean body habitus, not smoking, consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol, physical activity or exercise, membership in a high educational stratum, increased age and low dietary consumption of sucrose and starch. Each of these characteristics was examined in detail in its relation to HDL cholesterol concentrations in the respective chapters in this monograph; the purpose of the study reported here was to summarize the findings. When all variables were considered simultaneously in the analysis, body mass, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were the attributes most strongly and consistently associated with HDL cholesterol concentrations in the populations examined. These empirical findings from a cross-sectional study replicated across diverse populations were used to derive speculative estimates of the potential for modification of population levels of HDL cholesterol, consistent with hygienic intervention and lifestyle changes. The results of the study were considered in the context of the literature on determinants of HDL cholesterol.","['Heiss, G', 'Johnson, N J', 'Reiland, S', 'Davis, C E', 'Tyroler, H A']","['Heiss G', 'Johnson NJ', 'Reiland S', 'Davis CE', 'Tyroler HA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,AIM IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Alcohol Drinking', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholesterol/adverse effects/*blood', 'Coronary Disease/*etiology', 'Female', 'Hormones', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/adverse effects/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk', 'Smoking']",,,,,,,1980/11/01 00:00,1980/11/01 00:01,['1980/11/01 00:00'],"['1980/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Circulation. 1980 Nov;62(4 Pt 2):IV116-36.,"['0 (Hormones)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",,,,"['N01-HV1-2156-L/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HV1-2160-L/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HV2-2914-L/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

This high degree of interindividual variability of change calls for a differential gerontology.","['Lehr, U']",['Lehr U'],,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Z Gerontol,Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie,0140107,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', '*Aging', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Social Conformity']",,,,,,,1980/09/01 00:00,1980/09/01 00:01,['1980/09/01 00:00'],"['1980/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Z Gerontol. 1980 Sep-Oct;13(5):442-57.,,,,,,Alterszustand und Alternspozesse - biographische Determinanten.,,,,,,,,,

The paper examines these in the three classical 'time periods', arguing that inability to meet labour peaks is of great significance in explaining seasonal shortage of food and chronic shortage of cash. It also explains community indifference to upkeep of social overhead capital. Substitution of capital goods for labour is socially differentiated, not least by labour availability, and leads inevitably to a regressive distribution of land and the creation or enlargement of a class of landless labourers. Under certain limited conditions this class may enjoy a rising real income with associated health-promotive expenditures. The more normal case, however, is extreme poverty, whether rural or urban, with all that that implies for the undermining of health. Land reform therefore becomes a necessary precondition of health promotion.","['Elliott, C']",['Elliott C'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

A standardized, nidic environment consisting of a maternal nest and adjoining open field was studied under a variety of structured test conditions. When the mother was outside the nest, pups readily ventured into the field. The early excursions were not stimulated by the mother's absence from the nest because when the mother was removed from the nest but not placed in the field the pups remained nestbound. Anesthetized dams elicited few excursions, suggesting that olfactory cues are less potent in this situation than behaviorally transmitted signals. Nonlactating adults were not attractive to pups but after induction of ""maternal responsiveness"" concaveated males facilitated egression. The data from a final experiment suggest that when in the nest, the dam stimulates egression by providing additional ""permissive"" stimuli that render the weanling more responsive to approach cues outside the nest.","['Alberts, J R', 'Leimbach, M P']","['Alberts JR', 'Leimbach MP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Psychobiol,Developmental psychobiology,0164074,IM,"['Animals', 'Cues', '*Exploratory Behavior', 'Female', 'Male', '*Maternal Behavior', '*Nesting Behavior', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Behavior']",,,,,,,1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dev Psychobiol. 1980 Jul;13(4):417-29. doi: 10.1002/dev.420130408.,,,,['10.1002/dev.420130408 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

They were then tested twice a week individually and twice a week socially from 2 to 6 1/2 months of age in a playroom, utilizing multiple categories of behavior. The mother-only-reared juveniles were hyperactive in both object play (when tested individually) and social play. The brooder-only-reared kittens displayed enhanced socially directed behavior and were generally hypergregarious, whereas the brooder-littermate-reared kittens displayed retarded social behavior. Observations indicated that littermate-deprived kittens did not learn social communication skills and that some prolonged separation effects existed for littermate-reared kittens. The results suggest that the determinants of social play are more complex than the determinants of object play.","['Guyot, G W', 'Bennett, T L', 'Cross, H A']","['Guyot GW', 'Bennett TL', 'Cross HA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Dev Psychobiol,Developmental psychobiology,0164074,IM,"['Animals', '*Behavior, Animal', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Male', 'Maternal Deprivation', 'Motor Activity', 'Play and Playthings', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', '*Social Isolation']",,,,,,,1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dev Psychobiol. 1980 May;13(3):317-29. doi: 10.1002/dev.420130307.,,,,['10.1002/dev.420130307 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The individual's adjustment to his own imperfections in dental alignment is variable and there is no evidence that children with visible irregulaities will in general be emotionally handicapped.

Admittedly, at that time, the spectacular progress achieved through antibiotics encouraged the belief that health was merely a matter of medicine and that the institution of a social security scheme would suffice for minimizing the risks of death that were not directly involved in the natural differences between individuals. 30 years have passed and the expectation of life has lengthened (although less than anticipated), but the social differences remain. They are, in fact, by no means attributable to lack of medical science. The elimination of the most discriminating causes of death (alcoholism, accidents, suicide, tuberculosis, etc.) is less dependent on further scientific progress than on a complete change in living conditions and behavior. The reduction in the excess mortality of the poorer classes from other causes (cancer, cardiovascular diseases, etc.) again calls more for a thorough cultural transformation of the least privileged social categories than for the discovery of new therapies or increased expenditure on hospitals. Faced with a mortality that is already very unequal (selection, differential risks), the various social categories behave in basically different ways, which, while aggravating the real inequities, lead to an apparent morbidity that is inversely proportional to true morbidity and to a more prompt and frequent use of medical care among the social categories in which true morbidity is lowest. Inequality with respect to death is only 1 dimension of social inequality. It was an illusion to imagine that 1 could be eliminated without the other. Today that illusion has been destroyed. That does not mean that the present situation must be accepted. Inequality with respect of death is still 1 of the most disgraceful consequences of social inequality and its abolition must still be our aim. Obviously, however, this aim cannot be achieved through the health services alone.","['Vallin, J']",['Vallin J'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Popul Bull UN,Population bulletin of the United Nations,23470020R,J,"['Americas', '*Cause of Death', 'Demography', 'Developed Countries', '*Developing Countries', 'Economics', 'Europe', 'France', '*Incidence', '*Infant Mortality', '*Mortality', 'North America', 'Occupations', 'Population', '*Population Characteristics', '*Population Dynamics', '*Research', 'Research Design', '*Social Class', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'United Kingdom', 'United States']","['IND: 9000025', 'PIP: 005550', 'POP: 00106713']",,,['PIP'],"['Americas', '*Causes Of Death', '*Child Mortality', 'Demographic Factors', 'Developed Countries', '*Developing Countries', '*Differential Mortality', 'Economic Factors', 'Europe', 'France', '*Incidence', '*Infant Mortality', 'Measurement', 'Mediterranean Countries', '*Mortality', 'North America', 'Northern America', 'Northern Europe', 'Occupations', 'Population', '*Population Characteristics', '*Population Dynamics', 'Research Methodology', '*Social Class', '*Socioeconomic Factors', '*Socioeconomic Status', '*Summary Report', '*United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Western Europe']",['PIP: TJ: POPULATION BULLETIN OF THE UNITED NATIONS'],1980/01/01 00:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Popul Bull UN. 1980;(13):26-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other factors cited are the (not always justified) preference of patients--at least of those who can afford it--for physicians who work with sophisticated equipment, the vested interests of the industry that produces or owns that equipment, and the desire of the young physician to escape the stiff competition he would encounter in general practice, while at the same time separating himself from the somewhat negative image of the general clinician who does not keep abreast of developments in medicine.

An adequate analysis of the situation of hospital nurses, the paper suggests, depends upon locating the occupation within the wider setting of the mode of control and delivery of health care. The central feature of this setting is the dominance of medicine and medical technology, and the main factors shaping it are the activities of individual capitalists involved in the health industry and the State operating within the constraints of capital in general and within the context of class struggle. It is suggested that the characteristic feature of nurses' occupational strategy--the vacillation between professionalism and unionism--can best be understood in relation to the changing mode of control and delivery of health care and nurses' contradictory position within the social relations that constitute that mode.","['Bellaby, P', 'Oribabor, P']","['Bellaby P', 'Oribabor P']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Health Serv,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1305035,IM,"['Collective Bargaining', 'Delivery of Health Care/economics/trends', '*Economics, Nursing', 'Humans', 'Labor Unions', '*Nursing Staff, Hospital', 'Social Change', 'Specialties, Nursing', 'State Medicine/organization & administration', 'United Kingdom']",,,,,,,1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Health Serv. 1980;10(2):291-309. doi: 10.2190/DAP2-YWF4-EW4J-R9MC.,,,,['10.2190/DAP2-YWF4-EW4J-R9MC [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Mental health fiscal allocations and programmatic determinations in ghetto, lower socioeconomic, minority-populated urban areas are predicated on political and racist considerations, the underlying motivation being to keep minorities at greater risk of mental disability.3. Economic privation and stress increase vulnerability to mental illness, especially in a minority population for whom health, mental health, educational, and social services are grossly inadequate.4. Poverty and economic stress combine with health systems that are unresponsive to the needs of blacks and other minorities, resulting in the perpetuation of disabilities and other conditions in blacks that are potentially preventable.5. Health and mental health resources should be increased rather than diminished during periods of economic stress, especially in the public sector.6. In order to provide each citizen with access to quality health and mental health care regardless of race and/or economic status, there must be enacted a national health insurance program based on tax-levy monies that will cover all aspects of health and mental health care.7. Racism and social status will continue to be powerful determinants of the quality of service that white professionals render to black patients and to poor white patients, unless our training institutions mount a massive campaign to train appropriately and to include significant numbers of minority candidates and trainees in the effort.

A review of the human reserpine literature suggests, however, that factors other than pharmacologically produced alterations in brain biogenic amine metabolism must have been critical determinants of the eventual mood alterations observed in conjunction with reserpine treatment. While some of these factors, such as previous history of depression, ongoing psychosocial and environmental stress, can be intuitively identified, there are practical as well as ethical problems involved in actually testing the relative contribution of these factors in precipitating human depression and thereby determining their importance in a quantitative fashion. In the present paper we have attempted to examine, in a nonhuman primate model of depression, the degree to which factors such as prior rearing condition, repeated peer separation, and housing environment can intact with the behavioral effects produced by biogenic amine depleting agents. Major emphasis will be placed on studies utilizing alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, to ostensively reduce levels of the catecholamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. The results of these studies provide quantitative estimates, in terms of dose-effect relationships, of the degree to which a number of factors can combine to produce despair-like behavior in rhesus monkeys. These data may be of practical importance in evaluating the contribution of similar factors to the precipitation of human depression. Analysis of some of the existing literature relating alterations in behavior to changes in biogenic amine metabolism in animals suggests that there are important differences between rodent and primate species. These differences, when fully established, may indicate that additional research examining the mechanisms whereby modest alterations in biogenic amine metabolism can interact with environmental and social stress is needed.","['Kraemer, G W', 'McKinney, W T']","['Kraemer GW', 'McKinney WT']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Affect Disord,Journal of affective disorders,7906073,IM,"['Animals', 'Depression/psychology', 'Depressive Disorder/*enzymology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dopamine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Maternal Deprivation', 'Norepinephrine/*metabolism', 'Social Environment', 'Social Isolation', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/metabolism']",,,,,,,1979/03/01 00:00,1979/03/01 00:01,['1979/03/01 00:00'],"['1979/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Affect Disord. 1979 Mar;1(1):33-54. doi: 10.1016/0165-0327(79)90023-5.,"['EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",,,"['0165-0327(79)90023-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-0327(79)90023-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

This is dramatically reflected, both in the medical writings published in France around the year 1800, and in the naming, for the first time, of this phase of woman's life: La Menespausie, soon shortened to Menopause.","['Wilbush, J']",['Wilbush J'],,['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",Ireland,Maturitas,Maturitas,7807333,IM Q,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Attitude to Health', 'Europe', 'Female', 'France', 'History, 18th Century', 'Humans', '*Menopause', 'Social Adjustment', 'Syndrome']",,,,,,,1979/02/01 00:00,1979/02/01 00:01,['1979/02/01 00:00'],"['1979/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Maturitas. 1979 Feb;1(3):145-51. doi: 10.1016/0378-5122(79)90001-x.,,,,"['0378-5122(79)90001-X [pii]', '10.1016/0378-5122(79)90001-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis is based on 232 responses to a questionnaire mailed to a simple random sample of 500 senior citizens in Tompkins County, New York. Social and psychologic variables identified by the model as important in determining utilization of preventive health services are: perceived susceptibility and severity of disease, perceived efficacy and danger associated with the preventive action, and general health motivations. Differences of means between users and nonusers for these variables are computed and compared with the results of a more sophisticated analytic technique--logit analysis--for use with dichotomous dependent variables. Results reveal that the health belief model accounts for 34 per cent of the variance in use of the vaccine by senior citizens. Perceived susceptibility to the disease and amount of danger associated with receiving the swine flu immunization are found to be the most important determinants of utilization.","['Rundall, T G', 'Wheeler, J R']","['Rundall TG', 'Wheeler JR']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Care,Medical care,0230027,IM,"['*Aged', '*Attitude to Health', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/immunology', 'Models, Theoretical', 'New York', 'Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*prevention & control', 'Preventive Health Services/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Vaccination/adverse effects/*psychology']",,,,,,,1979/02/01 00:00,1979/02/01 00:01,['1979/02/01 00:00'],"['1979/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Care. 1979 Feb;17(2):191-200. doi: 10.1097/00005650-197902000-00009.,,,,['10.1097/00005650-197902000-00009 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The research design called for a detailed interview with the persons attempting suicide and members of their families. The study samples consisted of 30 low economic and 25 high economic status families. It was predicted that social anomie could be translated into behavioral (attempted suicide) and attitudinal (normlessness and powerlessness) determinants when viewed with regard to its impact upon the family. Significant differences in the degree of normlessness and powerlessness were found for suicidal and nonsuicidal adolescents and their families.

This article examines the political consequences of social policy in Denmark and Sweden, countries in which a social democratic labor movement has predominated for decades. Superficially, these two highly developed welfare states appear very similar. Yet the political and social contexts in which their social policies have evolved differ substantially. I shall demonstrate the argument that the traditional welfare state approach may be conducive to a new and powerful political conflict, which directly questions the legitimacy of the welfare state itself, unless government is successful in subordinating private capitalist growth to effective public regulation. In Denmark, where social democratic governments have failed to match welfare state growth with more control of private capital, social policy has tended to undermine the political unity of the working class. Consequently, the Social Democratic Party has been weakened. Social welfare programs, in effect, have helped create new forms of stratification within the working class. In Sweden, social democratic governments have been quite successful in shifting a decisive degree of power over the private market to the state. This has helped avert a crisis of the welfare state, and has also been an important condition for continued social democratic hegemony and working-class unity. I conclude that social reform politics tend to be problematic from the point of view of the future power of social democratic movements.","['Esping-Andersen, G']",['Esping-Andersen G'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Health Serv,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1305035,IM,"['*Conflict, Psychological', 'Democracy', 'Denmark', 'Economics', 'Humans', '*Politics', '*Public Policy', '*Social Welfare', 'Socialism', 'Sweden']",,,,,,,1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Health Serv. 1979;9(2):269-93. doi: 10.2190/7RRY-DM4L-EPR8-2RGB.,,,,['10.2190/7RRY-DM4L-EPR8-2RGB [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Two other groups of seven females tested only once showed diminished attacks against males by Day 14 postpartum. In Experiment 2, eight females were paired with a male for a week prior to parturition; they showed reliably fewer attacks on Day 2 postpartum than a group of nine females that were isolated prior to parturition. All of these results were obtained in a standard 3-min test. A 24-hr test on Day 4 of Experiment 2 revealed that in both groups female attacks dropped to near zero after 30 min. After female attacks declined, males initiated social behavior which occasioned vocalizations by the females. Further, males attacked in 65% of the tests and destroyed the litters of the females in 53% of the tests.

An unanticipated finding is that regions with higher earning levels have greater rates of outmigration. The data are disaggregated to examine separate migration relationships for each state. The results are that distance is a lesser deterrent for those migrants with more accessible alternatives, that higher earning levels reduce the deterring effects of distance, and that regions with higher earning levels have lower associated elasticities of migration.

This thrust to extend our understanding and capability of application of health planning was recognized at PAHO-WHO and DHEW as being long overdue, given the diversity of health planning efforts, the thinness of theory and the frequently unsatisfactory results of health sector planning in so many countries. In 1976 a series of descriptive-analytical studies were commissioned from 17 countries representing nearly every continent and every stage of development. These studies were further analyzed and abstracted and became the basis for a 5-day discussion in Copenhagen in 1977 among 35 practicing and academic health planners gathered from 16 countries, WHO, and DHEW. The thrust of the first assembly was to identify the determinants of (1) the establishment of formal health planning machinery, (2) the scope and content of concerns assigned to health planning, (3) the participants in the process, and (4) the relationships of planners to policy makers and implementors. In 1978 the second 5-day meeting was held in New Orleans to analyze the methodologies of health planning and to determine what could be generalized and disseminated as guidance to all countries. This was based on a new series of methodologically focused case studies which were abstracted and made available to each of the 53 health planning participants from 22 countries, PAHO-WHO, and DHEW. The four major foci of this conference were (1) the state of the art in health planning methodology, (2) how methods are being developed and adapted, (3) identification of major methodological shortcomings or constraints, and (4) surmounting the difficulties facing health planning in affecting major health-influencing forces which lie outside the territory traditionally considered to be part of the health sector. This article is a report on some of the things the author learned from participating in what he considers the two most informative planning meetings he ever attended.","['Blum, H L']",['Blum HL'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Health Plann,American journal of health planning,7701759,H,"['*Health Planning', '*National Health Programs', '*Public Policy', 'Social Change']",,,,,,,1978/06/11 00:00,1978/06/11 00:01,['1978/06/11 00:00'],"['1978/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1978/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Health Plann. 1978 Jul;3(3):34-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A syndrome of analgesic abuse has been proposed, definable by characteristics other than analgesic intake. To examine this concept, a population study of analgesic consumption was carried out; the distribution was clearly unimodal and no association could be found between the quantity of analgesics taken and social class, marital status, working or not working, tea or coffee consumption or the number of cigarettes smoked. The principal determinants appeared to be sex, with females reporting a higher intake, and the presence of painful conditions. It was concluded that analgesics abuse cannot be defined other than by the number of analgesics consumed, and that the concept of an analgesic abuse 'syndrome' is not helpful in the design of preventive programmes.","['Christie, D']",['Christie D'],,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,IM,"['Adult', '*Analgesics/adverse effects', 'Australia', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*etiology', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Marriage', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Class', 'Substance-Related Disorders/*complications']",,,,,,,1978/06/01 00:00,1978/06/01 00:01,['1978/06/01 00:00'],"['1978/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1978 Jun;7(2):139-43. doi: 10.1093/ije/7.2.139.,['0 (Analgesics)'],,,['10.1093/ije/7.2.139 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Of particular concern is the assumption of equilibrium family size made by those who employ the static perspective. The equilibrium family size assumption implies that the parameters relating social and economic variables to fertility will be similar for all births, regardless of order. To test this assumption of constancy, a two-equation model of fertility and female employment is introduced. Contrary to the static perspective's implication of constant effects, substantial parity differences in the estimates of parameters for both equations are reported, as are several differences between blacks and whites. On the basis of this evidence, I conclude that the static decision-making framework should be replaced by a dynamic approach to marital fertility.","['Hout, M']",['Hout M'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Demography,Demography,0226703,IM,"['Adult', 'Decision Making', 'Employment', '*Family Planning Services', 'Female', '*Fertility', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Marriage', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Parity', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1978/05/01 00:00,1978/05/01 00:01,['1978/05/01 00:00'],"['1978/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Demography. 1978 May;15(2):139-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Undernourished children showed lowered levels of exploratory activity and attachment behavior, especially distance interaction, and a heightened need for physical closeness to the mother. Moreover, among the undernourished children the level of intellectual performance and the overall time spent in play were decreased, while time spent sucking at the breast was increased. In contrast to the West Bengali study, maternal behavior showed no differences between the two nutritional groups, and the intercorrelations between maternal and child scores showed similar or parallel patterns of reciprocity for the well-nourished and the undernourished children. No sex or age differences were found. The findings were interpreted to support Levitsky and Barnes' hypothesis of ""functional isolation"" as a mechanism between undernutrition and environmental stimulation to produce long-term behavioral changes. In addition, hunger as a motivational state, expressed as increased sucking, may interfere with other motivational determinants that might lead to exploration and/or increased social contacts.","['Graves, P L']",['Graves PL'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,AIM IM,"['*Child Behavior', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Male', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Nepal', 'Nutrition Disorders/*psychology', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sucking Behavior']",,,,,,,1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 1978 Mar;31(3):541-51. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/31.3.541.,,,,['10.1093/ajcn/31.3.541 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The paper discusses the reasons for that limited focus and argues that, contrary to what is widely presented in the media and academe: (1) civil and political rights are highly restricted in the U.S.; (2) those rights are further restricted in the U.S. when analyzed in their social and economic dimensions; (3) civil and political rights are not independent of but rather intrinsically related to and dependent on the existence of socioeconomic rights; (4) the definition of the nature and extension of human rights in their civil, political, social, and economic dimensions is not universal, but rather depends on the pattern of economic and political power relations particular to each society; and (5) the pattern of power relations in the U.S. society and the western system of power, based on the right to individual property and its concomitant class structure and relations, is incompatible with the full realization of human rights in their economic, social, political, and civil dimensions. This paper further indicates that U.S. financial and corporate capital, through its overwhelming influence over the organs of political power in the U.S. and over international bodies and agencies, is primarily responsible for the denial of the human rights of the U.S. population and many populations throughout the world as well.","['Navarro, V']",['Navarro V'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Health Serv,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1305035,IM,"['Civil Rights', '*Human Rights', 'Politics', '*Public Policy', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States']",,,,,,,1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Health Serv. 1978;8(1):145-68. doi: 10.2190/E841-GE5G-80D7-J0CT.,,,,['10.2190/E841-GE5G-80D7-J0CT [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

The second view defines schizophrenia primarily in terms of the cross-sectional symptom picture alone. It has been shown empirically that defining a disorder in this way has relatively limited prognostic implications. The third approach identifies schizophrenia in terms of several ""axes,"" such as type of schizophrenic symptoms, their duration, the person's social relations, and his work function. These axes are viewed as relatively independent processes with somewhat different determinants, implying the need for different specific treatments.

Two formulations of transition theory are compared: one emphasizing the importance of changing social and economic structure for fertility decline; the other, the changing relationships between fertility and its determinants over time. To evaluate these formulations, multivariate time series cross-sectional models are developed. The statistical models permit the estimation of relationships both cross-sectionally and over time. As a consequence, the ability of the independent variables to explain cross-sectional as against temporal differences is evaluated. Industrialization, urbanization, religious composition, migration, infant mortality and marriage patterns satisfactorily explain the fertility decline once regional differences have been taken into account. Persisting characteristics of regional units account for much of the unexplained variance. Industrialization is the main explanatory variable of fertility decline in Germany. In the period considered, its impact on fertility increased substantially.","['Richards, T']",['Richards T'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Popul Stud (Camb),Population studies,0376427,,,,,,,,,1977/11/01 00:00,1977/11/01 00:01,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '1977/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Popul Stud (Camb). 1977 Nov;31(3):537-53. doi: 10.1080/00324728.1977.10412765.,,,,['10.1080/00324728.1977.10412765 [doi]'],,,,,,10.1080/00324728.1977.10412765 [doi],,,,,

The solution to the described problem is probably linked to the question whether increasing technology and increasing intricacy of the organizations and increasing productions are compatable with the improvement of individual life expression. Temporarily attention is diverted by theoretical fashion trends, however old interest in finding the truth is not eliminated and the realization that the wish for a scientific solution is not within the realm of possibility, leads to resignation. Clarification of the basic factors requires a lot of individual thought. Demography and sociology are in danger when the demographer and sociologic identify with a certain economic or sociologic system, since this threatens to eliminate logical thought.

Anthropologists have shown that a society's specific infant training practices are adaptive to survival and cultural values. The different expectations of infant behavior of the East African Digo produces a markedly different toilet training approach than the current maturational readiness method recommended in America. The Digo believe that infants can learn soon after birth and begin motor and toilet training in the first weeks of life. With a nurturant conditioning approach, night and day dryness is accomplished by 5 or 6 months. The success of early Digo training suggests that sociocultural factors are more important determinants of toilet training readiness than is currently thought.","['deVries, M W', 'deVries, M R']","['deVries MW', 'deVries MR']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,AIM IM,"['Adult', 'Africa, Eastern', 'Age Factors', 'Child', '*Child Behavior', 'Child Rearing', 'Child, Preschool', 'Conditioning, Psychological', '*Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kenya', 'Male', 'Social Environment', '*Toilet Training']",,,,,,,1977/08/01 00:00,1977/08/01 00:01,['1977/08/01 00:00'],"['1977/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 1977 Aug;60(2):170-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten patients were assessed by means of four standardized measures in the intra-unit study, specifically investigating the effects of integrating wards previously devoted either to chronic or to acute psychiatric illness. Twenty-five patients from a specialized geriatric unit were evaluated, by separate investigators, with respect to changes occuring as a result of their transfer to regional mixed units. The critical incident log, the problem classification form, and the clinical global impression showed some changes, for which there were several possible explanations. None of the changes was as dramatic as predicted by staff members holding divergent views prior to the study. The optimists predicted a ""blossoming"" of the psychogeriatric patients in the mixed, regional units, whereas the pessimists prophesied dire consequences. The group of patients studied was not completely homogeneous with respect to the effect to transfer. Clinical assessment after transfer could be relied on to detect improvement in some of these psychogeriatric patients and deterioration in others.

This hypothesis has been tested in summer 1973 in Cologne with a sample of 406 people aged 65 and over.

Notifications of incidence, though variable and incomplete, follow the same pattern of steady decline in the United Kingdom and are unaffected either by small-scale vaccination beginning about 1948 or by nationwide vaccination beginning in 1957. When valid comparisons can be made, attack-rates may be lower and complications fewer in vaccinated children, but allowance has to be made for overcrowding and socio-economic differences which may be more important as determinants of attack-rates. No protection by vaccination is demonstrable in infants. Adverse reactions and neurotoxicity following vaccinations were studied in 160 cases. In 79, the relationship to pertussis vaccine was strong. In 14 of these cases, reaction was transient but characteristic of a syndrome of shock and cerebral disturbance, which, in the other 65 cases, was followed by convulsions, hyperkinesis, and severe mental defect. It seems likely that most adverse reactions are unreported and that many are overlooked. Precise information about the efficacy and safety of this vaccine is lacking, because existing provisions, national and international, for epidemiological surveillance and evaluation are inadequate. The claim by official bodies that the risks of whooping-cough exceed those of vaccination is questionable, at least in the U.K.","['Stewart, G T']",['Stewart GT'],,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,AIM IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Encephalomyelitis, Acute Disseminated/epidemiology', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperkinesis/etiology', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/etiology', 'Pertussis Vaccine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Seizures/etiology', 'Social Class', 'United Kingdom', 'Vaccination', 'Whooping Cough/epidemiology/mortality/*prevention & control']",,,,,,,1977/01/29 00:00,1977/01/29 00:01,['1977/01/29 00:00'],"['1977/01/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/29 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1977 Jan 29;1(8005):234-7. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(77)91028-5.,['0 (Pertussis Vaccine)'],,,"['S0140-6736(77)91028-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(77)91028-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,

Case material from two patients elucidates a relatively neglected, specific substate. These two analyses center about prominent complaints of impotence and frigidity which are seen as equivalents of, or screens for, underlying depersonalization. Only by understanding and working through the genesis of the masked depersonalization could these sexual dysfunctions be adequately treated. Depersonalization was also manifest outside the sexual sphere, but its presence there led to a more thorough elucidation of its etiology, in which actual childhood observations of the primal scene were of paramount importance. A comprehensive description of depersonalization phenomenology is offered which considers this state as a compromise formulation with contributions from each structure of the mental apparatus. Normal and pathological determinants of the sesation of a split within the self into observing and participating aspects are described, as is the genesis of feelings of alienation and estrangement.","['Myers, W A']",['Myers WA'],,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Psychoanal Psychother,International journal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy,0364543,IM,"['Adult', '*Depersonalization', '*Erectile Dysfunction', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', '*Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological', 'Social Alienation']",,,,,,,1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Psychoanal Psychother. 1977;6:199-326.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parent-child correlations and midparent regressions in this subsistence farming sample, are similar in magnitude to those for well nourished, urban industrial samples, suggesting that the environmental component of variability in body size is the same regardless of the environment. Tenza children are significantly shorter and lighter than upper class Bogota children, and Tenza parents have mean heights and weights similar to those of other lower class Colombian samples. Thus, chronic undernutrition has affected the growth of parents and continues to affect the growth of the present generation. Although it has been hypothesized that heritability of growth might be reduced in samples experiencing malnutrition and its sequelae, such a reduction may only be observable where environment of parents during their development is different from that of their offspring, which is not the case here. The pattern of heritabilities with respect to different body measurements in Tenza, is similar to that seen in well nourished samples, except that measurements of breadth (biacromial, bicristal, bicondylar) have heritabilities similar in magnitude to those of linear measurements (height, sitting-height, subischial length) especially in males; and heritabilities of some measurements related to adiposity are significantly higher in daughters than in sons.","['Mueller, W H', 'Titcomb, M']","['Mueller WH', 'Titcomb M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Ann Hum Biol,Annals of human biology,0404024,IM,"['Adult', 'Body Height', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colombia', 'Female', '*Genotype', '*Growth', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein-Energy Malnutrition/diagnosis/genetics', 'Rural Population', 'Skinfold Thickness', '*Social Environment']",,,,,,,1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hum Biol. 1977 Jan;4(1):1-15. doi: 10.1080/03014467700001901.,,,,['10.1080/03014467700001901 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Experiment I began as an attempt to reduce the frequency of tantrums in a 6-yr-old autistic girl by using timeout. Unexpectedly, the result was a substantial increase in the frequency of tantrums. Using a reversal design, subsequent manipulations showed that the opportunity to engage in self-stimulatory behavior during the timeout period was largely responsible for the increase in tantrums. Experiment II was initiated following the failure of timeout to reduce the spitting and self-injurious behavior of a 16-yr-old retarded boy. Using a multiple-baseline design, the nature of the timein environment was shown to be an important determinant of the effects of timeout. When the timein environment was ""enriched"", timeout was effective as a punisher.

Biologic and behavioral aspects.,111-5,"More than 70 male chronic marihuana users were studied under research ward conditions for a 31-day period consisting of 5 days of baseline assessment, 21 days of marihuana availability, and 5 days of postsmoking assessment. Biological findings were for the most part within normal limits. Blood chemistry studies showed no abnormalities. Plasma testosterone levels for all subjects at all times during the study were well within normal limits, suggesting that previous reports of testosterone suppression by marihuana may have statistical but not biologic singificance. A significant reduction in baseline vital capacity was observed in six subjects, a compromise in pulmonary function similar to that characteristically produced by chronic inhalation of substances, such as tobacco smoke, which are irritants to the lung. Increased caloric intake and weight gain occurred in virtually all subjects and were causally related to marihuana smoking. The weight gain may be attributable to water retention as well as increased caloric intake. Behavioral findings indicated that no uniform alteration in mood is produced by marihuana smoking--all subjects reported becoming ""high"", but experienced no consistent degree of euphoria. Mood changes which occurred were relatively mild and were largely dependent on group determinants rather than individual experience. No relationship could be established between marihuana use and motivation to work or engage in socially desirable activities. Evidence that pulmonary function may be compromised as a function of marihuana smoking suggests the need for alerting individuals to this potential health hazard. As was true of cigarette smoking, the eventual public health consequences of marihuana use may become apparent only after large numbers of individuals have smoked marihuana for two or three decades.","['Mendelson, J H']",['Mendelson JH'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Postgrad Med,Postgraduate medicine,0401147,AIM IM,"['Adult', 'Body Weight', '*Cannabis', 'Energy Intake', 'Humans', 'Lung/physiopathology', 'Lung Diseases/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Motivation', '*Social Behavior', '*Substance-Related Disorders/complications', 'Testosterone/blood', 'Vital Capacity/drug effects']",,,,,,,1976/11/01 00:00,1976/11/01 00:01,['1976/11/01 00:00'],"['1976/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Postgrad Med. 1976 Nov;60(5):111-5. doi: 10.1080/00325481.1976.11714478.,['3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)'],,,['10.1080/00325481.1976.11714478 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

Empirical studies on client-centered group activities].,"1395, 1397-8","The experiencing of participants of client-centered encounter groups served to demonstrate possibilities and limits of current models of the group process. This was done by analyzing the correlations between 5 dimensions of experiencing and aims of group participation, personality variables, modus of participation i.e. patient, student, therapist, time of participation, and group setting. The experiencing dimensions included 1. sympathy, trust, understanding, and help between members, 2. freedom from anxiety and stress, 3. openness, controversy and feedback, 4. momentary strong and basic feelings in one's self and others, 5. understanding, help and closeness of the group facilitator. The results show: Successful group participation was to the extent of maximal 50% determined by the experiences immanent in the client centered group process concept. Personality variables measured by tests determined the experiencing in the group to an extent of maximal 10%, supposedly less than the group experiencing was influenced by special characteristics of the group development for example the initial phase of group formation, member characteristics like age, attitudes concerning group work, and conventions of social behaviour. Even less relevant as determinants of group experiencing were differences of group setting and social pressure in the direction of uniform experiences at least within the first 20 hours of group participation.","['Speierer, G W']",['Speierer GW'],,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Fortschr Med,Fortschritte der Medizin,2984763R,IM,"['Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Group Processes', 'Humans', 'Personality Inventory', 'Psychological Tests', '*Sensitivity Training Groups']",,,,,,,1976/09/16 00:00,1976/09/16 00:01,['1976/09/16 00:00'],"['1976/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1976/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Fortschr Med. 1976 Sep 16;94(26):1395, 1397-8.",,,,,,Dimensionen des Erlebens in Selbsterfahrungsgruppen.

Similarly, there is widespread interest in premarital sexual behavior, especially its determinants. This study presents several issues reflecting these concerns which have been the subject of much speculation but which have received little attention by researchers. The purpose of this study was to investigate--through the use of respondent reports--how formal and informal sex education influences premarital sexual behavior during college. A national probability sample of 1177 college students was studied using face-to-face interviews with approximately equal numbers of males and females. These interviews, which were conducted for the Institute for Sex Research, included questions about past and present sexual involvement and other attitudinal, behavioral and background variables. Accordingly, the data about sexual behavior and attitudes are based on the interviewees' self-reports. Indices were created which operationalized independent variables such as familial sexual conservatism, exposure to eroticism, perceived sex knowledge, and sexual exposure and assault during childhood and adolescence. Individual items reflecting childhood sex play, masturbation, current religiosity, religiosity while growing up, social class, sources of sex information, sex education in classrooms, and high school and college dating were used. The dependent variable, premarital sociosexual involvement, is a composite measure of incidence and prevalence of premarital heterosexual involvement which meets Guttman scaling criteria. An Automatic Interaction Detector analysis was used to determine the relative influences of reported sexualization variables on premarital sexual behavior. Major findings can be summarized as follows: Heterosexual behavior progresses in stepwise fashion from elementary to advanced levels of involvement, with each level representing a threshold. Reports of current influences and pressures explain more variance in premarital sexual behavior than reports of past informal sexualization influences, which, in turn, explain more variance than reported formal sex-education experiences. Limited success was reported with the use of a four-stage AID analysis which attempted to ascertain whether variables represented in later stages of the sexualization process ""mask"" the effects of variables in earlier stages and whether a development process can be identified. It may be concluded that these data do not support the belief that exposure to sexuality through formal sex education influences premarital sexual behavior. Informal sex education has significantly more impact on premarital sexual behavior, but there are indications that pressures and experiences confronting young people in a given dating or peer group situation take precedence over all past sexual socialization influences.","['Spanier, G B']",['Spanier GB'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Sex Behav,Archives of sexual behavior,1273516,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Marriage', '*Sex Education', '*Sexual Behavior', 'Single Person', 'Students', 'United States']",,,,,,,1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Sex Behav. 1976 Jan;5(1):39-67. doi: 10.1007/bf01542239.,,,,['10.1007/bf01542239 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze local attitudes to this issue, the present study targeted the audience of a recent Symposium ""Employment of the Ex-Addict"", held in Westchester County, New York, October, 1973. Ss (N = 83) completed a questionnaire to assess the nature and extent of proponent views, degree of commitment, and motivational components of support and opposition. The data strongly supported belief in the urgency of the need to employ. Educational and community measures of moderate activism were preferred to antidiscrimination legislation.

The situation was witnessed by a male or female observer who then judged B's attributes and predicted A's and B's ratings of one another. A formulation of social inference processes developed by Gollob was used to identify and compare the informational cues used by actors and observers in making these attributions. The contributions of these cues depended substantially on the type of attribute being inferred, the judge (A or the observer), and whether the judgment was made of A or of B. A's behavior (i.e., her performance on the achievement task) contributed less to her self-attributions than it did either to her predictions of how B would rate her or to observers' actual judgments of her attributes. A's self-attributions tended to be relatively more influenced by her experiences before participating in the experiment. Whereas A appeared to use B's performance as a comparative standard when judging her own competence and expected B to do likewise, observers did not use B's performance in this manner when judging A. Moreover, A did not use her own performance as a standard when judging attributes of B.

A large environmental correlation between the scales suggested that environmental factors may predominate in determining the unitary nature of extraversion. The interaction between subjects and scales depended more on genetical factors, which suggests that the dual nature of extraversion has a strong genetical basis.

Numerous arguments seem to indicate the reality of clinical and experimental links between emotional life, psychic troubles and the dysfunctioning of organs or the apparition of visceral lesions. Anatomical and physiological studies play a capital role at the level of the hypothalamus, limbic system and at different neuroendocrinological systems (pituitary, corticoadrenal and medulloadrenal). On the experimental level, beside confining ulcers obtained by different technics on the laboratory rat, one must insist on the experiments of Weiss who showed that the peptic ulcers of the rat, under certain conditions, depend on two variables: the number of stimuli which the animal must face and the informative feedbacks more or less useful, which it receives in return. The investigations undertaken on the sick man show the importance of functional troubles with respect to anomalies of the autonomic nervous system or anomalies of intramural ganglions, which explain perhaps the notion of target organs for the troubles. Considering the most recent concepts which valorise the role of genetic factors in the determination of psychosomatic diseases, one can conceive that psychological determinants, affective or environmental, are cofactors which integrate themselves with somatic, genetic, constitutional and nutritional factors to produce the final morbid picture.","['Duret, R L']",['Duret RL'],,['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Belgium,Acta Psychiatr Belg,Acta psychiatrica Belgica,0247037,IM,"['Animals', 'Colon/physiopathology', 'Colonic Diseases, Functional/physiopathology', 'Diarrhea/etiology', 'Esophageal Achalasia/physiopathology', 'Food Hypersensitivity/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Peptic Ulcer/etiology', 'Personality', 'Porphyrias/physiopathology', 'Psychophysiologic Disorders/physiopathology', '*Psychosomatic Medicine', 'Rats', 'Social Conditions', 'Stomach/physiopathology']",,,,,,,1975/06/01 00:00,1975/06/01 00:01,['1975/06/01 00:00'],"['1975/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Psychiatr Belg. 1975 Jun-Jul;75(4):339-54.,,,,,,Introduction a la medecine psychosomatique,,,,,,,,,

The results supported the hypothesis regarding the relationship between self-concept and psychological distance, but only for females. There was also a tendency for more trusting females to produce closer distances than less trusting females.

While much research has been directed at determining factors responsible for poor compliance, past studies have tended to focus upon easily measured characteristics of the patients, regimen, or illness which, unfortunately, are usually neither predictive nor alterable. This paper systematically reviews the literature on patient acceptance of recommended health behaviors, attempting to find social-psychological and related variables which have proven to be consistent predictors of compliance. The review suggests that certain health beliefs (especailly personal estimates of vulnerability to, and seriousness of, the disease, and faith in the efficacy of care), health-related motivations, perceptions of psychological and other costs of the recommended action, various aspects of the doctor-patient relationship, and social influence are the most productive dimensions for present intervention and further exploration. Building upon an earlier formulation, an hypothesized model is presented which combines these elements for explaining and predicting compliance behavior. Further research should, with standardized questionnaires and analysis techniques, employ prospective, experimental designs for a variety of population groups, settings, and regimens, to evaluate the ability of practical attempts to modify the model variables and thus enhance compliance.","['Becker, M H', 'Maiman, L A']","['Becker MH', 'Maiman LA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Care,Medical care,0230027,AIM IM,"['Age Factors', '*Attitude to Health', 'Continuity of Patient Care', '*Cooperative Behavior', 'Health Services/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Models, Psychological', 'Motivation', 'Personality', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Preventive Health Services/statistics & numerical data', 'Probability', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Sick Role', 'Social Conformity', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,,,,,,1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Care. 1975 Jan;13(1):10-24. doi: 10.1097/00005650-197501000-00002.,,,111,['10.1097/00005650-197501000-00002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,

These data are compared with data from recent studies in the United States and England of male homosexual behavior. Although preliminary and limited, the Mexican data indicate that cultural factors are important determinants of life styles and sex practices of homosexual males. Forty-eight of the 53 (90%) preferred and usually practiced anal intercourse, four preferred oral contacts, and one preferred mutual masturbation. Interviewees were also grouped according to major type of sex activity during the first sustained year of homosexual activity after puberty. One intragroup comparison indicates significant differences between anal active and anal passive interviewees. For example, as children anal passive subjects had significantly more homosexual contacts with adults; they also considered themselves more effeminate and as children were more involved with female sex-typed activities. Comparison of data from the English and United States studies with the present data suggests that preference for a particular sexual technique is not as developed in the former two countries; when there is a preference, it is not usually for anal intercourse.","['Carrier, J M']",['Carrier JM'],"['School of Social Sciences, University of California, Irvine, California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Sex Behav,Archives of sexual behavior,1273516,,,,,,,,,1971/12/01 00:00,1971/12/01 00:01,['2013/11/02 06:00'],"['2013/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '1971/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1971/12/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Arch Sex Behav. 1971 Dec;1(4):279-91. doi: 10.1007/BF01638057.,,,,['10.1007/BF01638057 [doi]'],,,,,,10.1007/BF01638057 [doi],,,,,

In this paper population policy refers to governmental actions that are designed to alter population events, or that do alter them. The concern with policy seems to center in the relationships between four demographic variables (size, rates, distribution, composition) and four 'quality of life' categories as both determinants and consequences (comprehended here as economic, political, ecological/environmental, social). As to policy means, they can be seen as being five in number (information, voluntary programmes, change in social institutions, incentives and disincentives, and coercion) with the potential of affecting the three factors of fertility, mortality, and migration. The relationships and effects of these conceptual cross tabulations are illustrated.","['Berelson, B']",['Berelson B'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Popul Stud (Camb),Population studies,0376427,,,,,,,,,1971/07/01 00:00,1971/07/01 00:01,['2011/11/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '1971/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1971/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Popul Stud (Camb). 1971 Jul;25(2):173-82. doi: 10.1080/00324728.1971.10405796.,,,,['10.1080/00324728.1971.10405796 [doi]'],,,,,,10.1080/00324728.1971.10405796 [doi],,,,,

Ages at death, even in broad groups of ages, are not generally available until 1728, which is more than 50 years too late to give us any inkling of the ages, if any, at which people were specially susceptible to plague. There are reports, it is true, that suggest that children suffered from plague more severely than adults, at least on certain occasions (as in 1361 or 1418 for example), but nothing more precise. The legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin may be a folk-memory of a plague (possibly in 1284) that killed mainly the children of the town, for the connection between infestation of rats and the loss of children suggests some kind of plague outbreak. Pollitzer concludes that no particular age group is specially liable to plague, and attributes all differences observed to different risks of exposure. The determinants of the severity of an outbreak would therefore be the environmental details and social customs.","['Hollingsworth, M F', 'Hollingsworth, T H']","['Hollingsworth MF', 'Hollingsworth TH']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Popul Stud (Camb),Population studies,0376427,,,,,,,,,1971/03/01 00:00,1971/03/01 00:01,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '1971/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1971/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Popul Stud (Camb). 1971 Mar;25(1):131-46. doi: 10.1080/00324728.1971.10405789.,,,,['10.1080/00324728.1971.10405789 [doi]'],,,,,,10.1080/00324728.1971.10405789 [doi],,,,,

This paper points out the many sources of inaccuracy in the census data used. It argues that the indicators of unusually low fertility in the highland, predominantly Indianspeaking areas fail to control effectively for the very high levels of infant mortality in these regions. Fragmentary survey results give some indication of the scale of infant mortality, and appear to refute the idea that fertility is exceptionally low in areas of high altitude. In an attempt to explain why such high mortality rates persist in the Andean region the main health problems of Bolivia are examined. It seems that the causes are economic and social, rather than physiological. Unfortunately a change of policy which reduced death rates would produce grave new social problems.","['Whitehead, L']",['Whitehead L'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Popul Stud (Camb),Population studies,0376427,,,,,,,,,1968/11/01 00:00,1968/11/01 00:01,['2011/11/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '1968/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1968/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Popul Stud (Camb). 1968 Nov;22(3):335-46. doi: 10.1080/00324728.1968.10404943.,,,,['10.1080/00324728.1968.10404943 [doi]'],,,,,,10.1080/00324728.1968.10404943 [doi],,,,,

Multiple regression analysis reveals that age accounts for most of the explained variance in mobility, followed by income, education, regional location, sex, family size, and marital status. Additional variables-class of worker, race, nativity, professional type, size of place and industry-add no significant increments to explained variance.More specifically, low income and high education stimulate mobility and increases in family size and age slacken it. Young married professionals move the most and farthest, males somewhat more than females. Mobility is greatest in the West, least in the Northeast. Age reduces or reverses contrasts between single and married, large and small families, high and low incomes, little and much education, and residents of East and West.Factor analysis suggests that migration is part of two orderly processes-occupational career mobility and family life cycle. The bearing of these findings on the relationship between geographic mobility and social integration for the middleclass in the United States is considered.","['Ladinsky, J']",['Ladinsky J'],"['University of Wisconsin, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Demography,Demography,0226703,,,,,,,,,1967/03/01 00:00,1967/03/01 00:01,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '1967/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1967/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Demography. 1967 Mar;4(1):293-309. doi: 10.2307/2060370.,,,,['10.2307/2060370 [doi]'],,,,,,10.2307/2060370 [doi],,,,,

In a similar way, this study takes an across-country approach to specify independent variables, to separate economic from social and political variables, to make distinct comparisons of fertility responses in developed and underdeveloped countries, and to examine a wide range of hypotheses. The key is empirical analysis by separate regressions. This permits direct comparisons of countries at different levels of development, increases the probability of obtaining statistically significant regression coefficients, and standardizes the analysis for factors which vary with level of development.In this way, the authors determine positive and statistically significant relations between fertility and illiteracy, child mortality, proportion of agricultural population, proportion of nonfarm selfemployment, and overcrowded housing and show a negative significant relationship between fertility and communism. The study does not establish statistically significant relations, however, for population density, social mobility, substitutes for sexual intercourse, achievement motivation, protein in the diet, and religion.In general, the signs of the regression coefficients for the separate levels of development are the same as those for all countries combined. Any failure to attain statistical significance may be explained by small sample size and insufficient variation in the variables for separate levels of development.","['Friedlander, S', 'Silver, M']","['Friedlander S', 'Silver M']","['City College of the City University of New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Demography,Demography,0226703,,,,,,,,,1967/03/01 00:00,1967/03/01 00:01,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '1967/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1967/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",ppublish,Demography. 1967 Mar;4(1):30-70. doi: 10.2307/2060350.,,,,['10.2307/2060350 [doi]'],,,,,,10.2307/2060350 [doi],,,,,

Arguments based on economics, world peace, individual freedom, humanism and the preservation of life's amenities all point to the urgent need for programs to control birth rates. This applies to the United States also, although we have the advantage of a relatively high cultural and economic level from which to attack the problem. Modern psychiatry is increasingly committed to the Community Mental Health concept, which in part implies greater involvement with the element of the population that is socially and economically at a disadvantage. Effective treatment cannot ignore the effects on the patient of intolerable reality situations, often produced by successive unwanted pregnancies. In addition, a positive approach to family planning by psychiatrists and social workers will provide the structure needed for truly preventive psychiatry; as our knowledge of the determinants of psychosis, delinquency and mental retardation expands, selective counseling can do much to prevent these family and social tragedies. Both as world citizens and as practitioners of a profession, psychiatrists cannot afford to delay pledging their resources to the solution of so compelling a problem.","['Fischer, A']",['Fischer A'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Calif Med,California medicine,0410260,IM,"['*Community Mental Health Services', '*Family Planning Services', 'Humans', '*Social Work, Psychiatric']",,,,,,,1967/03/01 00:00,1967/03/01 00:01,['1967/03/01 00:00'],"['1967/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1967/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1967/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Calif Med. 1967 Mar;106(3):189-95.,,,,,,,PMC1502760,,,,,,,,
