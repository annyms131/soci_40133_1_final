11071843,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine: (a) the effect of two physical activity modes on changes in subjective well-being (SWB) over the course of a 12-month period in older, formerly sedentary adults (N = 174, M age = 65.5 years) and (b) the role played by physical activity participation and social support in changes in SWB over time. METHOD: Participants were randomized into either an aerobic activity group or a stretching and toning group. Structural equation modeling was employed to conduct multiple sample latent growth curve analyses of individual growth in measures of SWB (happiness, satisfaction with life, and loneliness) over time. RESULTS: A curvilinear growth pattern was revealed with well-being significantly improving over the course of the intervention followed by significant declines at the 6-month follow-up. Subsequent structural analyses were conducted showing that frequency of exercise participation was a significant predictor of improvement in satisfaction with life, whereas social relations were related to increases in satisfaction with life and reductions in loneliness. Improvements in social relations and exercise frequency also helped to buffer the declines in satisfaction with life at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that social relations integral to the exercise environment are significant determinants of subjective well-being in older adults. Findings are discussed in terms of how physical activity environments might be structured to maximize improvements in more global well-being constructs such as satisfaction with life."
18390845,0,a,"Schools are overloaded with health promotion programs that, altogether, focus on a broad array of behavioral domains, including substance abuse, sexuality and nutrition. Although the specific content of programs varies according to the domain focus, programs usually address similar concepts: knowledge, attitudinal beliefs, social influences and skills. This apparent conceptual overlap between behaviors and programs provides opportunities for a transfer-oriented approach which will stimulate students to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in one domain (e.g. skills for resisting tobacco use) to other domains (e.g. alcohol, sex). A requirement for such an approach is that behaviors share at least some determinants. This review addresses this issue by examining similarities between domain-specific determinants of smoking, drinking, safe sex and healthy nutrition among adolescents. Recent empirical studies and reviews were examined. The results show that the following determinants are relevant to all four behaviors: beliefs about immediate gratification and social advantages, peer norms, peer and parental modeling and refusal self-efficacy. Several other determinants have been found to relate to at least two behaviors, e.g. health risk beliefs and parental norms. These results can be used for the development of a transfer-oriented school health promotion curriculum."
11718448,0,a,"The main objective of this cohort study was to analyze the influence of social factors on the interval from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis in the 217 patients with digestive tract cancer. From the clinical charts, the following information was extracted: date of the beginning of illness, dates of medical attendance, type and date of diagnostic tests, characteristics of the disease (symptoms, stage), and date of treatment. From personal interviews we gathered the data not present in the clinical chart: sociodemographic data, information about other underlying diseases, and variables related to lifestyle. The time periods considered were from onset of symptoms to initial consultation (S-C); from initial consultation to hospital admission (C-H); and from hospital admission to diagnosis (H-D). The information on hospital admission, diagnosis, and treatment was prospectively gathered, whereas data before hospitalization were assessed retrospectively. For statistical analysis, we used Kruskal-Wallis test and Cox regression. Pain was the only predictor associated with a shorter S-C period. Hemorrhage, number of symptoms, and hospital consultation significantly shortened the interval C-H. Both hemorrhage and pain, and an initial visit at private primary care were the independent predictors that decreased the period H-D. In conclusion, sociodemographic factors did not influence healthcare attendance."
16700397,0,a,"This study investigated the attitudes of Omani adolescents towards gender roles and women's empowerment in taking household decisions, and the determinants of their positive attitudes. A national representative secondary school-based sample of 1670 boys and 1675 girls completed a self-administrated questionnaire with 2 indices: Adolescents' Attitudes Towards Gender Roles and Adolescents' Attitudes Towards Women's Empowerment. Other questions included demographic data, risk behaviour lifestyle, proxies to mental health and social environments expected to predict attitudes towards gender role. Eight variables predicted higher scores in both indices: sex, age, socioeconomic class, sleep problems, self-esteem, current smoking, history of indulging in violent behaviour and parental relations."
18268195,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although risk factors for Alzheimer disease have been well studied, much less is known about risk factors for primary progressive aphasia (PPA). OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that learning disabilities (LDs) are more common in patients with PPA and their first-degree family members. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Self-report endorsement of an individual and family history of an LD in a sample of 699 subjects from the Northwestern Alzheimer's Disease Center registry. We compared 3 dementia groups (PPA, typical amnestic Alzheimer disease, and the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia) and 1 elderly control group. A retrospective medical record review in the PPA probands was used to obtain additional information. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of LDs among probands and their first-degree relatives. RESULTS: The patients with PPA and their first-degree family members had a significantly higher frequency of LD compared with the other dementia groups and the controls. Some of the families of patients with PPA displayed unusual concentrations of LD, especially dyslexia. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LD may constitute a risk factor for PPA, providing additional clues concerning the determinants for the selective vulnerability of the language network in this syndrome."
9346048,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To enhance the case definition of unintentional injuries in childhood by applying an objective severity measure to fatal and non-fatal cases. DESIGN: A descriptive prospective epidemiological study of a defined resident childhood population (< 16 years of age) for a one year period, 1990. SETTING: Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Child population estimate for 1990 was 54,400. SUBJECTS: Resident children who died, were admitted to local hospitals, or attended local accident and emergency departments. OUTCOME MEASURES: Using recognised severity scoring systems (for example the injury severity score, trauma score) injuries were classified as severe, moderate, or mild. RESULTS: There were six deaths, 904 admissions, and 11,682 accident and emergency department attendances. All deaths, 25% of admissions, and 1% of accident and emergency attenders were classified as severe. The underlying determinants of severe injuries are different than those for all other injuries (for example age, social class). A comparison with a local survey in 1986 showed a 26% rise in hospital admissions, but no significant rise in the frequency of severe or moderately injured children. Comparisons with other international data showed higher rates of injury admissions and attendances for England, but no significant differences in the frequency of severe injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Objective severity scoring enhances the case definition of unintentional injuries in childhood by allowing for the identification, and, therefore, the more reliable ascertainment of severely injured children. This more completely ascertained set of population cases increases the accuracy of comparisons of injury frequency over time and by place, and, in addition, enhances our basic understanding about the epidemiological characteristics of childhood unintentional injury."
12319653,1,a,"This paper analyzes the impact of internal migration on earnings within the human capital model framework. Since migrants constitute a non-random sample of population, the endogenous nature of migration decision warrants necessary correction for the selectivity bias in their earnings function. The Mincer-type earnings model is thus augmented to determine the extent of this bias. Besides estimating the standard Mincerian earnings model, the paper also attempts to verify the learn-as-you-go proposition by introducing migration duration variables in the earnings model. Based on the household level Population, Labor Force, and Migration (1979-80) survey data, the analysis yields the following important conclusions: (i) the data allowed a meaningful estimation of Mincerian earnings function for migrants and non-migrants; (ii) the level of schooling was one of the important determinants of the distribution of income both for migrants and nonmigrants--the four categorical variables of education were in general statistically significant with expected signs, implying that the hypothesis of a positive relationship between income and education was accepted; (iii) the rates of return to education improved systematically with higher levels of education, thus confirming the notion that education serves as a signalling device; (iv) the age-income profile was almost linear for migrants but showed concavity for nonmigrants; (v) the presence of sample-selection was observed for migrants; and (vi) even after controlling for the influence of personal characteristics, i.e., education and experience, the long-standing migrants earned relatively more at the destination than the more recent migrants."
1761131,1,a,"The issue of do not resuscitate (DNR) decisions has been the subject of much discussion in the medical literature. To try to understand the factors that may be determinants of the timing of DNR decisions, we reviewed the charts of 70 consecutive burned patients who died between 1986 and 1988. When a DNR decision was written, it was within 48 hours of the patient's death (74% of patients). No statistical difference was found in the sex distribution or in the percentage of body surface area burned in the DNR group and in the resuscitation group. Physicians, nurses, social workers, the hospital attorney, the district attorney, and the coroner of our county were interviewed. The uncertainty of legal guidelines and practical considerations of family expectations preclude a uniform approach to this problem."
8816008,1,a,"This study examined the structure and determinants of lay people's implicit theories of heroin addiction. A questionnaire was derived from interviews with lay people about their beliefs and theories of heroin addiction and academic literature on the subject. One hundred and forty-four subjects completed the questionnaire, in which they rated 105 statements about the causes, correlates and cures of heroin addiction. The three parts of the questionnaire were individually factor analyzed and a clear, interpretable factor structure emerged for each. The factors seemed similar to explicit academic theories, but the exception was beliefs about cure, which did not show overall support for the most clinically used models. When the three factor analyses were combined into a single 'higher-order' factor analysis four factors emerged, labelled moralistic, psychosocial, sociocultural and drug treatment, which reflect more or less coherent views on the nature of heroin addiction. Subjects' political beliefs was the greatest (demographic and attitudinal) determinant of lay beliefs in these factors, with experience of addiction, addicts, drugs and age also highly correlated. Vote was the main determinant and best predictor of the four 'higher-order' structured lay theories: right-wing voters emphasizing moralistic and individualistic theory and left-wing voters supporting the psychological and societal ideas. Implications for policy and interventions to addicts of these lay theories are considered."
19207602,0,a,"Healthcare policy reforms enacted through the 1990s explicitly endorsed expanded community care and enhanced equitable access to care. We examine end-of-life home-care service utilization during this time period. We are interested in trends in and predictors of utilization influencing receipt of service or total service use. This is a population-based, retrospective study of home-care utilization by adults 50 years of age and older in British Columbia, Canada, who died in the last 6 months of each year from 1991 to 2000 (n = 98,327). Data were drawn from the British Columbia Linked Health Data resource; we examined both receipt and extent of care, using logistic and standard regression models. Independent variables included year of death, age, gender, area of residence and income quintile. Year of death was not significantly associated with receipt of home care in general. However, the odds of receiving home support services declined significantly over time, while annual home support hours increased. In contrast, receipt of home nursing increased, while annual home nursing visits did not change. Social factors frequently emerged as significant predictors of both receipt and extent of care. However, we found only limited evidence for interactions between these factors and year of death acting as determinants of receipt or extent of service. Results suggest that end-of-life home care services did not expand, but instead were reallocated and intensified over the 1990s. As well, there was little evidence to suggest enhanced equity in access to care."
12291040,1,a,"""Inscribed within an ancient national tradition, rural emigration in the interandean valleys of Bolivia is gaining importance. The country's contemporary crises and the immigration policies of the host countries maintain the flux trend towards Argentina while enabling new destination targets: the United States, and more recently Israel and Japan. In these Bolivian lands, the emigration derived income provides the driving force of family economies and triggers development of the local territory. At the same time, emigration induces a process of socio-economic differentiation in peasant communities which weakens the food-system and increases family nutritional risks in the populations marginal to this migration system. In addition to these mutations there is a strong sociocultural destructuring which affects community-cohesion in local societies."" (SUMMARY IN ENG AND SPA)"
2169762,1,a,"A causal distinction is established in infant Norway rats between opioid- and nonopioid-mediated determinants of behavior. Contact influences are shown to be mediated by nonopioid pathways, whereas gustatory influences are shown to be opioid mediated. Specifically, naltrexone (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) did not at all diminish quieting exerted by contact with an anesthetized dam but completely reversed the quieting effects of morphine in isolated rats. Naloxone (5 mg/kg) did not affect the latencies with which nondeprived or 8-hr deprived rats 9, 12, 15, and 18 days of age attached to the nipples of anesthetized dams, nor did naloxone (5 and 10 mg/kg) cause any systematic change in nipple attachment in 10- and 18-day-old rats that had been deprived of their dam for either 0, 8, or 24 hr. In a 3rd experiment, naloxone (5 mg/kg) did not significantly reduce milk intake by 9-, 12-, 15-, or 18-day-old rats from the nipple when milk letdown was induced by oxytocin. Moreover, naloxone (5 and 10 mg/kg) did not reduce milk intake in Day-10 rats that, while suckling, received milk via a cannula placed in the posterior portion of the tongue at the level of the intermolar eminence or in rats that obtained milk directly from their awake mother. In contrast, milk intake was significantly reduced by naltrexone (0.25-1.0 mg/kg) in Day-10 rats that obtained milk (a) by licking it off a saturated substrate or (b) through an indwelling cannula located in the anterior portion of the lower jaw. (Milk delivered at this placement is thought to engage feeding systems by its taste and texture.) In a final set of experiments in Day-10 rats, intake of milk delivered via anterior jaw cannulae was reduced by naloxone (5 and 10 mg/kg) in rats that were either isolated, in contact with an anesthetized dam, or attached to her nipples. On the basis of resistance to naloxone and naltrexone administration, these experiments demonstrate that behavioral influences of the tactile (and possibly olfactory) qualities of the mother are not mediated by opioid systems. Implications for understanding the means through which mothers can influence their young and the infantile mediators of these maternal influences are discussed."
1750947,1,a,"An AAMC working group concluded that medical educators have paid insufficient attention to students' development of professional standards and to the immediate ethical dilemmas that students face as students. Its discussion of the primary determinants of medical students' ethical development focused on improving: (1) the evaluation of candidates for admission; (2) the medical school learning climate, including recognition of the challenges inherent in the increasing cultural diversity among students and patients; and (3) communication to students of expectations of professional behaviors and standards. An AAMC initiative is outlined that includes preparation of a resource book featuring cases illustrating common ethical dilemmas that medical students face, descriptions of effective honor systems, suggestions for faculty development, and an annotated bibliography."
12396543,0,a,"Determinants of sexual activity and intentions for condom use were examined guided by the Attitude, Social influences, and Self-efficacy (ASE) model as a theoretical framework. A total of 561 in and out-of-school youth (15-24 years) in Addis Ababa completed a self-administered questionnaire. A third of them reported sexual intercourse in the past and half of the sexually active used condoms during recent intercourse. Being out-of-school, male, aged 20-24 years, alcohol use and khat (amphetamine-like substance) consumption predicted the likelihood of engagement in sexual activity. Of these variables, however, male sex was more associated with reported condom use during recent sexual intercourse. Self-efficacy, skills, and barriers predicted 23% of the variance in intentions to use condoms. Self-efficacy was also associated with past condom use. Psychosocial constructs predicted more variations in condom use intention for males than for females. In general, self-efficacy was found to be the strongest predictor of the constructs, whereas attitude and social influences were the weakest. The study implies that HIV/AIDS prevention programmes for young people in Ethiopia need to emphasize building assertive communication skills in sexual negotiations and condom use. Minimizing the gender gap in sexual relationships forms the cornerstone for such educational strategies."
17126972,0,a,"This paper reviews the nexus between poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa using a sustainable livelihood framework. Much of the literature on HIV and AIDS has generated an almost universal consensus that the AIDS epidemic is having an immense impact on the economies of hard-hit countries, hurting not only individuals, families and firms, but also significantly slowing economic growth and worsening poverty. International evidence has concentrated on the pathways through which HIV/AIDS undermines livelihoods and raises vulnerability to future collapse of livelihoods. Yet, little attention has been paid to the role that social relations and livelihood strategies can play in bringing about risky social interaction that raises the chance of contracting HIV. Using the sustainable livelihood and social relation approaches, this article demonstrates that although AIDS is not simply a disease of the poor, determinants of the epidemic go far beyond individual volition and that some dimensions of being poor increase risk and vulnerability to HIV."
19288983,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Intermittent smokers account for a large proportion of all smokers, and this trend is increasing. Social and communication inequalities may account for disparities in intermittent smoking status. METHODS: Data for this study came from 2,641 ever-smokers from a 2003 nationally representative cross-sectional survey. Independent variables of interest included race/ethnicity, sex, household income, education, health media attention, and cancer-related beliefs. The outcome of interest was smoking status categorized as daily smoker, intermittent smoker, or former smoker. Analyses used 2 sets of multivariable logistic regressions to investigate the associations of covariates with intermittent smokers compared with former smokers and with daily smokers. RESULTS: People with high education and high income, Spanish-speaking Hispanics, and women were the most likely to be intermittent rather than daily smokers. Women and Spanish-speaking Hispanics were the most likely to be intermittent rather than former smokers. Attention to health media sources increased the likelihood that a person would be an intermittent smoker instead of a former or daily smoker. Believing that damage from smoking is avoidable and irreversible was associated with lower odds of being an intermittent smoker rather than a former smoker but did not differentiate intermittent smoking from daily smoking. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that tailoring smoking-cessation campaigns toward intermittent smokers from specific demographic groups by using health media may improve the effect of these campaigns and reduce social health disparities."
7989069,1,a,"Symptom management and prevention of psychotic relapse are major treatment concerns in schizophrenia. Research shows a relationship between psychotic symptom levels and several intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental factors. These determinants are incorporated into an etiologic causal model of psychotic symptoms based on a vulnerability-stress framework. Then a multifaceted intervention model to influence symptom determinants is advanced, and examples of intervention elements are specified. Finally, a research agenda to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention model is described, and related methodologic issues are considered."
9216030,1,a,"This article presents the results of an assessment of gynecological morbidity among 385 women with young children residing in a district of Karnataka State, South India. All three main modes of assessment (clinical examination, laboratory tests, and self-reports) reveal a high burden of reproductive tract infections. The two most common conditions, identified by laboratory tests, were bacterial vaginosis and mucopurulent cervicitis. Approximately one-fourth of the women had clinical evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical ectopy, and fistula. The contribution of sexually transmitted diseases to overall gynecological morbidity appears to be relatively modest; 10 percent were so diagnosed. Associated conditions of anemia and chronic energy deficiency were common. Severe anemia was found in 17 percent of cases and severe chronic energy deficiency in 12 percent. These results indicate that radical improvements in women's health in India will require far more than the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive tract infections."
9415002,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate dietary determinants of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in health conscious individuals to explain the reduced risk in vegetarians, and to examine the relation between IHD and body mass index (BMI) within the normal range. DESIGN: Prospective observation of vegetarians, semi-vegetarians, and meat eaters for whom baseline dietary data, reported weight and height information, social class, and smoking habits were recorded. SUBJECTS: 10,802 men and women in the UK aged between 16 and 79, mean duration of follow up 13.3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Death rate rations for IHD and total mortality in relation to dietary and other characteristics recorded at recruitment (reference category death rate = 100). RESULTS: IHD mortality was less than half that expected from the experience reported for all of England and Wales. An increase in mortality for IHD was observed with increasing intakes of total and saturated animal fat and dietary cholesterol-death rate ratios in the third tertile compared with the first tertile: 329, 95% confidence interval (CI) 150 to 721; 277, 95% CI 125 to 613; 353, 95% CI 157 to 796, respectively. No protective effects were observed for dietary fibre, fish or alcohol. Within the study, death rate ratios were increased among those in the upper half of the normal BMI range (22.5 to < 25) and those who were overweight (BMI > or = 25) compared with those with BMI 20 to < 22.5. CONCLUSIONS: In these relatively health conscious individuals the deleterious effects of saturated animal fat and dietary cholesterol appear to be more important in the aetiology of IHD than the protective effect of dietary fibre. Reduced intakes of saturated animal fat and cholesterol may explain the lower rates of IHD among vegetarians compared with meat eaters. Increasing BMI within the normal range is associated with increased risk of IHD. The results have important public health implications."
18378372,0,a,"The emerging fields of social epidemiology and population health seek to understand the social determinants of health. Especially, with regards to how income inequality causes health disparities, attention has been focused on material and psychosocial mechanisms. I use examples from the epidemiological and social science literature to argue for a third broad etiological framework: the role played by the ways we generally recognize, define, name, and categorize disease states and attribute them to a cause or set of causes. These framing effects shape population health by influencing: health and illness beliefs; patterns of consumption and other behaviors; perceptions of what interventions and policies work; class, ethnic, and other social dynamics; and clinical and public health practices. Important characteristics of many framing phenomena are their capacity to be self-perpetuating and their performative power. A better understanding of framing effects can lead to deploying them more deliberatively and flexibly to improve individual and population health."
19149396,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Most immigrants to Canada now come from Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean and Africa, where cultures and languages often differ significantly from the Canadian context. Subgroups of immigrants experience disparities in health. Inability to communicate in an official language in Canada may be a marker of risk for poor health due to both pre- and post-migration factors. We aimed to study the relationship between language proficiency and self-reported health. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the first two surveys of the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (2001, 2003), a population-based cohort study of new immigrants to Canada. Specifically, we used logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between self-reported health and language proficiency by sex, controlling for a range of health determinants at 6 months (wave 1) and 2 years (wave 2) after arrival. RESULTS: After controlling for covariates (age, sex, education, region of birth, immigrant class, job satisfaction, access to health care), analysis of the wave 1 survey showed that poor proficiency in English or French is significantly related to the self-reported poor health (OR=2.0, p<0.01). And this relationship was consistent in the wave 2 survey (OR=1.9, p<0.01). We also found that this statistically significant association between poor language proficiency and self-reported health holds only for women (wave 1 survey OR=2.6, p <0.01, wave 2 survey OR=2.2, p<0.01), not for men. CONCLUSION: The association between poor language proficiency and poor self-reported health, and particularly its significantly greater impact on women, has implications for language training, health care and social services, and health information."
19654137,0,a,"INTRODUCTION OR BACKGROUND: Debate over relationships between economic growth, wealth, health and health inequity is long-standing and ongoing. The main message of this paper is that economic growth, while necessary, is not a sufficient condition in itself for achieving equitable health. SOURCES OF DATA: This review surveys and draws on research into principal factors commonly linked with improving health-income, health care, individual behavior-suggesting, using work from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health, that these are better understood in a broader social determinants of health framework. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The paper acknowledges that post-war globalization has seen significant growth, poverty reduction and greater economic resources at individual and household levels all of which can contribute to better health. But it also highlights renewing inequity in global health during the period. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: It argues that over-reliance on market-driven growth, which fails to address deep-rooted social inequalities in economic resources key to accessing social determinants of health, and in the key determinants of health themselves have contributed to increasing inequity in health outcomes. GROWING POINTS: Commitment to market-driven growth remains evident in national policy-making worldwide. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: With increasing health inequity, and calamitous global economic events in 2008-09, the centrality of this commitment needs urgently to be reviewed."
16297230,0,a,"Experts contend that weather and climate forecasts could have an important role in risk management strategies for community water systems. Yet, most water managers make minimal use of these forecasts. This research explores the determinants of the use of weather and climate forecasts by surveying managers of community water systems in two eastern American states (South Carolina and the Susquehanna River Basin of Pennsylvania). Assessments of the reliability of weather and climate forecasts are not driving their use as water managers who find forecasts reliable are no more likely to use them than are managers who find them unreliable. Although larger systems and those depending on surface water are more likely to use forecasts for some (but not all) purposes, the strongest determinant of forecast use is risk perceptions. Water managers who expect to face problems from weather events in the next decade are much more likely to use forecasts than are water managers who expect few problems. Their expectations of future problems are closely linked with past experience: water managers who have had problems with specific types of weather events (e.g., flood emergencies) in the last 5 years are likely to expect to experience problems in the next decade. Feeling at risk, regardless of the specific source of that weather-related risk, stimulates a decision to use weather and climate forecasts."
18805655,0,a,"PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence and correlates of cocaine injection initiation and the impacts of daily cocaine injection among a cohort of injection drug users. METHODS: Among 1603 participants, from May 1996 to December 2005, risk factors for initiation of cocaine injection among baseline heroin users were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression and correlates of daily cocaine injection by generalized estimating equations. FINDINGS: Of the 238 individuals who had never injected cocaine, 200 (84%) had at least one follow-up visit and 121 (61%) consequently initiated into cocaine injection, yielding an incidence density of initiation into cocaine injection of 21.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 17.9-25.8) per 100 person-years. In a multivariate model, Downtown Eastside (DTES) residence (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=2.46, 95% CI: 1.68-3.60), incarceration (AHR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.01-2.24), requiring help injecting (AHR=1.57, 95% CI: 0.99-2.49), and binge drug use (AHR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.22-2.73) remained associated with initiation into cocaine injection. DTES residence (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.99, 95% CI: 1.62-2.46), unstable housing (AOR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.53), incarceration (AOR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.04-1.60), sex trade involvement (AOR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.15-1.85), requiring help injecting (AOR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.73-2.58)), borrowing syringes (AOR=1.81, 95% CI: 1.35-2.43) and binge drug use (AOR=2.16, 95% CI: 1.81-2.58) were independently associated with daily cocaine injection. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline prevalence and subsequent incidence of initiation into cocaine injection was high. Daily cocaine injection was independently associated with a number of health and social harms, including elevated HIV risk behavior."
18567407,0,a,"There are relatively few systematic investigations concerning sexual disorders in schizophrenia. In the paper, the most important set of symptoms of sexual disorders in schizophrenia, such as weaker libido, erection and ejaculation disturbances in men, and lubrication and orgasm disturbances in women are described. The lacking of satisfactory partner and sexual relationships is emphasized in the article. In the case of women, the most significant are the problems related to the period of pregnancy, childbirth and care giving. The overview of research literature is focused on differences between females and males in relation to sexual disorders determinants as well as clinical, mental and social effects in the course of schizophrenia."
11133341,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with estabLished coronary artery improves if smoking is stopped. Still, about half of patients who suffer a myocardial infarction continue smoking after that event. In order to predict to whom additional support should be offered, various baseline characteristics were compared with smoking status at short-term and long-term follow-up. METHODS: Demographics, medical history, presence of coronary risk factors, psychological determinants, and the clinical course were recorded in a group of 530 unselected consecutive patients who had been admitted with a myocardial infarction and were smoking. Patients who were smoking at admission, and who were alive at 4-year follow-up, were studied to relate smoking status and baseline characteristics. RESULTS: At 3 months, persistent smokers were younger than quitters, had shorter hospital stays, underwent revascularization procedures less often, smoked more cigarettes per day at baseline, and were more socially isolated. After 4 years, patients who stopped smoking had had a more serious myocardial infarction and had a lower displeasure score than those who continued smoking. Also, quitters received more support from their social environment. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of the patients try to stop smoking after a myocardial infarction, about half smokes after 4 years. In the future, special support should be offered to smokers who suffer myocardial infarction, especially to those whose psychosocial profiles are less favorable."
20198904,0,a,"Drug use is a complex behavior with multidimensional determinants, including social, psychological, cultural, economic, and biological factors. Blood borne viral infections including hepatitis C virus are transmitted when an uninfected intravenous drug user (IVDU) uses injection equipment, especially syringes, that have previously been used by an infected person. The transmission can also result from sharing other injection equipment such as 'cookers' and 'cottons'. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse have declined substantially since the introduction of needle exchange. Infection with hepatitis C may spontaneously resolve during the acute stage and never progress to chronic infection, or the infection may become chronic without medical complications, or the infection may become chronic with progressive medical complications. Regular testing for infection is an important strategy for secondary prevention of chronic hepatitis C infection. Care for hepatitis C is a vital component of a comprehensive health program for persons using illicit drugs. Such care includes screening for transmission risk behavior, prevention counseling and education, testing for HCV antibody and RNA. IDUs found to have chronic HCV infection should be assessed for the presence and degree of liver disease and evaluated for treatment for HCV Hepatitis C care also requires providing access to treatment for substance use and abuse. Therapy with opioid agonists, including methadone maintenance treatment, has been shown to diminish and often eliminate opioid use and reduce transmission of infection. Approval of buprenorphine makes office-based pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction possible. When considering treatment for hepatitis C, particular attention must be paid to mental health conditions. As a group, IDUs exhibit higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders than the general population. IFN-based regimens for hepatitis C are often complicated by neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including depression, insomnia, and irritability. Strong linkages with mental health services, whether on-site or within the community, are a vital component of comprehensive health programs for IDUs and are particularly important during treatment for hepatitis C. Past episodes of depression or other psychiatric disorders are not absolute contraindications for the treatment for HCV infection. Some authors recommend prophylactic antidepressant therapy before initiating treatment for HCV in patients thought to be at a high risk of depression."
17435206,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In earlier studies, determinants of socioeconomic gradient in mobility have not been measured comprehensively. AIM: To assess the contribution of chronic morbidity, obesity, smoking and physical workload to inequalities in mobility. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on 2572 persons (76% of a nationally representative sample of the Finnish population aged > or = 55 years). Mobility limitations were measured by self-reports and performance rates. RESULTS: According to a wide array of self-reported and test-based indicators, persons with a lower level of education showed more mobility limitations than those with a higher level. The age-adjusted ORs for limitations in stair climbing were threefold in the lowest-educational category compared with the highest one (OR 3.3 in men and 2.9 in women for self-reported limitations, and 3.5 in men and 2.2 in women for test-based limitations). When obesity, smoking, work-related physical loading and clinically diagnosed chronic diseases were simultaneously accounted for, the educational differences in stair-climbing limitations vanished or were greatly diminished. In women, obesity contributed most to the differences, followed by a history of physically strenuous work, knee and hip osteoarthritis and cardiovascular diseases. In men, diabetes, work-related physical loading, musculoskeletal diseases, obesity and smoking contributed substantially to the inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Great educational inequalities exist in various measures of mobility. Common chronic diseases, obesity, smoking and workload appeared to be the main pathways from low education to mobility limitations. General health promotion using methods that also yield good results in the lowest-educational groups is thus a good strategy to reduce the disparities in mobility."
15797980,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic illness with an unpredictable and variable course, profoundly affects the quality of life (QOL). General health questionnaires are used to assess QOL in SLE, but a disease-specific instrument could offer enhanced responsiveness and content validity. We detail the steps we took to develop and validate a new SLE-specific QOL instrument, SLEQOL. METHODS: Rheumatology professionals nominated items that they felt were important determinants of QOL of SLE patients. One hundred SLE patients were asked to assess the importance and frequency of occurrence of these items and to suggest those that had not been listed. Item reduction was performed using Rasch model and factor analyses to create a new questionnaire in English. This final questionnaire was administered to a cohort of 275 patients to study its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Fifty-one items covering a wide range of QOL concerns were identified. The patients' responses led to the elimination of 11. The new questionnaire of 40 items was found to have Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 and to consist of eight domains covering physical, mental and social QOL issues. It has good test-retest reliability, poor to fair cross-sectional correlation with the SF-36, with poor correlation with lupus activity or damage indices. The SLEQOL was more responsive to change than the SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new 40-item SLEQOL in English and showed that it is valid for use in SLE patients in Singapore. It offers better content validity and responsiveness to change than the SF-36."
12343383,1,a,"""This paper analyses age and experience profiles of earnings inequality for American and Brazilian males. Decomposition of the inequality profiles using a human capital framework clarifies the determinants of cross-section inequality profiles and demonstrates a number of important differences in the shape of the two countries' profiles and in their underlying components. Changes in the distribution of schooling across cohorts are shown to play a central role in explaining cross-section inequality profiles within each country and in explaining differences in earnings inequality in the United States and Brazil.""

9068417,1,a,"The effects of breeding season and reproductive status on male reproduction were investigated in the common mole-rat (Cryptomys hottentotus hottentotus), a co-operatively breeding rodent that exhibits seasonal reproduction and a reproductive division of labour. Testicular anatomical and histological morphometrics, and selected sperm parameters were studied in 50 males from 17 wild caught colonies. Males exhibited no apparent manifestation of season on testicular activity: spermatogenesis and sperm quality (motility and percentage normal morphology) were similar in the reproductively active and inactive periods. This maintenance of reproductive activity during the non-reproductive period is essential in C. h. hottentotus males, as this period coincides with the period of maximal dispersal opportunities. Such reproductive activation in dispersing males may aid intersexual recognition, and assist pair-bond formation or successful assimilation into foreign colonies, thereby facilitating later outbreeding. Consequently, outbreeding opportunities may be important determinants of reproductive activity in male common mole-rats, moderating seasonal effects. Reproductive and non-reproductive males revealed no differences in any of the testicular or sperm parameters studied. The absence of a physiologically well-defined suppression of reproduction in male common mole-rats is more typical of social suppression in male mammals."
8227095,1,a,"The associations of social and behavioural factors on preterm birth in Singapore were studied using hospital maternity records of 20,723 consecutive singleton births between January 1986 and November 1991. The overall proportion of preterm births was 3.6%, the rates for the Chinese, Malay and Indian groups being 3.2%, 3.8% and 4.9% respectively. Teenage mothers were at a higher risk of preterm labour compared to women aged 20-29 years. The incidence of preterm labour decreased with increasing educational status. Preterm births were six times more likely in women who had no antenatal care. Women who had three or more previous births were at a higher risk, while those who had one or two previous births were at a lower risk compared to women who had none."
9696119,1,a,"The current study set out to investigate the structure, determinants, and relationship between lay theories of the etiology and efficacy of ""cures"" for four types of paraphilia: fetishism, pedophilia, sexual sadism, and voyeurism. One hundred and five participants completed a four-part questionnaire, which was divided into (a) demographic details, (b) perceptions of the etiology, (c) ratings of cure for each paraphilia, and (d) the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Previous studies of lay theories have demonstrated a clear and interpretable factor structure similar to that of explicit academic theories, as well as a clear and logical relationship between perceived etiology and cure. A similar structure was expected to emerge in this study, together with positive correlations between the various factors and personality type. A factor analysis revealed a clear and logical factor structure for etiology and cure items. Further, etiology and cure factors correlated strongly with each other but only moderately with demographic details and personality differences. These findings are discussed in relation to growing literature in the field."
2014415,1,a,"A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 2000 adult Ethiopians living in rural communities to determine firstly the prevalence of mental illness and secondly its association with stress and demographic variables. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire developed by WHO experts was used as the measure of mental illness. A modified version of the Holmes-Rahe Social Readjustment Scale was the measure of stress. Respondents were interviewed in their homes. Those experiencing 11 or more of the 20 neurotic symptoms and 3 or more of the 4 psychotic symptoms were considered mentally ill. Despite the use of high cut-off points for identifying potential cases, the prevalence of mental illness was 17.2%--neurotic 11.2% and psychotic 6.0%. This is higher than earlier reports for Ethiopia, but comparable to rates found in other African countries. Mental illness scores were most strongly associated with stress in that the odds of experiencing 6 or more stressful life events in the past year were 2.7 times greater for neurotics and 2.1 times greater for psychotics. In addition, neuroses and psychoses were significantly associated with a family history of mental illness and with being divorced, separated or widowed. Neurosis alone was also associated with chronic illness, females, those between the ages of 35 and 44, and illiteracy. These findings were discussed in terms of their relevance for identifying high stress groups and thus for preventing mental illness through community activities."
16162598,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Underweight, overweight, and obese women aged 18-34 years were compared with normal weight women of the corresponding age according to socioeconomic, psychosocial, health behaviour, self reported global and psychological health, and locus of control characteristics. METHODS: The 2000 public health survey in Scania is a cross-sectional study. A total 13,715 persons aged 18-80 years, of which 1967 were females of 18-34 years of age, were included in this study. They answered a postal questionnaire, which represents 59% of the random sample. A logistic regression model adjusted for age was used to investigate the association between socioeconomic, psychosocial, health behaviour, self reported global and psychological health, locus of control, and the BMI categories. RESULTS: A 17.5% proportion of the women, aged 18-34 years, were underweight (BMI < 20.0), 18.4% were overweight, and 7.0% obese. The prevalence of underweight according to the BMI < 18.5 definition was 5.8% among women aged 18-34 years. Women who were underweight had significantly higher odds ratios for overtime work, being students, low emotional support, and poor self reported global as well as poor psychological health than normal weight women. Women who were overweight/obese were unemployed, had low education, low social participation, low emotional and instrumental support, were daily smokers, had a sedentary lifestyle, had poor self reported global health, and had lack of internal locus of control compared with normal weight women. CONCLUSIONS: Underweight women are more likely to have poorer psychological health than normal weight women. In contrast, overweight and obese women are more likely to have poor health related behaviours and lack of internal locus of control compared with normal weight women. These differing patterns suggest both different etiology and different preventive strategies to deal with the health risks of people who are underweight as opposed to those who are overweight/obese."
19418020,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Based on the theoretical and empirical approach of Pierre Bourdieu, a multivariate non-linear method is introduced as an alternative way to analyse the complex relationships between social determinants and health. METHODS: The analysis is based on face-to-face interviews with 695 randomly selected respondents aged 30 to 59. Variables regarding socio-economic status, life circumstances, lifestyles, health-related behaviour and health were chosen for the analysis. In order to determine whether the respondents can be differentiated and described based on these variables, a non-linear canonical correlation analysis (OVERALS) was performed. RESULTS: The results can be described on three dimensions; Eigenvalues add up to the fit of 1.444, which can be interpreted as approximately 50 % of explained variance. The three-dimensional space illustrates correspondences between variables and provides a framework for interpretation based on latent dimensions, which can be described by age, education, income and gender. CONCLUSION: Using non-linear canonical correlation analysis, health characteristics can be analysed in conjunction with socio-economic conditions and lifestyles. Based on Bourdieus theoretical approach, the complex correlations between these variables can be more substantially interpreted and presented."
1946862,1,a,"The aims of this study were, first, to estimate the prevalence of depressive disorders in Australian nursing home residents using international diagnostic criteria, and second, to explore environmental determinants of such disorders. Residents of 24 nursing homes were surveyed using the Canberra Interview for the Elderly (CIE) and a range of environmental measures was also taken. Of 323 residents who were screened for cognitive impairment, 165 (51%) scored 18 or above on the Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al. 1975), and were interviewed with the CIE. According to DSM-III-R criteria and the CIE, the prevalence of major depressive episode was 9.7%. Using ICD-10 criteria, 6.1% of residents suffered from a severe depressive episode, 6.7% from a moderate depressive episode and 6.7% from a mild depressive episode. Some measures of the social environment were significantly related to depressive symptoms."
2141337,1,a,"Despite considerable progress in the epidemiology of late life depressive disorders, the determinants and course of late life depressive symptoms remain unclear. The apparent reciprocal relationship between depression and disability, a consistent finding in cross-sectional studies further confounds efforts to estimate the importance of depressive symptoms in the elderly. In a longitudinal study of 1457 aged community residents who completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale at baseline and 24 months later, a significant level of depressive symptoms emerged in 163 respondents (11%), while 1080 (74%) remained symptom free. Unlike other studies, we found that the number of medical conditions, social support, life events, and demographic characteristics contributed little to distinguish those with emerging symptoms from those who remained symptom free. However, increasing disability and declining health preceded the emergence of depressive symptoms and accounted for seventy percent of the variance explained by discriminant analysis. These findings have etiologic implications for both the course and determinants of depression in late life."
8061592,1,a,"The present case-control study was designed mainly to estimate the risk of gastric cancer associated with consumption of alcoholic beverages. Seventy-four cases were selected from patients undergoing endoscopy with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of gastric cancer and matched by age and sex to a pool of controls (193) from three different sources, at the same hospital ward. After adjustment for several confounders, consumption of more than one bottle of red wine per day 20 years prior to the interview showed an odds ratio (OR) = 2.61 (P = 0.049), with a dose-response relationship increasing from 1.36 for those consuming less than one glass of wine per meal, up to 3.67 if the daily consumption exceeded one bottle of red wine. Other statistically significant determinants of the disease occurrence were low education level (OR = 4.33; P = 0.0008) and low social class (OR = 2.77; P = 0.016), as well as the regular practice of preserving food by smoke at home (OR = 1.91; P = 0.032)."
10409779,1,a,"The objective of this study was to investigate the association between farmers' socioeconomic conditions and their children's health in La Fraylesca, Chiapas. Data were collected using a cross-sectional survey of 1046 households (5546 individuals) sampled from locations in two counties situated in the study area. The survey included anthropometric measurements, a 24-hour dietary recall, stool tests, and childhood mortality data. Children of private farmers and ""wealthy peasants"" displayed better nutritional status, higher quality diet, lower prevalence of intestinal parasites, and a lower risk of dying than those whose parents were communal farmers, from ejidos, or ""poor peasants"". The results suggest that using volume of maize production as a classification method proved more valuable than land tenure to identify agricultural groups with different health status. It appears that the main determinants of health differentials are structural inequities in resource distribution. Thus, the impact of medical interventions on inequalities will be limited unless they are accompanied by redistribution of resources."
19161545,0,a,"Child stunting, an outcome of chronic undernutrition, contributes to poor quality of life, morbidity and mortality. In South Asia, the low status of women is thought to be one of the primary determinants of undernutrition across the lifespan. Low female status can result in compromised health outcomes for women, which in turn are related to lower infant birthweight and may affect the quality of infant care and nutrition. Maternal autonomy (defined as a woman's personal power in the household and her ability to influence and change her environment) is likely an important factor influencing child care and ultimately infant and child health outcomes. To examine the relationship between maternal autonomy and child stunting in Andhra Pradesh, India, we analysed data from National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-2. We used cross-sectional demographic, health and anthropometric information for mothers and their oldest child <36 months (n = 821) from NFHS-2. The main explanatory variables of autonomy are presented by four dimensions - decision making, permission to travel, attitude towards domestic violence and financial autonomy - constructed using seven binary variables. Logistic regression models were used to test associations between indicators of female autonomy and the risk of having a stunted child. Women with higher autonomy {indicated by access to money [odds ratio (OR) = 0.731; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.546, 0.981] and freedom to choose to go to the market [OR = 0.593; 95% CI 0.376, 0.933]} were significantly less likely to have a stunted child, after controlling for household socio-economic status and mother's education. In this south Indian state, two dimensions of female autonomy have an independent effect on child growth, suggesting the need for interventions that increase women's financial and physical autonomy."
11980743,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This study examines social, demographic and family planning programme factors influencing intrauterine device (IUD) use, failure and subsequent resolution ('use dynamics') in the 1988 Chinese National Survey of Fertility and Contraceptive Prevalence. METHOD: A time-to-failure model was used to identify independent determinants of IUD failure. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of abortion in women after failure. RESULTS: Being younger at IUD fitting [<25 versus > or = 35 years, hazard ratio 5.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.3, 7.7] and having a larger number of living children (> or = 3 versus <2 children, hazard ratio 1.2, 95% CI 1.1, 1.4) predict higher risk of IUD failure when controlled for each other; but in women with IUD failure, being older and having fewer children predict a much higher chance of resulting abortion. Contraceptive history and social/regional factors were also associated with higher IUD failure risk, in particular, use before 1984 (hazard ratio 1.3, 95% CI 1.2,1.4); and some of these factors were also predictive of abortion following failure. CONCLUSIONS: The determinants of IUD use dynamics suggest two main possible mechanisms. Some determinants may reflect effects of the Chinese family planning programme; some may indicate women's physiological and biological reactions to IUD. Health implications and relevant policy recommendations are discussed."
1311941,1,a,"Risk behaviors related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and transmission were studied in a sample of 167 male cocaine users admitted during a 5-month period to an inpatient drug treatment program. Data obtained included drug history and related behaviors, sexual behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes regarding HIV infection and AIDS. Approximately 20% of the sample had used IV drugs in the year prior to the interview and 94% of these reported sharing needles; 20% of the IV drug users (IVDUs) reported always using bleach to clean needles. With regard to sexual practices, 7% of the total sample reported sex with other males in the year prior to the interview; 86% of the total sample reported having sex with females and 80% of these noted they never or rarely used condoms during vaginal sex. Respondents generally did not believe they themselves were at high risk for HIV infection, yet they continued to engage in acknowledged high-risk behaviors. These findings suggest that IVDUs and non-IV cocaine users are likely to contribute to the spread of HIV in several populations."
15772506,0,a,"Distance education offers many advantages to students, faculty, and educational institutions. Despite these advantages, distance education classes historically have higher dropout rates than do the courses taught in the traditional, face-to-face setting. Current research includes information related to technology, teaching tips, and resources for these extended learning opportunities. However, information related to student success in distance education is limited and success indicators are poorly defined. Current studies on success indicators often lack a defining framework that provides an opportunity for study replication and strengthens the credibility of study findings. An empirical model developed by Powell et al divides potential determinants of success into three categories. This literature review identifies indicators in each category and indicates a need to revise the current framework to include technology as a fourth category. The revised framework should provide a basis for additional research in this rapidly growing area."
11264268,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of self-rated health to a measure of physical status, based on a professional rating of the individual's health from a strictly physical point of view. METHODS: A random selection of 407 people over the age of 20 from the north-western catchment area of greater Stockholm were invited in 1995 to a physical examination, including a self-report questionnaire with questions about self-rated health, lifestyle, psychosocial factors and quality of life. A measure of physical health on a 5-point graded scale was constructed using the information from the records of the physical examination as a base. RESULTS: Self-rated health and the professional ratings of health coincided in approximately 60% of the cases. There were a relatively large number of cases where the ratings were contradictory. The correlation between the scales was 0.45. Comparison between the two ratings with respect to association with potential determinants showed that physical factors naturally explained most of the variances in physical health, whereas social and mental well-being and somatic conditions (women) were the most important explanatory variables for self-rated health. Irrespective of whether they had ""favourable"" or ""unfavourable"" health, those with ""poor"" self-rated health also had perceived lower social and mental well-being, less appreciation, more somatic conditions (women) and worse coping abilities (men). CONCLUSIONS: With mental, psychosocial and social problems becoming more pronounced in sickness patterns for primary care patients, self-rated health could be a helpful device, especially when time resources for consultations are short. This measure could also give a more global view of the patient's situation when effectivity and rationality can be a threat to a holistic view of the patient."
16872670,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the motivational determinants of the continuation of breast-feeding until 3 months postpartum. METHODS: A prospective cohort study using the Integrated Change Model in 341 women in 5 child health care centers. RESULTS: At birth, 73% of the mothers started with breast-feeding and 39% of them continued at least 3 months postpartum. Mothers who continued for 3 months differed in almost all the motivational determinants from mothers who discontinued. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, social support for formula feeding from significant others and situational self-efficacy for breast-feeding made a significant independent contribution to the continuation of breast-feeding. Among the predisposing determinants, the strongest positive predictor of continuation was the intention to return to work at 1 month postpartum. CONCLUSION: The Integrated Change Model is valid to explain and predict the continuation of breast-feeding. Hence, the results may be used to tailor future interventions aimed at promoting breast-feeding. In the discussion, we use the results to target interventions."
16380367,0,a,"This paper reports on an exploratory study of nursing home bankruptcy. From state and industry data regarding nearly 1,000 California facilities, it was possible to identify 155 homes in five chains (multi-facility organizations) that were operating in bankruptcy in 2000. When compared with facilities in non-bankrupt chains, while the bankrupt chain facilities had significantly worse financial liquidity, higher administrative costs, and higher payables to related parties, they also had more Medicare residents, fewer Medicaid residents, better solvency, and were located in less competitive county markets and in areas with higher Medicaid reimbursement rates. These findings indicate that, rather than facility characteristics and local market factors, strategic decisions taken at the corporate (chain) level are the major determinants of nursing facility bankruptcy status."
22692441,0,a,"University students may encounter personal, family, social, and financial stresses while trying to cope with their academic challenges. Such constraints could affect their eating behavior and health status which, in turn may have negative effects on their studies. In light of little information in Malaysia on this subject, this study was undertaken on a sample of 180 students pursuing different academic programs in a Malaysian university. The study objectives were to determine the students' eating behavior including body weight control and the extent of fear of being fat, their social self concept that reflects the five selves namely, the psychological self, the social self, the sexual self, the family self and the physical self. Eating behavior and social self concept were determined based on various methods previously validated in studies on young adults in Asia and Australia. This article focuses on gender comparisons for these determinants. The results showed that psychological and emotional factors have a significant bearing on the eating behavior of university students. Uninhibited eating behavior of both the males and females showed significant and negative correlations with feelings pertaining to personal worth, the physical self, and their relationships with peers and families. Gender differences were manifested for some determinants. The females showed more restrained eating behavior than the males; the females have a significantly higher score for family relationship, which appears to be a significant factor on male students' eating behavior. Future studies on a larger sample size may help to unravel the extent to which psychological factors influence eating behavior of students, and the underlying psychosocial basis for some of the gender differences reported in this study."
18263623,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to assess the association of religious affiliation (Muslim versus Christian) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in Albania, a predominantly Muslim country in Southeast Europe. METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted in Tirana, the Albanian capital, in 2003-2006. Of non-fatal consecutive ACS patients, 467 were recruited (370 men aged 59.1 +/- 8.7 years and 97 women 63.3 +/- 7.1 years, 88% response). The coronary heart disease-free control group comprised 469 men (53.1 +/- 10.4 years) and 268 women (54.0 +/- 10.9 years) (69% response), 452 and 237 of whom were fully examined. Information collected included sociodemographic, psychosocial and behavioural characteristics by structured interview and anthropometric measurements. Furthermore, data on religious affiliation was available for all but 20 of the non-respondents. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was used to assess the association of religious affiliation (Muslim versus Christian) with ACS. RESULTS: Of ACS patients, 77.1% were Muslims compared with 65.8% of the entire control group. Muslims in both sexes were at higher risk of ACS than Christians (age- and sex-adjusted OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.4-2.3, P < 0.01). The association persisted (OR = 1.6, 95%CI = 1.1-2.3, P = 0.02) upon further adjustment for marital status, family size, education, income, employment status, social position, emigration of close relatives, financial loss and coronary risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In this transitional country, we found a higher risk of ACS in Muslims than Christians, independent of the socioeconomic circumstances and conventional coronary risk factors assessed. This finding requires replication and the determinants of the excess risk sought."
10928731,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Most adolescents experiment with alcohol, and the use of alcohol typically escalates during the teenage years. The present study examined how several risk and protective factors measured during early adolescence were associated with heavy drinking in a sample of high school seniors. METHOD: As part of a school-based survey, seventh-grade students (N = 1,132) reported degrees of experimentation with alcohol and cigarettes. Several psychosocial factors deemed to be important in the etiology of drinking were also assessed. Students were followed-up in the twelfth grade, when 16% were categorized as heavy drinkers based on drinking and drunkenness frequency and quantity typically consumed. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses revealed that heavy drinking was predicted by having had experimented with alcohol or cigarettes, having had a majority of one's friends drink and having had poor behavioral self-control in early adolescence. In addition, several effects were limited to either boys or girls. For example, positive alcohol expectancies predicted greater later heavy drinking in boys, while friends' smoking predicted later heavy drinking in girls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that early intervention programs aimed at preventing alcohol use by addressing the social and psychological determinants of alcohol use may have important preventive effects in terms of later heavy drinking."
10173402,1,a,"A population-based case control study was conducted to ascertain whether the process of primary care can be a determinant of infant mortality due to Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). Cases were 118 infants who died from ARI, individually matched with 118 infants who suffered an ARI episode and recovered. Information was gathered through interviewing mothers. Study variables were assembled into five subsets: children's characteristics; mothers' characteristics; access to medical services; process of primary care, and; sociodemographic variables. An index per subset was built to analyze the independent influence of each on ARI death risk. The index was constructed upon the weighted sum of the adjusted odds ratios (OR) within each subset. Then, the values of each index were collapsed into high/low values with the 50 percentile as a cut-off value. Next, by means of a conditional logistic regression procedure, an explanatory model of ARI mortality was obtained. The final multivariate model included the indexes that showed an independent effect: I) Process of care (OR 9.68, CI 95% 3.59-26.1): inadequate referral, attention provided by more than one physician and being attended by a private physician; II) children's characteristics (OR 7.22, CI 95% 2.35-22.2): perinatal history, lack of breast-feeding and incomplete immunization scheme; III) access to medical services (OR 5.27, CI 95% 2.02-13.7): geographic and economic barriers, lack of confidence in public health services, and; IV) mothers' characteristics (OR 4.03, CI 95% 1.18-13.8), mainly represented by untimely care seeking. We conclude that the management of the disease is a key determinant in which factors relating to the mother and the health services are strongly related. Our study reveals untimely care seeking, difficult access and inadequate disease treatment as important factors which deserve careful attention in the future. We also confirm the importance of biological determinants previously described. A main strategy to reduce infant mortality due to ARI should be to encourage training of primary care physicians, including private practitioners, focused on providing effective case management and emphasizing the education to mothers."
16690175,0,a,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) even among children. The purpose of this study is to investigate for the first time the distribution and determinants of total serum homocysteine (tHcy) levels in healthy Greek children. METHODS: tHcy, folate, B12 were measured in 524 children (275 boys and 249 girls) aged 6-15 years old from different socioeconomic status in Northern Greece. RESULTS: The geometric mean tHcy level for boys and girls was 7.8 (3.4-24.2) and 7.5 (3.9-29.0) micromol/L, respectively. Eighty one (15.4%) children had homocysteine levels above the upper reference limits (>10 micromol/L). The geometric mean serum tHcy level was significantly (P<0.001) increasing with age; 6.4 (3.4-11.2) micromol/L was found in the age group of 6-9 yr (group1), 7.2(4.1-22.1) micromol/L in the one of 10-12 yr (group 2) and 8.5 (3.9-29.0) micromol/L in the one of 13-15 yr (group 3). Serum folate levels were found to be statistically significant (P<0.001) between age group 1 and age group 3 [11.8 (4.66-20.00) vs. 7.5 (0.99-20.00)ng/mL) and between age group 2 and 3 [10.0 (1.82-20.0) vs. 7.5 (0.99-20.00)ng/mL]. Vitamin B12 levels were significantly (P<0.001) different in the three age groups [1048 (117-2000), 805 (296-2000), 700 (214-2000)pg/mL] respectively. Age, BMI, waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were positively correlated with tHcy, whereas serum folate and vitamin B12 were negatively correlated. No association was found between tHcy levels and parental education status. In multiple linear regression analysis only age (Beta: 0.248, 95%, CI: (0.159-0.361), P<0.05) and folate (Beta: 0.347, 95%, CI: [(-0.206)-(-0.118)], P<0.05) were found significantly and independently associated with tHcy. CONCLUSIONS: tHcy levels were increasing with age and boys were found to have slightly higher levels than girls. Age and folate levels were the most significantly and independently determinants associated with tHcy. Children with tHcy levels above the upper reference limits (>10 micromol/L) were found to be correlated with BMI, WC, SBP, serum folate and vitamin B12 levels. These children should be encouraged to include high folate food items in their diet and where necessary folate supplements should be recommended. In addition, more prospective studies are necessary in order to evaluate the relationship of tHcy and CVD risk factors in children of our region."
10883746,0,a,"The aim of the present survey was to compare the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of asthma in boys and girls aged 6-7 and 13-14 years in a rural and an urban area in the West Bank.

The prevalences of ever wheezing in the urban and rural areas were 16.4% and 12.0%, respectively (p < 0.05); the 12-month prevalences of wheezing were 10.5% and 5.5%, respectively (p < 0.05); the prevalences of more severe wheeze were 4.5% and 1.7%, respectively (p < 0.05); and prevalences of diagnosed asthma were 4.2% and 2.8%, respectively (p = NS). When controlling for age by stratification, the significant association between prevalence rates and place of residence persisted in the 13-14-year age group. These results also show that the prevalence of asthma among Palestinian children is moderately high in comparison with that reported from developing countries, but lower than those reported from Western countries. This survey, the first epidemiological survey on asthma in the West Bank, demonstrates a marked difference between urban and rural areas. The findings emphasize the need for further study of the environmental determinants of the disease among Palestinian children."
8546553,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The popularity and use of nontraditional therapies among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has grown enormously. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal cohort study of 56 patients aged 23 through 68 years with HIV infection followed up at the HIV clinic at a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center. OBJECTIVE: To assess the demographic and psychologic characteristics of patients who seek nontraditional remedies, and their impact on disease progression and mortality from HIV. METHODS: A standardized, self-administered questionnaire to assess the incidence and type of nontraditional therapies used by patients with HIV. Data on demographics, medical status, physical functioning (Karnofsky performance score), CD4 lymphocyte counts, depression (Beck Depression Inventory), coping (inventory of coping with illness scale), psychological and/or emotional stress (Profile of Mood States scores), and compliance with prescribed therapy were prospectively assessed on all patients at baseline and every 6 months. RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients reported using nontraditional therapies. Nontraditional therapy users were significantly older than patients who did not use such therapies (44 vs 38 years, P = .03); with 94% of patients who used nontraditional therapy being older than 35 years compared with 56% of conventional therapy users (P = .005). Alternative therapy use did not correlate with race, education, HIV-risk group affiliation, duration of HIV seropositivity, stage of HIV disease, CD4 cell count, or Karnofsky performance scores. Nontraditional therapy users reported greater community-based acquired immunodeficiency syndrome group support (P = .06), greater perceived social support (P = .08), and significantly higher recreational or ""street drugs"" use (P = .02). Depression, adaptive coping, and emotional stress were not different between nontraditional and conventional therapy users; however, nontraditional therapy users were significantly more assertive (P = .04). On follow-up, CD4 cell count, HIV disease progression, physical functioning, or mortality were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Recourse to nontraditional therapy is common among patients with HIV. Because of the possibility of untoward effects and potential adverse drug interactions associated with nontraditional therapy, HIV care givers should be aware of its use in their patients and take a history of nontraditional therapy first. Patients who choose nontraditional remedies do so not because they are depressed or emotionally disturbed, but rather because they seek greater control of the outcome of their disease. However, no beneficial effect on disease progression, CD4 cell count, or mortality was observed in these patients when compared with patients receiving only conventional medical therapy."

10186847,1,a,"For many caregivers, rendering aid to frail parents, grandparents, siblings, and spouses comes at a high price: compromised physical and mental health, disturbed relationships with spouse and children, truncated opportunities for social life, and, for caregivers who are employed, declining job performance. Using the 1982 National Long Term Care Survey's ""Survey of Informal Care-givers,"" this study investigates how the sociodemographic characteristics of caregivers, care requirements, the availability of backup caregivers, and conditions of employment affect the likelihood that caregivers will suffer work constraints. Estimations of both the probability of work constraints and hours of work reveal that proxies for work conditions figure prominently, as do care requirements. In the model of constrained work, ill health, financial burdens, and primary responsibility for care are significant determinants; the estimation of hours of work revealed that low income and competing care demands wielded major influence. Women and white caregivers are employed fewer hours, while spouses are more likely than other informal caregivers to face constrained work. Occupation, as an indicator of work conditions, is shown to be an important addition to the factors considered in investigations of circumstances that affect caregivers' experiencing work constraints."
8192118,1,a,"Proposed and tested a model of the determinants of adolescents' chronic life stressors, consisting of sociodemographic, personal, and contextual stress and coping factors, using baseline and 1-year follow-up data from 259 adolescents who varied in their psychological and physical health. Concurrent regression analyses at Time 1 and at Time 2, and longitudinal regressions that controlled for the levels of chronic stressors 1 year earlier, showed that sociodemographic, personal, and contextual factors each made a significant contribution to predicting adolescents' ongoing stressors with their mother, father, siblings friends and classmates and teachers at school. Personal factors of an emotional temperament and low perceived self-worth, and contextual factors of more negative life events and fewer social resources, were related to more chronic stressors. Suggestions for further development of the model are discussed."

Five-minute behavioral samples were observed randomly out of every hour from 8 a.m. through 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, for four 2-week phases (baseline, placebo, 50 mg, and 100 mg). During naltrexone administration, there were fewer days with frequent head-banging and self-biting, whereas there were more days on which blows to the head or self-biting were infrequent. Self-injurious participants slept 1.38 hours less per night during baseline, which was unaffected by naltrexone."
2019096,1,a,"The purpose of this paper is to develop an analytic framework and methodology for estimating the demand for psychiatric hospitalization in state facilities, either new admissions or readmissions of clients from the Community Services Boards (CSBs) of Virginia. The combination of community and organizational factors with inpatient characteristics for the CSBs can help identify pertinent predictors of psychiatric hospitalization. Review of the literature on psychiatric epidemiology shows that the predictors of psychiatric hospitalization can be classified into four major dimensions including community resources, socio-demographic factors, CSB client characteristics, and CSB organizational factors. It is postulated that the rates of first admissions and readmissions to state facilities are influenced by four dimensions. Furthermore, the variation in readmissions rates is contingent upon previous first admission rates and the average length of stays in state institutions while other conditions-such as community resources and demographics, CSB client mix, and CSB organizational factors-are simultaneously considered. The data were compiled from multiple sources. A path analytic model, using a linear structural relations program (LISREL VI), was validated. After the model was carefully fitted, the estimation equations for the rates of first admissions and readmissions were finalized. The estimates for psychiatric hospitalization, both first- and re-admissions, were made for each of the study CSBs."

10653046,1,a,"Compliance by patients to prescribed treatment regimens can be considered as the interface between effective therapy and effective disease management. Compliance can be affected by the nature of the relationship between the practitioner and the patient, and their attitudes towards each other. It has also been suggested that practitioner behaviour can influence patient behaviour and health status. However, each individual patient is influenced in his or her attitudes, and reactions to disease and its management, by a wide variety of patient-related factors. These include psychological variables such as mood, beliefs, and the knowledge, motivation and ability of the patient. Social factors may also play a role: these include age, marital and socioeconomic status and level of education. Results from a range of studies in patients with pulmonary or other diseases show that the psychosocial determinants of compliance are only poorly understood, and suggest that compliance cannot be predicted from patients' health status and that social factors are weak indicators only. Furthermore, it appears from available data that patients' beliefs about health issues are not as useful as indicators of likely compliance as was previously believed."

9618614,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Marijuana use among high school seniors increased during most of the 1970s, decreased throughout the 1980s, and has been increasing again during the 1990s. Earlier analyses of the classes of 1976 through 1986 attributed the historic trends during that period to specific changes in views about marijuana. This study examined whether recent increases in marijuana use among seniors and among students in earlier grades reflect similar processes. METHODS: Multivariate regression analyses were conducted on data from large annual nationwide surveys of high school seniors from 1976 through 1996 (approximate n = 61,000) and 8th and 10th graders from 1991 through 1996 (n's = 87,911 and 82,475, respectively). RESULTS: Individual lifestyle factors (grades, truancy, religious commitment, evenings out for recreation) correlated substantially with marijuana use but did not explain the historic changes in marijuana use. Rather, decreases in perceived risk of harmfulness and in disapproval can account for the recent increases in all 3 grades and for earlier decreases among seniors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that perceived risks and disapproval are important determinants of marijuana use. Accordingly, prevention efforts should include realistic information about risks and consequences of marijuana use."
9612838,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated that physical activity serves an important preventive function against the development of cardiovascular disease. The recognition that U.S. children are often sedentary, coupled with the observation that physical activity habits tend to persist into adulthood, has prompted the investigation of exercise determinants consistent with social learning theory. The purposes of the present study were to identify social learning variables relevant to children's exercise and to explore the longitudinal predictive value of the determinants. METHODS: Data were collected from 111 families (N = 54 girls, N = 57 boys) who were interviewed in both Phase 1 (fifth and sixth grades) and Phase 2 (eight and ninth grades) of this study. Data from mothers (N = 111) were collected during both phases; data from 80 fathers were collected at Phase 2 only. RESULTS: The results of simultaneous stepwise regression analyses indicated that child's enjoyment of physical activity was the only consistent predictor of physical activity during Phase 1. At Phase 2, child's exercise knowledge, mother's physical activity, and child's and mother's friend modeling/support emerged as predictors for girls. For boys, child's self-efficacy for physical activity, exercise knowledge, parental modeling, and interest in sports media were important. Longitudinally, mother's self-efficacy, barriers to exercise, enjoyment of physical activity, and child's self-efficacy for physical activity were important for girls. Only child's exercise knowledge predicted boys' physical activity. The addition of information from fathers nearly doubled the explanatory power of the predictors for both genders. CONCLUSIONS: Socialization in the family unit exerts a tremendous influence on health-related behaviors such as exercise. The relative importance of determinants seems to differ for girls and boys and the pattern of these determinants appears to change over time."

The costs of hip fracture are comprised of direct costs from health care and the social welfare system. Data were collected for 1,080 postmenopausal women admitted from private residence for primary hip fracture surgery during the year of 1992 in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. It was found that the cost of hip fracture is significantly related to age, mortality the year after a fracture, type of fracture, costs 1 year before a fracture, and hospital admission. The savings in direct costs for an average woman surviving the year after a fracture amount to SEK 210,000."
1901487,1,a,"A field trial was conducted to compare the effects of eight health education and economic incentive interventions on the awareness and acceptance of cataract surgery. Cataract screening and follow-up surgery were offered to more than 19,000 residents age 40 years and older in a probability sample of 90 villages in south India. Eight months after intervention, an evaluation was conducted to identify those in need of surgery who had been operated on. Two principal measures of program effectiveness are examined: awareness of cataract surgery and acceptance of the surgery. The type of intervention had a negligible effect on awareness of cataract surgery. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals who were aware of surgery tended to be male, literate, and more affluent than those who were unaware of that option. Interventions that covered the complete costs of surgery had higher surgery acceptance rates. One health education strategy, house-to-house visits by a subject with aphakia, increased acceptance of the procedure more than others. In a multiple logistic regression analysis of acceptance rates, persons accepting surgery tended to be male; other factors were not important in explaining variation in acceptance rates."
7479620,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Whereas self-efficacy expectations have been identified as important determinants of exercise participation patterns, little empirical work that examines efficacy expectations as outcomes of exercise participation or their theoretical relationship to other psychological outcomes associated with exercise has been conducted. In the context of middle-aged males and females, the present study attempted to integrate social cognitive and impression management perspectives with respect to anxiety associated with exercise. METHODS: Formerly sedentary subjects participated in a 5-month exercise program with assessments of physique anxiety, efficacy, outcome expectations, and anthropometric variables prior to and following the program. RESULTS: Both acute bouts and long-term participation in exercise resulted in significant increases in self-efficacy. In turn, these changes in efficacy and initial positive outcome expectations were significant predictors of reductions in physique anxiety, even when controlling for the influence of gender and reductions in body fat, weight, and circumferences. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are discussed in terms of the implications for structure and content of exercise environments and the utility of the proposed theoretical integration. Strategies for enhancing beliefs regarding health and fitness outcomes associated with exercise rather than appearance outcomes may be required to maximize reductions in negative body image."

9890367,1,a,"PURPOSE: To identify the psychosocial and behavioral factors that influence condom use to reduce the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among young men in Ghana. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design in which data on a community-based sample of 601 young men, 15-24 years of age, were collected by a household survey instrument. For a conceptual framework, the study used constructs from the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Social Learning Theory (SLT) in the Ghanaian context. RESULTS: While 65% of the sexually active male respondents had used condoms at least once, only 25% had used condoms at last intercourse. Findings from multiple logistic regression analysis indicate that perceived susceptibility to HIV infection, perceived self-efficacy to use condoms, perceived barriers to condom use, and perceived social support were significant predictors of condom use. The most important finding, however, is that perceived barriers significantly interacted with perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy. Subjects who perceived a high level of susceptibility to HIV infection and a low level of barriers to condom use were almost six times as likely to have used condoms at last intercourse, compared to others. Similarly, young men who perceived a high level of self-efficacy to use condoms and a low level of barriers to condom use were nearly three times more likely to have used condoms at last intercourse when compared to others. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that HIV prevention programs for youth should emphasize personal vulnerability to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, instill in youth the self-belief that they can use condoms any time, and address how to overcome barriers to condom use."
12965967,0,a,"Improving end-of-life experience is a major challenge to successful aging. Deaths that are reasonably free of discomfort, in accordance with patients' wishes, and within acceptable professional and ethical standards are high-quality deaths. The authors developed a 31-item measure of the quality of dying and death and applied it in a community sample and a sample of hospice enrollees. Scores on the Quality of Dying and Death Instrument and measures of perceived quality of care were collected from patients' loved ones after death. Higher overall after-death ratings of the quality of care received from all providers and from physicians were associated with higher-quality dying and death. How well patients' symptoms were controlled in the community study and how well wishes were followed and treatments were explained in the hospice study were associated with higher-quality dying. Major challenges to end-of-life research include recruiting representative population samples, given widespread reluctance of patients and loved ones to participate in research at the end of life; important variation in evaluations among different reporters after death; reluctance of loved ones to assign negative evaluations to dying experiences after death; and the highly individual and dynamic nature of dying experiences. Overcoming these challenges is of great importance in the search for the social, organizational, and individual determinants of high-quality dying in the U.S. cultural and health care context."
9465373,1,a,"This study researched the effects of cognitive variables on recycling behavior, as well as effects of various media of influence on the cognition and behavior. According to Hirose (1994), the decision making process for recycling consists of two steps. The first leads to goal intention of an ecological lifestyle. The second is related to behavior intention of recycling in line with the goal intention. Mass media, such as newspaper and TV, are thought to influence beliefs about environmental problems, including three determinants of goal intention: perception of seriousness, responsibility, and effectiveness. Personal media, such as personal contacts with pro-environmental activists, are thought to influence evaluation of behavior, including three determinants of behavior intention: evaluation of feasibility, cost and benefits, and social norms. Local media, such as municipal announcement and circular, are hypothesized to have a mixed effect of the two. Path analysis indicated that goal intention affected recycling behavior through behavior intention. Effects of the three media of influence on the cognitive variables were also consistent with the hypothesis."
8115345,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The recognition that children are surprisingly inactive and that lifetime health beliefs and behavior patterns are formed in childhood has emphasized the need to examine the acquisition of exercise behavior in children. Although research has shown social learning theory variables to be relevant to the study of exercise determinants in an adult population, there has been little study done with child populations. The purpose of the present study was to explore the factors that may influence a child's level of physical activity. METHODS: Two hundred forty-two 5th- and 6th-grade children and their mothers were interviewed. It was hypothesized that several social learning variables would exert a particularly strong influence on level of physical activity of children. RESULTS: Regression analysis results indicated that salient predictor variables for boys included enjoyment of physical activity, friend and family support for physical activity, mother's perceived barriers to exercise, and mother's perceived family support for exercise. For girls, the salient predictor variables included enjoyment of physical activity, number of exercise-related items at home, mother's perceived family support for physical activity, mother's perceived barriers to exercise, and direct parental modeling of physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that social learning variables may be important correlates of physical activity in children."
8351534,1,a,"Detailed nationally representative population level data were used to investigate the pre-natal care and delivery experiences of pregnant women in Jamaica. The results of this study show that: (a) demographic criteria (particularly first births) and self-reported clinical pregnancy complications are valid predictors of deleterious maternal health outcomes and can be used to stratify mothers into risk groups. (b) There appears to be a significant problem of under and inappropriate utilization of pre-natal care services by all women and in particular by demographically 'high risk' women, i.e. young, first time mothers. Significant proportions of the latter group report either no pre-natal care visits at all or visits which are later than the first trimester. The problems of delayed initiation of pre-natal care are specially exacerbated for poor, teenage mothers who happen to be living in the Kingston Metropolitan Area. (c) In terms of the content and quality of pre-natal care services the message is somewhat mixed. On the positive side the pre-natal care system is doing a moderately satisfactory job with regard to diagnostic tests and educational advice. On the negative side however, the fact that once women enter the health care system they all receive the same moderately adequate care (in terms of diagnostic evaluations and educational advice) with no attempt to focus particular attention on high risk mothers is troublesome. (d) With regard to appropriate delivery venues for pregnant women, pre-natal care visits do not appear to significantly influence the choice of delivery venues. Moreover, rich urban women are much more likely to deliver in a hospital than their rural peers. In conclusion, the study discusses the social and behavioral context of these results, addresses the policy implications and makes some recommendations to improve maternal health services."
16424130,0,a,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of biological and social background on height of adolescent girls at age 19 y in the city of Pelotas, Southern Brazil. In 2001, a sample of the urban census tracts was visited and adolescent girls who were part of the Pelotas 1982 Birth Cohort Study were located. Standardized questionnaires were administered to the adolescents and their mothers. Height was measured using locally manufactured stadiometers; standardized protocols were employed. The information obtained in 2001 was combined with data collected in earlier phases of the study. The follow-up rate was 69% and 473 girls were studied in 2001. Multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the determinants of height. The height of the 19-y-old adolescents was 161.2+/-6.3 cm. The significant determinants of height were family income, maternal pre-gestational weight, maternal height, smoking during pregnancy, birth weight, height gain, and age at menarche. Birth weight was a more important predictor than weight gain during infancy or height gain between the ages of 2 and 4 y. Each 100 g in birth weight was associated with an increase of approximately 0.2 cm in the adolescent's height (P=0.001). The current findings reinforce the importance of early life factors in the determination of adult height."
2262395,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to examine those factors associated with the contraceptive behavior of a national representative sample of Hispanic female adolescents. The subjects included all (n = 85) unmarried, sexually active Hispanic women, aged 15 to 19, from the 1982 National Survey of Family Growth. Contraceptive behavior was measured on a normalized scale, ranging from oral contraceptives to no contraception. Mexican/American and Central/South American background females were more likely (p less than 0.031) to use effective birth control than Puerto Rican, Cuban, and other Hispanic background subjects. Twenty additional social, behavioral, and demographic variables were found to be significantly associated (p less than 0.05) with contraceptive behavior. Based on multiple regression analysis, seven of these variables were found to explain 62% (p less than 0.0001) of the variation in the contraceptive behavior of this sample. Poorer contraceptive behavior was associated with noncompliance with the initial birth control method used (33.8%), lower coital frequency (8.3%), older postmenarchial age (5.7%), failure to use birth control at first coitus (4.6%), fewer years dating (4.0%), lower frequency of church attendance (3.3%), and never having experienced a pregnancy scare (2.0%). These findings suggest that the contraceptive behavior of Hispanic female adolescents is a dynamic process that can be understood in the context of previous sexual and contraceptive behavior."
9039380,1,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To analyse the factors that determined whether or not people were successful in quitting tobacco during the 1980s in Sweden. DESIGN: A logistic regression model was used for the analyses and included: education, marital status, socioeconomic group, social network, physical activities, cigarette consumption, and years spent smoking as independent variables. Men and women were analysed separately for smoking. A specific univariate analysis was also performed for men who used snuff. SETTING: Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: A panel of 5104 randomised people aged 16-84 years was interviewed in 1980-81 and followed up in 1988-89 in the survey of living conditions undertaken by Statistics Sweden. The participation rate was 86%. The panel included 1546 men and women who were daily smokers. There were 418 daily users of snuff among the men, and 129 men both smoked and used snuff. MAIN RESULTS: Together 26% of women and 23% of men had quit smoking. Five percent in both groups were new smokers. Among men, 26% had quit using snuff and 5% had begun smoking. New snuff users among men were 5%. In the multivariate analysis, unmarried men kept smoking at significantly higher rates (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2,3.6), as did those men who smoked 11-20 cigarettes/day (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.5, 3.4), or more than 20 cigarettes/day (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.4,5.7). Among women, smoking 11-20 cigarettes/day was also a significant factor (OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.1,5.0). Men and women aged 25-44 were significantly more likely to continue smoking (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.1,3.7, and 2.2; 95% CI 1.2,4.4) as were those who had smoked for 20 years or more (OR 4.7; 95% CI 2.0,10.8 and OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.1,5.5, respectively). For women, low education (up to grade 9) was also a significant factor (OR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.2,5.1). Among men who had quit using snuff we did not find any values of significance. CONCLUSIONS: One in four smokers had quit during the 1980s and a few started smoking (5%). Some men quit smoking and started using snuff instead. For both sexes, the daily consumption of cigarettes, years spent smoking, and age were the most important determinants of successful quitting. In men, being married/ cohabiting was an important factor as was higher education in women."
2384283,1,a,"This article uses the current controversies in the British debate about health to illustrate the need to theorize, and therefore critically evaluate, the links between medicine and health policies, including health care policies. The medical model of health is deeply embedded in institutional practices in many countries, and while this model has attracted deserved criticism in recent years, an alternative social model, or one that incorporates indispensable aspects of the medical model, has attracted much less attention and requires sustained development. Comparative study of patterns of inequality in health, and especially of the correlation between material deprivation and premature mortality, necessarily reveals causal determinants of both health and ill-health in populations and invites ambitious programs to develop a social model."
9049796,1,a,"This case-control study (n = 100 dental patients, matched for age and sex) investigated the role of life-events in periodontitis. Data collected included life events, tobacco use, oral health behaviours and socio-demographics. The results of conditional simple logistic regression analysis showed that periodontitis was associated with the negative impact of life-events (p < 0.01), the number of negative life-events (p < 0.05), high levels of dental plaque (p < 0.01), tobacco smoking (p < 0.01) and being unemployed (p < 0.05). These associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for oral health behaviour and socio-demographic variables, but not tobacco smoking (p > 0.05). Marital status became statistically significant after adjusting for the other variables (p < 0.05). A model is suggested to explain the pathways through which life events may affect periodontal health. It was concluded that psychosocial factors and oral health risk behaviours cluster together as important determinants of periodontitis."
9577303,1,a,"In pregnancy, the additional demands for Fe are thought to be met principally through increased maternal dietary Fe absorption and by mobilization of maternal Fe stores. In a general population sample of 576 women we examined the maternal and dietary characteristics which influenced Fe stores (assessed by serum ferritin concentration) in early pregnancy. The effects of these characteristics on two measures of functional Fe status (mean cell volume and haemoglobin concentration) were also considered. Serum ferritin concentrations were lower in multiparous women (P < 0.0001) and in those with a lower BMI (P = 0.01), and rose with increasing alcohol intake (P < 0.0001). Ferritin concentrations fell with increasing Ca intake (P < 0.0001); the proportion of women with serum ferritin values < or = 12 micrograms/l rose from 14% of the women in the lowest quarter of Ca intake to 29% of the women in the highest quarter. Mean cell volume and haemoglobin concentration were not related to Ca intake in early pregnancy. Although Ca added to test-meals reduces Fe absorption, long-term Ca supplementation has not been shown to lower plasma ferritin concentration, suggesting that high habitual Ca intakes would be unlikely to influence Fe status in non-pregnant individuals. Our findings show that in early pregnancy there is an association between high dietary Ca intake and lower Fe stores. This effect of Ca on one aspect of Fe status may result from its influence on Fe bioavailability."
22029554,0,a,"Because of increased concerns about terrorism around the globe, international organizations are very interested in understanding how safety and cultural issues impact their employees' willingness to relocate abroad. This has been especially true for international companies based in the United States, given the recent salience of US activities around the world. Additionally, questions remain regarding the efficacy of financial incentives to motivate individuals' willingness to relocate when the destination may be dangerous. Therefore, the factors impacting willingness to relocate from the US to another country were examined experimentally in this study. Based upon theory and research in social and organizational psychology, it was hypothesized that cultural similarity, destination safety, and financial incentives would have direct effects on individuals' willingness to accept relocation offers. It was also predicted that cultural similarity and destination safety would moderate the effects of incentives upon willingness to relocate. The study used a 2 x 2 x 3 between-subjects design manipulating destination similarity (similar, different), destination safety (safe, dangerous), and bonus for relocating (0% bonus, 20% bonus, 40% bonus). Results from 196 participants at a university in the northeastern part of the US revealed that financial incentives and safety perceptions directly impacted willingness to relocate. In line with moderator predictions, financial incentives had a stronger effect on willingness to relocate when the destination was culturally different from the United States than when it was similar. Against expectations, there was no interaction between financial incentives and safety. Destination safety perceptions were relatively strong determinants of willingness to relocate."
19412483,0,a,"A series of 44 consecutive elderly, admitted to a busy general hospital following deliberate self-poisoning, is reviewed for associated medical and psychosocial factors. In all but 3 cases the act involved an overdose of drugs prescribed for the treatment of a chronic medical and/or psychiatric disorder. Women outnumbered men by 2.7 to 1. There was high proportion of chronic psychiatric (80%, mostly depressive) and medical (60%) conditions. Chronic stress from the physical illness, social isolation, or tacit family conflict were common and seemed instrumental in the self-poisoning act. Most attempts were carried out around the weekend and during winter. One man succumbed to complications of the overdose but the rest of the patients recovered. Psychosocial (especially depressive) and medical vulnerability, plus availability of prescribed drugs, were the most important determinants of suicidal behavior among these elderly attempters."

How the dissemination of fluoridated salt--a biological component of oral health promotion--interacts with both the determinants of health and the non-biological components of oral health promotion is discussed with respect to individual health behaviour, socio-economic health disparities, the physical and social environment, and the health education curriculum."
10130406,1,a,"Hospitals face a paradigm shift: from planning service delivery to population-based community health planning. Comprehensive community health planning is a two-step process: assessment and action, in that order. Assessment identifies community problems and resources; action follows planning, which determines which of those problems should be addressed with which resources. This paper provides an overview of the community assessment process. The first challenge in launching a community health initiative is to identify and recruit partners drawn from the ranks of prominent community organizations, such as school boards, public health agencies, and elected officials. The best enlistment strategies are those that empower persons outside the hospital to take visible control. Defining the community is the first step in analyzing the community. It is important that everyone involved in the assessment process agree on the definition, which should take in those characteristics that make the community unique, including its social systems, environmental factors, and demographics. The next step in the process is developing a community health profile, a set of key community indicators or measures that will help you set priorities, document successes and failures, and monitor trends. There are a number of models available to consult in developing indicators, whether traditional, medically oriented determinants of health or broader parameters, such as housing and public safety. Criteria for selecting indicators include validity, stability and reliability, and responsiveness. Most indicators will be developed using secondary, or already existing, sources of data, such as census data, Medicare and Medicaid files, police records, and hospital admission and exit records. Conducting the community assessment involves putting together a list of problems to be solved and a list of available resources, both of which can be compiled using the same four-step process of gathering and analyzing data: obtaining community input, identifying problems already being addressed, consulting with professional experts, and analyzing existing data. Demographics are one way of analyzing data; another is using a ""community scoreboard"" that groups causal factors into four categories: lifestyle, environment, human biology, and health services. Once the community assessment is complete, planning and implementation of programs can begin. At the same time, it is essential to mobilize the community to support your initiative. Again, you must look beyond the hospital walls to build a constituency for change, to community leaders in education, employment, transportation and recreation, housing, and the physical environment, as well as health education and preventive services.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
16053643,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence that demographic determinants, socioeconomic determinants, chronic diseases, and functional capacity have on self-rated health among elderly persons (60 years and older) living in the city of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and to investigate the existence of differences between men and women in terms of their self-rated health. METHODS: The study was carried out using data collected in the city of Sao Paulo as part of a project called Health, Well-being, and Aging in Latin America and the Caribbean (the ""SABE project""). We analyzed data on 2,135 elderly individuals (58.6% women; mean age, 69.4 years; median age, 68.0 years). The dependent variable was self-rated health (good or poor). The following independent variables were considered: (1) demographic ones (age, sex, marital status, and living arrangements (whether the elderly person lived alone or with others)), (2) socioeconomic ones (schooling and income), (3) the number of chronic diseases (hypertension, arthritis or rheumatism, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, bronchitis or emphysema, embolism or stroke, and cancer), and (4) functional capacity. To estimate the association between self-rated health and the independent variables and to study gender differences, a multiple binary logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The presence of chronic diseases in association with gender was the strongest determinant of self-rated health among the elderly in Sao Paulo. Among men with four or more chronic diseases, they were 10.53 times as likely to characterize their health as poor; among women with four or more chronic diseases, the ratio was 8.31. Functional capacity, schooling, and income were also strongly associated with self-rated health, and the influence of age was significant. The elderly women were more likely to report good self-rated health than were men when the women or men either had no chronic diseases or had two or more. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the need for simultaneous, comprehensive actions in the health sector, social services, and the economic sector to address the main determinants of self-rated health in order to promote well-being and quality of life among the elderly."

1759089,1,a,"The role of single night studies and the determinants of effective nasal continuous positive airway (CPAP) pressures were determined in 412 consecutive patients between 1984 and 1989. Patients chosen for analysis had an apnea index (AI) of greater than or equal to 20 hr-1 prior to CPAP. The AI was 67 +/- 30 hr-1, the body mass index (BMI) was 36 +/- 9 kg/m2, the age was 51 +/- 13 yr and the lowest oxygen saturation was 72 +/- 14%. Effective CPAP (9 +/- 3 cm H2O) was documented in 320 patients on single night studies and resulted in a 99% reduction in the frequency of obstructive events and improvement in the lowest O2 saturation to 94 +/- 5%. Only 18% of the variability in effective CPAP could be explained by AI and BMI. Single night studies are sufficient to establish effective CPAP in 78% of patients and offer considerable conservation of resources compared to routine multiple night studies. Effective CPAP pressures are variable and must be determined by incremental CPAP trials."
17176233,0,a,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: If they are to respond effectively to health inequities, organisations involved in health promotion need to refocus on the social determinants of health (SDH) and the distribution of resources for health. METHODS: This paper examines the potential of health promotion foundations (HPFs), a semi-autonomous arm of the state, to act at several policy and program intervention points to address the SDH and reduce health inequities. CONCLUSION: The public purpose, enterprise and innovation potential of health promotion foundations provides them with unique capacity to respond to SDH. In the complex and contested policy environment surrounding action on the determinants of health, the role that foundations can most usefully play is that of a change agent in a broader social movement seeking health equity."
9842499,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to assess the role of needs and social factors in the use of health services among children under age 15 in Catalonia, Spain, where health care reform was explicitly designed to facilitate universal access to primary care according to health needs. Data from the Catalan Health Interview Survey of 1994, a multistage probability sample (2,433 children under 15 years old), were analyzed. Multiple regression examined the relationship between health needs and number of visits in the last year, controlling for the effect of sociodemographic characteristics. Two logistic regression equations were selected to predict heavy (more than seven visits per year) and light (less than two visits) utilization of services. The multiple regression model explained 14.3 percent of the variance in number of visits, with health status perception, disability, reported chronic condition, restriction of activities, and having had a recent accident by far the most important determinants. No familial socioeconomic characteristics, including social class, education, or family size, influenced the extent of use. In contrast to health systems not designed to achieve either universal access according to need or strong primary care, universal access to health services in Catalonia appears to enhance the use of services among children with health needs, regardless of socioeconomic characteristics."

1951797,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Despite public health efforts, the prevalence of smoking among African Americans remains high. The determinants of smoking behavior in this population must be elucidated so that interventions can be better targeted and more effective. METHODS: As part of a prospective community intervention trial to reduce cancer mortality, we conducted a random household survey of 1137 African-American adults in San Francisco and Oakland between November 1985 and July 1986. The survey instrument included questions about social network characteristics, instrumental and emotional aspects of social support, smoking behavior, and stressors. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of smoking (41.9%) was higher than that reported in national surveys. Logistic models revealed that persons reporting high levels of stress, represented by an abbreviated hassles index, were more likely to smoke than those reporting less stress. Women with poor social networks were more likely to smoke (odds ratio = 3.1) than women with optimal networks; however, this relationship did not hold among men. Indeed, men lacking emotional support from friends or family were less likely to smoke (odds ratio = 0.5) than men receiving such support. No interaction between social support and hassles was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Stressful environments may contribute to high-risk smoking behavior among urban African Americans."
17469399,0,a,"Benchmarking of the performance of states, provinces, or districts in a decentralised health system is important for fostering of accountability, monitoring of progress, identification of determinants of success and failure, and creation of a culture of evidence. The Mexican Ministry of Health has, since 2001, used a benchmarking approach based on the World Health Organization (WHO) concept of effective coverage of an intervention, which is defined as the proportion of potential health gain that could be delivered by the health system to that which is actually delivered. Using data collection systems, including state representative examination surveys, vital registration, and hospital discharge registries, we have monitored the delivery of 14 interventions for 2005-06. Overall effective coverage ranges from 54.0% in Chiapas, a poor state, to 65.1% in the Federal District. Effective coverage for maternal and child health interventions is substantially higher than that for interventions that target other health problems. Effective coverage for the lowest wealth quintile is 52% compared with 61% for the highest quintile. Effective coverage is closely related to public-health spending per head across states; this relation is stronger for interventions that are not related to maternal and child health than those for maternal and child health. Considerable variation also exists in effective coverage at similar amounts of spending. We discuss the implications of these issues for the further development of the Mexican health-information system. Benchmarking of performance by measuring effective coverage encourages decision-makers to focus on quality service provision, not only service availability. The effective coverage calculation is an important device for health-system stewardship. In adopting this approach, other countries should select interventions to be measured on the basis of the criteria of affordability, effect on population health, effect on health inequalities, and capacity to measure the effects of the intervention. The national institutions undertaking this benchmarking must have the mandate, skills, resources, and independence to succeed."
8964453,1,a,"Course of Grief Response, influencing Factors, Satisfaction with treatment, Need for Psychotherapeutic Support: The emotional response to a late miscarriage or a stillbirth was examined retrospectively in a systematic study involving 51 patients. The women had lost a child either by stillbirth (beyond the 20th week of gestation) or shortly after delivery. We assessed the long-term course of possible determinants of grief, a complicated grief response, as well as the patients' satisfaction with the treatment and their need for further psychotherapeutic support. The mourning response was complicated by a depressive reaction in 22%. Major risk factors were individual disposition, lack of partner and professional support. The findings reveal that the course of the grief response is positively influenced by: 1. open discussion (thematisation) with the skilled personnel and the patients' families, 2. direct or indirect contact with the deceased child (concretisation) and 3. the patients concerned being extensively informed as to place and circumstances of the funeral (whereabouts of the child)."
15271082,0,a,"Behavioural interactions are often analysed in terms of their costs and benefits to the actors [Hamilton, (1964) J. Theor. Biol.7 1-16; Gadagkar, (1993) Trends Ecol.

Using the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, we wish to distinguish between two possible determinants of interaction behaviour between conspecifics, namely kin-directed behaviour that reflects genetic distance between individuals, or, alternatively, interactions guided by a functional distance between individuals, specifically, with respect to disease susceptibility. We find no relationship between contact rate of individuals and the genetic distance of their respective colonies. Interestingly, we do find a significant negative correlation between contact rate and the distance between the two colonies in susceptibility to a spectrum of parasite strains. This cannot be explained by either of the a priori alternatives so we propose two further testable hypotheses to explain our results."
7639921,1,a,"This paper explores the frequency of occurrence of highway accidents on the basis of a multivariate analysis of roadway geometrics (e.g. horizontal and vertical alignments), weather, and other seasonal effects. Based on accident data collected in the field, a negative binomial model of overall accident frequencies is estimated along with models of the frequency of specific accident types. Interactions between weather and geometric variables are proposed as part of the model specifications. The results of the analysis uncover important determinants of accident frequency. By studying the relationship between weather and geometric elements, this paper offers insight into potential measures to counter the adverse effects of weather on highway sections with challenging geometrics."
12783770,0,a,"CONTEXT: Gender discrimination and son preference are key demographic features of South Asia and are well documented for India. However, gender bias and sex preference in Nepal have received little attention. METHODS: 1996 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey data on ever-married women aged 15-49 who did not desire any more children were used to investigate levels of gender bias and sex preference. The level of contraceptive use and the total fertility rate in the absence of sex preference were estimated, and logistic regression was performed to analyze the association between socioeconomic and demographic variables and stopping childbearing after the birth of a son. RESULTS: Commonly used indicators of gender bias, such as sex ratio at birth and sex-specific immunization rates, do not suggest a high level of gender discrimination in Nepal. However, sex preference decreases contraceptive use by 24% and increases the total fertility rate by more than 6%. Women's contraceptive use, exposure to the media, parity, last birth interval, educational level and religion are linked to stopping childbearing after the birth of a boy, as is the ethnic makeup of the local area. CONCLUSIONS: The level of sex preference in Nepal is substantial. Sex preference is an important barrier to the increase of contraceptive use and decline of fertility in the country; its impact will be greater as desired family size declines."
16846943,0,a,"Married women in India are increasingly at risk of HIV, often due to their husbands' extramarital sexual behaviour. Topical microbicides may provide protection to women who are unable to negotiate condom use. During the formative phase of a study to develop measures related to microbicide acceptability, we conducted in-depth interviews with 14 'high-risk' and 16 'low-risk' married women and 15 husbands. Some participants had recently completed a 2-week microbicide safety trial. A sequence of in-depth interviews with each participant explored the context of microbicide acceptability, including perceptions of couple harmony, vulnerability to HIV, sexual power, and ability to control life events. Women's perceptions of control and sexual power influenced attitudes towards microbicide use. HIV risk was most commonly associated with partner infidelity and easily detected, according to both men and women, by a lack of marital harmony. Despite this, high-risk women denied perceiving HIV risk until confronted with specific evidence of a husband's positive HIV or STI diagnosis. This study provides an in-depth examination of HIV risk for Indian married women, identifying potential determinants of microbicide use, and providing guidance for the development of psychometric scales to measure couple harmony, HIV risk perception, and sexual power and control."
1347337,1,a,"The causal agent of Kaposi's sarcoma is unknown. That the disorder is ten times more common in homosexual or bisexual men with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) than in other human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission groups suggests that a certain aspect of their behaviour exposes them to the agent or facilitates its spread. We therefore assessed social and demographic characteristics, including sexual behaviour, of 65 homosexual or bisexual men with AIDS from London. Sexual practices in which there was contact with partner's faeces before AIDS developed were the main determinants of Kaposi's sarcoma risk. Risk increased with frequency of insertive ""rimming"" (oral-anal contact): Kaposi's sarcoma developed in 18% of the men with AIDS who reported never having practised insertive rimming compared with 50% who practised it less than once a month, 73% between once a week and once a month, and 75% or more once a week (two-sided exact p-value for trend less than 0.001). 45 men had been interviewed about their sexual practices before AIDS developed, and 20 were interviewed at the time the syndrome developed. The findings were similar and statistically significant when each group was analysed separately. The men with Kaposi's sarcoma also tended to be more sexually active and were more likely to engage in other sexual activities that entailed contact with faeces than were the men who had other features of AIDS only. Other behaviours and exposures, including the use of ""poppers"" (nitrite inhalants), were not related to Kaposi's sarcoma risk, after taking into account whether the subjects had practised insertive rimming. The data suggest that faecal-oral contact is the main route of transmission of the agent of Kaposi's sarcoma in homosexual or bisexual men with AIDS."
21431819,0,a,"This paper introduces a series of research projects designed to fulfill the societal role of environmental health studies by investigating (1) the dynamic and complex relationships between environmental conditions and (2) health in an urban setting. Research in this first category has revealed the existence of the combined influence of multiple physical environmental factors on health and its mechanisms. In the second category, there have been a number of studies of the integrated influence of social environmental factors on health employing an aggregate modeling of multiple determinants of health and studies of individual topics related to social determinants of health. These research projects have contributed to the formulation of specific remedies and the development of comprehensive health policies. Participatory approaches have been used to enhance capacity building opportunities and to ensure that research results reflect the actual conditions in urban societies. Healthy Cities projects and programs have been developed in close collaboration with this type of research. Urban societies have become interdependent and share the same issues globally. Further research into the relationships between health and the environment in the context of urbanization will expand the base of evidence applicable to the complex realities in modern societies."

A conventional cross-sectional model of full or part-time employment makes use of some longitudinal material not normally included in such models. Whether the woman made the hitherto customary break from employment at the time of the first maternity is included in recognition that this cohort was among the first generation to be offered Statutory Maternity Leave. Results suggest that the presence of children (still) inhibits full-time employment and raises the probability of part-time employment; that income effects on participation have continued to weaken while wage elasticity for full-time employment is high. Continuity of employment straight after childbearing raises the chances of subsequent full-time employment, but by no means guarantees it. Gains from maternity leave and other family friendly employment policies have been far from uniform."""

18320099,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The social environment is an important determinant of population and individual health. However, its impact is often not considered in national health policies and generally its attributes are considered as constants. For this reason, contemporary health policies place greater emphasis on individual risk factors. OBJECTIVE: Colombias position in the world ranking is described with respect to several social macro-determinants of health, previously characterized as components of class/welfare regime model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The exploratory study included all countries with comparable data including the following: (1) economic development [gross domestic product per capita adjusted for purchasing power parity], (2) income inequality [Gini coefficient], (3) social capital corruption perceptions index and generalized trust, and (4) political regime index of freedom. First, correlations between these macro-determinants were estimated, and second, the relationship between them and life expectancy at birth was explored. Finally, the position of Colombia in global context was determined. RESULTS: Important correlations occurred among the macro-determinants. Colombia tended to have intermediate to low positions in the global context in all macro-determinants, with the exception of gross domestic product per capita adjusted for purchasing power parity. CONCLUSION: The macro-determinant of population health with the highest potential of effecting improvement in health conditions is to modify income inequality."
10990337,0,a,"This cross-sectional study analyses determinants of condom-use behaviour among patients attending dedicated STD clinics in South Africa. A structured interviewer-administered survey was conducted among 1473 patients. Patients' beliefs and attitudes towards condom use in general, as well as their personal condom-use behaviour were measured. Their perceptions, regarding the social influence of their partners and friends on their condom use, and of their self-efficacy in using condoms, while infected with an STD were also measured. Condom use, as a dependent variable, was examined and patients were placed in a pre-contemplation stage if they had never used a condom, contemplation if they had seriously thought of using a condom, some action stage if they sometimes used a condom and regular action stage if they used a condom every time. The relationships between the stages of change, as dependent variables, and the independent variables were investigated for both those patients with steady partners and those with outside partners. This was performed by stepwise multiple regression analyses. The variables that significantly explained stages of change were similar for patients with steady partners and those with outside partners. In both partner groups communication was the variable most strongly associated with the use of condoms. General self-efficacy in condom use, self-efficacy in condom use with a partner and attitudes towards the use of condoms played a role in determining patients' different stages of change."
2273357,1,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the effects of social factors (education, income, marital status, partners' employment status, housing tenure, social class), smoking, and maternal height on the dietary intake of pregnant women. DESIGN: The study was a prospective investigation on a two phase sample. SETTING: The study involved women attending the antenatal clinic at a district general hospital. PATIENTS: A group of pregnant Caucasian women, selected because they were heavy smokers (15+ cigarettes/day) (n = 94) and a randomly selected sample of never smokers (n = 112) were studied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data on social factors were collected by interviewer administered questionnaire. A 7 day weighed intake method was used to determine dietary intake at 28 weeks gestation. In univariate analyses, income, housing tenure and social class had significant effects on intakes of both macro- and micronutrients, and maternal education and smoking had significant effects on intakes of micronutrients. Using a stepwise multivariate analysis with income, smoking and maternal education, income was a significant factor in the intake of most nutrients but this effect disappeared when social class and housing tenure factors were entered into the model. Only social class and housing tenure had any significant effect on intakes of macronutrients--energy, protein and fat. Smoking and maternal education were the most important determinants of quality of diet (nutrient density); other factors had only negligible effects. Income was the only significant factor in alcohol intake. It is suggested that the effects of social class and income are overlapping. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking, being renters of accommodation, and being of minimum education and low social class are risk factors for poor dietary intake. It is recommended that such higher risk groups be specifically targeted for nutritional advice in pregnancy."

17665843,0,a,"In the first part of this paper, a secondary analysis of multiple data sources was done to identify how many nurses, physicians, dentists, pharmacists and other health workers have migrated from the Portuguese speaking African countries (PSAC) to Portugal between 1998 and 2002.

Health professionals are increasing as a proportion of total immigrants into Portugal. Relatively to the countries' of origin population, the PSAC contribute the most with foreign health professionals to the Portuguese healthcare system. Our study of Guinea-Bissau nurses in Portugal replicates the results of other studies and suggests that the decision to emigrate is multiply determined. The implication for policy makers is that the causal complexity among factors spurring emigration makes that the marginal effect of policy reforms addressing one or more of the multiple determinants of emigration may be sufficient to retain some proportion of health professionals, even when other determinants of emigration are present. The situation observed is also indicative of the need of programs for social integration of these professionals."

This study examined argileh smoking knowledge and attitudes in a sample of university students in Beirut as determinants of argileh smoking. Data were collected cross-sectionally through self-administered questionnaires from 416 students at the American University of Beirut through stratified cluster sampling. The proportion of ever-smokers in this study was 43%, compared with the 30% reported 4 years ago. A total of 28.3% of the surveyed students were current argileh smokers, and the average initiation age was 16 years. Compared with argileh smokers, significantly greater proportions of nonsmokers had positive attitudes about argileh banning and more accurate knowledge about argileh. Argileh smoking among Lebanese young is on the rise. Students demonstrated partial knowledge and moderate to favorable attitudes concerning argileh smoking. Possible public health interventions are discussed in light of the social and cultural context of argileh use to neutralize this emerging global public health threat."
16442195,0,a,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of cognitive functioning, psychopathology, and severity of extrapyramidal side effects on community outcome in a group of Greek outpatients with schizophrenia. Participants were 40 outpatients with schizophrenia (25 men). Social adjustment was assessed with the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Severity of symptoms of schizophrenia was measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS), and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS). Finally, a battery of neuropsychological tests was administered in order to assess the following cognitive domains: executive functioning/set shifting, executive functioning/inhibition, fluency, verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, attention, visuospatial ability, and psychomotor speed/visual scanning. Total scores on the QLS were significantly correlated with negative symptoms, parkinsonism, and performance on the fluency tasks. Interpersonal relations subscale was significantly related with negative symptoms and fluency. No significant relationship was found between the Instrumental Role Functioning subscale and the PANSS, ESRS, or any cognitive domain. Scores on the Intrapsychic Foundation subscale were significantly correlated with negative symptoms and fluency. Finally, scores on the Common Objects and Activities subscale were significantly related with severity of negative symptoms, parkinsonism and visual memory. Our findings suggest that severity of negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, especially performance on fluency tasks and visual memory, as well as parkinsonism, are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia."
10750613,0,a,"BACKGROUND: To investigate social variation in birthweight and length of gestation in Estonia in the period of transition to a democracy and market economy. METHODS: All live births resulting from singleton pregnancies reported to the Estonian Medical Birth Registry in 1992-1997 (n = 84, 629) were studied with respect to social variation in birthweight and preterm delivery (<37 weeks gestation). The results were adjusted for maternal age, parity, education, nationality, marital status, smoking in pregnancy, sex of the infant (and gestational age). RESULTS: Between 1992 and 1997, mean birthweight increased from 3,465g to 3,497g (P < 0.001) and the preterm rate fell from 5.8% to 5.1% (P = 0.001). Maternal education, marital status and nationality were all independently related to the mean birthweight and the risk of preterm birth. The mean difference in birthweight between children of mothers with basic and university education was 87 g (95% CI : 74-100). Children born to mothers of non-Estonian compared to Estonian nationality were on average 77 g lighter (95% CI: 70-84). While the effect of nationality and marital status on birthweight was relatively stable during the study period, differences in birth outcome by maternal education became stronger. CONCLUSIONS: The mean birthweight increased and the preterm rate decreased in Estonia as a whole during the transition. However, the improvements were not shared equally by all social groups. An increase in variation in birthweight by maternal education was particularly notable."
12347158,1,a,"""This study considers the utility of parameterised life tables derived by survival analysis for comparing mortality between areas, using death registration records and accompanying information on the social characteristics for each individual deceased. Such methods enable a comparison of summary measures of mortality experience such as life expectancy and median age at death before and after adjustment for socio-economic variables. In the absence of comparable information on the survivor population an approximate life table method is investigated as a means of comparing mortality profiles and the effects of social factors. Such factors may pertain both to the individuals (e.g. their birthplace) or to their small area of residence (e.g. measures of area deprivation). These methods also permit a comparison of the impact of socio-economic factors on different causes of death.

2005268,1,a,"By extending earlier stress-resistance research with a 1-year time lag, findings with 254 adults show that adaptive personality characteristics and positive family support operate prospectively over 4 years in predicting reduced depression, even when prior depression is controlled. By strengthening knowledge about the determinants and mediational role of coping, the results demonstrate in a 2-group LISREL analysis that the pattern of predictive relations differs under high and low stressors. Under high stressors, personal and social resources relate to future psychological health indirectly, through more adaptive coping strategies. Under low stressors, these resources relate directly to psychological health. The results support the idea that such resources play a causal role in maintaining psychological health, and they suggest the potential for a general, adaptively oriented framework applicable to adjustment under both high and low stressors."

Our hypothesis was based on the strain hypothesis of the Demand-Control-Support model, which postulates a relation between job demands, job control and support at work on the one hand, and the aetiology of health complaints on the other hand. High demands were hypothesized to obstruct return to work, whereas high control and high support were thought to have a positive effect on return to work. This hypothesis was tested in a population of employees who were sick-listed for 6-8 weeks. Return to work, as operationalized by the categories (i) not working; (ii) return to work with adjustments; and (iii) full return to work, was determined 4 months after the onset of the sick leave. The hypothesis was tested by logistic regression analyses. High job demands were the least predictive of full return to work. However, the likelihood of employees with high job demands returning to work with adjustments was higher than the likelihood of them not working. Therefore, job demands might also work as a pressure to return to work (compare this with Smulders and Nijhuis, 1999). Furthermore, high skill discretion in combination with high job demands predicted working with adjustments in comparison with not working. Finally, high supervisor support was the most predictive of return to work without adjustments, and the least predictive of not working."
18771064,0,a,"Using data from a 2005 national survey of working adults in the United States, we examine the effects of the gender composition of the superordinate-subordinate role-set on mental and physical health measures. Subordinates' and superordinates' genders are important determinants. Men who work in gender-mixed superordinate contexts (i.e., with one male and one female superior) report lower levels of distress and physical symptoms than men who work with one male superior. Women who work with one male superior report less distress and fewer physical symptoms compared to women who work with one female superior or in gender-mixed superordinate contexts. With a few exceptions, these observations generally hold net of occupation, job sector, and an array of work-related conditions. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of predictions derived from the similarity-attraction and role congruity theories. We also outline ways that theoretical development in relational demography can be refined by a more specific focus on the demographic characteristics--especially gender--of the superordinate-subordinate role-set."
9656267,1,a,"Research on the determinants of exercise behaviour has not assessed the role of personal goals which may be in conflict with exercising. A cross-sectional study showed that 312 nonexercisers, 466 people who exercised once or twice a week, and 202 people who exercised at the norm of at least three times a week differed significantly with respect to the number of important personal goals expected to be hampered by exercising at the norm. To be specific, the number of competing activities in the home was higher for the sedentary group than for those who exercised. Further, those who exercised at the norm reported fewer competing social activities than all other subjects and fewer competing self-developmental activities than the non-exercisers. Scores on the scale for activities outside the home did not differ significantly among the three groups. It is argued that any theoretical model of exercise behaviour should take into account the influence of competing personal goals on the initiation and continuation of exercise during leisure time."
12038742,0,a,"The authors describe the use of a stress process model by the East Side Village Health Worker Partnership (ESVHWP), a project of the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center, as a framework for understanding social determinants of health. Specifically, the authors describe the development by the ESVHWP Steering Committee of a context-specific stress process model for east side Detroit residents. The authors examine data from in-depth interviews to illuminate actions taken by community members to reduce stressors or minimize their impact on health. Finally, the authors describe the use of this context-specific stress process model and data gathered regarding actions to address community stressors to inform the development of interventions by the ESVHWP to reduce stressors or strengthen the conditioning factors that reduce the impact of stress on health. On the basis of these results, the authors discuss opportunities and challenges for partnership approaches to addressing social determinants of health in urban communities."
19390298,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Most studies of successful aging have used restricted definitions based on the absence of disability and identified a small number of predictors. The authors aimed to examine whether a broad multidimensional definition of successful aging has good construct validity and identified a wider range of predictors that are relevant for multifaceted interventions. METHODS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal data analyses were performed on 1,281 community-living Chinese elderly of 65 years and above in the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study cohort. Successful aging was measured in multiple dimensions of functioning and wellness: cognitive and affective status, physical health, social functioning and engagement and life satisfaction, and a summary composite measure created across dimensions to form a dichotomous variable. Potential determinants included sociodemographic, psychosocial, behavioral variables. RESULTS: Successful aging was determined in 28.6% of respondents and in multivariate models was significantly (p <0.05) associated with age (OR = 0.90), female gender (OR = 1.37), > or =6 years of education (OR = 2.31), better housing (OR = 1.41), religious or spiritual beliefs (OR = 1.64), physical activities and exercise (OR = 1.90), and low or no nutritional risk (OR = 2.16). CONCLUSION: In contrast to findings based on more restricted biomedical definitions of successful aging, a multidimensional definition of successful aging identified more variables including demographic status, psychosocial support, spirituality, and nutrition as salient determinants."
8837908,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The baseline findings from a controlled study of the effect of a public education campaign on community attitudes to mental illness are presented. METHOD: A census of attitudes to mental illness was conducted in two areas, prior to the opening of supported houses for the mentally ill. Factor analysis of the Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) inventory revealed three components: Fear and Exclusion, Social Control and Goodwill. RESULTS: The only determinant of Fear and Exclusion was having children. The main determinants of Social Control were social class, ethnic origin, age, having suffered mental illness and having children. The main determinant of Goodwill was educational level. The attitude factors were predictive of respondents' behavioural intentions toward the mentally ill. Respondents with children and non-Caucasians were more likely to object to the mentally ill living in their neighbourhood. CONCLUSIONS: Any intervention aimed at changing attitudes to mentally ill people in the community should be targeted at people with children and non-Caucasians, as these groups are more likely to object."
16250728,1,a,"The relations of diet adherence (DA) and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) to metabolic control, as measured with glycosylated hemoglobin A(tc) (GHbA(tc), and correlates of self-care were examines among a type I diabetic sample (n = 423). The Health Belief Model (HBM), supplemented by other factors (locus of control, self-efficacy, health value, and social support), was used as a theoretical model. In multiple regression analyses both DA (p<.01) and SMBG (p<.001). SMBG showed strong associations with self-efficacy in SMBG (p,.001) and net benefits of SMBG (p<.001). The revised models explained 14% and 21% of the variation in DA and SMBG, respectively. The results suggest that although perceived net benefits are important determinants of both SMBG and DA, DA is also related to diabetes support, whereas SMBG is more strongly related to perceived self-efficacy. Thus self-care regimen should be planned individually for diabetic patients."
15798130,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship among father's occupational group, daily smoking, and smoking determinants in a cohort of New Zealand adolescents. METHODS: The longitudinal Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study provided information on adolescents' self-reported smoking behavior and potential predictors of smoking, such as social and material factors, personality characteristics, educational achievement, and individual attitudes and beliefs regarding smoking. Longitudinal logistic generalized estimating equation analyses were used. RESULTS: Adolescents whose fathers were classified in the lowest-status occupational group were twice as likely as those whose fathers occupied the highest-status occupational group to be daily smokers. This high risk of daily smoking among the adolescents from the lowest occupational group was largely predicted by their lower intelligence scores and by the higher prevalence of smoking among fathers and friends. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent socioeconomic differences in smoking, school-based interventions should seek to prevent smoking uptake among adolescents, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Programs need to provide positive, nonsmoking role models consonant with the culture and norms of lower-socioeconomic-status groups. Adolescents need to acquire resistance skills and protective behaviors against social pressure and influences."
18203774,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, HIV prevalence has begun to decline in Zimbabwe, which has been associated with reductions in sexual risk behaviour. Here, we analyse the determinants of HIV incidence in this period of decline and estimate the population-level impact of identified risk factors. METHODS: A population-based cohort of 1672 HIV-negative adult males and 2465 HIV-negative adult females was recruited between 1998 and 2000. Each individual was then followed-up 3 years later. The influence and inter-relationship of social, behavioural and demographic variables were examined using a proximate determinants framework. To explore the population-level influence of a variable, methods were developed for estimating a risk factor's contribution to the reproductive number (CRN). RESULTS: HIV incidence was 19.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 16.3-24.2] per 1000 person years in men and 15.7 (95% CI 13.0-18.9) in women. Multiple sexual partners, having an unwell partner, and reporting another sexually transmitted disease were risk factors that captured the main aspects of the proximate determinants framework: individual behaviour, partnership characteristics and the probability of transmission, respectively. If the proximate determinants fully captured risk of HIV infection, underlying factors would not influence a fully parameterized model. However, a number of underlying social and demographic determinants remained important in regression models after including the proximate determinants. For both sexes, having multiple sexual partners made a substantial CRN, but, for women, no behaviour explained more than 10% of new infections. CONCLUSIONS: The proximate determinants did not explain the majority of new infections at the population level. This may be because we have been unable to measure some risks, but identifying risk factors assumes that those acquiring infections are somehow different from others who do not acquire infections. That they are not suggests that in this generalized epidemic there is little difference in readily identifiable characteristics of the individual between those who acquire infection and those who do not."
1492502,1,a,"Complex associations between alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, eating habits and physical exercise are explored. Data from the 1985 German Cardiovascular Prevention Study are used to explore associations between these behaviours, separate for young men (n = 561) and young women (n = 509) between 25 to 34 years of age. Analyses concern three forms of associations: 1. associations between different categories of single health behaviours; 2. associations between various health behaviours, and 3. associations between health behaviours, and their social determinants. Contingency tables, cluster analyses and logistic regression analyses are applied. Cluster analyses identified subgroups with particular health behaviour patterns. One distinct pattern, similarly among men and women, was typified by increased physical exercise, less smoking and increased beer consumption. For young men, results from regression analyses showed significant effects of higher income and positive health attitudes on belonging to this distinct cluster. For young women cluster membership was significantly correlated with higher education and positive health attitudes. Results of the statistical analyses demonstrate the usefulness of a multi-methods approach in studying complex behaviour patterns. Finally the relevance of the present findings for future studies and applications is indicated."
15714217,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To outline the rationale, objectives and strategies used in a systematically designed research programmme to study specific weight gain-inducing behaviours, their social-psychological as well as environmental determinants, and the effects of interventions aimed at the prevention of weight gain. DESIGN: The evidence for potential behavioural determinants and strategies to prevent weight gain was reviewed, and the methods applied within the Netherlands Research programme weight gain prevention (NHF-NRG) project were described. The project is designed according to the Intervention Mapping protocol. SETTING: The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: The main target groups are (a) adolescents (12-16 y) in secondary school, (b) young adults (20-40 y) at the workplace and (c) recently retired people (55-65 y) at home. INTERVENTIONS: Each intervention includes an individual component, in which computer-tailored information is provided. Additionally, interventions are aimed at changing environmental components. RESULTS: The short-term results of this project can be expected by the beginning of 2005. Guidelines for nationwide weight gain prevention, based on this research programme, will become available in 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the few interventions that were evaluated to date, no robust conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of obesity prevention. The systematic and multidisciplinary design of the NHF-NRG programme enables the identification of potentially effective methods and strategies for the prevention of weight gain."
14695364,0,a,"Utilization of health services is a complex behavioral phenomenon. Empirical studies of preventive and curative services have often found that use of health services is related to the availability, quality and cost of services, as well as to social structure, health beliefs and personal characteristics of the users. In this paper an attempt is made to examine the factors associated with the use of maternal health care services in Bangladesh on the basis of data from a survey of maternal morbidity in Bangladesh, conducted by the Bangladesh Institute of Research for Promotion of Essential and Reproductive Health and Technologies (BIRPERHT). The results from both the bivariate and multivariate analyses confirmed the importance of mother's education in explaining the utilization of health care services. Female education retains a net effect on maternal health service use, independent of other women's background characteristics, household's socioeconomic status and access to healthcare services. The strong influence of mother's education on the utilization of health care services is consistent with findings from other studies. Women whose husbands are involved in business/services also positively influenced the utilization of modern health care services. However, the study results are inconclusive with respect to the influence of other predisposing and enabling factors, such as women's age, number of previous pregnancies and access to health facilities. Multivariate logistic regression estimates do not show any significant impact of these factors on the use of maternal health care. The influence of severity of disease condition in explaining the utilization of maternal health care appears to be significant. Multivariate analysis indicate that women having had a life-threatening condition are little over two times more likely to seek care from a doctor or nurse to treat their maternal morbidities."
14563081,0,a,"Conservatives are taking aim at the field of public health, targeting its efforts to understand and control environmental and social causes of disease. Richard Epstein and others contend that these efforts in fact undermine people's health and well-being by eroding people's incentives to create economic value. Public health, they argue, should stick to its traditional task--the struggle against infectious diseases. Because markets are not up to the task of controlling the transmission of infectious disease, Epstein says, coercive government action is required. But market incentives, not state action, he asserts, represent our best hope for controlling the chronic illnesses that are the main causes of death in industrialized nations. In this article, we assess Epstein's case. We consider his claims about the market's capabilities and limits, the roles of personal choice and social influences in spreading disease, andthe relationship between health and economic inequality. We argue that Epstein's critique of public health over-reaches, oversimplifies, and veils his political and moral preferences behind seemingly objective claims about the economics of disease control and the determinants of disease spread. Public health policy requires political and moral choices, but these choices should be transparent."
11784904,0,a,"A population-based case-control study was carried out to identify determinant factors for post-neonatal infant deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia, and malnutrition in Greater Metropolitan Belo Horizonte, Southeast Brazil. From May 1, 1991, to April 30, 1992, 511 post-neonatal deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia, and malnutrition were selected after investigation of medical records to validate cause of death. Of this total, 396 deaths were compared to a neighborhood control group, matched for age. The study was carried out in a low-income area with a high proportion of families living in shantytowns. The article discusses the methodology and selected socioeconomic factors. Logistic regression analysis indicated that number of household appliances, mother's and father's education, and mother's marital and work status were significantly associated with risk of infant death, i.e., they were determinants of infant deaths due to avoidable causes."
10813470,0,a,"The objective of this study is to determine the effect of permethrin insecticide-treated bed net (PITN) use on the incidence of febrile episodes and on household malaria expenses in Benin. Over the course of one year, 208 randomly selected PITN user and non-user households were visited weekly to determine expenditures on febrile morbidity and its treatment, and to monitor spending on malaria prevention. Multivariate analyses were performed to distinguish the effects of PITN use from other important determinants of morbidity, such as malaria-related beliefs and practices, income, and other socio-economic variables. Results from the logistic regression analysis show that the use of PITNs decreases the risk of febrile episodes by 34% in children living in the rural zone. Multiple regression analysis reveals that PITN use does not reduce prevention and treatment expenses. These expenses are significantly associated with women's income. This report also discusses other factors associated with febrile morbidity and malaria-related expenditures."
19477880,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Early family-level and social-level stressors are both assumed to be the components of two main path models explaining the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and its long-term consequences on mental health explored through life-course epidemiological studies. AIMS: To investigate the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and mental health outcomes in adulthood when taking into account early family and social stressors. METHODS: A retrospective French cohort study of 3023 adults representative of the general population in the Paris metropolitan area was conducted in 2005 through at-home, face-to-face interviews. The outcomes measures were current depression and lifetime suicide attempt, intimate partner violence, violence against children and alcohol dependence. RESULTS: The adults exposed to interparental violence during childhood had a higher risk of psychosocial maladjustment. After adjusting for family- and social-level stressors in childhood, this risk was, respectively, 1.44 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.00) for depression, 3.17 (1.75 to 5.73) for conjugal violence, 4.75 (1.60 to 14.14) for child maltreatment and 1.75 (1.19 to 2.57) for alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: The adult consequences of parental violence in childhood-and this independently of the other forms of domestic violence and the related psychosocial risks-should lead to intensifying the prevention of and screening for this form of maltreatment of children."
16629693,0,a,"Intrauterine growth retardation and preterm birth are more frequent in African-American women and women of lower socio-economic status, but the reasons for these disparities are not fully understood. The physical and social environments in which these women live may contribute to these disparities. We conducted a multilevel study to explore whether conditions of mothers' neighbourhood of residence contribute to adverse birth outcomes independent of individual-level determinants. We analysed data from 105 111 births in 1015 census tracts in Louisiana during 1997-98, merging it with data from other existing sources on neighbourhood socio-economic status, neighbourhood physical deterioration, and neighbourhood density of retail outlets selling tobacco, alcohol and foods. After controlling for individual-level sociodemographic factors, tract-level median household income was positively associated with both birthweight-for-gestational-age and gestational age at birth. Neighbourhood physical deterioration was associated with these birth outcomes in ecological analyses but only inconsistently associated with them after controlling for individual-level factors. Neither gestational age nor birthweight-for-gestational-age was associated with the neighbourhood density of alcohol outlets, tobacco outlets, fast-food restaurants or grocery supermarkets. We conclude that measures of neighbourhood economic conditions are associated with both fetal growth and the length of gestation independent of individual-level factors, but that readily available measures of neighbourhood retail outlets are not. Additional studies are needed to better understand the nature of environmental influences on birth outcomes."
15098428,0,a,"Despite significant debate about the efficacy, ideology, and ethics of the method, condom social marketing (CSM) has become the dominant approach to AIDS education in many sub-Saharan African countries. However, critics have charged that social marketing (SM) distracts from the structural determinants of health-related behavior and excludes genuine community participation. This article argues that the diffusion of SM techniques in Africa is not driven by demonstrated efficacy but is attributable to the promotion of privatization and free markets in the structural adjustment era across the region. The CSM experience in a central Mozambican community reveals the dangers of using the method at the expense of community dialogue and participation to confront the AIDS epidemic. The advertising campaign developed to sell condoms has clashed with Pentecostal and Independent Churches, now a majority of the population, that have expanded rapidly across the region spreading a contrasting message about sexuality and risky behavior."
17266167,0,a,"A major characteristic of teenage smoking is the ability to 'bum' cigarettes from peers. To date, research into the determinants of teenage smoking has largely ignored the effects of this social market on the smoking decisions of teenagers. In this paper, we estimate the demand for cigarettes using data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey which distinguishes teens who primarily buy cigarettes from those who primarily borrow cigarettes. Our results demonstrate the ways in which higher cigarette prices and restrictions on smoking influence not only a teen's decision to smoke and the quantity of cigarettes smoked, but also the manner in which cigarettes are acquired. We show that current cigarette regulations are ineffective in reaching the group of light smokers who primarily obtain cigarettes through the social market, thus indicating that alternative measures should be explored in an effort to reduce the number of smokers in the future."
8420583,1,a,"As the epidemic of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in sub-Saharan Africa enters its second decade, much has been learned about the distribution and determinants of the disease and its causative agent, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Over 6 million people, or 2.5% of the adult population, are thought to be infected with HIV. The distribution of HIV is largely determined by sexual behavior; as for other sexually transmitted diseases, the characteristics of sexual networks determine the extent and rate of spread of HIV. Female sex workers and their male clients are at high risk for HIV and have been important in initiating the epidemic in many African countries. The dynamics of HIV in the rest of the population are complex; men with multiple sexual partners are largely responsible for transmission of HIV to women in the general population. Other sexually transmitted diseases and lack of male circumcision may increase the probability of transmission of HIV during sexual intercourse and probably are partially responsible for the rapid diffusion of HIV in Africa. Interventions among high-risk groups are needed, but they must be accompanied by attempts to induce behavior change among men and women in the general population. Epidemiologic studies of the determinants of sexual behavior and sexual contact patterns, as well the design and evaluation of interventions, are urgently needed. Key areas for development are the study of behavioral exposures and outcomes, the evaluation of interventions, developing new methods for conducting interventions in resource-poor environments, and increasing the number of African scientists with the skills and resources to conduct epidemiologic studies."
17279404,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the different practice profiles of general practitioners (GPs) in order to test the hypothesis of heterogeneity in physician behaviour. DATA: For the year 2000, 4,660 GPs from two regions in France. VARIABLES: volume and structure of the physicians' medical activity, income level, personal characteristics, socioeconomic and geographical environment, characteristics of their patients. METHODS: A cluster analysis to identify different practice profiles and a regression analysis to display the determinants of the physicians' activity. RESULTS: Four different homogeneous groups can be identified, each one associating a physician's level of activity to his socioeconomic status. The level and the intensity of medical activity depend on individual factors, patients' characteristics as well as the socioeconomic context. CONCLUSIONS: There is no uniformity in the way GPs practice medicine. An immediate consequence is that any cost-containment measure that is applied uniformly to all GPs inevitably results in different outcomes according to the physicians' category type."
12614539,0,a,"The number of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) being utilized by North America health care consumers is growing at an astounding rate. There is a need by both health care providers and consumers to categorize CAM in order to make meaningful comparisons and informed decisions on their use. Four paradigms of health and illness are proposed that classify medicines according to the basic assumptions of health and disease associated with each medicine. CAMs classified in the body paradigm are those that work through biologic mechanisms, or in other words, target biologic factors as the primary determinants of health. The mind-body paradigm extends the body paradigm to include factors such as stress, psychologic coping styles, and social supports as primary determinants of health and disease. The body-energy paradigm assumes health and disease are functions of the flow and balances of life energies. The body-spirit paradigm assumes that one or more transcendental aspects or personalities existing outside the limitations of the material universe can influence health and disease. It is postulated that there is a hierarchical relation among the four paradigms, such that each paradigm essentially subsumes the assumptions of the previous ones, but adds additional assumptions that qualify the previous ones. Implications of this framework for clarifying many contemporary issues in health care are discussed."
8151506,1,a,"Although peer raters of personality traits do tend to agree, the strength of their consensus is often modest. This article focuses on methods for analyzing determinants of consensus. Variance components methods adapted from generalizability theory have some untapped potential for understanding gradations in consensus.

Limitations of the variance components approach are also discussed. The methods are illustrated with artificial data."
9125701,1,a,"The purpose of this article has been to acquaint psychoanalysts and psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapists with some of the most current ideas in philosophy and psychology, which have crucial implications for our professional organizations and our clinical work. The basic stance of this postmodern thinking constitutes a challenge to what is called foundationalism, which dominated scientific and philosophical thought until recently. In place of foundationalism, even in the production of scientific or philosophical works, we could hope for an ongoing dialogue between a king or queen who states the basic theoretical orientation, the loyal opposition that looks for inconsistencies and kinks in it, the jester who deconstructs the whole thing and introduces parenthetical digressions, and finally, a secret society of organization that functions to hold the adherents of the theory together and provide them with a unifying ego ideal. Postmodern thought is described and there is some discussion of its ""four horsemen,"" Derrida, Rorty, Foucault, and Lyotard, who in general question the possibility of whether any form of interpretation can be thought of as related to reality or the truth. My own point of view is that an intermediate position is necessary rather than a binary opposition between nihilism and foundationalism or more specifically, postmodernism and traditional psychoanalysis. That is to say, within certain horizons and with an understanding of the cultural and historical referents that always affect and delimit both the patient and the therapist, it is still possible to reach conceptions about what is going on both in the psychoanalytic process and the psyche of the patient that have at least a tentative ""truth."" Careful attention to the patient's material following an interpretation can provide clues about the validity of our conception at the time. But the horizons and historicity that delimit all ""truth"" reduce the authority and the stature of the analyst, make the analyst less of an arbiter of what is ""reality,"" and focus greater attention on the therapist-patient dyad, which is consistent with the modern trend in psychoanalytic treatment anyway. The notion of social constructions as constituting the psychoanalytic process was discussed and it was suggested that this notion suffers from the lack of sufficient attention to the historical determinants of how a given individual reacts in a given situation. A patient will react differently to different therapists, depending on the transference or projective identifications that the patient brings to the treatment, regardless of the interpersonal interaction. This is in opposition to the idea that transference is primarily an effect of the therapist-patient dyad, and preserves a major aspect of traditional Freudian theory. The dangers of postmodern thought disintegrating into nihilism are described, and the limitations of so-called postmodern thought are discussed, including the intrinsic paradoxical nature of any postmodern proposition. At the same time, postmodern thought is useful in calling attention to the ""space of the Other"" in human affairs, to the tendency to form binary oppositions in which the second element in each binary pair is part of the Other and is depreciated, and to remind us that there are always further interpretations of the narrative that emerges from the psychoanalytic situation. The feminization of psychotherapy and its relationship to feminism are important current issues. Postmodern thought is valuable in responding to the common complaint of feminists about Nietzsche's attitude toward women; postmodernist approaches emphasize the ambiguous and the allegorical aspects of Nietzsche's thought, to the extreme orf Derrida's contention that Nietzsche is not really interpretable at all. At the same time feminists legitimately object to postmodernist erosion of the grounds for political action. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"
2331859,1,a,"Although sentiments about the positive health benefits of regular exercise have been expressed for many centuries, it is only in the past three decades that epidemiologic evidence has provided scientific support for the health benefits of being physically active. The evidence for the protective effect of physical activity is particularly strong with reference to cardiovascular disease, with the relative risk of being ""inactive"" compared to 'active' estimated to typically lie between 1.5 and 2.0. Despite the popular view that exercise participation has increased in recent years, estimates of trends in physical activity in Australian (and other) populations have been difficult to interpret because of the different measurements and surveys used. We examined data from population surveys using well validated, standardised methods to assess exercise participation, through National surveys between 1984 and 1987 conducted by the Commonwealth Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (DASETT). Over the period in which the surveys were conducted, there appears to have been a slight increase in the proportion of Australians who participated in regular physical activity. There was a significant decline in the proportion who reported being totally sedentary--from 32.9 per cent in 1984 to 25.4 per cent in 1987. The data from all of the surveys were then pooled to give an overall sample size of 17053, and socio-demographic variables were examined in relation to exercise participation. Women, older people, the less well educated, and those on lower incomes were less likely to perform regular physical activity. Inequalities in the social distribution of exercise participation parallel those found for other health risk factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
16078556,0,a,"This article reviews current literature and research on literacy and health and identifies priorities for research on this topic in Canada. Information sources included documents found through an environmental scan, the Alpha Plus collection and a computer search of recent documents. The information was analyzed using a conceptual framework. The review found that low literacy has direct and indirect impacts on health. Families are at risk due to difficulty reading medication prescriptions, baby formula instructions and health and safety education materials. People with lower levels of literacy tend to live and work in less healthy environments. They have more difficulties obtaining employment and income security. Determinants of literacy include: education, early childhood development, aging, living and working conditions, personal capacity/genetics, gender and culture. Action is needed to improve literacy and health through a combination of health communication, education and training, community development, organizational development, and policy development. There is some evidence that such interventions can have a positive effect on health, particularly when combined with one another. Further program and policy development requires greater evidence and evaluation of existing initiatives, more cost/benefit analyses, more culturally specific studies, and greater attention to current social trends and needs."
15369573,0,a,"AIMS: To compare low-rate daily smokers (one to five cigarettes/day) with other daily smokers, using the Transtheoretical Model of Change as a framework. DESIGN: Mail survey with a follow-up after 7 months. SETTING: A randomly selected population sample in French-speaking Switzerland, in 1998. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2338 daily smokers aged 25 + years, including 95 smokers of one to five cigarettes/day, 324 smokers of six to 10 cigarettes/day, 399 smokers of 11-15 cigarettes/day and 1520 smokers of 16 + cigarettes/day, and 1765 people (75% of 2338) at 7-month follow-up. FINDINGS: Compared with smokers of 16 + cigarettes/day, low-rate smokers of one to five cigarettes/day included more women (67% versus 46%, P < 0.001), were 4 years younger (P < 0.001), were less motivated to quit smoking (62% versus 37% in the 'precontemplation' stage of change, P < 0.001), thought that quitting would be easier (-3.4 points on a 0-10 scale, P < 0.001) and were less bothered by the risk of smoking. Low-rate smokers were taking control more actively over their smoking, e.g. they more often stayed away from places where people smoked, sat in the no-smoking sections in public places and tried to delay as much as they could their first cigarette of the day. Only 45% of low-rate smokers were still in the same category 7 months later. CONCLUSIONS: For many smokers, low-rate smoking may result from a conscious effort to limit their cigarette consumption. Being a low-rate smoker was a temporary condition for most people. Low-rate smokers should be considered as a specific, although heterogeneous group."
9484309,1,a,"This study examined determinants of the treatment climate in 89 psychiatric and substance abuse programs. Clearer policies giving patients more control, and more health and treatment services, were related to more supportive, autonomous, expressive, and practically oriented milieus. In contrast, more policy choice and daily living assistance were associated with less support, personal expression, and practical orientation. Programs in which staff had more paraprofessionals and better team functioning, and in which patients had more social resources and better mental functioning, tended to be more supportive and to have more emphasis on autonomy, personal expression, and practical orientation. Based on these results, we suggest some guidelines on how to change the treatment milieu to benefit patients' adjustment."
16122570,0,a,"Recent findings support and add to earlier findings of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Deficits across neurocognitive domains such as attention, working memory, language skills, and executive functioning tend to be moderate, with the most pronounced deficits found in verbal learning and memory. All these neurocognitive domains are related to adaptive and social skills, with executive functions and verbal learning and memory showing more variance across more domains than other neuro-cognitive variables. Negative symptoms and neurocognitive domains, although correlated, are distinct and have differential pathways of change with treatment. General psychopathology symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, may become important treatment targets as strategies are developed for translating cognitive enhancement to real-world functional performance."

The estimated earnings potentials of the parents and their children are included as explanatory variables but are not found to be important determinants of coresidency."
1519079,1,a,"This study explores mechanisms involved in self-evaluation of health by making specifications of linkages among various dimensions of health status, physiological measures, social and behavioral factors or characteristics. The proposed structural equation model is tested by using data from a comprehensive health survey of the population of Finnmark county, Norway (1987-88), including 4549 men and 4360 women aged 30-62. The findings suggest the burden of physical distress and reliance on permanent disablement benefit to play the key role in reducing self-evaluated health. The seemingly strong labelling impact of permanent work disability, contrasted the modest effect of diagnoses of chronic disease. Moreover, the impact of both these key factors and other important determinants is strongly socially patterned. Positive health related life-style appeared to have a positive impact on self-rated health, while preoccupation with health had a negative impact. This finding adds some credibility to the suggestion that the growing occupation and fascination with health have some negative health outcomes."
12292524,1,a,"""Like the 1930s, the 1980s were characterized, in France, by a profound economic, social, and moral crisis.... The far right exploited the general mood of anxiety to place immigrants in the center of the debate, blaming the immigrant communities for the country's problems.... In the 1930s, the group designated as most dangerous was the Jews; in the 1980s, it was the North Africans. As a result, the extreme right urges that borders be closed, that access to citizenship be restricted, that as many foreigners as possible be turned away. Although racist ideas were commonly expressed in the 1930s, they are no longer openly espoused today, with the exception of certain fringe groups. But, aside from this difference and the origin of the groups perceived as most threatening, the modus operandi of the xenophobic process has varied little in 50 years."" (SUMMARY IN ENG AND SPA)"

19237481,0,a,"The BBC comedy show ;Harry and Paul' sparked media controversy in the UK and around the world for inciting stereotyped racial discrimination, vulgarity and violation of human rights when it portrayed a Filipino domestic worker as a sex toy in Episode 4 of the series. This incident raises the issue concerning the media's role in framing social issues and how it affects the wider determinants of health. There is a need for health psychology as an academic discipline to engage more in these issues. The Journal of Health Psychology provides a unique platform for discussion and debate of perspectives on racism, the media and health."
16612193,0,a,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The reality of schizophrenia is not fully expressed by measures of psychopathology and both descriptive research and research into interventions benefit from the investigation of social outcomes. We define these as measures which reflect performance compared to normal social expectations, either of oneself or of another. The studies we reviewed looked at the effects on summary measures, for example, quality of life, as well as simpler, more self-explanatory outcomes such as employment, marital status, financial independence and housing. RECENT FINDINGS: The review contrasts studies which describe the determinants of social outcomes and studies designed to estimate the effects of interventions on these outcomes. Recent descriptive studies demonstrate that social outcomes have both longitudinal and cross-sectional associations with cognitive impairment, preexisting functional impairment and certain symptoms. Studies of both pharmacological and social interventions suggest that, at best, these can affect social outcomes. SUMMARY: Simpler social outcomes are reported less frequently than summary measures which can make interpretation more difficult, thus diluting a potential advantage of social outcome measures to researchers and clinicians alike. Social outcomes are underreported compared to measures of psychopathology, particularly in trials of interventions."
17241481,0,a,"To examine the effects of risk on infant development within cultural contexts, 141 dual-earner Israeli and Palestinian couples and their first-born child were observed at 5 months and again at 34 months. Eight ecological determinants were examined as potential risk factors, including the infant's observed and parent-reported difficult temperament; the mother's depressive symptoms, work-family interference, and experience of childbirth; the parents' marital satisfaction and social support; and observed maternal and paternal sensitivity. Symbolic play and behavior problems were assessed at 34 months. Culture-specific effects of risk and protective factors were found. Parent sensitivity facilitated symbolic competence to a greater extent in the Israeli group. Culture moderated the effects of maternal depression and family social support on toddlers' behavior problems. Maternal depressive symptoms had a negative impact on the behavior adaptation of Israeli children and social support buffered against behavior problems in the Arab group. Implications for research on risk and resilience and the role of culture in moderating the effects of ecological risk are discussed."
18784048,0,a,"International interest in the social determinants of health and their public policy antecedents is increasing. Despite evidence that as compared to other wealthy nations Canada presents a mediocre population health profile and public policy environments increasingly less supportive of health, the Canadian public health gaze is firmly - and narrowly - focused on lifestyle issues of diet, physical activity and tobacco use. Much of this has to do with Canada being identified as being driven by a liberal political economy, a situation shared with a cluster of other developed nations. Reasons for Canada's neglect of structural and public policy issues are explored and ways by which public health workers in Canada and elsewhere can help to shift policymakers and the general public's understandings of the determinants of health are outlined."
19826556,0,a,"Understanding social inequalities in health is of great importance; it provides the conceptual frame for investigating the social factors that affect health, together with empirical evidence for improving population health. Individual and socioeconomic data, disease related conditions and self rated health (SRH) ratings were collected from a representative sample of 1,000 participants in order to study health inequalities in Greece. 20.8% of men and 37.2% of women reported poor health status. Significant inequalities in SRH were observed. Strong associations of poor SRH with gender, age, insurance coverage and chronic diseases were identified. Social insurance scheme captured partly the effects of educational level, income and residence area in SRH in multivariate analysis. Respondents under chronic treatment and those suffering from cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and neurological/psychiatric disorders exhibited the highest risk of reporting poor SRH. Our findings provide decision-makers with insights into how to manage health inequalities by prioritizing preventive measures and consequently, progress towards the fair distribution of healthcare resources."
11264268,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of self-rated health to a measure of physical status, based on a professional rating of the individual's health from a strictly physical point of view. METHODS: A random selection of 407 people over the age of 20 from the north-western catchment area of greater Stockholm were invited in 1995 to a physical examination, including a self-report questionnaire with questions about self-rated health, lifestyle, psychosocial factors and quality of life. A measure of physical health on a 5-point graded scale was constructed using the information from the records of the physical examination as a base. RESULTS: Self-rated health and the professional ratings of health coincided in approximately 60% of the cases. There were a relatively large number of cases where the ratings were contradictory. The correlation between the scales was 0.45. Comparison between the two ratings with respect to association with potential determinants showed that physical factors naturally explained most of the variances in physical health, whereas social and mental well-being and somatic conditions (women) were the most important explanatory variables for self-rated health. Irrespective of whether they had ""favourable"" or ""unfavourable"" health, those with ""poor"" self-rated health also had perceived lower social and mental well-being, less appreciation, more somatic conditions (women) and worse coping abilities (men). CONCLUSIONS: With mental, psychosocial and social problems becoming more pronounced in sickness patterns for primary care patients, self-rated health could be a helpful device, especially when time resources for consultations are short. This measure could also give a more global view of the patient's situation when effectivity and rationality can be a threat to a holistic view of the patient."
15791922,0,a,"Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder affecting girls, caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. There are no population-based data on the extent and determinants of health service use in this disorder. The population-based registry, the Australian Rett Syndrome database, was the source of phenotype data. This also contains data from mutation screening and X-inactivation studies. Data on retrospective (n = 152) and prospective (n = 162) health service use were collected in 2000 from a questionnaire and a calendar study, respectively. Health service use was highest in younger cases (P = .001) and lowest in cases with milder phenotypes (P < .001). Random X-inactivation was associated with service use (P = .02). Maternal education, phenotype, and individual mutations were determinants of health service use. The use of a retrospective and prospective data set enabled accurate assessment of service use in Rett syndrome. Both genetic and sociodemographic determinants of health service use were identified, with important implications for the optimal and equitable management of children with Rett syndrome."
10656104,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with self rated health of people with and without chronic health conditions or long term disability. SETTING: Canadian household population. DESIGN: Analysis of 1994/95 National Population Health Survey interview data with 13,995 respondents aged 20 years and older. Determinants of poor and good compared with excellent health were examined using multivariate nominal logistic regression. Factors included in the analyses were illness related (chronic disease, long and short-term disability, and pain) demographic, lifestyle (smoking, physical activity, drinking), and social psychological resources (mastery, chronic stress, distress, self esteem, and social support). RESULTS: Illness related variables were associated with poor health, with smaller but significant contributions from demographic and lifestyle factors. Psychological resources, especially high mastery and self esteem, are associated with better health in those with chronic conditions or disability. CONCLUSION: The determinants of self rated health for people with chronic illness and disability make the greatest contribution to the findings for the overall population."
15772506,0,a,"Distance education offers many advantages to students, faculty, and educational institutions. Despite these advantages, distance education classes historically have higher dropout rates than do the courses taught in the traditional, face-to-face setting. Current research includes information related to technology, teaching tips, and resources for these extended learning opportunities. However, information related to student success in distance education is limited and success indicators are poorly defined. Current studies on success indicators often lack a defining framework that provides an opportunity for study replication and strengthens the credibility of study findings. An empirical model developed by Powell et al divides potential determinants of success into three categories. This literature review identifies indicators in each category and indicates a need to revise the current framework to include technology as a fourth category. The revised framework should provide a basis for additional research in this rapidly growing area."
19069053,0,a,"Student level data on participation in classroom discourse and student effort on assignments in 117 middle school English classrooms are used to investigate the social determinants of student engagement in classroom instruction. Social identity theories of race, social class, and attachment to school, and research in the social psychology of achievement motivation both suggest differential levels of student engagement among diverse student groups. Using multilevel models, the author investigates the relationship between classroom context and students' levels of engagement. Levels of engagement among black and low SES students are mostly insensitive to classroom context, suggesting there is little collective action directed at fostering anti-school norms among these student groups. However, consistent with research in the social psychology of achievement motivation, students who begin class with weaker reading and writing skills are less likely to be engaged, setting the stage for a cycle of reduced achievement growth."
14999160,0,a,"Women's mental health during pregnancy has important implications not only for the well-being of the mother, but also for the development, health, and well-being of her unborn child. A growing body of empirical evidence from population-based studies suggests that two indicators of women's mental health during pregnancy--psychosocial stress and social support--may exert a significant influence on fetal development and infant birth outcomes, such as birth weight and length of gestation, even after controlling for the effects of established sociodemographic, obstetric, and behavioral risk factors. This paper describes the role of three major biological systems involved in the physiology of pregnancy and stress physiology: neuroendocrine, immune/inflammatory, and cardiovascular systems. These systems have been hypothesized to mediate the effects of maternal mental health on fetal developmental and health outcomes, and a central role has been proposed for placental corticotropin-releasing hormone in this process. However, not all women reporting high prenatal stress and/or low social support proceed to develop adverse birth outcomes, raising the question of the determinants of susceptibility/vulnerability in the context of high stress and/or low social support. In this context, the role of race/ethnicity and genetic predisposition are discussed as two promising avenues of further investigation."
16707005,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The Spanish National Health Service is a universal and free health care system. Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent disorder, generating large health and social costs. The objectives of this study were to describe its management in primary care, to assess patient characteristics that influence physicians' decisions, and to describe clinical outcome at 2 months. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 648 patients with non-specific low back pain was recruited by 75 physicians (out of 361-20.8%) working in 40 primary care centers in 10 of the 17 administrative regions in Spain, covering 693,026 out of the 40,499,792 inhabitants. Patients were assessed on the day they were recruited, and prospectively followed-up 14 and 60 days later. The principal patient characteristics that were analyzed were: sex, duration of the episode, history of LBP, working status, severity of LBP, leg pain and disability, and results of straight leg raising test. Descriptors of management were: performance of the straight leg raising test, ordering of diagnostic procedures, prescription of drug treatment, referral to physical therapy, rehabilitation or surgery, and granting of sick leave. Regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between patients' baseline characteristics and physicians' management decisions. Only workers were included in the models on sick leave. RESULTS: Mean age (SD) of included patients was 46.5 (15.5) years, 367 (56.6%) were workers, and 338 (52.5%) were females. Median (25th-75th interquartile range) duration of pain when entering the study was 4 (2-10) days and only 28 patients (4.3%) had chronic low back pain. Diagnostic studies included plain radiographs in 43.1% of patients and CT or MRI scans in 18.8%. Drug medication was prescribed to 91.7% of patients, 19.1% were sent to physical therapy or rehabilitation, and 9.6% were referred to surgery. The main determinants of the clinical management were duration of the episode and, to a lesser extent, the intensity of the pain (especially leg pain), a positive straight leg raising test, and degree of disability. The main determinant of sick leave was the degree of disability, followed by the characteristics of the labor contract and the intensity of leg pain (but not low back pain). After at least 2 months of treatment, 37% of patients were still in pain and approximately 10% of patients had not improved or had worsened. CONCLUSION: Although the use of X-Rays is high, determinants of physicians' management of LBP in primary care made clinical sense and were consistent with patterns suggested by evidence-based recommendations. However, after 2 months of treatment more than one third of patients continued to have back pain and about 10% had worsened."
1644512,1,a,"Freidson is a foremost analyst of the medical profession. Most recently Freidson attacks those who claim that medicine is declining in power. He insists that medicine has not lost the core elements that make it a powerful, indeed, the dominant, health profession. The author compares Freidson's early writings on medicine with his most recent ones, and shows that there are critical confusions in Freidson's central concepts of professional autonomy and dominance. This difficulty is illuminated by viewing dominance, autonomy, and subordination as on a continuum of control. Using this continuum, the author argues that Freidson implicitly admits what he set out to deny (that medicine has not declined in power) by shifting his focus from medical dominance to that of autonomy. Freidson also now rejects valid parts of his earlier work (that which emphasizes social structural determinants of behavior over socialization). In equating medicine in the United States with teaching in that country, Freidson's contention of ""little change in medical power"" meets its own refutation. Finally, despite his derogation of others, Freidson's lack of an adequate framework to explain the dynamics and not simply the structure of health care produces purely normative, utopian (and unhelpful) policy recommendations."
19306200,0,a,"Cancer is primarily a chronic disease of older adults that must be managed and incorporated into everyday activities. Online sites are important sources of health care information and support. Health literacy is necessary for full utilisation of online resources. The objective of this study was to examine and compare cancer related conversations in online forums hosted by Canadian and American associations for retired persons. A content analysis was used to evaluate archived cancer conversations of general-health online forums representing two leading North American associations for retired persons. There were 125/1817 (6.8%) Canadians and 70/892 (7.8%) US cancer discussions among participants in 2006. Online conversations were grouped into three categories: request for information, provision of information and sharing of information. Important subthemes included cancer prevention and screening, treatment and cancer care and health system issues. There were significantly more posts about provision of cancer information from the Canadian compared with the US site (p = 0.023). American more than Canadian conversations emphasised the health system concerns as determinants of cancer care practices. Online discussion forums hosted by retirement associations may serve as an important channel in information dissemination about cancer prevention and screening, treatment and care support and health care advice for seniors."
18415929,0,a,"Unplanned and premature discharge from in-patient alcohol or drug detoxification is a common and severe problem in the treatment of substance abuse. So far, most of the relevant studies focused on drug detoxification, whereas only few studies also investigated alcohol detoxification. The aim of the present study was to comparatively identify and analyse determinants of unplanned discharge during in-patient treatment in both diagnostic groups which simultaneously underwent detoxification under the same treatment setting. Subjects were 239 consecutive admissions (alcohol: n = 90; illegal drugs: n = 149) to a specialised qualified detoxification unit at the Psychiatric University Hospital of Heidelberg during the year 2000. Data on sociodemographical and psychosocial variables, medical history, psychopathological findings on admission and presence of psychiatric and/or somatic comorbidity as well as intensity level of withdrawal symptoms were collected retrospectively and analysed with respect to the prediction of planned/unplanned discharge. The high overall rates of unplanned discharge (alcohol: 43.3 % and drugs 62.4 %) confirm the previously reported figures. Treatment success of drug patients was rather affected by sociodemographical and psychosocial factors such as level of education, delinquency, unemployment and hepatitis C diagnosis. Relating to alcohol patients psychopathological findings on admission including orientation, affective state and cognition were most relevant for planned discharge. Furthermore, the results of this study underline the central role of motivation during in-patient treatment as well as the importance of a planned treatment continuation after discharge from the detoxification program."
7487339,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Studies of adult antisocial behavior or criminality usually find genetic factors to be more important than the family environment, whereas studies of delinquency find the family environment to be more important. We compared DSM-III-R antisocial personality disorder symptoms before vs after the age of 15 years within a sample of twins, rather than comparing across studies. METHODS: We administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version III-revised by telephone to 3226 pairs of male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Biometrical modeling was applied to each symptom of antisocial personality disorder and summary measures of juvenile and adult symptoms. RESULTS: Five juvenile symptoms were significantly heritable, and five were significantly influenced by the shared environment. Eight adult symptoms were significantly heritable, and one was significantly influenced by the shared environment. The shared environment explained about six times more variance in juvenile anti-social traits than in adult traits. Shared environmental influences on adult antisocial traits overlapped entirely with those on juvenile traits. Additive genetic factors explained about six times more variance in adult vs juvenile traits. The juvenile genetic determinants overlapped completely with genetic influences on adult traits. The unique environment (plus measurement error) explained the largest proportion of variance in both juvenile and adult antisocial traits. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics of the shared or family environment that promote antisocial behavior during childhood and early adolescence also promote later antisocial behavior, but to a much lesser extent. Genetic causal factors are much more prominent for adult than for juvenile antisocial traits."
19241491,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: As a first step in planning interventions to promote exercise in rural breast cancer survivors (BCS), we sought to determine the exercise preferences of rural BCS and to identify the major determinants of these preferences. METHODS: Self-administered mail survey to a population-based sample from a state cancer registry. RESULTS: Among the 483 respondents, 96% were White with mean education of 13+/-2.5 years and mean months since diagnosis of 39.0+/-21.5. Only 19% reported >or=150 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. Although up to half were open to various counseling options, the most popular options were counseling after treatment (36%), face-to-face (47%), and from an exercise specialist (40%). Rural BCS preferred home-based (63%), unsupervised (47%), moderate intensity exercise (65%) that was primarily walking. The strongest preference correlates include higher education with exercise specialist, higher environment score with outdoors, more comorbidities with low intensity and counseling after cancer treatment, higher social support with exercising with friends or family, sedentary or insufficient physical activity with low intensity, and lower household income with preferring supervised exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions designed to promote exercise among rural BCS are needed. Such interventions should consider the environmental aspects of this population and include multiple options based on the preferences of targeted subgroups."
12014467,0,a,"The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA) mandates policies designed to increase the frequency and speed with which permanency is achieved for children in the child welfare system. ASFA's focus is on child safety, permanency, and well-being. The expectation that parents correct neglectful conditions within specified time frames places an increased ethical responsibility on child welfare staff. Carrying out this responsibility requires vigorous and innovative approaches to engaging and working with neglectful families. Drawing on a well-established conceptual framework for understanding the determinants of effective parenting, the authors derive the ENGAGE (Engagement, Needs assessment, Goal setting, Assessment of progress, Goal achievement, Ending work) model for achieving permanency within the policy structure. The model incorporates creative client engagement, assessment of family needs, mutual goal setting, the goal achievement process, termination, and aftercare."
8203689,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study addresses the question of whether inequalities in premature mortality related to educational level differ among countries. METHODS: Data on mortality by educational level were obtained from longitudinal studies from nine industrialized countries. The data referred to men between 35 and 64 years of age. The follow-up periods occurred between 1970 and 1982. The size of mortality differences associated with educational level was measured by means of two inequality indices, both based on Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: Inequalities in mortality are relatively small in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway and about two times as large in the United States, France, and Italy. Finland and England and Wales occupy intermediate positions. The large inequalities in mortality in the United States and France can be attributed in part to large inequalities in education in these countries. CONCLUSIONS: The international pattern found in this study was also observed in a comparison that used occupation as the socioeconomic indicator. Differences between countries in levels of inequality in mortality may be partially explained by the countries' different levels of egalitarian social and economic policies."
17176242,0,a,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: Food insecurity, now listed among the social determinants of health, compromises the health and well-being of affected Australians. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of food insecurity within an urban population of social disadvantage in readiness for a local health promotion response. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey conducted in three disadvantaged locations of south-western Sydney. Prevalence of food insecurity was assessed using both the 16-item US Household Food Security Survey Module and the single-item question previously used in national Australian health surveys. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between food insecurity and socio-demographic characteristics of the households. RESULTS: The 16-item US tool yielded a significantly higher food insecurity prevalence (21.9%, 95% CI 20.0-23.8) than the single-item Australian tool (15.8%, 95% CI 14.1-17.5). Compared with the former, the single-item Australian tool has high specificity (96%) yet low sensitivity (56.9%). In our three sites, food insecurity was strongly and independently associated with household capacity to save money (AOR=5.05). Local fruit and vegetable production (83.8%), nutrition education (83.9%), transport to food outlets (81.5%) and better public transport overall (76.3%) were most highly rated by 'food insecure' households as useful future strategies. CONCLUSION: The higher sensitivity of the US 16-item food security survey module relative to the single-item Australian tool indicates its potential for use in future Australian surveys of food insecurity."
11804992,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although there is evidence that emotionally stressful behavior can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis, there is less data to support the notion that affiliative social behavior can slow disease progression. The present study examines the influence of social environment on the progression of atherosclerosis in the Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit, a model that spontaneously develops lesions because of a genetic defect in lipoprotein clearance. METHODS AND RESULTS: WHHL rabbits were assigned to 1 of 3 social or behavioral groups: an unstable group, in which unfamiliar rabbits were paired daily, with the pairing switched each week; a stable group, in which littermates were paired daily for the entire study; and an individually caged group. The stable group exhibited more affiliative social behavior and less agonistic behavior than the unstable group and significantly less aortic atherosclerosis than each of the other 2 groups. Although the unstable and individually caged groups had comparable aortic lesion areas, the severity of the disease progressed faster in the unstable group, as indexed by a larger area of calcification and increased fibrous cap thickness in complex lesions. The unstable group showed increased agonistic behavior and signs of chronic adrenocortical and gonadal activation, whereas the individually caged group was relatively sedentary, had low glucocorticoid levels, and was hyperinsulinemic compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that social environment can slow, as well as accelerate, the progression of atherosclerosis. It also emphasizes the importance of behavioral factors in atherogenesis, even in a model of disease with strong genetic determinants."
9785696,1,a,"Sexual activity among high-school-aged youths has steadily increased since the 1970s, emerging as a significant public health concern. Yet, patterns of youth sexual risk behavior are shaped by social class, race, and gender. Based on sociological theories of financial deprivation and collective socialization, we develop and test a model of the relationships among neighborhood poverty; family structure and social class position; parental involvement; prosocial activities; race; and gender as they predict youth sexual risk behavior. We employ structural equation modeling to test this model on a cross-sectional sample of 370 sexually active high-school students from a midwestern city; 57 percent (n = 209) are males and 86 percent are African American. We find that family structure indirectly predicts sexual risk behavior through neighborhood poverty, parental involvement, and prosocial activities. In addition, family class position indirectly predicts sexual risk behavior through neighborhood poverty and prosocial activities. We address implications for theory and health promotion."
17488752,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Extremely high rates of mortality and morbidity have been reported among people with intellectual disabilities. Virtually no research has addressed the potential social determinants of health status within this very vulnerable population. METHOD: Cross-sectional survey of self-reported health status and indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage and social connectedness in 1273 English adults with mild or moderate intellectual disabilities. RESULTS: Indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage accounted for a statistically significant proportion of variation in health status, over and above any variation attributable to the personal characteristics and living circumstances of participants. Indicators of social participation and networks did not add to the explanatory power of the model. Among the indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage, hardship was more strongly associated with variation in health status than either employment status or area-level deprivation. CONCLUSION: As in the general population, self-reported health was associated with indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage, especially hardship. In contrast, there was no evidence of any association between health status and social participation and networks."
16403215,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination rates among adults 65 years and older or less than 65 years with high risk medical conditions are still below Healthy People 2010 recommended levels of 90%. This study was designed to: 1) assess self-reported pneumococcal vaccination rates following health center level interventions to increase adult vaccination rates; and 2) determine factors associated with vaccination. METHODS: Tailored interventions to increase immunizations were implemented at two inner-city health centers. We surveyed 375 patients 50 years of age and older. Multivariate logistic regression examines the predictors of 1) self-reported pneumococcal vaccination and 2) combined self-reported influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. Both of these models were stratified by age group (50-64 years and 65 years and older). RESULTS: Pneumococcal vaccination rates were 45% by self-report, 55% by medical record review, 69% for patients 65 years old and older, 32% for patients 50-64 years; they did not differ by race. Receipt of the previous season's influenza vaccine was significantly related to pneumococcal vaccination among both younger and older patients. Receiving both the pneumococcal vaccine and the most recent influenza vaccine compared with receiving neither, among younger patients was related to unemployment, more frequent physician visits, and belief that those who do not receive the flu shot are more susceptible to the flu. For older patients, receipt of both vaccines was related to nonsmoking status, believing that friends/family think the patient should be vaccinated, seeing posters advertising flu shot clinics, and belief that those who do not receive the flu shot are more susceptible to the flu. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that improving overall pneumococcal vaccination rates among eligible adults, has the potential to eliminate racial disparities. Interventions delivering vaccination messages specific to older and younger adult groups may be the best strategy for improving adult vaccination rates."
18198004,0,a,"This paper examines factors that may predispose unmarried and unemployed out-of-school youth to risky sexual behaviour. Data for analysis were derived from the Behaviour Surveillance Survey carried out in Kenya in late 2002. A total of 6129 male and female unmarried and unemployed out-of-school youth in the age range 15-24 years were successfully interviewed. However, for this paper only a sample of 3961 comprising sexually experienced youth in the 12 months preceding the survey was used. Methods of analysis included descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression. Results for males indicate that factors associated with low and high risk were whether they had fathered a child, district of residence and frequency of alcohol use, while current age and age at first sexual debut stood out for those with low risk alone. For females the district of residence and age of partner at sexual debut were the factors that predisposed them to low-risk sexual behaviour, while for high risk the district of residence, current age and ever being pregnant were significant. The results indicate that for these youth, contextual and probably social factors appear to be the main determinants of risky sexual behaviour for both males and females. The findings also support those of other studies that link risky sexual behaviour among youth, especially males, to alcohol consumption. Programmes for intervention therefore need to focus on these aspects. There is also a need for studies that can look at district-specific factors for more focused interventions."
7785474,1,a,"This study followed 592 alcoholics (180 women and 412 men) after discharge from inpatient treatment. Multiple measures of treatment outcome were used to broaden our understanding of the process of recovery from alcohol abuse, and how that process differs for men and women. Patients were interviewed by telephone between 3 and 15 months after discharge to gather information about post-treatment experiences including: relationship with family, role performance, psychological impairment, and effort toward recovery. Additionally, if any alcohol use took place after treatment, information was collected about the pattern of alcohol consumption. Results indicated being married is consistently related to less drinking for men, while for women, being married contributes to relapse in the short term. The determinants of each measure of outcome were different for women and men, indicating that the process of recovery is not the same for both genders. The study confirms that drinking is related to other adverse outcomes for men, but not necessarily for women. It is evidence that women and men have different post-treatment functioning, and that different characteristics are predictive of these outcomes."
8241491,1,a,"The study evaluates the extend to which West German company doctors reported that they carried out the workplace related activities as required by the German Work Security Law 'ASiG'. Postal questionnaires were completed by 502 of West German company doctors. About one third of those who responded, reported that they carried out the requirements of the German Work Safety Law with regard to workplace-related prevention. Multivariate analysis was applied to discover the factors that influenced compliance. We conclude that investment in supply-side factors (doctors' qualifications, experiences and recourses) are not enough to bring about compliance. More important are the demand-side regulations which directly address the health and safety culture of the companies."
9748791,1,a,"In spite of the 30-year experience in the use of methadone in heroin addicts, there is no consensus about the value of that method. In view of the opinion that resistance to methadone treatment is partly caused by ignorance, the aim of this paper is to improve the knowledge about the method. The paper offers explanation of: (1) metabolic basis of heroin addiction, (2) methadone pharmacology, (3) psychosocial aspects of the addiction, (4) methadone treatment procedure, (5) aims and (6) results of the treatment. A demand for designing the treatment program on the basis of expert knowledge rather than on political and moral judgments is stressed. Topics in program organization are described: indications, daily dosage and its administration, treatment duration, professional job-sharing and control of the treatment. A review of medical goals--individual-oriented and social-oriented goals of the treatment is made. ""Therapeutic milieu"", as well as treatment dose and treatment duration have been recognized as the main determinants of the outcome. Evaluation criteria and treatment have been elaborated as potential basis for further research."
12347234,1,a,"""The paper examines the determinants of high bridewealth in the east-central states of Nigeria, inhabited by the Igbo, and relates high bridewealth to rising age at marriage among both men and women. High and rising bridewealth in Igboland is associated with the prevailing economic situation, socio-economic status of bride's parents, raising incidence of self-selection of marital partners in place of arranged marriages, and particularly increasing female education.... Rising age at marriage in Igboland cannot be understood only on the basis of increasing urbanization, female education and employment opportunities, but also on the basis of rising bridewealth which reduces the tempo of marriage....The study ends with an investigation of the determinants of marital fertility through the use of a causal model that includes bridewealth, age at marriage and other socio-economic variables.""

8923653,1,a,"The fertility decline that began in Bangladesh in the late 1980s and continues has prompted diverse theories to explain it. In this qualitative analysis of 21 focus-group sessions with rural women ranging in age from the teens to late 40s and living in the villages of the Matlab area, the women's perceptions of their changing society and of the influence of the family planning program are examined. The women's statements reveal their awareness of the social and economic transition they are undergoing and their interest in family-size limitation, which is bolstered by a strong family planning program. Although the shifts in economic and social circumstances are not large, in conjunction with the strong family planning program they constitute a powerful force for change in attitudes, ideas, and behavior among these women."
2014871,1,a,"Previous studies of the relationship between cancer stage, age, and race have not controlled for social class and health care setting. Logistic regression analyses, using information from the New York State Tumor Registry and area-level social class indicators, demonstrated that, in New York City, older Black, lower class women in public hospitals were 3.75 and 2.54 times more likely to have late stage breast or cervical cancer, respectively, than were younger White, high social class women in non-public hospitals."
9183339,1,a,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke represents a major economic challenge to society. The direct cost of stroke is largely determined by the duration of hospital stay, but internationally applicable estimates of the direct cost of acute stroke care and rehabilitation on cost-efficient stroke units are not available. Information regarding social and medical factors influencing the length of hospital stay (LOHS) and thereby cost is needed to direct cost-reducing efforts. METHODS: We determined the direct cost of stroke in the prospective, consecutive, and community-based stroke population of the Copenhagen Stroke Study by measuring the total LOHS in the 1197 acute stroke patients included in the study. All patients had all their acute care and rehabilitation on a dedicated stroke unit. Neurological impairment was measured by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale. Local nonmedical factors affecting the LOHS, such as waiting time for discharge to a nursing home after completed rehabilitation, were accounted for in the analysis. The influence of social and medical factors on the LOHS was analyzed in a multiple linear regression model. RESULTS: The average LOHS was 27.1 days (SD, 44.1; range, 1 to 193), corresponding to a direct cost of $12.150 per patient including all acute care and rehabilitation. The LOHS increased with increasing stroke severity (6 days per 10-point increase in severity; P < .0001) and single marital status (3.4 days; P = .02). Death reduced LOHS (22.0 days; P < .0001). Age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, claudication, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, former stroke, other disabling comorbidity, smoking, daily alcohol consumption, and the type of stroke (hemorrhage/infarct) had no independent influence on LOHS. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care and rehabilitation of unselected patients on a dedicated stroke unit takes on average 4 weeks. In general, comorbidity such as diabetes or heart disease does not increase LOHS. Efforts to reduce costs should therefore aim at reducing initial stroke severity or improving the rate of recovery."
1460172,1,a,"The association of knowledge of health risks, living arrangements, and perceived stress with health-risk behaviors was examined in a sample of college students included in the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Supplement of the National Health Interview Survey. Regressions of each health-risk behavior (dependent variable) were performed on the predicted correlates. Although knowledge was not associated with participation in physical activity or smoking, the study found that students who knew more about the harmful effects of alcohol drank less, and those with greater knowledge of health risks practiced fewer risky behaviors. Students living independently were more likely to smoke, and those living in residence halls were less like to do so. Drinking, however, was more common among students living in residence halls or independently than among those living at home. Hall residents engaged in more group physical activity than other students did, but their physical activity was unrelated to health-risk behaviors. Stress was associated with smoking but not with other health practices. The findings suggest that smoking may be less influenced by health knowledge and more associated than drinking is with a response to stress. Drinking appears to be a social activity associated with living among peers and is potentially modifiable by increased knowledge about the effects of alcohol on health."
1941951,1,a,"Health care systems, irrespective of how they are financed, present the paradox that to some observers they appear as a major component of social benefits, while to other observers they seem both excessively costly and limited in their effectiveness. These differing perceptions may be explained in part by the diversity of the determinants of health and disease, only some of which are amenable to those preventive or therapeutic measures encompassed in a health care system--the majority of determinants being genetic, societal, or else uninfluenced by those interventions at present available within a health service. The share of national resources which should be devoted to health care, and the method of raising resources, are primarily matters for political decision; but a national system has advantages both of economy and of comprehensiveness. But when it comes to allocation of resources within the established health budget, the knowledge and skills of health professionals are essential to informed decision-making. The possibilities depend critically on the 'state of the art' at a given time, as is illustrated by the radical changes over time in what could be done for patients with renal failure; and health professionals are likely to be most aware of current options, and of how to choose between them. More speculatively, they are also less likely to confuse the attitudes appropriate to providing a service with those required to run a business."
17522961,0,a,"The pattern of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has changed significantly with the emerging predominance of elderly patients. Age is no longer seen as a contraindication to dialysis. Based on 2004 data, in the USA, patients aged 45-64 years old comprise the largest portion of the incident population, while patients aged 75 and older have the highest incident rates of ESRD. Mortality is higher among the elderly dialysis patients for whom cardiovascular diseases and infections are the most common causes of death. The quality of life (QoL) of these patients has been found to vary in different investigations, dependent on such factors as the investigator(s), the composition of the study group and the criteria used, among others; however, age was always found one of the major determinants of their QoL. Quality-of-life data suggest that older dialysis patients have similar levels of social functioning and mental health as younger dialysis patients but that their level of physical functioning is poorer. As such, the survival and QoL of elderly patients depends mainly on the severity of the comorbid conditions. The rationing of dialysis on the basis of age alone is not justified as dialysis can provide elderly patients with the means to gain the health status that permits them to enjoy life, but in their own way."
15230050,0,a,"Atherosclerosis is a common disease in parrots. The disease is found in all common parrot species, but especially in African Grey parrots and Amazons. It is a disease of older birds that is seen in both males and females. The most common sign is sudden death, but clinical symptoms that can be found include dyspnea, lethargy and nervous signs, such as paresis and collapses. Because the clinical signs are seldomly seen, it is difficult to diagnose atherosclerosis and therefore it is mostly an unexpected finding at necropsy. Age and species are determinants of atherosclerosis in parrots. Suggested risk factors include an elevated plasma cholesterol level, diet composition, social stress and inactivity, but research is needed to confirm this."
10606101,1,a,"Extending past work testing goal perspective theory in sport, one purpose of this study was to examine, via a longitudinal design, the relationship of goal orientations to the beliefs about the causes of success in the case of elite male Dutch soccer players. A second purpose was to determine the relationship of goals and beliefs to ratings of performance. Seventy-five male pupils representing five teams from an internationally renowned soccer school in The Netherlands completed the TEOSQ and a measure of their perceptions of the determinants of success in soccer at the onset and conclusion of one season. Assessments of the coaches' appraisal and athletes' self-reported performance in soccer were carried out at the same time. In line with other studies, a positive association between ego orientation and the belief that ability or innate talent are determinants of success was revealed. Task orientation was linked to the beliefs that effort, team play, and parental support contribute to achievement in soccer. An increase in skilled performance over the season (as appraised by the coach) corresponded to a stronger task orientation and the beliefs that soccer success stems from hard work and having supportive parents."
8909379,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease is predicted to become the commonest cause of death in india within 15 years People from India living overseas already have high rates of the disease that are not explained by known coronary risk factors. Small size at birth is a newly described risk factor for coronary heart disease, but associations between size at birth and the disease have not been examined in India. METHODS: We studied 517 men and women who were born between 1934 and 1954 in a mission hospital in Mysore, South India, and who still lived near to the hospital. We related the prevalence of coronary heart disease, defined by standard criteria, to their birth size. FINDINGS: 25 (9%) men and 27 (11%) women had coronary heart disease. Low birthweight, short birth length, and small head circumference at birth were associated with a raised prevalence of the disease. Prevalence fell from 11% in people whose birthweights were 5.5 lb (2.5 kg) or less to 3% in those whose birthweights were more than 7 lb (3.1 kg), p for trend = 0.09. The trends were stronger and statistically significant among people aged 45 years and over (p = 0.03 for birthweight, 0.04 for length, and 0.02 for head circumference). High rates of disease were also found in those whose mothers had a low body weight during pregnancy. The highest prevalence of the disease (20%) was in people who weighted 5.5 lb (2.5 kg) or less at birth and whose mothers weighted less than 100 lb (45 kg) in pregnancy. These associations were largely independent of known coronary risk factors. INTERPRETATION: In India, as in the UK, coronary heart disease is associated with small size at birth, suggesting that its pathogenesis is influenced by events in utero. The association with low maternal bodyweight is further evidence that the disease originates through fetal undernutrition. Prevention of the rising epidemic of the disease in India may require improvements in the nutrition and health of young women."
12474412,0,a,"The economic analysis of efficiency of investment in health care and health at large by means of cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness techniques is the subject of implementation work in a number of countries. Poland's integration with the countries of the European Union justifies the need to understand and to use economic analyses. Unfortunately, these activities encounter many methodological and executive barriers. The investments in workers' health are not only investments in health care and the improvement of working conditions, but also in compensations, including financial ones, resulting from adverse effects of factors influencing the health of working population. The financial reporting system that exists in Poland does not ensure the possibility of full presentation of the aggregated data on the financing of activities for workers' health and diminishing of the adverse effects of factors present in the work environment. The information on the outcome of the investments in workers' health come from different sources, which means that it applies to different groups subjected to the analysis. The problem lies not only in the assessment of profitability of health investments but also in the social problem of the division of the resultant costs and benefits among various branches of the national economy. Therefore, the analyses involving mutual relations between individual sectors that invest in workers' health and those that bear consequences is essential in the terms of economic analyses. The authors present the determinants of economic evaluation in regard to health of working population in Poland."
11398960,0,a,"Until there is an effective vaccine, changing sexual behavior (e.g., use of condoms or fewer partners) is still the only course of action that can slow the spread of HIV for most Africans. But exactly which factors influence behavior change and how are still debated. This article examines the notion that as the HIV/AIDS epidemic strengthens and spreads through communities in Africa, and mortality mounts, behaviors that prevent transmission should be changing. We focus on men in three countries--Uganda, Kenya, and Zambia--examining determinants of their behavior change, and analyze the relative importance of knowing someone who has died of AIDS as compared with other factors such as age, education level, knowledge of HIV/AIDS, economic status, and marital status. Data from three DHS surveys in Uganda (1995), Zambia (1996), and Kenya (1998) are fitted to a model predicting behavior change. Results from this cross-sectional, multinational study suggest that married and working men aged 20-40 are significantly more likely to have changed their behavior. Personal experience of AIDS is a significant predictor of behavior change in Uganda and Zambia, and is marginally significant in Kenya. One implication in the context of the epidemic is that behavior change is partly determined by the high level of mortality experienced by African communities. A second implication is that higher levels of disclosure, or lower levels of denial of AIDS as a cause of death, may help individuals change their behavior."
7792367,1,a,"This paper discusses minor psychiatric morbidity in the community and its relation to help-seeking. The research is aimed at identifying the demographic and social characteristics that enhance the likelihood of minor psychiatric morbidity, as measured by the General Health Questionnaire, and to reveal how these determinants relate to health status. In the second stage of the study, the same characteristics are related to their effect on the decision to decision to consult a general practitioner and, specifically, on presenting psycho-social problems to the GP. At the population level, the likelihood of a high GHQ score was greater for women, divorced persons and the unemployed, other variables remaining equal. However, GHQ score was contaminated by poor subjective health perception, especially for unemployed persons. Chronic physical illness did not have an independent effect on the GHQ score. Chronic physical illness did influence help-seeking. In addition, several socio-demographic characteristics showed an independent effect on consulting behaviour for both GHQ-positive and GHQ-negative patients. Women, unemployed persons and publicly insured patients with a minor psychiatric disturbance were more apt to visit their GP, regardless of their physical health status. However, no socio-demographic characteristics increased the likelihood that a GHQ-positive patient would present unambiguous psycho-social complaints as a reason to see their doctor."
8907736,1,a,"This study examined both the content of school district programs related to sexual orientation, and the social and political determinants of these school programs. Data were collected from districts within all 126 U.S. communities with legal protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and from a random sample of 129 U.S. jurisdictions without such legislation. Results showed that most school districts are not offering recommended program elements related to sexual orientation issues. Districts within localities with gay rights protection are doing more than those without. Although compositional factors account for some of the differences in educational efforts, a politically engaged constituency also made a major difference in school district efforts. To the extent that gays and lesbians served in local public office and mobilized to influence school elections, they were able to affect school programs and policies."
9220563,1,a,"While many works compare traits of homeless adults across levels of alcohol use, few specifically consider whether drinking status affects determinants of either homelessness or ""vulnerability"" to homelessness. This paper relies on a 1986 Chicago, Illinois sample (n = 535) to consider the potential contributions of resources, social network characteristics, disaffiliation, and mental health problems. Results suggest that resource problems may determine homelessness regardless of drinking status. But drinking-associated problems may raise the resource threshold for ""vulnerability,"" reduce the protection afforded by social networks against both homelessness and ""vulnerability,"" increase the deleterious impact of disaffiliation, and spur complicating mental health problems."
10573234,1,a,"Living conditions in eastern Germany have changed rapidly since unification in 1990 and little is known about how these changes affect the prevalence of atopic diseases. This study describes methods and prevalences of a large epidemiological project investigating determinants of childhood asthma and allergies in eastern (Dresden and Leipzig) and western (Munich) Germany in 1995/1996. Community based random samples of 9-11 yr old children in Dresden (n=3,017) and Munich (n=2,612), and of 5-7 yr old children in Dresden (n=3,300), Leipzig (n=3,167) and Munich (n=2,165) were studied by parental questionnaires, bronchial challenges with hypertonic saline, skin examination, skin-prick tests, and measurements of specific and total serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E using Phase II modules of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). In 9-11 yr old children, the prevalence of physician diagnosed asthma (7.9% versus 10.3%; p<0.01) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (15.7% versus 19.9%; p<0.05) was lower in Dresden than in Munich. No difference between Munich and Dresden was observed in the prevalence of diagnosed hay fever, skin test reactivity to > or = 1 allergen, and increased levels (>0.35 kU x L(-1)) of specific IgE against inhalant and food allergens. Symptoms and visible signs of atopic eczema tended to be more prevalent in Dresden. Similar East-West differences between the three study areas were seen in the younger age group. These findings are in line with recently observed increases in the prevalence of hay fever and atopic sensitization, but not of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, among 9-11 yr old children in Leipzig."
12319425,1,a,"""In this paper we examined the interdistrict variations in mean age at marriage of males and females in Karnataka [India] in two points of time, 1971 and 1981, and also the possible factors influencing this variation....A multivariate analysis of the determinants of mean age at marriage in Karnataka showed that literacy rate, sex ratio of the population and percentage of villages electrified are important in explaining the regional and time variation in age at marriage of both sexes.... Our regression results indicated that a 10 per cent increase in female literacy rate is associated with approximately one-year increase in female age at marriage. However, neither the increase in female literacy nor the changes in the sex ratio of the population could explain all the increase in female age at marriage during 1971-81. This indirectly suggests that there was an increase in female age at marriage among all socio-economic groups."""
18442431,0,a,"The aim of this paper is to assess the spatial distribution of nutritional status of children of less than three years through Z-scores of weight-for-age, height-for-age and weight-for-height using data collected by the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2, 1998-99), India. The nutritional status of pre-school children was regressed on different socio-demographic factors after eliminating the effect of age. The data show that there are gender differences and spatial variations in the nutritional status of children in India. Gender difference is not very pronounced and almost disappears when the effects of age and socio-demographic variables are removed. The spatial difference, especially the rural-urban difference, was found to be very large and decreased substantially when the effects of age and socioeconomic variables were removed. However, the differences were not close to zero. All the variables were found to affect significantly the nutritional status of children. However, the literacy of mothers did not affect height-for-age significantly. The weight-for-age and height-for-age scores showed a dismal picture of the health condition of children in almost all states in India. The worst affected states are Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh. Assam and Rajasthans are also lagging behind. Weight-for-height scores do not give a clear picture of state-wise variation. Goa, Kerala and Punjab are the three most developed states in India and also have the lowest percentages of underweight children according to the Z-scores. Along with these three states come the north-eastern states where women are well educated. Thus overall development, enhancement of level of education and low gender inequality are the key factors for improvement in the health status of Indian children."
11020935,0,a,"In Bangladesh, the total fertility rate declined from more than six children per woman of reproductive age in 1980 to 3.3 children per woman in 1996. Much discussion has ensued about the circumstances responsible for this decline and, in particular, about the contribution made by the national family planning program. For this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with 67 women concerning the factors influencing their reproductive behavior. The participants, residents of a rural area in southwestern Bangladesh, consisted of two groups: women who were currently practicing family planning and women who had never practiced or had not done so for at least four years. The findings suggest that the family planning program has played an important role in reducing family size, but also indicate that economic and social changes, and especially growing aspirations (particularly for a life outside agriculture) have combined with changes in the nature of family decision making to make couples more receptive to the idea of family planning."
11081011,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants of mental and physical health as a function of disease state in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A sample of 129 SLE patients (mean age 42.01 years; SD 11.09) was recruited from 9 immunology/rheumatology clinics across Canada. Patients completed questionnaires assessing psychological distress, social support, coping, stress, and health-related quality of life. Physicians rated disease activity (using the revised Systemic Lupus Activity Measure; SLAM-R) and damage (using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index). Mental and physical health composite scores were derived from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36. Patients were subdivided into more active (SLAM-R > or = 10; n = 38) or less active disease states (n = 91). RESULTS: Better mental health was predicted by more education and less emotion-oriented coping in the patients in a more active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.46). Better mental health was predicted by less stress, less emotion-oriented coping and more task-oriented coping in patients during a less active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.45). Better physical health was predicted by more emotion-oriented coping in patients in a more active disease state (P = 0.04; R2 = 0.11). Better physical health was predicted by less stress and younger age in patients during a less active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.20). CONCLUSION: The positive association between emotion-oriented coping and better physical health in patients during a more active disease state suggests that this style of coping may be more adaptive in situations that are considered uncontrollable (e.g., SLE flare). Predictors of mental health were similar to those found in the literature, especially for SLE patients in a less active disease state."
8074943,1,a,"A comparison of sex differential mortality rates indicates that women are at increased risk in several countries of Asia, in part due to less access to a variety of services and lower priority for food than their male siblings. Poorer nutritional status becomes apparent during adolescence, with a delay in maturation which may have repercussions for subsequent ability of the biologically immature woman to carry through a normal pregnancy. There is a dearth of information on girls during this vulnerable period of life which is recently being corrected by studies in Nepal, India and the Philippines where the magnitude of dietary risk is being compared with its impact on nutritional status and the sociocultural factors that may be responsible."
2065639,1,a,"Total and domestic (discretionary) consumption of salt was assessed in a sample of 91 households, which were randomly selected in three areas of Italy characterized by different dietary habits. Total salt intake was estimated by the mean urinary sodium in four 24 h collections. Discretionary salt, added during the preparation of the meals or at the table, was assessed using a simplified protocol of the lithium marker technique. Total sodium excretion was 191 mmol/d, 160 mmol/d and 132 mmol/d in adult males, adult females and children respectively. Dietary sodium density was 15 mmol per MJ of energy in children and 19 mmol/MJ in adults. It was significantly lower in the area where the traditional consumption of unsalted bread persists. Discretionary sodium intake was 67 mmol/d in adult males and females and 43 mmol/d in children; equivalent respectively to 36 per cent, 39 per cent and 34 per cent of total sodium intake. No difference was found between urban and rural environments, whereas discretionary use of salt was higher in the lower social class. These findings have important nutrition policy implications for the lowering of salt intake in the general population."
11048582,0,a,"Aiming to analyze the mild to moderate growth retardation associate factors in children at school age, a case control study was conducted with 153 pairs of seven and eight years old children from public schools of the outskirts of the city. The cases were defined as children with a height for age(H/A) between -1 and -2 Z score, according to NCHS/WHO standards, and matched with a H/A +/- 0.5 Z-score children of same age, gender, school, classroom and class time, as controls. The height was measured at school according to WHO rules by trained professionals, and household visits were carried out to obtain environmental and socio-economic data. Initially the data was analyzed by the univariate conditional method and then, the statistically significant variables were included in a model of multivariate logistic regression analysis. As a result, the risk factors remaining at the end of the multivariate analyses, by Odds Ratio and it's 95% Confidence Interval were respectively:--mother's height: for each decrease of one standard deviation the OR increased 1.84(CI: 1.35 to 2.49); inadequate feeding pattern: OR = 2.12; CI: 1.17 to 3.83, very low socio-economic level: OR = 9.2; CI: 3.35 to 25.13, low birth weight: OR = 2.59; CI: 1.44 to 4.63 and smoking during pregnancy: OR = 1.75; CI: 0.98 to 3.12. These results highlight the environment as a determinant factor for growth performance during the first years of the child's life. Despite this, the significant OR for Mother's height allows the assumption that besides the environment, the parent's height has to be considered as one of the determinants of height deficit, even for the low socioeconomic level."

The multiracial categories used here are derived from youths' reports of their own and their parents' race(s). Comparisons are made within groups of multiracial respondents who make different choices among single-race categories. Results show differences between subgroups in strength and importance of ethnic identity, self-esteem, and perceptions of ethnic discrimination. Multinomial logistic regression shows further that physiognomy, ethnic identity, and race of coresident parent(s) are significantly associated with reported race. Also related to racial identification among part-Hispanic youth are the racial distribution and socioeconomic status of their neighborhoods and the racial distributions of their schools."
16948157,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A significant and growing number of people work long hours. Research examining impacts is limited, but raises concerns about risks to the worker, the family, the employer, and the community. The purpose of this report, which is authored by the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) Long Work Hours Team, is to motivate and guide future research by proposing a framework for studying long work hours and discussing research gaps. METHODS: The NORA Long Work Hours Team examined research reports and literature reviews, and gathered input from a conference on long work hours organized by the Team and faculty from University of Maryland. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A framework is proposed for long work hours, including determinants, outcomes, and moderating factors of long work hours, suggesting that studies need to include more clear and complete descriptions of work schedules, worker characteristics, and the work environment, and need to consider a wider range of possible health, safety, social and economic outcomes for workers, families, employers, and the community. Additional studies are needed on vulnerable employee groups and those critical to public safety. More studies are also needed to develop interventions and test their effectiveness."
14717564,0,a,"This paper aims at articulating a conceptual framework for monitoring equity in health and healthcare. The focus is on four main questions: What is health equity? What is monitoring? What are the essential components of a system for monitoring health equity? and Why monitor health equity? Monitoring equity in health and healthcare requires comparing indicators of health and its social determinants among social groups with different levels of underlying social advantage, i.e. groups who occupy different positions in a social hierarchy. A framework is presented for formulating the key questions, defining the social groups to be compared, and selecting the health indicators and measures of disparity that are fundamental to monitoring health equity. Although monitoring health equity is a scientific endeavour, its fundamental objective is guided by values; technical challenges should be addressed as part of a broader strategy to confront the political obstacles to greater equity."
14746119,0,a,"The purpose of this study was to examine individual determinants of use of publicly funded home-care nursing and housework assistance by Canadians 18 years and older from 1994 to 1999. Andersen and Newman's Behavioural Model of Health Services Use guided the selection of variables, analyses, and interpretation of the findings. Descriptive, correlation, and multiple logistic regression analyses were completed in each of the first 3 cross-sectional cycles of Statistics Canada's National Population Health Surveys. The determinants of use of housework assistance were older age, female, living alone, lower income, activity restriction, needing help with housework, not hospitalized in the previous year, and having at least 1 chronic condition. The determinants for home nursing tended to be the opposite of those for housework assistance. Between 1994 and 1999, use of housework assistance appeared to decrease and use of nursing services appeared to remain relatively stable.

DESIGN: Base-line data from the Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health (BIRNH) study (1979-1984). SUBJECTS: A total of 5837 men and 5243 women aged 25-74y were included in the analysis. The sample was considered representative of the Belgian population. MEASUREMENTS: Using the body mass index (BMI) as the criterion, obesity was defined as a BMI> or =30 kg/m2. Nutritional data were assessed by a 24 h food record. Physical activity level (PAL) was calculated by dividing total caloric intake by an estimation of basal metabolic rate (BMR, predicted from gender, weight and age). Age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) of the prevalence of obesity were estimated by multilogistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Prevalence of obesity was 12.1% in men and 18.4% in women. In both sexes, prevalence of obesity increased gradually in each 10-year age category (P<0.0001) and steeply decreased with level of education. Comparing lowest (Q1) to highest quartile (Q4), after adjustment for age, prevalence of obesity decreased with total carbohydrate intake, as well as total sugar intake in both sexes, and increased with total fat intake only in men. Obesity increased with a high fat to sugar ratio (men: OR(Q4/Q1) = 1.56; confidence interval (CI): 1.25-1.93; women: OR(Q4/Q1) = 1.45; CI: 1.17-1.80). PAL was inversely and very strongly associated with obesity (men: OR(Q4/Q1) = 0.20; CI: 0.15-0.26; women: OR(Q4/Q1) = 0.18; CI: 0.14-0.23). The same associations were observed with the mean BMI. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that prevalence of obesity is particularly high in Belgium. Low level of education and reduced physical activity, increased fat intake and especially elevated fat to sugar ratio appear to be powerful determinants of obesity in this Belgian population."
12637842,0,a,"To determine the treatment preferences (, medication, counseling, or both) for victims of recent trauma at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder and the determinants of those choices, preferences were elicited from 466 consecutive victims of physical or sexual assault at an urban emergency department as part of the routine clinical evaluation by emergency department social workers. Demographics, assault characteristics, and clinical history were used to predict preference. More than 80% of victims expressed an interest in treatment, with more interested in counseling (76%) than medication (62%). Female gender and assaults of a sexual nature were most highly predictive of preference for medication, whereas female gender, sexual assault, a history of psychiatric treatment, and perceived life threat from the trauma were most predictive of preference for counseling and preference for any treatment. Because treatment preferences were easily obtained from assault victims seeking emergency care, the elicitation of these treatment preferences and the consideration of them in the treatment planning process could facilitate engagement in treatment and overcome the avoidance of treatment by some victims."
7652121,1,a,"A substantial body of research relates socioeconomic, behavioral, social, and psychological factors to the development and progression of a wide variety of diseases. The search for shared pathways that link these factors leads to the investigation of upstream determinants, as opposed to biologic pathways, but these have been little studied by biobehavioral researchers. Available data suggest that socioeconomic factors structure the development and maintenance of behavioral, social, and psychological factors; however, we know little of how this takes place. A consideration of the ways in which socioeconomic position influences the everyday texture of people's lives could advance our understanding of both macroeconomic and microeconomic influences on health, and lead to new, community-centric approaches to intervention. Such a research agenda would help to advance the scientific foundations for reducing the primary origins of disease, which are social and economic."
18777671,0,a,"There exists a lot of research on the reservation wages of the unemployed as a determinant of unemployment duration. Little is known about the reservation wages of those who are not in the labor force but might be potential labor force returnees, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries. The main objective of this article is to assess what can be learned from the subjective reservation wages of DI beneficiaries. Using the New Beneficiary Data System (NBDS), the article assesses the magnitudes of reservation wages compared to the last wage earned and the benefit amount, as well as the determinants of reservation wages in a regression framework. The NBDS is unique in that it provides the reservation wages and the work history of DI beneficiaries before and after joining the DI rolls. The article has several noteworthy results and policy implications: *Data show that a significant portion of beneficiaries report being likely to accept a job if offered one. Based on the NBDS, 13 percent of DI beneficiaries who did not work since joining the rolls in 1981-1982 reported in 1991 that they would be willing to work if offered a job and provided their reservation wages. *DI beneficiaries do not appear to price themselves out of the labor market. Half of them would want a wage that is 80 percent or less of the last wage earned before receiving DI. It is estimated that approximately 7 percent of long-term DI beneficiaries may potentially return-to-work if they search for jobs and have a wage offer distribution with a mean at 80 percent of their last wage. *The nonlabor income in addition to the benefit is positively and significantly associated with the reservation wage, while the benefit amount per se is not. However, this result needs to be treated with caution given that nonlabor income is endogenous to the model. *Heterogeneity exists between persons still under the DI program and those that have moved to the Old-Age program. The subsamples of persons who have shifted to the Old-Age program and those who are still under the DI program have median reservation wage to the last wage ratios of 0.69 and 0.93, respectively. A significantly lower reservation wage for persons who have moved to the Old-Age program was also found in a regression framework. This heterogeneity between the two groups may result in part from the different program characteristics both groups face, for instance, in terms of benefit termination and Medicare eligibility rules. *Subjective reservation wage data can be useful to study populations that are out of the labor force. This article is innovative in that it focuses on a group of persons who are typically considered as being out of the labor force, and therefore are not asked reservation wages in general household surveys such as the Current Population Survey. It would be of great interest to collect more reservation wage data for DI beneficiaries in a longitudinal data set to expand this analysis, for instance, to assess conclusively the effects of changing program characteristics on reservation wages and return-to-work outcomes as beneficiaries transition to the Old-Age program or as new return-to-work programs are put in place."

8654535,1,a,"Rats housed in an enriched environment allowing both social interaction and physical activity improve more than rats housed in standard laboratory cages after focal brain ischemia. To determine the relative importance of social and physical activity, rats that sustained ligation of the middle cerebral artery were kept in an enriched environment with opportunities for various activities (group A), housed together in the same size of cage as group A but with no activity-stimulating equipment (group B), or housed in individual cages with a running wheel (group C). There was no significant difference in infarct size between the groups. Limb placement, climbing, balance on an inclined plane, and ability to traverse a beam and a rotating pole were repeatedly tested 2-13 weeks after the operation. During the entire postoperative period, group A performed significantly better than group C in all tests and better than group B on the rotating pole. With time they also performed significantly better than group B in limb placement, climbing, and on the inclined plane. Group B performed significantly better than group C on the inclined plane and in climbing at all times, and by 13 weeks also in the limb placement test and on the beam. Thus, social interaction was superior to wheel-running but an enriched environment allowing free physical activity combined with social interaction resulted in the best performance."

19032747,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Air pollution and social characteristics have been shown to affect indicators of health. While use of spatial methods to estimate exposure to air pollution has increased the power to detect effects, questions have been raised about potential for confounding by social factors. METHODS: A study of singleton births in Eastern Massachusetts was conducted between 1996 and 2002 to examine the association between indicators of traffic, land use, individual and area-based socioeconomic measures (SEM), and birth outcomes (birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm births), in a two-level hierarchical model. RESULTS: We found effects of both individual (education, race, prenatal care index) and area-based (median household income) SEM with all birth outcomes. The associations for traffic and land use variables were mainly seen with birth weight, with an exception for an effect of cumulative traffic density on small for gestational age. Race/ethnicity of mother was an important predictor of birth outcomes and a strong confounder for both area-based SEM and indices of physical environment. The effects of traffic and land use differed by level of education and median household income. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings of the study suggested greater likelihood of reduced birth weight and preterm births among the more socially disadvantaged, and a greater risk of reduced birth weight associated with traffic exposures. Results revealed the importance of controlling simultaneously for SEM and environmental exposures as the way to better understand determinants of health."
16481310,0,a,"Research on the social determinants of health has demonstrated robust correlations between several social factors, health status, and life expectancy. Some of these factors could be modified through policy intervention. National-level public policies explicitly based on population health research are in various stages of development in many Western countries, but in spite of evident need, seemingly not at all in the United States. Because research shows such a strong association between education and good health, we offer evidence to show that at least two pressing problems in American society, namely the uneven distribution of educational attainment and health disparities linked to socioeconomic position, may be ameliorated through policy initiatives that link quality early childhood care, child development programs, and parental training in a seamless continuum with strengthened K-12 education."
17963491,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The fulfilment of expectations, labour pain, personal control and self-efficacy determine the postpartum evaluation of birth. However, researchers have seldom considered the multiple determinants in one analysis. To explore to what extent the results can be generalised between countries, we analyse data of Belgian and Dutch women. Although Belgium and the Netherlands share the same language, geography and political system and have a common history, their health care systems diverge. The Belgian maternity care system corresponds to the ideal type of the medical model, whereas the Dutch system approaches the midwifery model. In this paper we examine multiple determinants, the fulfilment of expectations, labour pain, personal control and self-efficacy, for their association with satisfaction with childbirth in a cross-national perspective. METHODS: Two questionnaires were filled out by 605 women, one at 30 weeks of pregnancy and one within the first 2 weeks after childbirth either at home or in a hospital. Of these, 560 questionnaires were usable for analysis. Women were invited to participate in the study by independent midwives and obstetricians during antenatal visits in 2004-2005. Satisfaction with childbirth was measured by the Mackey Satisfaction with Childbirth Rating Scale, which takes into account the multidimensional nature of the concept. Labour pain was rated retrospectively using Visual Analogue Scales. Personal control was assessed with the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire and Pearlin and Schooler's mastery scale. A hierarchical linear analysis was performed. RESULTS: Satisfaction with childbirth benefited most consistently from the fulfilment of expectations. In addition, the experience of personal control buffered the lowering impact of labour pain. Women with high self-efficacy showed more satisfaction with self-, midwife- and physician-related aspects of the birth experience. CONCLUSION: Our findings focus the attention toward personal control, self-efficacy and expectations about childbirth. This study confirms the multidimensionality of childbirth satisfaction and demonstrates that different factors predict the various dimensions of satisfaction. The model applies to both Belgian and Dutch women. Cross-national comparative research should further assess the dependence of the determinants of childbirth satisfaction on the organisation of maternity care."
18390845,0,a,"Schools are overloaded with health promotion programs that, altogether, focus on a broad array of behavioral domains, including substance abuse, sexuality and nutrition. Although the specific content of programs varies according to the domain focus, programs usually address similar concepts: knowledge, attitudinal beliefs, social influences and skills. This apparent conceptual overlap between behaviors and programs provides opportunities for a transfer-oriented approach which will stimulate students to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in one domain (e.g. skills for resisting tobacco use) to other domains (e.g. alcohol, sex). A requirement for such an approach is that behaviors share at least some determinants. This review addresses this issue by examining similarities between domain-specific determinants of smoking, drinking, safe sex and healthy nutrition among adolescents. Recent empirical studies and reviews were examined. The results show that the following determinants are relevant to all four behaviors: beliefs about immediate gratification and social advantages, peer norms, peer and parental modeling and refusal self-efficacy. Several other determinants have been found to relate to at least two behaviors, e.g. health risk beliefs and parental norms. These results can be used for the development of a transfer-oriented school health promotion curriculum."
9126524,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This paper discusses appropriate strategies for multivariate data analysis in epidemiological studies. METHODS: In studies where determinants of disease are sought, it is suggested that the complex hierarchical inter-relationships between these determinants are best managed through the use of conceptual frameworks. Failure to take these aspects into consideration is common in the epidemiological literature and leads to underestimation of the effects of distal determinants. RESULTS: An example of this analytical approach, which is not based purely on statistical associations, is given for assessing determinants of mortality due to diarrhoea in children. CONCLUSIONS: Conceptual frameworks provide guidance for the use of multivariate techniques and aid the interpretation of their results in the light of social and biological knowledge."

2126292,1,a,"A cross-sectional survey was done in the puerperium of 320 mothers who delivered at Ogun State University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Nigeria over a period of three months. The patients were stratified according to their parities in relation to their levels of formal education. The results showed that those with the least formal education were the most parous (p less than 0.005) and had the highest perinatal deaths. The difference between perinatal deaths suffered by mothers with no formal education and those with post-secondary school education was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). No association was demonstrated between the level of formal education and the delivery of low birthweight infants. When compared with grandmultiparae (parity greater than or equal to 5), primipara had more formal education (p less than 0.005). Therefore, for a successful implementation of the four-child policy in Nigeria, a concerted effort must be made to encourage maternal formal education. This should be to at least secondary school level."
10162860,1,a,"Occupational safety and health researchers seek to conduct effective cancer awareness campaigns to increase agricultural workers' skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Georgia undertook such a project using a social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) conceptual model, with its objectives focusing on personal determinants of and environmental influences on farmers' behavior. One underused strategy to increase the success of health campaigns, formative evaluation, was undertaken during year one of the demonstration project, with four goals. These included an assessment of: (1) the availability of societal resources to support farmers' practices, (2) the affordability for farmers to follow through with behaviors being promoted, (3) the social support for behaving in ways that reduce farmers' skin cancer risk, and (4) farmers' current knowledge, outcome expectations, and self-efficacy in this regard. Formative evaluation revealed an absence of information, products, services, and social support for farmers' skin cancer prevention and detection. As a result, the Georgia project's plan was refined to include specific activities aimed at increasing the environmental support for health promotion activities relating to farmers' skin cancer prevention and detection. These include a seminar for rural primary care physicians and public health nurses to increase knowledge and skills relating to conducting clinical skin exams; programs for agricultural extension agents, cotton scouts, and 4-H groups to provide opportunities to learn more about and practice sun safety; and a feed and seed store campaign."
2063828,1,a,"Commonly used measures of effect, such as risk ratios and odds ratios, may be quite biased when used to assess the effect of factors that alter transmission risks given exposure to infected individuals. This is demonstrated in a simulation model involving a higher-risk behavior and a lower-risk behavior affecting the sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. The bias arises because population contact patterns between higher-risk and lower-risk persons change their relative probabilities of exposure to an infected individual as an epidemic progresses. The assessment of contact patterns is thus central to risk assessment for contagious diseases. A new formulation of selective mixing presented here, together with a structured mixing specification of the social settings of contact, provides a theoretic framework for the investigation of contact pattern determinants."
18788702,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between the knowledge, social support, self-efficacy, appropriate environment, perceived barriers, and perceived benefits of physical activity and levels of physical activity. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A cross-sectional survey with multi-stage sampling was performed in a sample of 642 midlife women aged 40-59 years from Kalasin Province between June and July 2006. Physical activity was measured by interviewing and classified as active and inactive according to the national guidelines. They were also interviewed for general characteristics, factors of interest, and problems and needs for promoting physical activity. RESULTS: Forty seven percent of active physical activity was found in the midlife women. The women with moderate level of physical activity knowledge were more likely to be active than those with a low level of the knowledge (aOR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1, 2.6). The women who perceived high benefits of physical activity were more likely to be active than those with the moderate perceiving (aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.3, 2.4). CONCLUSION: These findings provided two determinants of the physical activity in rural midlife Thai women for planning the physical activity program."

To better integrate aspects of prevention and health promotion into the CCM, an enhanced version called the Expanded Chronic Care Model is introduced. This new model includes elements of the population health promotion field so that broadly based prevention efforts, recognition of the social determinants of health, and enhanced community participation can also be part of the work of health system teams as they work with chronic disease issues."
17214174,1,a,"A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Abis area, 15 kilometers south east of Alexandria city, to determine the prevalence of human fascioliasis and to study some of the epidemiological determinants which may affect the infection. A specially designed questionnaire interview was completed, and a total number of 3475 stool samples were examined. The results revealed a prevalence rate of fascioliasis of 11% in the studied area which was only second to S. mansoni. The prevalence of infection was significantly higher among females in general and specifically in the age group 5 to less than 15 years and 25 to less than 35 years. Family aggregation of fasciola infection was noticed among the studied group. The prevalence and also the risk of infection were significantly higher among children whose mothers were infected. They were, however, insignificantly higher among illiterate, single males, and low social class group. In addition, the prevalence and risk of infection were significantly higher among individuals obtaining their raw green leafy vegetables from multiple sources. From the results it was concluded that human fascioliasis is an important public health problem in Abis area with increased risk of spread of infection to Alexandria city through raw green leafy vegetables which represent the main source of infection."

15578812,0,a,"AIM: To examine infant growth characteristics and their socio-demographic determinants in Severodvinsk, northwest Russia. METHODS: Length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length Z-scores of 1,067 infants born in 1999-2000 in Severodvinsk were calculated on the basis of the data on the length and weight obtained from the medical files. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate independent effects of maternal age, education, occupation, marital status, weight, parity, sex of the baby, and breastfeeding duration on infant growth. RESULTS: At the age of 12 months, 1.1% of the infants were stunted, 1.1% underweight, and 0.5% wasted in comparison with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 reference population. The mean Z-scores for length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length were 0.48+/-0.93, 0.38+/-1.04, and 0.65+/-1.03, respectively. Mean weight-for-length Z-scores considerably increased from birth to 12 months, while length-for-age Z-score remained largely unchanged. In regression analysis, length-for-age Z-scores were lower by 0.43 (p=0.028) and by 0.30 (p<0.001) in infants born to mothers with basic and unknown education, respectively. Positive trends between linear growth and maternal age (p=0.027) and education (p=0.024) were observed. No social variations in weight-for-length Z-scores were found. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting were lower than previously reported from Russia, which may reflect good overall socio-economic conditions in the town. Social variations in linear growth indicate the existence of inequalities in infant health, which may further increase with age."

The authors find evidence for moderate behavioral consistency in a person's behavior across interaction partners, little or no evidence that people consistently engender the same behavioral response from others, and preliminary evidence of unique responding to particular partners. They also consider several methodological issues concerning behavioral measurement as well as the implications of the results for the study of accuracy."
15896895,0,a,"Almost a third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the organism that causes tuberculosis disease. Most of those infected never fall ill, but individuals who do can recover if they have access to effective therapies. This paper discusses certain ethical and ethnographic issues raised by cases in which patients are infected with M. tuberculosis strains resistant to at least the two most powerful drugs on which therapy is usually based. In most poor countries, people with such multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were, until very recently, considered ""untreatable."" In addition to being consigned to a permanent state of ill health, they were also at risk of transmitting their resistant strain to others. In this paper we discuss the logic of ""cost-effectiveness,"" which international health policy-makers utilized to make the case that treatment of MDR-TB is not feasible in resource poor settings. These analyses, which have held sway in public health policy for many years, are flawed, we argue, because they ignore and conceal the social determinants of access to health services and often rely on assumptions rather than evidence. We propose that policies based solely on analyses of cost-effectiveness of specific interventions for individual settings can be short-sighted and, because they do not pay sufficient attention to the social, political, economic, epidemiological and pathophysiological factors influencing the production of health, will ultimately hinder progress toward effective global TB control."
9801018,1,a,"There are no recent population-based data on the prevalence of hearing loss in older adults using standard audiometric testing. The population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study was designed to measure the prevalence of hearing loss in adults aged 48-92 years, residing in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. Hearing thresholds were measured with standardized protocols using pure-tone air- and bone-conduction audiometry in sound-treated booths. The examination also included an otoscopic evaluation, screening tympanogram, and a questionnaire on hearing-related medical history, noise exposure, other potential risk factors, and self-perceived hearing handicap. Of the 4,541 eligible people, 3,753 (82.6%) participated in the hearing study (1993-1995). The average age of participants was 65.8 years, and 57.7% were women. The prevalence of hearing loss was 45.9%. The odds of hearing loss increased with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.88 for 5 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80-1.97) and were greater for men than women (OR = 4.42, 95% CI 3.73-5.24). The male excess of hearing loss remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, education, noise exposure, and occupation (OR = 3.65). These results demonstrate that hearing loss is a very common problem affecting older adults. Epidemiologic studies are needed to understand the genetic, environmental, and sex-related determinants of age-related hearing loss and to identify potential intervention strategies."

14502860,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the prevalence of ischemic stroke, little is known regarding driving resumption and its determinants after stroke. This study documents driving resumption poststroke and describes the relationship between specific variables and driving resumption. METHOD: Between May 2001 and January 2002, 110 consecutive patients admitted to Hartford Hospital with acute ischemic stroke, who had driven during the month before admission, were enrolled in this cohort study. Stroke outcome measures including the NIH Stroke Scale, Barthel Index, Short Form (SF-12), COOPS social support scale, and an original questionnaire were administered. Patients were followed up at three and six months to establish poststroke driving status. The relationship between driving resumption and the predictor variables was determined using correlations (point-biserial and phi coefficients) and forward multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Forty (50%) of the surveyed patients resumed driving within one month of their strokes. The best logistic regression model (R2 = 0.391) for predicting resumption of driving after stroke included the variables prestroke driving frequency (OR = 7.74 [2.47-24.3]), poststroke Barthel Index score (OR = 1.16 [1.06-1.27]), and marital status (OR = 3.55 [1.28-9.83]). CONCLUSION: Resumption of driving is early after mild strokes. Factors other than the specific consequences of the stroke contribute to the prediction of driving resumption. While factors such as prestroke driving frequency, functional independence and marital status should not be used as a sanction for driving resumption, they offer insights to individuals who are likely to resume driving early after an ischemic stroke."
17687880,0,a,"Cocaine consumption in Spain continues to rise and is reaching an alarming level. This is a descriptive and correlational study in which a transcultural analysis is made with a sample of 62 different countries. The aim of this study is to compare the influence of macrosocial, cultural and economic variables on the behaviour of cocaine abuse. Thus, the importance of the cocaine traffic and supply is shown in relation to the abuse of the same, but recognition and emphasis is given to the presence of other explanatory factors characteristic of societies in which cocaine is abused and demanded. These factors are: predominance of cultural values of self-expression, high index of subjective wellbeing and a high GNP per capita. Finally, the relevance of social factors, environment and socio-economic context, as determinants of cocaine abuse from a trans-cultural perspective, are discussed. The implementation of different actions is proposed: the promotion of values oriented towards self-regulation and self-control, the control of the cocaine supply (direct and indirect), combating early cultural destruction by means of publicity and promoting cultural creation and the diversification of leisure."
9616419,1,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: In the UK, studies of socioeconomic differentials in mortality have generally relied upon occupational social class as the index of socioeconomic position, while in the US, measures based upon education have been widely used. These two measures have different characteristics; for example, social class can change throughout adult life, while education is unlikely to alter after early adulthood. Therefore different interpretations can be given to the mortality differentials that are seen. The objective of this analysis is to demonstrate the profile of mortality differentials, and the factors underlying these differentials, which are associated with the two socioeconomic measures. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: 27 work places in the west of Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 5749 men aged 35-64 who completed questionnaires and were examined between 1970 and 1973. FINDINGS: At baseline, similar gradients between socioeconomic position and blood pressure, height, lung function, and smoking behaviour were seen, regardless of whether the education or social class measure was used. Manual social class and early termination of full time education were associated with higher blood pressure, shorter height, poorer lung function, and a higher prevalence of smoking. Within education strata, the graded association between smoking and social class remains strong, whereas within social class groups the relation between education and smoking is attenuated. Over 21 years of follow up, 1639 of the men died. Mortality from all causes and from three broad cause of death groups (cardiovascular disease, malignant disease, and other causes) showed similar associations with social class and education. For all cause of death groups, men in manual social classes and men who terminated full time education at an early age had higher death rates. Cardiovascular disease was the cause of death group most strongly associated with education, while the non-cardiovascular non-cancer category was the cause of death group most strongly associated with adulthood social class. The graded association between social class and all cause mortality remains strong and significant within education strata, whereas within social class strata the relation between education and mortality is less clear. CONCLUSIONS: As a single indicator of socioeconomic position occupational social class in adulthood is a better discriminator of socioeconomic differentials in mortality and smoking behaviour than is education. This argues against interpretations that see cultural--rather than material--resources as being the key determinants of socioeconomic differentials in health. The stronger association of education with death from cardiovascular causes than with other causes of death may reflect the function of education as an index of socioeconomic circumstances in early life, which appear to have a particular influence on the risk of cardiovascular disease."

This collaboration should extend from the early stages of technology development to the evaluation and improvement of population-wide interventions. This paper provides an integrating framework for social science research on health producing processes at the household level, drawing on recent work in economics, anthropology, and public health. Further development of theory and methods in this area would benefit from interdisciplinary research in categories as defined by social and behavioral science in addition to those related to specific diseases and intervention programs."
15234641,0,a,"PURPOSE: To determine the rates of patient adherence to key evidence-based therapies at 6 months after hospital discharge for an acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: In this nonrandomized, prospective, multinational, multicenter study, adherence to aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 6 months after discharge for myocardial infarction or unstable angina was assessed in 21,408 patients aged 18 years or older. Patients were enrolled at 104 tertiary and community hospitals representing a broad range of care facilities and practice settings (e.g., teaching vs. nonteaching). RESULTS: Of 13,830 patients, discontinuation of therapy was observed at 6-month follow-up in 8% of those taking aspirin on discharge, 12% of those taking beta-blockers, 20% of those taking ACE inhibitors, and 13% of those taking statins. In a multivariate analysis, adherence to beta-blocker therapy was higher in patients with a myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 1.47), hypertension (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.54), ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.61), or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.45). Aspirin adherence was higher among patients cared for by cardiologists (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.19 to 1.75; P <0.001) than among those cared for by nonspecialists. Male sex and prior heart failure were associated with improved adherence to ACE inhibitor therapy. Hypertension was associated with poorer adherence to statin therapy (OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.99; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Among patients prescribed key evidence-based medications at discharge, 8% to 20% were no longer taking their medication after 6 months. The reasons for noncompliance are complex, and may be elucidated by future studies of medical and social determinants."
1894154,1,a,"Ability to afford single, separate households has been perceived as the key determinant of living alone among single older women. This paper shows that, when race is analyzed separately, family-related variables such as marital history and the number of children raised, rather than economic affordability, are the most important factors in the living arrangement decision of widowed elderly women of color. Economic affordability also turns out to be insignificant when white and nonwhite divorced elderly women are analyzed separately."
12225453,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and investigate potential predictors of psychological distress in Filipino women living in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: The sample of n = 487 women (88% response rate) was drawn from Filipino organization membership lists and supplemented by snowball sampling. Participants were interviewed in their homes or at a community event in 1996/1997. Follow-up in 1997/1998 involved n = 346 women (71% response rate) who were interviewed either in their homes or by telephone. The two surveys included measurement of demographic, immigration, physical health, satisfaction with life in Australia and life event variables. The GHQ-28 was included in the follow-up survey as a measure of psychological distress. RESULTS: The proportion of women having an above threshold score (using the cut-off of 4/5) on the GHQ-28 was 23%. Women who were single, dissatisfied with life in Australia, had reported a major change in their financial situation, their relationship or their health in the year between surveys were significantly more likely to have an above threshold score. CONCLUSIONS: The level of mental distress among Filipinas in Queensland appears to be slightly higher than the levels reported in the general population but lower than other migrant groups. The determinants of mental distress in this population contrast with those in the general Australian population and other migrant groups. The social context of these determinants in Filipinas needs to be elicited for an understanding of these differences."
12415928,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the major psychosocial determinants of smoking in adolescents and the school influence on these determinants. METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey in 8th grade (age 14.8 years, n = 459) of 14 schools. Logistic regression with smoking as the dependent, and psychosocial indicators as independent variables. Total climate score for each school computed as the sum of scores of five school-related indicators. Linear regression analysis on aggregate data (school level), controlling for gender, ethnicity, and social class. RESULTS: Five out of 15 tested psychosocial indicators were identified as independent protective factors. The prevalence of smoking decreased steeply with an increasing number of protective factors. In the regression analysis on the aggregate level the mean number of protective factors per school and the prevalence of smoking were significantly related to the school climate score (R2 = 0.650, p < 0.001, and R2 = 0.456, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Provided a causal interpretation of the cross-sectional statistical associations is correct, efforts to improve the general climate in schools appear as a promising strategy to enhance individual protective factors. Longitudinal evaluative studies are needed to prove the effectiveness of such a strategy."
18158271,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of our study was to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of children with epilepsy in Hong Kong with that of children with epilepsy in Canada, and to explore possible factors affecting these findings. A second interest was to determine agreement between proxy reports and self-ratings among children with epilepsy in Hong Kong, compare these with findings in Canada, and identify factors that influence the concordance. METHODS: Child self-report and parent-proxy questionnaires on an epilepsy-specific HRQL measure, appropriately translated and validated in Chinese, were administered to 266 Hong Kong children and their parents. An unpaired t test was used to compare the scores with published results from 381 Canadian children and their parents, who used the original English version of the measure. Demographic characteristics of the two groups were compared using t tests, chi2 tests, and Fisher's exact tests. Agreement between parents' and children's scores was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standardized response means (SRMs). The total HRQL score differences between parents and children in Hong Kong were compared with those in Canada using an unpaired t test. Factors that might affect the parent-child score difference were studied using Pearson correlation analysis, chi2 test, and analysis of variance. Factors studied included: sex, current age, age at diagnosis, duration of epilepsy, number of antiepileptic drugs used, type of seizure, seizure severity, cognition of the child, the type of school attended, presence of neurological problems, presence of behavioral problems, recent health care usage, education and employment status of both parents, housing status of the family, and relationship of the proxy respondent to the child. RESULTS: (1) In contrast to the Canadian sample, Hong Kong children with epilepsy were older (P<0.01), had a longer duration of epilepsy (P<0.01) and less severe seizures (P<0.01), and were more likely to attend normal schools (P<0.01). Children in Hong Kong reported more interpersonal/social difficulties (P<0.01), more worries (P<0.01), and more secrecy about their epilepsy (P<0.01). Parents in Hong Kong believed that their children perceived more worries (P<0.01) and were more secretive about their epilepsy (P<0.01). (2) Moderate to good agreement between parent-proxy response scores and child self-report scores was demonstrated (ICC=0.50-0.69, SRM=0.19-0.33). The total HRQL score differences between parent and child in Hong Kong were not different from those in Canada. None of the factors studied were related to the parent-child score difference. CONCLUSIONS: Youth with epilepsy in Hong Kong and their parents reported poorer quality of life than children with epilepsy in Canada. Further studies are necessary to identify the determinants of HRQL in children with epilepsy in different cultures. Acceptable agreement between the two ratings suggests that proxy reports can be used when child self-reports cannot be obtained."
12227963,0,a,"Urbanization, a characteristic of the twentieth century, is a profound transformation of human settlement processes and their outcomes, which has not been well understood in terms of both positive and negative impacts. This paper argues that the interrelations between urban planning, health, social, and environmental policies have been poorly articulated until now. Although sectoral approaches have often applied remedial and corrective measures to overcome unsatisfactory conditions in urban areas, today we know that infectious diseases stemming from insanitary conditions are not the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Europe. Nonetheless diverse forms of ill health remain associated with place of work and residence. Therefore, in order to deal with the complexity and diversity of urban areas there is an urgent need to move from conventional, sectoral approaches based on biomedical models of health to coordinated action stemming from an ecological interpretation of health including its social determinants. This kind of approach is presented in order to promote health and social development at the local level."
21694883,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The use of antibiotic drugs triggers a complex interaction involving many biological, sociological, and psychological determinants. Resistance to antibiotics is a serious worldwide problem which is increasing and has implications for morbidity, mortality, and health care both in hospitals and in the community. OBJECTIVES: To analyze current research on the determinants of antibiotic resistance and comprehensively review the main factors in the process of resistance in order to aid our understanding and assessment of this problem. METHODS: We conducted a MedLine search using the key words ""determinants"", ""antibiotic"", and ""antibiotic resistance"" to identify publications between 1995 and 2007 on the determinants of antibiotic resistance. Publications that did not address the determinants of antibiotic resistance were excluded. RESULTS: The process and determinants of antibiotic resistance are described, beginning with the development of antibiotics, resistance and the mechanisms of resistance, sociocultural determinants of resistance, the consequences of antibiotic resistance, and alternative measures proposed to combat antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the published literature identified the main determinants of antibiotic resistance as irrational use of antibiotics in humans and animal species, insufficient patient education when antibiotics are prescribed, lack of guidelines for treatment and control of infections, lack of scientific information for physicians on the rational use of antibiotics, and lack of official government policy on the rational use of antibiotics in public and private hospitals."
15239775,0,a,"Terms such as 'molecular epidemiology' and 'genetic epidemiology' have been coined to depict the change from 'traditional epidemiology', concerned with disease determinants at the community or society level, over to 'modern epidemiology', which is concerned with determinants operating at the individual level or even below, i.e. at the organ, tissue, cell, or molecular level. In this commentary, we point out to the limitations of this development and suggest that more emphasis is placed on making the presumed causal disease models explicit, when investigating the relationship between putative determinants and disease. Understanding the disease processes at the micro-level is insufficient for understanding disease at the individual level; and disease patterns at the population level cannot be understood unless it is realized that individuals exist in a variety of contexts that cannot be reduced to individual attributes."
17031317,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the maternal acceptability of formula-feeding proposed to reduce postnatal HIV transmission in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. METHODS: Each consenting HIV-infected pregnant women, age > or =18 years, who received a perinatal antiretroviral prophylaxis was eligible. Two hierarchical infant-feeding options were proposed antenatally: exclusive formula-feeding or short-term exclusive breast-feeding. Formula-feeding was provided free up to age 9 months. Determinants of acceptability were analyzed using a logistic regression. Formula-feeding failure was defined as having breast-fed one's child at least once. RESULTS: Between March 2001 and March 2003, 580 women delivered: 97% expressed their infant-feeding choice before delivery; 53% chose formula-feeding. Significant prenatal determinants for refusing formula-feeding were: living with her partner, being Muslim, having a low educational level, being followed in one of the study sites, having not disclosed her HIV status, and having been included within the first 6 months of the project. Among the 295 mothers who formula-fed, the Kaplan-Meier probability of success of the formula-feeding option was 93.6% at Day 2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.7% to 96.3%) and 84.2% at 12 months (95% CI: 79.9% to 88.5%): 46 of 295 (15.6%) women breast-fed at least once, of whom 41% temporarily practiced mixed-feeding at Day 2 because of social stigma or newborn poor health. CONCLUSIONS: In settings with general access to clean water, structured antenatal counseling, and sustained provision of free formula, slightly over half of HIV-infected women chose to artificially feed their newborn infant. Low mixed-feeding rates were observed. This social acceptability must be balanced with mother-child long-term health outcomes to guide safe recommendations on infant-feeding among HIV-infected women in African urban settings."

23511722,1,a,"The question of safety and risk in people's ideas about health and care is approached here from an anthropological perspective. One strength of such an interpretive approach which seems especially important in this context, is that, although the researcher provides an account of the beliefs and actions of other people, the exercise is undertaken with an awareness that the interpretation is itself a product of particular historical and cultural determinants.Cultures, including those of industrial-capitalistic societies like Sweden, form systems of meanings which provide explanations of how the world works, of what is thought of as real and what is designated as natural and inevitable as well as what is morally right. These meanings link people to one another and form the basis for social action. It is thus within this framework that the notion of risk and safety get their content and meaning.In this line of thought a description is provided of what happens when people meet in joint health care encounters where their interests do not coincide, their understanding of what is going' on is not the same, or their expectations of what the other should or should not do differ. How considerations of safety and risk in our health care may be interpreted by people with other health theories and views or other understandings about such things as what life is, what is a person, what is good health, a good life or a normal body, and what death means, are also discussed. An attempt is made to profile the need to define variations in the notions of risk and safety in health care over cultural boundaries with examples from cross-cultural studies."

9269889,1,a,"Assessment of behavioral skills remains critical to the evaluation of HIV prevention interventions; however, investigators often rely upon participant reports of self-efficacy to estimate such skills. We evaluated the relationship between self-efficacy beliefs for condom use and behavioral performance. Forty-three men completed the Condom Use Self-Efficacy Scale (CUSES) and participated in 2 behavioral assessments. Regression analyses indicated that the CUSES subscales relevant to negotiation of condom use did not account for a significant amount of variability in interpersonal skills; similarly, the CUSES subscale relevant to technical condom use skill did not account for variability in the condom application scores. We caution investigators against the assumption that higher self-efficacy reflects behavioral competence for HIV-risk reduction."
19161600,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Vertical and horizontal trust, as dimensions of social capital, may be important determinants of health. As mass media campaigns have been used extensively to promote healthy lifestyles and convey health-related information, high levels of individual trust in the media may facilitate the success of such campaigns and, hence, have a positive influence on health. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between trust levels in mass media, an aspect of vertical trust, and health. METHODS: Based on cross-sectional data of the general population from the AsiaBarometer Survey (2003-2006), we analyzed the relationship between self-rated health and trust in mass media, using a multilevel logistic model, adjusted for age, gender, marital status, income, education, occupation, horizontal trust, and trust in the healthcare system. RESULTS: In a total of 39082 participants (mean age 38; 49% male), 26808 (69%) were classified as in good health. By the levels of trust in mass media, there were 6399 (16%) who reported that they trust a lot, 16327 (42%) reporting trust to a degree, 9838 (25%) who do not really trust, 3307 (9%) who do not trust at all, and 191 (0.5%) who have not thought about it. In the multilevel model, trust in mass media was associated with good health (do not trust at all as the base group): the odds ratios (OR) of 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-1.27) for do not really trust; OR of 1.35 (95% CI = 1.23-1.49) for trust to a degree, and 1.57 (95% CI = 1.36-1.81) for trust a lot. Horizontal trust and trust in the healthcare system were also associated with health. CONCLUSION: Vertical trust in mass media is associated with better health in Asian people. Since mass media is likely an important arena for public health, media trust should be enhanced to make people healthier."
12948575,0,a,"Over 10% of current births in all countries of the world are delivered by caesarean section. Single-dose ampicillin or cefazolin administered after cord clamping has been proven to be effective for the prevention of post-caesarean infections as indicated in many randomised trials and reviews in the Cochrane Library. This study aimed to determine three determinants of behavioural intention using the theory of planned behaviour: attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived controls. Intentions were examined for five aspects of the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, namely whether or not antibiotics were used, used in all caesarean sections, after rather than before cord clamping, whether ampicillin/cefazolin or broader-spectrum antibiotics were used, and whether single or multiple doses were given. Fifty obstetricians selected from university, regional, and general hospitals in southern Thailand, were surveyed using a questionnaire and in-depth interview. Their intentions to use a single dose and to use in all cases were low, and this was related to negative attitudes and reference groups who did not approve of the single dose. The negative attitude was based on scepticism concerning the applicability of well-equipped trials from the developed world and fear of consequences of post-caesarean infections. Norms carried over from residency training had more long-term influence in their practice than newer information from books or journals. Perceived external controls on their practice were less predictive of intentions. Intentions were only partly predictive of behaviour. Changing attitudes, introducing evidence-based information into residency training and strengthening control systems in the hospital are essential to improve intentions."
12137318,0,a,"The present paper aims at describing the most relevant background data on geomorphological, economic, ethnohistoric, demographic and linguistic features of the island of Vis. As an introduction to future holistic anthropological research on the island, it seeks to identify both internal and external impulses of change and/or continuity of the island population structure within a wider socio-cultural and historical context. The ethnohistorical and demographic data indicate a higher degree of isolation throughout history as compared to other islands in the region and a continuous depopulation trend during the last century. The analysis of the existing linguistic data on two main settlements shows a certain amount of intradialectal micro-differentiation, which is mainly due to various social and non-linguistic reasons."

2005270,1,a,"We examined whether depressed persons' social skill deficits contribute to their negative cognitions and whether this contribution is independent of their negative schemata. Depressed (n = 60) and nondepressed (n = 60) subjects engaged in group discussions. We assessed subjects' social competence schemata with a questionnaire and subjects' actual level of social competence in the discussion through objective ratings made by codiscussants and outside observers. We found that independently of their negative schemata, depressed subjects' social skill deficits explained a significant portion of the variance in their more negative interpretation of feedback (relative to nondepressed subjects'). This suggests that real deficits in depressed persons' performance compound the effects of their negative schemata and further contribute to their negative cognitions. We also further explored findings by Dykman et al. (1989) and Lewinsohn et al. (1980)."
19997790,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about psychosocial mechanisms that may underlie differences in lifestyle change between socioeconomic groups. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine how educational level influences middle-aged participants' (N = 385) psychosocial responses to the GOAL Lifestyle Implementation Trial. METHODS: The measurements of self-efficacy and planning for healthy lifestyle were conducted pre-intervention (T1) and post-intervention (T2, 3 months), and measurements of exercise and healthy eating as outcomes at T1 and at 12 months (T3). RESULTS: Psychosocial determinants at T1 and their T1-T2 changes were mostly similar, irrespective of educational levels. Exercise barriers self-efficacy was enhanced slightly less (p = 0.08) among the low-SES. T2 levels as well as pre-post-intervention changes in exercise self-efficacy predicted 12-month changes in exercise, and T2 diet coping planning predicted changes in dietary fat intake. The associations were similar across all SES groups. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing self-efficacy and planning is similarly effective among intervention participants regardless of education level."
10140222,1,a,"Something is definitely wrong with the American health care system. Too many citizens are denied health care, and health care costs continue to rise at an uncomfortable and intolerable rate. Ensuring care for all is a paramount goal. There is no way to simultaneously cover everyone; leave the reimbursement of physicians unrestrained; ensure instantaneous access to every imaginable high-technology service; subsidize the world's costliest and least efficient health bureaucracy; and contain costs. Widespread dissatisfaction in all quarters--physicians, hospitals, third-party payers, regulators and consumers--has led to an avalanche of reform proposals. Rapidly changing social, political, and economic environments; rising fiscal pressure; and an evolving understanding of the major determinants of health have also created pressure for changes. There are some new and hopeful signs that America is facing up to the need for changes in the health care delivery system. The Pan American Uni-Care Health Plan that is described in this article may serve as a reasonable balance among these competing priorities."
9268254,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The authors explore the determinants of having a regular source of care in a community-based probability sample of homeless adults in Los Angeles. Results from this study should be more representative than those from previous studies of the homeless that are clinic- or shelter-based. In addition to those factors found to be barriers to regular sources of care in the general population, we hypothesized that psychosocial characteristics of the homeless and the homeless lifestyle would negatively impact their likelihood of having a regular source of care. METHODS: The authors conducted a multiple logistic regression to predict regular source of care among the homeless, using an adaptation of the Behavioral Model of health services utilization as an analytic framework. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of the sample reported that they had a regular source of care. Of those with a source of care, 30% reported a hospital outpatient department; 25% reported a community or homeless clinic; 23% reported a hospital emergency room; 14% reported a government clinic; and 9% reported a private physician's office as their source of care. Some factors found to be barriers to having a regular source of care in the general population (male, Hispanic, young age) also were barriers among homeless adults. Additional barriers in this sample included homelessness-related characteristics such as competing needs, long-term homelessness, and social isolation. Chronic mental illness and chronic substance dependence were not related to having a source of care among the homeless. Characteristics that increased the likelihood of having a regular source of care in the general population (poor health status, Medicaid) were not related to having a regular source of care among the homeless. CONCLUSIONS: In a context of limited resources, the distribution of regular source of care among the homeless appears to be highly inequitable. Although some of the characteristics identifying those with a regular source of care suggest differential patterns of behavior across subgroups, others suggest differential advantage in access to care and a lack of fit between the needs of the homeless and the organization of health services."
8192118,1,a,"Proposed and tested a model of the determinants of adolescents' chronic life stressors, consisting of sociodemographic, personal, and contextual stress and coping factors, using baseline and 1-year follow-up data from 259 adolescents who varied in their psychological and physical health. Concurrent regression analyses at Time 1 and at Time 2, and longitudinal regressions that controlled for the levels of chronic stressors 1 year earlier, showed that sociodemographic, personal, and contextual factors each made a significant contribution to predicting adolescents' ongoing stressors with their mother, father, siblings friends and classmates and teachers at school. Personal factors of an emotional temperament and low perceived self-worth, and contextual factors of more negative life events and fewer social resources, were related to more chronic stressors. Suggestions for further development of the model are discussed."
2033624,1,a,"The British Government is implementing some major alterations to the way health services in Great Britain are organised. As well as the introduction of competition between health care providers, their financial interests are to be linked to their output, in efforts to use market forces to increase efficiency and cut costs. This paper looks at the possible impact of these changes of health care organisation on ethical medical practice. This is investigated with particular reference to the country whose health service has embraced most closely these elements of the market--the United States of America. The question to be answered is whether high standards of ethical care are ensured by factors somehow intrinsic to the medical profession, and are therefore immune to changes in the economics of health care. This assumption is shown to be questionable in light of what is known about the determinants of ethical medical practice."
17705873,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The inappropriate use of emergency room (ER) service by patients with non-urgent health problems is a worldwide problem. Inappropriate ER use makes it difficult to guarantee access for real emergency cases, decreases readiness for care, produces negative spillover effects on the quality of emergency services, and raises overall costs. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a medium-sized city in southern Brazil. The urgency of the presenting complaint was defined according to the Hospital Urgencies Appropriateness Protocol (HUAP). Multivariable Poisson regression was carried out to examine factors associated with inappropriate ER use. RESULTS: The study interviewed 1,647 patients over a consecutive 13-day sampling period. The prevalence of inappropriate ER use was 24.2% (95% CI 22.1-26.3). Inappropriate ER use was inversely associated with age (P = 0.001), longer stay in the waiting room, longer duration of symptoms and morning shift. However, the determinants of inappropriate ER use differed according age groups (P value for interaction = 0.04). Within the younger age-group (15-49 years), inappropriate ER use was higher among females, patients who reported visiting the ER because there was no other place to go, patients reporting that the doctor at the regular place of care refused to attend to them without a prior appointment, and individuals who reported that the PHC clinic which they use is open for shorter periods during the day. Among older patients (50+ years), those with highest level of education, absence of self-reported chronic diseases and lack of social support were more likely to engage in higher inappropriate ER use. CONCLUSION: Efforts should be made to redirect inappropriate ER demand. Besides expanding access to, and improving the quality of primary and secondary care, it is important to mobilize social support for older patients, to enhance the relationship between different levels of care, as well as to develop campaigns to educate the public about the appropriate use of medical services."
12793513,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Psychiatric hospitals in Italy had to be closed under a law dated 1994. AIMS: To investigate the discharge of patients from public psychiatric hospitals. METHODS: A total of 4492 patients from 22 psychiatric hospitals were described at recruitment and followed during the period 1994-2000. Their characteristics were investigated as determinants of discharge to community residential facilities for psychiatric patients versus other settings. RESULTS: All 22 psychiatric hospitals closed between 1994 and 2000; 678 patients had died, and the remainder were discharged. Of these, 39% went to nursing homes, 29% to community residential facilities for psychiatric patients, 2% joined their family, less than 1% were settled in private independent accommodation, and 29% remained in the psychiatric hospital, although defined as discharged. Ten patients were recorded as missing when still in the psychiatric hospitals, none after discharge. Younger, more educated patients and patients from two of the four regions studied were more likely to be discharged to community residential facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients were discharged to highly supervised settings. The potential risk of abandonment due to deinstitutionalization was not observed in this population. The wide use of highly supervised settings can be explained by the patients' old age, but different local policies may have affected the discharge process."
7944247,1,a,"A cross-sectional survey of 568 married women aged 21-65 years in the Pasir Panjang Constituency was conducted to determine the prevalence of cervical cancer screening in the community and the factors affecting acceptance of this screening test. Results show that 309 (54.4%) of the respondents had ever had a Pap smear. The women who reported having had a smear were more likely to be below 45 years of age (prevalence ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.88), Chinese and of a higher socioeconomic status (1.68, 1.33 to 2.12). They were also more likely to have married at a later age (1.68, 1.21 to 2.31) than women who had not had a smear. Age and socioeconomic status remained independent predictors on multivariate analysis. The findings suggest that an important task of public health practitioners is to increase the uptake of screening among older and socially disadvantaged women who are known to be at the highest risk of cervical cancer. In addition, strategies to encourage younger women to continue regular attendance at screening clinics beyond their childbearing years will be important for the future."

9759686,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies suggest underuse of beta-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease, but these studies have been based on selected populations of recently hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe national patterns and determinants of beta-blocker use in the ambulatory setting. METHODS: We analyzed 11745 visits by patients with coronary artery disease to randomly selected, office-based physicians in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys for 1980, 1981, 1985, and 1989 through 1996. We used multiple logistic regression to determine the independent effect of sociodemographic and clinical factors on beta-blocker use. OUTCOME MEASURE: Beta-blocker use at patient visits. RESULTS: Beta-blocker use was reported in only 20.9% of office visits by patients with coronary artery disease and no strong contraindications between 1993 and 1996. In multivariate analyses, age younger than 75 years, residence in the Northeast, and visits to cardiologists and internists compared with family and general practitioners predicted greater use of beta-blocker therapy. White race and private insurance also were significant predictors of beta-blocker use between 1980 and 1996. Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant decline in beta-blocker use from 1980 to 1990, followed by a gradual increase in recent years. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-blockers appear to be underused in ambulatory patients with coronary artery disease. Our data suggest that nonclinical factors may influence rates of use, indicating the need for closer scrutiny of variations in physician prescribing practices."
12291764,1,a,"""In Canada, the proportion of women among immigrants fluctuates around 50 percent, with a slight increase in recent years. Another important characteristic of immigration...is a radical change in the composition of origin of flows in the past three decades--European-dominated streams have been replaced by those originating mostly in Asia. This paper focuses on female Asian immigrants in Canada.... Major Asian source countries of female immigrants (Hong Kong, Philippines, India, China, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Lebanon and Iran) give evidence to the growing importance of political push factors and sending countries' policies-facilitation factors as crucial determinants of international migration."""
7555215,1,a,"Using census and administrative agency data for 177 urban census tracts, variation in rates of officially reported child maltreatment is found to be related to structural determinants of community social organization: economic and family resources, residential instability, household and age structure, and geographic proximity of neighborhoods to concentrated poverty. Furthermore, child maltreatment rates are found to be intercorrelated with other indicators of the breakdown of community social control and organization. These other indicators are similarly affected by the structural dimensions of neighborhood context. Children who live in neighborhoods that are characterized by poverty, excessive numbers of children per adult resident, populations turnover, and the concentration of female-headed families are at highest risk of maltreatment. This analysis suggests that child maltreatment is but one manifestation of community social organization and that its occurrence is related to some of the same underlying macro-social conditions that foster other urban problems."
18093027,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Empirical research suggests that social disadvantage has a negative effect on the development of language, and related cognitive skills such as reading. There is, however, no corresponding body of research on the impact of social disadvantage on motor development. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of social disadvantage on motor development in young children. In addition, we explored a possible link between an early neuromotor indicator and attainments in language, and reading. METHODS: The Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure was used to identify two contrasting districts based on a composite measure of social disadvantage. We investigated the effect of social disadvantage on the motor attainments of a sample of 239 children aged 4-5 years, and 276 children aged 7-8 years attending mainstream schools in each district using a standardised motor assessment battery, and a motor neurodevelopmental measure. We used standardised receptive language and reading assessments to evaluate possible associations between motor and language/reading attainments. RESULTS: There was a significant negative effect of social disadvantage on motor skills, for both age groups, and for both males and females. A similar negative effect of social disadvantage on attainments in language, and reading was also found. Children from areas of social disadvantage had significant deficits in motor and receptive language attainments relative to their more advantaged peers. In addition, we revealed a significant predictive relationship between a neurodevelopmental measure of early motor development and reading attainment. CONCLUSIONS: Children growing up in socially disadvantaged areas may be at particular risk of motor, including neurodevelopmental, delay, as well as language and reading difficulties. The determinants of motor and neuromotor deficits in children from disadvantaged backgrounds should be explored, and the relationship between early neuromotor development and language/reading development requires further investigation."
9696257,1,a,"The aim was to compare how general lifestyle, gender and occupational status determine dental health behavior. All the 1012 55-year-old citizens of Oulu (a medium-sized Finnish town) were invited to participate in this study. 780 of them did so. Information about frequency of toothbrushing, use of extra cleaning methods, use of sugar in coffee or tea, and time of the last dental visit, lifestyle, occupational status and gender was gathered from the 533 dentate subjects. Lifestyle was measured by means of questions about physical activity, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and dietary habits. Females and people with a healthy lifestyle brushed their teeth more often. Extra cleaning methods were used more often by people with a healthy lifestyle, whereas gender and occupational status had a weaker association. Males and people with a lower occupational status used sugar in coffee or tea more often. The time from the last dental visit was longer among workers and men; lifestyle had no significant association. At the population level oral cleaning habits are a matter of a health-oriented lifestyle and gender-related behavior. The dental visiting habit has a weaker association with general lifestyle."
17721671,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Psychoeducational groups are a common component of interventions in schizophrenia. AIMS: To explore patients' views about wanted and unwanted effects of group psychoeducation. METHOD: Subjective feedback of 103 participants of a psychoeducational intervention as well as data from two specific focus groups-one with ""enthusiastic"" and one with ""critical"" participants-were analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Participants emphasized the importance of information received and of exchanging information with others suffering from the same disorder. Positive effects on coping, activation and social interaction were reported. Perceived overemphasis on illness related information produced defensive reactions, whereas the integration of quality of life topics was appreciated. A pleasant group atmosphere and clinical stability were suggested as important determinants of success. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative analyzses of participants' views help to understand the potentials of a psychoeducational intervention in schizophrenia."
15884999,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Rural residents, rural community leaders, rural planners, rural health authorities and community organizations seek to understand the health, quality of life and sustainability of their communities. The aim of this article is to follow the cooperative community-based process of developing and testing a workbook to be used to assess and foster rural communities' health, quality of life and ultimately their sustainability. ISSUE: In a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada funded, 3 phase project, entitled Determinants of Health of Rural Populations and Communities, researchers at Brandon University, University of Manitoba and Concordia University, Canada, partnered various stakeholder groups in an visionary effort to build a framework and indicators for the purpose of assisting rural communities to assess not only their health and wellbeing, but also their sustainability. CONCLUSION: In this on-going project, it is anticipated that the findings related to the health, wellbeing, quality of life and sustainability of rural communities will be integral to policy development by local, provincial and federal organizations and governments well into this century. Moreover it is expected that diverse community-based organizations will be able to use the findings to take action, particularly in an intersectoral manner, the outcome of which will be an improvement of the rural resident and community health."
12880519,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the vast scientific literature on the social determinants of health, there is still a debate on the extent to which this relationship remains in old age. The objective of this study was to examine the association between socioeconomic circumstances and health among older adults in a small town in Brazil. METHODS: The study was carried out in Bambui, a town of around 15 000 inhabitants that is located in the state of Minas Gerais, which is in southeastern Brazil. From 1 177 residents aged 65 years or older, 1 074 of them (91.2%) were interviewed and 997 (84.7%) were examined (physical measurements and blood tests). Those in the lowest third of the distribution of total household monthly income, with an income of less than US$ 240 per month, were compared with those who had an income above that level. RESULTS: Lower family income was independently associated with: (1) some lifestyle risk factors (less consumption of fresh fruits or vegetables and less frequent exercise during leisure time in the preceding 30 days), (2) several indicators of worse health status (General Health Questionnaire score, self-rated health, self-rated visual acuity, level of difficulty in walking 300 meters, inability to perform routine activities because of a health problem in the preceding 2 weeks, and seropositivity for Trypanosoma cruzi), (3) a higher number of nonprescribed medications used in the preceding 3 months, and (4) a higher number of hospitalizations in the preceding 12 months. Obesity was more frequent in the higher-income group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not confirm observations in some developed countries of a lack of association between socioeconomic status and health among the aged. Our results showed that a small difference in monthly family income was sufficiently sensitive to identify elderly persons in worse health, even within a community that appears to be uniformly poor."
16014164,0,a,"This paper contributes to a nascent scholarly discussion of sex and gender as determinants of health. Health is a composite of biological makeup and socioeconomic circumstances. Differences in health and illness patterns of men and women are attributable both to sex, or biology, and to gender, that is, social factors such as powerlessness, access to resources, and constrained roles. Using examples such as the greater life expectancy of women in most of the world, despite their relative social disadvantage, and the disproportionate risk of myocardial infarction amongst men, but death from MI amongst women, the independent and combined associations of sex and gender on health are explored. A model for incorporating gender into epidemiologic analyses is proposed."
2311906,1,a,"To be delivered of a child with cleft lip and palate is an extreme psychic stress factor for the mother. In coping with this, she is left to the support of the caring medical staff. Therefore, the aim of the present study was 1. to ascertain, to what extent mothers of children with cleft lip and palate are given information on the malformation, and receive emotional support by the medical staff; and 2. to determine the effect such experiences have on their ability to cope. For this purpose we developed a special questionnaire, which was completed by 154 mothers of such children. Retrospectively, a relevant part of them criticised not only the communication and the contents of information, but also the emotional support as deficient. A correlation between these determinants and largely insufficient coping was statistically confirmed. Our results should be taken into account in respect of the practical requirements when caring for mothers of children with a cleft lip and palate."
15330403,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Although patients with bipolar disorder have been shown to benefit from psychosocial interventions, the proportion that utilizes these interventions is unknown. We set out to clarify the determinants of psychosocial service utilization in adults with bipolar disorder. METHOD: We investigated psychosocial service utilization among the first 500 patients admitted to the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD). RESULTS: In the 3 months prior to enrollment in STEP-BD, a majority of the patients (54%) were engaged in at least one psychosocial service modality in addition to pharmacotherapy. In order of decreasing frequency, these were therapy with a psychologist, self-help group, therapy with a social worker, and therapy with another type of provider. Bipolar patients with personality disorders (80% vs 20%, p = 0.0002), alcohol/drug abuse disorders (76% vs 24%, p = 0.0022), and anxiety disorders (60% vs 40%, p = 0.0043) received more psychosocial services than those without. Poorer global functioning also increased the likelihood of receiving services, whereas being married decreased service utilization. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial service utilization by outpatients with bipolar disorder is strongly linked to greater severity/complexity of illness. Potential moderators, such as insurance status and availability of care, should be examined in future studies."
18509581,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the principal determinants that are longitudinally associated with the performance of social roles in the first 3 years following a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. DESIGN: Inception cohort with 5 measurements over 3 years. PATIENTS: A total of 156 patients recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. METHOD: Performance of social roles was measured using the 2 role functioning and the social sub-scales of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36. Potential determinants (n = 43) were divided into the following clusters: patient and disease characteristics (n = 12), psychosocial characteristics (n = 10), basic functions (n = 18) and basic activities (n = 3). Multivariate longitudinal regression analyses were performed with generalized estimating equations. A backwards selection procedure for every cluster per outcome reduced the large number of potential determinants. In order to determine whether longitudinal associations are present the selected determinants were entered into an overall regression model. RESULTS: Twenty-three candidate determinants were selected. Vitality, measured with the SF36 sub-scale vitality, the T2-weighted supratentorial lesion load and the perceived amount of social support, measured with the Social Support List Discrepancies, were longitudinally associated with the performance of social roles in 2 or 3 of the models. CONCLUSION: Vitality, the perceived amount of social support, and disease activity, i.e. the T2-weighted supratentorial lesion load, determine the performance of social roles in the early stages of multiple sclerosis."
2335542,1,a,"From 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1982 information on all births to Bedouin Arab women residing in the Negev Desert of Israel showed a previously unreported seasonal pattern. The peak season, November-February, coincided with the period of cool temperatures and the Bedouin Arab cultural seasons of winter and spring. This pattern is different from those of Jewish and Christian groups in the same region, a difference not attributable to religion alone. Sociodemographic factors associated with the peak season of birth include traditional occupations of fathers, multiparae 2+, and traditional place of residence. This pattern has persisted over the past 15 years although it is less apparent among the more recently sedentarized Bedouin Arabs."
18083444,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Low educational attainment is a marker of socioeconomic status that correlates strongly with higher death rates from many conditions. No previous studies have analyzed national data to measure the number of deaths associated with lower education among working-aged adults (25-64 years) by race or ethnicity. Furthermore, no previous studies have examined comprehensively the relationship of education to cause-specific and all-cause mortality in the three largest racial or ethnic groups in the United States using national data. METHODS: Age-standardized, race/ethnicity-specific death rates from all causes and the 15 leading causes were measured among men and women aged 25-64 years by level of education based on U.S. national mortality data in 2001. The total number of deaths that potentially could be avoided among people aged 25-64 years was estimated by applying the mortality rates among college graduates (within each 5-year category of age, gender, and race/ethnicity) to each of the less-educated subpopulations. All analyses were performed in 2007. RESULTS: Nearly half (48%) of all deaths among men aged 25-64 years (white, black, and Hispanic), and 38% of all deaths in women would not have occurred in this age range if all segments of the population experienced the death rates of college graduates. Black men and women had the highest death rates from all causes combined and from many specific causes at nearly all levels of education, and the largest average life years lost before age 65 years. However, the total number of deaths associated with low education status was not confined to any single racial group. About 161,280 deaths in whites, 40,840 deaths in blacks, and 13,162 deaths in Hispanics in this age range were associated with educational disparity. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially avoidable factors associated with lower educational status account for almost half of all deaths among working-aged adults in the U.S.; these deaths are not confined to any single racial or ethnic group. These findings highlight the need for greater attention to social determinants of health."
7875917,1,a,"This study tested predictions specifying the influence of caregiver personality traits on negative outcomes of caregiving, health complaints and burden. Two-hundred and thirteen caregivers, who were caring for family members with dementia, were interviewed and their relatives were assessed on cognitive status and aggression. At follow-up conducted twenty-four months later, forty-five caregivers were still continuing to provide home care for their dependents. Caregivers who scored higher on a measure of neuroticism experienced higher levels of burden and health complaints both at initial and follow-up assessment. Caregiver extraversion-introversion did not influence the experience of caregiving. At both initial and final assessment, the ability to enjoy some aspects of caregiving, recreational activities, and satisfaction with social support from family and friends mitigated negative outcomes of caregiving, while appraising the dependent as more troublesome increased negative outcomes. Caring for more cognitively impaired and more aggressive dependents and being female increased negative outcomes initially. Personality traits and most other study variables demonstrated significant continuity across time for caregivers continuing home care."
7566843,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the epidemiologic characteristics of women who have mild dyskaryosis on cervical smear but cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade II or III at biopsy. METHODS: We analyzed information from 291 women (median age 33 years, range 17-69) observed for the first time with a single smear test showing mild dyskaryosis. All subjects underwent colposcopy, and histologic confirmation was obtained by biopsy. We compared the characteristics of women who had CIN I or no evidence of CIN with those of women with CIN II or III at biopsy. RESULTS: Twenty-eight women (10%) had CIN I at biopsy, 46 (15%) CIN II, and 23 (8%) CIN III. The frequency of CIN II or III tended to decrease with increasing education; compared with women reporting 11 or fewer years of education, the multivariate odds ratios (OR) of CIN II or III lesions was 0.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-0.9) in those reporting 11 years of education or more. Compared with nulliparas, the OR of CIN II or III was 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-3.5) for parous women. Furthermore, compared with never-smokers, the OR of CIN II or III was 2.3 (95% CI 1.0-5.4) for current smokers. Ex-smokers were at increased risk, too; the estimated multivariate OR was 3.8 (95% CI 1.9-7.6). Compared with women reporting one sexual partner, the multivariate ORs of CIN II or III were 1.4 and 2.3 for women reporting two to three or four or more sexual partners, respectively (chi 2(1) trend = 6.65, P < .05). CONCLUSION: Our results show that smoking is a risk indicator of CIN II or III in women with a single smear showing mild dyskaryosis. Parous women, those of low social standing, and those reporting multiple sexual partners also are at increased risk of CIN II or III."
25125929,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Female genital mutilation/cutting is a harmful practice which has effect on female's wellbeing. However, the practice has continued to prevail in many cultures. Research on the social determinants of the practice and its continuation are scarce. The objective of this study was to assess whether attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation is predicted by gender role perception among adolescents in Jimma zone. METHODS: This study used data collected in the first round of Jimma Longitudinal Family Survey of Youth. A total of 2084 adolescents were identified from 3700 households and one adolescent were interviewed from each household using structured questionnaire. Data on the socio-demographic characteristics, religiosity, access to electronic media, perception of gender role, attitude towards continuation of Female circumcision was collected. Descriptive and multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze the data using SPSS for windows version 16.0. Statically tests were performed at the level of significance of 5%. RESULTS: Of the 2084 adolescents, 1146 (55.0%) were aged 12-14 years, 1025 (49.2%) females and 749 (35.9%) from rural areas. The majority, 1289 (61.9%) were Muslims and 1351 (64.8%) Oromo. Five hundred seventy three (28.1%) of the male youth did not agree to the importance of marrying a circumcised girl. However, 149 (13.8%) and 258 (12.7%) agreed that it is very important and important, to marry a circumcised girl, respectively. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, perception of gender role, sex, place of residence, highest education in the household and religion remained to be important predictors of attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation after adjustment for age and ethnicity. Adolescents who had low gender role perception were 1.4 times more likely to have a positive attitude towards the continuation of the female genital mutilation (OR: 95%CI, 1.41: 1.02-1.94). Female adolescents were 36% less likely to support (P<0.01) the continuation of FGM compared to their male counter parts (OR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.49, 0.83). Compared to urban youth, those who live in semi urban and rural areas were 1.46 and 1.52 times more likely to have a positive attitude towards the continuation of the FGM practice, respectively (P<0.05). Similarly the Probability of having positive attitude towards the continuation of the FGM practice decreased steadily as the highest educational level in the household increased. CONCLUSION: One-fifth of the youth support the continuation of the practice. Low gender roles perception, being from the rural areas, household's lower level of education and being Muslim were strong predictors of the attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation. Improving perception of adolescents towards gender roles through effective behavior change communication, and involving religious leaders in the campaign against the practice of female genital mutilation is recommended as a useful strategy to ban the practice."
11450925,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to identify 'non-medical' datasets holding routinely collected information that might be used to measure and monitor the wider determinants of community health and well-being. METHODS: An expert panel discussion, involving public health and environmental health academics and professionals with expertise in a variety of backgrounds (including environmental health, housing, transport, community safety, public health, primary and secondary care), and interrogation of the Office for National Statistics database were carried out for the West Midlands region. The aim was to identify routinely collected 'non-medical' datasets containing information on the following factors: physical environment, crime, housing and homelessness, social services, socio-economic environment including employment, lifestyles, education, leisure and culture, transport and accidents. RESULTS: Fifty-six datasets were identified. Although 43 (77 per cent) were collected at least annually, few (17; 30 per cent) held data that were disaggregated and routinely available at the sub-local authority level. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a number of datasets that hold information relevant to health. However, no single dataset is likely to provide information on all dimensions of health and the determinants of health, and local agencies should consider carefully the strengths and weaknesses of each. Through the development of inter-sectoral working and multi-agency involvement at the local level there is now considerable scope to improve the quality of many of these datasets and to promote their use in the measurement and monitoring of community health."
18815713,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to quantify socioeconomic inequalities in low-back pain, neck-shoulder pain, and arm pain in the general working population in Oslo and to examine the impact of job characteristics on these inequalities. METHODS: All economically active 30-, 40-, and 45-year-old persons who attended the Oslo health study in 2000-2001 and answered questions on physical job demands, job autonomy, and musculoskeletal pain were included (N=7293). Occupational class was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status. The lower occupational classes were compared with higher grade professionals, and prevalences, prevalence ratios, prevalence differences, and population attributable fractions were calculated. RESULTS: There were marked, stepwise socioeconomic gradients for musculoskeletal pain, steeper for the men than for the women. The relative differences (prevalence ratios) were larger for low-back pain and arm pain than for neck-shoulder pain. The absolute differences (prevalence differences) were the largest for low-back pain. Physical job demands explained a substantial proportion of the absolute occupational class inequalities in low-back pain, while job autonomy was more important in explaining the inequalities in neck-shoulder pain and arm pain. The estimated population attributable fractions supported the impact of job characteristics at the working population level, especially for low-back pain. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, physical job demands and job autonomy explained a substantial proportion of occupational class inequalities in self-reported musculoskeletal pain in the working population in Oslo. This finding indicates that the workplace may be an important arena for preventive efforts to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in musculoskeletal pain."
8874461,1,a,The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to spread rapidly in developing countries. Heterosexual transmission accounts for almost three-quarters of infections. Current strategies have been effective in the prevention of HIV spread within certain groups but they have had limited impact on the general spread of the epidemic. There is a need to complement these strategies with approaches that will influence the social and environmental determinants of risk to enable those vulnerable to infection to protect themselves.
18561037,0,a,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the incidence and outcome of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Switzerland and to test the feasibility of a large cohort study with case identification in the first 24 hours and 6-month follow-up. METHODS: From January to June 2005, we consecutively enrolled and followed up all persons with severe TBI (Abbreviated Injury Score of the head region >3 and Glasgow Coma Scale <9) in the catchment areas of 3 Swiss medical centres with neurosurgical facilities. The primary outcome was the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) after 6 months. Secondary outcomes included survival, Functional Independence Mea - sure (FIM), and health-related quality of life (SF-12) at defined time-points up to 6 months after injury. RESULTS: We recruited 101 participants from a source population of about 2.47 million (ie, about 33% of Swiss population). The incidence of severe TBI was 8.2 per 100,000 person-years. The overall case fatality was 70%: 41 of 101 persons (41%) died at the scene of the accident. 23 of 60 hospitalised participants (38%) died within 48 hours, and 31 (53%) within 6 months. In all hospitalised patients, the median GOSE was 1 (range 1-8) after 6 months, and was 6 (2-8) in 6-month survivors. The median total FIM score was 125 (range 18-126); median-SF-12 component mea - sures were 44 (25-55) for the physical scale and 52 (32-65) for the mental scale. CONCLUSIONS: Severe TBI was associated with high case fatality and considerable morbidity in survivors. We demonstrated the feasibility of a multicentre cohort study in Switzerland with the aim of identifying modifiable determinants of outcome and improving current trauma care."
9179583,1,a,"Substance use is frequently assumed to be associated with higher levels of sexual risk-taking and lower levels of condom use. An analysis of 668 black, Hispanic and white low-income women at public health and public assistance facilities in Miami show that 19% engaged in risky sexual behavior over the preceding six months, 24% in substance use and 31% in condom use. Overall, substance users are nearly four and one-half times more likely to take sexual risks than nonusers, but are about half as likely to have relied on condoms. When the probability of condom use is considered in the context of both substance use and sexual risk, substance users who take sexual risks appear just as likely to rely on condoms as are nonusers who take sexual risks and those who do not (odds of 0.43-0.49). However, substance users who do not take sexual risks are much less likely to use condoms (odds of 0.15). This pattern holds among black, Hispanic and white women, and suggests that perceptions of risk and the risks that partners bring to sexual encounters may be more important determinants of condom use than substance use per se."
16234425,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Recent research has corroborated the notion that seasonality in suicide is more heterogeneous and less consistent than postulated by former scholars. This work investigates the smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland between the late 19th and the end of the 20th century. It includes analyses by region and by suicide method. METHODS: Monthly suicide frequencies in Switzerland are available for the period 1876-2000. Data on canton/region are available for the periods 1901-1920 and 1969-2000, and data on suicide method for the periods 1881-1920 and 1969-2000. Analyses focusing on the overall change rely on data aggregated by quinquennia. The Edwards' test and the peak-low ratio were used in univariate analyses of seasonality. Putative determinants of the peak-low ratio were examined using regression analysis with cantonal data. RESULTS: The decrease of seasonal effects in suicide applies to a period of more than 100 years in Switzerland. Big differences of seasonal effects have existed all the time with regard to specific methods and to specific regions. No seasonality was apparent in poisoning, and in Geneva and Basle City, respectively. However, the seasonal effects have been most impressive in drowning and hanging suicides, and in rural Catholic regions. In regression analysis, the decline in suicide seasonality is associated with the decline in the agricultural work force. CONCLUSIONS: The smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland has been a continuous long term process, which probably started by the end of 19th century. Seasonal effects in suicide will probably fade away in most regions of Switzerland and in most suicide methods. This process is in parallel with the disappearance of the traditional rural society."
10224633,1,a,"Age differences in the types of processing associated with impression change were examined. Young, middle-aged, and older adults formed an impression of a target based on a short vignette that described either positive or negative characteristics in 1 of 2 domains (ability vs. morality). Impression change was examined after presentation of additional behavioral information that was inconsistent with the original vignette. Replicating previous findings, younger adults changed their impressions in response to the consistency of the new information with the initial target description. In contrast, impression change in the 2 older groups was based on the trait diagnosticity of the original and new information, suggesting greater use of inferential, knowledge-based processing with age. The results indicate that qualitative difference exist in impression change processes, with different-aged individuals considering different types of information when constructing and updating social representations."
19027442,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study was to examine the need for psychosocial support in a consecutive sample of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). Out of an initial sample of 250 patients, 239 patients could be assessed at the beginning of their RT. Two hundred eight patients were reassessed at the end of RT 4-8 weeks later. METHODS: Measures comprised the Hornheide Screening Instrument, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, the Resilience Scale, and the Short Form 12 as a measure of health-related quality of life (QoL). Medical and radiological data were continuously registered. RESULTS: Within the sample, the need for psychosocial support as reflected in the screening instrument was high (>70%). Patients with the need for psychosocial support revealed significantly higher fatigue scores than patients who where not identified as needing psychosocial support. Furthermore, a negative correlation of the need for psychosocial support and QoL as well as resilience could be observed. QoL turned out to be the strongest predictor for the need of psychosocial support. CONCLUSION: The study confirmed that the need for psychosocial support is an important aspect in the treatment of cancer patients undergoing RT, which appeared to be powerfully predicted by the patients' health-related QoL. Fatigue turned out to be an important illness- and treatment-related factor that affects QoL. Psychological interventions for cancer patients should explicitly focus on decreasing patients' fatigue and increasing their resilience, thus improving their QoL."
8683633,1,a,"BACKGROUND: We and others have previously described a number of characteristics that are associated with delays in diagnosis and increased risk for inadequate treatment of older women and men with cancer. These characteristics include poor social support, limited access to transportation, and impaired cognition. However, there is little information on how these factors influence survival of older cancer patients. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine which patient characteristics predicted survival up to 10 years after the diagnosis of cancer. METHODS: In 1984, we initiated a population-based study of men and women who were 65 years of age or older, living in a six-county area of New Mexico, and newly diagnosed with cancer. For 646 individuals with cancer of the breast (n = 188), prostate (n = 247), or colon or rectum (n = 211), we assessed patient baseline characteristics, disease stage at diagnosis, and adequacy of treatment (definitive or nondefinitive) as determinants of survival for up to 10 years following diagnosis. Multivariate survival models were used to analyze the data; all P values were two-sided. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, we first included all patient characteristics, except the stage at diagnosis and the adequacy of treatment. In this initial analysis, the following were among variables that were significantly associated with patient survival: age, education, cancer knowledge, ethnic group, and cognitive status. When stage at diagnosis and adequacy of treatment were added to the model, both advanced stage at diagnosis (hazard ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval inverted question markCI inverted question mark = 1.3-2.1] for diagnosis at regional stage versus local stage; hazard ratio = 3.0 [95% CI = 2.0-4.7] for distant stage versus local stage) and inadequate treatment (hazard ratio = 1.6 [95% CI = 1.1-2.3]) were associated with poor survival. However, adding stage at diagnosis and adequacy of treatment to the analysis had little influence on the magnitude of the effect of patient characteristics on survival. In separate analyses of patient data by cancer site, receipt of nondefinitive therapy was associated with increased mortality among patients with colon/rectal cancer (hazard ratio = 7.8 [95% CI = 2.8-21.4]) and breast cancer (hazard ratio = 2.2 [95% CI = 1.1-4.3]) but not among patients with prostate cancer (hazard ratio = 1.0 [95% CI = 0.6-1.9]). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced stage at diagnosis and inadequate treatment of older cancer patients are associated with poor survival. Impaired cognition and inadequate education in elderly patients are also associated with poor survival. This decreased survival does not appear to be a consequence of known barriers to health care that are responsible for delays in diagnosis and for inadequate treatment. IMPLICATIONS: Efforts to facilitate early diagnosis and receipt of definitive treatment for cancer in older individuals may improve their survival."
8029140,1,a,"Very important is an analysis of epilepsy in wider context--not only clinically--due to its chronic course and high incidence. A problem of non-medical consequences due to the disease and related to social functioning of epileptic patients is widely discussed. The author attempted to carry out psychological analysis of all factors determining an attitude toward epileptic patients, basing on the results of research on a role of social determinants in epilepsy."
15345887,0,a,"BACKGROUND: At least 50 percent of the injections administered each year are unsafe, more particularly in developing countries, posing serious health risks. An initial assessment to describe injection practices; their determinants and adverse effects can prevent injection-associated transmission of blood borne pathogens by reducing injection frequency and adoption of safe injection practices. AIMS: To assess the injection practices in a large metropolitan city encompassing varied socio-cultural scenarios. STUDY SETTING AND DESIGN: Field based cross sectional survey covering urban non-slum, slum and peri-urban areas of a large metropolitan city. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Injection prescribers, providers and community members selected by random sampling from the study areas. Pre tested questionnaires assessed knowledge and perceptions of study subjects towards injections and their possible complications. Observation of the process of injection and prescription audit also carried out. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: MS Access for database and SPSS ver 11 for analysis. Point estimates, 95% confidence intervals, Chi Square, t test, one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The per capita injection rate was 5.1 per year and ratio of therapeutic to immunization injections was 4.4:1. Only 22.5%of injections were administered with a sterile syringe and needle. The level of knowledge about HIV and HBV transmission by unsafe injections was satisfactory amongst prescribers and community, but inadequate amongst providers. HCV was known to a very few in all the groups. The annual incidence of needle stick injuries among providers was quite high. CONCLUSION: A locally relevant safe injection policy based on multi disciplinary approach is required to reduce number of injections, unsafe injections and their attendant complications."
10320501,1,a,"This paper critically examines the notion of barriers as conceptualized in the literature and suggests an expanded orientation to more fully appreciate its complexity. This alternative approach not only takes into account factors and processes relevant to the individual that create constraints to utilization, but also acknowledges influences on the design and delivery of health care. These latter considerations determine the availability and characteristics of programmes and services that may or may not encourage or enable participation by persons of low income. A socio-ecological model is proposed that compels health care practitioners and researchers to acknowledge the many influences on utilization behaviour. The literature on barriers to prenatal care is subsequently reviewed and evaluated, with consideration given to the range of behavioural determinants suggested by the model. Finally, a case is made for qualitative methods for inquiry to further enhance knowledge about factors and processes influencing use of the health care system, including prenatal care. It is argued that these approaches lead to enhanced appreciation of behaviour as a social product and are consistent with the ideology of health promotion."
9383625,1,a,"This study evaluated the hypothesis that the behavior problems that place children at risk for victimization by peers are associated with victimization primarily when children are also at social risk for victimization. Social risk was defined as lacking supportive friends or as being rejected by the peer group. Participants were 229 boys and girls in the 3rd through 7th grades (M age = 11 years 2 months). As predicted, behavior problems (internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and physical weakness) were more strongly related to victimization when children had few friends, had friends who were incapable of fulfilling a protective function (e.g., were physically weak), or were rejected by peers than when children had more friends, had friends capable of defending them, or were better liked by peers. Results illustrate the principle that individual risk variables depend on social context for expression."
8546553,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The popularity and use of nontraditional therapies among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has grown enormously. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal cohort study of 56 patients aged 23 through 68 years with HIV infection followed up at the HIV clinic at a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center. OBJECTIVE: To assess the demographic and psychologic characteristics of patients who seek nontraditional remedies, and their impact on disease progression and mortality from HIV. METHODS: A standardized, self-administered questionnaire to assess the incidence and type of nontraditional therapies used by patients with HIV. Data on demographics, medical status, physical functioning (Karnofsky performance score), CD4 lymphocyte counts, depression (Beck Depression Inventory), coping (inventory of coping with illness scale), psychological and/or emotional stress (Profile of Mood States scores), and compliance with prescribed therapy were prospectively assessed on all patients at baseline and every 6 months. RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients reported using nontraditional therapies. Nontraditional therapy users were significantly older than patients who did not use such therapies (44 vs 38 years, P = .03); with 94% of patients who used nontraditional therapy being older than 35 years compared with 56% of conventional therapy users (P = .005). Alternative therapy use did not correlate with race, education, HIV-risk group affiliation, duration of HIV seropositivity, stage of HIV disease, CD4 cell count, or Karnofsky performance scores. Nontraditional therapy users reported greater community-based acquired immunodeficiency syndrome group support (P = .06), greater perceived social support (P = .08), and significantly higher recreational or ""street drugs"" use (P = .02). Depression, adaptive coping, and emotional stress were not different between nontraditional and conventional therapy users; however, nontraditional therapy users were significantly more assertive (P = .04). On follow-up, CD4 cell count, HIV disease progression, physical functioning, or mortality were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Recourse to nontraditional therapy is common among patients with HIV. Because of the possibility of untoward effects and potential adverse drug interactions associated with nontraditional therapy, HIV care givers should be aware of its use in their patients and take a history of nontraditional therapy first. Patients who choose nontraditional remedies do so not because they are depressed or emotionally disturbed, but rather because they seek greater control of the outcome of their disease. However, no beneficial effect on disease progression, CD4 cell count, or mortality was observed in these patients when compared with patients receiving only conventional medical therapy."
9612838,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated that physical activity serves an important preventive function against the development of cardiovascular disease. The recognition that U.S. children are often sedentary, coupled with the observation that physical activity habits tend to persist into adulthood, has prompted the investigation of exercise determinants consistent with social learning theory. The purposes of the present study were to identify social learning variables relevant to children's exercise and to explore the longitudinal predictive value of the determinants. METHODS: Data were collected from 111 families (N = 54 girls, N = 57 boys) who were interviewed in both Phase 1 (fifth and sixth grades) and Phase 2 (eight and ninth grades) of this study. Data from mothers (N = 111) were collected during both phases; data from 80 fathers were collected at Phase 2 only. RESULTS: The results of simultaneous stepwise regression analyses indicated that child's enjoyment of physical activity was the only consistent predictor of physical activity during Phase 1. At Phase 2, child's exercise knowledge, mother's physical activity, and child's and mother's friend modeling/support emerged as predictors for girls. For boys, child's self-efficacy for physical activity, exercise knowledge, parental modeling, and interest in sports media were important. Longitudinally, mother's self-efficacy, barriers to exercise, enjoyment of physical activity, and child's self-efficacy for physical activity were important for girls. Only child's exercise knowledge predicted boys' physical activity. The addition of information from fathers nearly doubled the explanatory power of the predictors for both genders. CONCLUSIONS: Socialization in the family unit exerts a tremendous influence on health-related behaviors such as exercise. The relative importance of determinants seems to differ for girls and boys and the pattern of these determinants appears to change over time."
9695890,1,a,"Assisting children and adolescents in adopting physically active lifestyles is an integral part of the health education and health promotion services provide by nurses in school, family, community, and primary care settings. In order to effectively engage in physical activity counseling, the determinants of physical activity must be understood and integrated into effective interventions for youths. This review of research literature includes a critique of intervention studies aimed at helping children and adolescents adopt active lifestyles that will be sustained throughout life. Social cognitive theory provided the theoretical basis for most of the studies reviewed but specification of how theory concepts were operationalized in the interventions was often unclear. Suggestions for increasing the rigor of theoretically based intervention studies aimed at promoting physical activity are proposed. Models and variables are identified that need further testing to determine their relevance to the promotion of physical activity during childhood and adolescence."
14674958,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess patient and/or illness characteristics associated with aspects of quality of life (QOL) in first-episode psychosis (FEP). METHOD: Patient characteristics, symptom ratings and Wisconsin QOL scale (client version) were assessed. Data were analysed with correlation coefficients and a hierarchical regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients presented with varying levels of QOL on different domains. The level of 'general satisfaction' was related to age of onset and social premorbid adjustment; 'weighted index of QOL' to social premorbid adjustment and inversely to educational premorbid adjustment; 'social relations' inversely to duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), length of prodrome and negative symptoms; 'psychological well-being' inversely to depression and educational premorbid adjustment; 'activities of daily living' to social premorbid adjustment and inversely to negative symptoms; and 'outlook on symptoms' to level of depression. CONCLUSION: Domains of self-rated QOL in FEP patients are differentially associated with malleable and non-malleable aspects of patient and illness characteristics."
16821508,0,a,"Many Americans do not have access to adequate medical care. Previous research on this problem focuses primarily on individual-level determinants of access such as income and insurance coverage. The role of community-level factors in helping or hindering individuals in obtaining needed medical care, however, has not received much attention. We address this gap in the literature by investigating the association between neighborhood residential instability and access to health care. Using individual-level data from the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and block-group level data from the 2000 decennial census, we find that individuals who live in neighborhoods with high residential turnover have worse health care access than residents of other neighborhoods. This association persists even when the prevalence of poverty, the supply of health care, and a variety of individual characteristics are held constant. We offer explanations for these findings and suggest directions for future research."
12237986,0,a,"PURPOSE: To develop a model of psychosocial and environmental influences on physical activity and psychophysiological health outcomes in women. DESIGN: A structural equation model was evaluated. Variables included 13 predictors (perceived benefits to exercise, self-efficacy, goal setting, restructuring plans, relapse prevention, social support, work hassles, community hassles, family hassles, age, race, income, and education), two mediator variables assessing physical activity (performance, physical activity level), and three health outcome variables (body size, vigor, and fatigue). METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 198, self-described sedentary women aged 30-60 years completed several paper-and-pencil tests, after which they were assessed physiologically by means of performance on a 1-mile walk, BMI, and percentage of body fat measurements. RESULTS: Overall, the model showed good fit. Self-efficacy, age, race, and income correlated with physical performance, and restructuring plans, relapse prevention, and age related to physical activity level. Performance was inversely correlated with body size, and physical activity level was directly related to perceived vigor. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that psychosocial determinants are important factors in understanding physical activity and psychophysiological health, and thus they should be incorporated into intervention programs focused on increasing physical activity and improving health outcomes in women."
18718651,0,a,"BACKGROUND: It is currently discussed whether allergic sensitization may start in utero under the influence of the maternal immune system and environmental determinants. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between allergen-specific cord blood (CB) IgE levels, parental sensitization, CB cytokine production, and environmental influences. METHODS: As part of an ongoing multicenter birth cohort study, allergen-specific IgE antibodies against 20 common seasonal, perennial, and food allergens were measured in blood samples from 922 neonates, 922 mothers, and 835 fathers. Supernatants from stimulated CB cells were assessed for the production of IL-5, IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TNF-alpha. RESULTS: Allergen-specific IgE antibodies were detectable in 23.9% of newborns. Contamination with maternal serum was excluded by several means of analyses, including the absence of IgA antibodies. Clear correlation between maternal and fetal IgE was found only for hen's egg, cow's milk, and soybean allergen. Fetal IgE correlated negatively with the level of IFN-gamma production, but not with IL-5 and IL-10. CONCLUSION: Allergen-specific IgE antibodies most probably of fetal origin are detectable in CB and correlate with a lowered CB IFN-gamma production."
15117117,0,a,"The first aim of the present study was to assess the validity of self-reported information concerning previous cancer. The second aim was to investigate determinants for under- and over-reporting of cancer. The Malmo Diet and Cancer Study is a prospective cohort study including 28,098 subjects. A questionnaire assessed lifestyle and medical conditions, e.g. previous cancer (yes/no). Cancer follow-up was made using the Swedish Cancer Registry (SCR). Questionnaire information concerning previous cancer was considered as test, and SCR information as golden standard (any tumour in the SCR, and specific sites were investigated). The validity analysis assessed agreement, sensitivity and specificity. Under- and over-reporting were studied in relation to lifestyle and socio-demographic factors. Sensitivity of the questionnaire in relation to malignant tumours was 0.82. It was 0.53 when cancer in situ of the breast and uterine cervix together with benign lesions of the urinary bladder and the nervous system were included in the cancer definition. Under- and over-reporting (in relation to malignant tumours) were more common among women and old people. Obesity, size of household, place of birth, smoking, social participation, educational level, type of employment, alcohol consumption and poor well-being was associated with under- or over-reporting in relation to at least one of the studied endpoints in either men or women. We conclude that there was a considerable disagreement between self-reported information and cancer registry data."
11965528,0,a,"All available polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentration data in ambient air obtained over the past 10 years in Germany were evaluated to clarify whether it is justified to use benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) as a marker compound for the total PAH exposure. The data basis comprises annual mean concentrations from 1990 to 1998 supplied by the emission protection authorities of the federal states with additional information on the region, year and site of measurement. The data are very heterogeneous with respect to sample size, the number of individual PAHs analyzed, place of origin and year. Nine of 25 individual compounds with sufficient sample size (74<N<518) were submitted to an explorative descriptive analysis and multiple regression analysis. Six compounds were selected for factor analysis to evaluate whether associations can be related to one or several background determinants. The concentration data of BaA, BeP, BaP, DBA, BghiP, COR, BbF, BkF and INP are not normally distributed and demonstrate great variability. Location, East-West differences persisting after the German reunion and time characterize the distributive patterns, e.g., from 1991 to 1997, a significant decrease in BaP could be determined based on the data from North Rhine-Westphalia (1991, N=51, median 1.6 ng/m(3); 1997, N=45, median 0.7 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). The BaP concentrations in the new federal states in the East (N=80, median 2.2 ng/m(3)) are about twice as high compared to the ones in the old federal states in the West (N=438, median 1.1 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). BaP measurements taken at sites characterized by traffic (1.8 ng/m(3)), industrial (1.3 ng/m(3)) or urban environment (1.3 ng/m(3)) rank significantly higher compared to measurements taken at rural sites (0.92 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). Factor analysis of the intercorrelation matrix of BaA, BeP, BaP, DBA, BghiP and COR yields one factor to explain 92% of the variability of the six individual PAHs. BaP shows the highest factor loading. These results confirm the common practice to use BaP as marker compound for the PAH exposure in ambient air."
1611863,1,a,One goal of supportive housing is to enlarge and improve the functioning of the social support networks of residents. The networks of a convenience sample of 42 residents were assessed using scales developed by Barrera. The size of the networks (11.5) was no larger than that reported for similar clients living in other types of community settings but the composition differed. Staff and co-residents appear to partially replace rather than add to family and friends. This is of concern because friends are uniquely important determinants of satisfaction. An association between perceived need for support and network size was also found. These findings suggest some positive influences but also raise questions about unintended negative consequences of living in artificially constructed social environments.
12290730,1,a,"The present study investigates the determinants and patterns of married women's labor force participation in Korea. Married women's employment in Korea is largely determined by age, urban residence, household characteristics of the husband's socioeconomic status, family income, fertility, and the lagged effect of work. Older age, rural residence, inferior household economic condition, and recent work experience are the major positive causes of married women's participation in the market work. On the other hand, younger women with preschool children, who currently reside in urban areas, enjoying better household economic conditions (due to higher socioeconomic status of husbands and/or higher family income) are the groups of women with the smallest probability of working in the market. Married women's employment pattern in Korea shows a pattern typical of less-developed and low-income countries in two aspects: married women working and characterized by a low level of education; the difference between urban and rural areas in terms of work participation pattern is remarkable. Although Korea belongs to the advanced group of currently industrializing countries, she lags behind with other developing countries in terms of married women's employment. Moreover, it is difficult to predict in advance that Korea would have similar experiences as those of contemporary advanced countries."
9247752,1,a,"Lifestyle related factors such as obesity, drinking habits, sodium and potassium intake and physical inactivity are well established determinants of high blood pressure. The role of psycho-social stressors, and in particular environmental work or home stress is far less clear. Some but not all studies using the Karasek 'job-strain' model have found a relationship with ambulatory blood pressure levels. Other studies using more 'subjective' measures of occupational stress have found no relationship or even inverse associations with blood pressure. The possibility that relationships between external stressors, personality factors and blood pressure levels might be mediated or confounded by coping mechanisms influencing lifestyle factors known to directly affect blood pressure has not been adequately studied. This paper briefly explores the paradigm relating environmental psychosocial stress, individual coping mechanisms, lifestyle behaviours and blood pressure levels. The issues are critical for research methodology in this area and for the development of better behavioural strategies for the prevention and nonpharmacological management of hypertension."
7945681,1,a,"The authors raise questions regarding the wide-spread calls emanating from lay and medical audiences alike to intensify the formal teaching of ethics within the medical school curriculum. In particular, they challenge a prevailing belief within the culture of medicine that while it may be possible to teach information about ethics (e.g., skills in recognizing the presence of common ethical problems, skills in ethical reasoning, or improved understanding of the language and concepts of ethics), course material or even an entire curriculum can in no way decisively influence a student's personality or ensure ethical conduct. To this end, several issues are explored, including whether medical ethics is best framed as a body of knowledge and skills or as part of one's professional identity. The authors argue that most of the critical determinants of physician identity operate not within the formal curriculum but in a more subtle, less officially recognized ""hidden curriculum."" The overall process of medical education is presented as a form of moral training of which formal instruction in ethics constitutes only one small piece. Finally, the authors maintain that any attempt to develop a comprehensive ethics curriculum must acknowledge the broader cultural milieu within which that curriculum must function. In conclusion, they offer recommendations on how an ethics curriculum might be more fruitfully structured to become a seamless part of the training process."
9683377,1,a,"This paper contributes to debates on the broad determinants of health and on the policy shift from curative to preventive and protective interventions. It addresses empirically the relative importance of influences on health with a multiple regression analysis of ecologic data from the 49 counties of Ontario. One model achieved high predictive power (that is, Adj R2 > 75%, p < 0.0001). Educational levels were a strong predictor of population health, showing a consistent inverse relationship with premature mortality ratios for both sexes and it was the strongest predictor for females. A low income variable supplied the strongest prediction for male mortality. This variable displayed a positive association with male mortality. Municipal expenditures on environmental protection exerted a negative effect on male mortality. These findings raise questions about the current directions of health policy in Ontario where the provincial government has reduced funding to social and environmental programs, while promising to maintain health care funding."
17307053,0,a,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus confers an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), in part owing to the effects of the metabolic syndrome, a clustering of risk factors that often accompanies the diabetic state. It is likely that the combination of hypertension, diabetic dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance produces an enhanced, atherogenic environment within the circulation. In keeping with a multifactorial approach to CVD risk reduction, intensive glycemic control could hypothetically have multiple beneficial effects on the metabolic and macrovascular systems of the patient with type 2 diabetes. When considering risk factor modification in this population, it is important to consider both the biological mechanisms of disease and the social determinants that contribute to disparities in health."
18386045,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: While health inequalities among employees are well documented, their variation and determinants among employee subpopulations are poorly understood. We examined variations in occupational class inequalities in health within four employment sectors and the contribution of working conditions to these inequalities. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the Helsinki Health Study in 2000-2002 were used. Each year, employees of the City of Helsinki, aged 40-60 years, received a mailed questionnaire (n = 8,960, 80% women, overall response rate for 3 years 67%). The outcome was physical health functioning measured by the overall physical component summary of SF-36. The socioeconomic indicator was occupational social class. Employment sectors studied were health care, education, social welfare and administration (n = 6,557). Physical and mental workload, and job demands and job control were explanatory factors. Inequality indices from logistic regression analysis were calculated. RESULTS: Occupational class inequalities in physical health functioning were slightly larger in education (1.47) than in the other sectors (1.43-1.40). Physical workload explained 95% of inequalities in social welfare and 32-36% in the other sectors. Job control also partly explained health inequalities. However, adjusting for mental workload and job demands resulted in larger health inequalities. CONCLUSION: Inequalities in physical health functioning were found within each employment sector, with minor variation in their magnitude. Physical workload was the main explanation for these inequalities, but its contribution varied between the sectors. In contrast, considering psychosocial working conditions led to wider inequalities. Improving physical working conditions among the lower occupational classes would help reduce health inequalities within different employment sectors."
8882839,1,a,"Theoretically, segregation and discrimination could affect mortality among blacks (African Americans) not only through their impact on social class (including the concentration of blacks in high-poverty areas) but also by influencing health care and psychosocial factors. This paper reviews evidence that variation in mortality rates for black infants and young adults living in large metropolitan areas is associated with the level of black-white segregation. A few metropolitan areas in California with relatively low levels of segregation are shown to have low black death rates and small black-white differences in mortality rates for infants and young adult males (15-44 years old). In-depth studies are needed in these areas. Longitudinal studies of potential ""risk factors"" for disease and death among blacks should include: personal histories of experiences with discrimination, psychological reactions to discrimination, segregation indexes, quality of life in residential areas, and social class indicators."
1583030,1,a,"Surveys of low-income women in Los Angeles County in 1985 and 1986 were used to examine the relative impact of child-bearing motivations versus life circumstances on the intention to have a(nother) child. Future child-bearing intentions are strongly related to current parity level regardless of marital status, race/ethnicity or economic status. Psychological motivating factors predict child-bearing intentions of nulliparous women, but not those of parous women. Multivariate analyses showed that motivation for parenthood and life circumstances combined predicted women's child-bearing intentions 88.6% of the time for nulliparous women, but 73.7% for parous women. These findings suggest that, in a low-income population, the onset of parenthood reduces the relationship between specific motivations for child-bearing and actual child-bearing intentions, and diminishes the ability to predict child-bearing intentions based on both attitudinal and social/structural factors."
15864975,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Delays in providing effective treatment for a patient with psychosis has significant negative effects on the outcome. This includes more hospitalizations, longer periods of inpatient care, slower and less complete recovery, and more frequent relapses. In this study, we established the Duration of Psychosis (DUP) in a sample of patients with first-episode psychosis and examined the pathways to care. METHODS: The sample comprised patients presenting with first-episode psychosis to the psychiatric services of the Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, from January to December 2000. The association between the DUP and demographic, clinical and social variables was examined. RESULTS: The DUP ranged from 0.1 to 336 months. The mean DUP was 32.6 (SD = 59.8) months, with a median of 12 months. Twenty four percent of the patients had sought consultation with a traditional healer prior to consulting a psychiatrist. The DUP of this group of patients was not significantly different from those who sought help elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: The DUP of our patients was longer than that reported in studies done in the West. The attitudes and beliefs of family in the Asian society are likely to be crucial in the pathways to care."
9653610,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine on a large scale the multiple medical and nonmedical factors that influence glycemic control in the general population of children with diabetes, we performed a nationwide French cross-sectional study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 2,579 patients aged 1-19 years with type 1 diabetes of > 1 year's duration. The study was center based: 270 centers were identified, 206 agreed to participate, and 147 included at least 90% of their patients. Questionnaires were completed by physicians interviewing patients and family, and HbA1c measurements were centralized. To identify explanatory variables for HbA1c level and frequency of severe hypoglycemia, we performed multiple regression analysis using all the quantitative variables collected and stepwise logistic regression for the qualitative variables. RESULTS: Mean HbA1c value for the whole population was 8.97 +/- 1.98% (normal 4.7 +/- 0.7% [SD]). Only 19 children (0.7%) had ketoacidosis during the 6 months before the study, whereas 593 severe hypoglycemia events occurred in 338 children (13.8%). Control was better in university-affiliated hospitals and centers following > 50 patients, reflecting the importance of access to experienced diabetologists. Children had a mean of 2.3 injections, allegedly performed 2.8 glucose measurements per day, and were seen an average of 4.6 times per year at the center. In the multiple regression analysis, 94% of the variance of HbA1c was explained by our pool of selected variables, with the highest regression coefficient between HbA1c and age (Rc = 0.43, P < 0.0001), then with daily insulin dosage per kilogram (Rc = 0.28, P < 0.0001), mother's age (Rc = 0.26, P < 0.0001), frequency of glucose measurements (Rc = 0.21, P < 0.0001), and diabetes duration (Rc = 0.14, P < 0.0001). Logistic regression identified quality of family support and dietary compliance, two related qualitative and possibly subjective variables, as additional explanatory determinants of HbA1c. The frequency of severe hypoglycemia was 45 per 100 patient-years and correlated with diabetes duration, but not with HbA1c levels or other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall results remain unsatisfactory, 33% of studied French children with type 1 diabetes had HbA1c < 8%, the value obtained in Diabetes Control and Complications Trial adolescents treated intensively. Diabetes management in specialized centers should be encouraged."
18083444,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Low educational attainment is a marker of socioeconomic status that correlates strongly with higher death rates from many conditions. No previous studies have analyzed national data to measure the number of deaths associated with lower education among working-aged adults (25-64 years) by race or ethnicity. Furthermore, no previous studies have examined comprehensively the relationship of education to cause-specific and all-cause mortality in the three largest racial or ethnic groups in the United States using national data. METHODS: Age-standardized, race/ethnicity-specific death rates from all causes and the 15 leading causes were measured among men and women aged 25-64 years by level of education based on U.S. national mortality data in 2001. The total number of deaths that potentially could be avoided among people aged 25-64 years was estimated by applying the mortality rates among college graduates (within each 5-year category of age, gender, and race/ethnicity) to each of the less-educated subpopulations. All analyses were performed in 2007. RESULTS: Nearly half (48%) of all deaths among men aged 25-64 years (white, black, and Hispanic), and 38% of all deaths in women would not have occurred in this age range if all segments of the population experienced the death rates of college graduates. Black men and women had the highest death rates from all causes combined and from many specific causes at nearly all levels of education, and the largest average life years lost before age 65 years. However, the total number of deaths associated with low education status was not confined to any single racial group. About 161,280 deaths in whites, 40,840 deaths in blacks, and 13,162 deaths in Hispanics in this age range were associated with educational disparity. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially avoidable factors associated with lower educational status account for almost half of all deaths among working-aged adults in the U.S.; these deaths are not confined to any single racial or ethnic group. These findings highlight the need for greater attention to social determinants of health."
16303256,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The post-partum blues is a transient mood alteration affecting most women a few days after delivery. Its stereotypic pattern of symptoms and time course, peaking on post-partum day 3-5, is suggestive of biological determinants superimposed on psycho-social factors. This study was designed to evaluate the possible role of the serotonin system during this period through assessment of brain tryptophan availability. METHODS: Blood samples from 50 women were collected just before (D0) and 3 days after (D3) delivery. Based on plasma concentration of tryptophan, amino acids competing with tryptophan for transport across the blood-brain barrier and on their respective affinities for this transporter, a brain tryptophan availability index (BTAI) was calculated and its variation correlated with the intensity of post-partum blues evaluated through the Kennerley and Gath score at D3. RESULTS: The BTAI showed a -15% decrease between D0 and D3 (p < 0.01, paired t-test). This decrease was not supported by a drop in plasma tryptophan since its level rather increased (+19%). There was no evidence for change in placental indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activity since the variation in plasma l-kynurenine (+12%) paralleled the change in tryptophan level. The decreased BTAI appeared the consequence of a dramatic increase in plasma levels of most amino acids, particularly the competitor aminoacids leucine, isoleucine, valine and tyrosine, during the early post-partum. This decrease in brain tryptophan availability was concomitant to the post-partum blues, whose intensity significantly correlated with the amplitude of BTAI variation (Pearson's coefficient -0.283, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that generalized, large amplitude metabolic and/or nutritional changes occurring in the early post-partum result in a transient decrease in brain tryptophan availability, partly accounting for the mood alteration referred to as the post-partum blues, a model for the triggering of puerperal mood disorder in vulnerable women."
22666725,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Studies on quality of life (QoL) on youths are limited and have not examined determinants of QoL for this cohort. AIMS: The current study seeks to examine the QoL of Jamaican youths and to build a model that identifies factors that explain QoL. MATERIALS AND METHOD: During the period June to August 2006, the Centre of Leadership and Governance, Department of Government, at the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus, conducted a stratified random probability survey of 1,338 respondents. Data were collected using a 166-item questionnaire. Of the sampled population (N=1,338), the proportion of those respondents age 18 to 25 years was 27% (N=364) and this constitutes the sample for the current study. The data were stored and retrieved in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 12). Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data, and logistic regression was used to establish the model. RESULTS: The quality of life of Jamaican youths was determined by 4 factors which explain 20% of the variability in quality of life. The parents' economic wellbeing has the most influence on the quality of life of Jamaican youths (OR=1.348; 95% CI: 1.35, 3.04), followed by moderate religiosity (OR=3.594; 95% CI: 1.47, 8.82), the extent of the welfarism of the state (OR=5.273; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.69) and gender (OR = 1.329, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.69). CONCLUSION: The current work has offered us an understanding of the determinants of QoL of youths and how interventions can be planned for in the future."
10176379,1,a,"Several studies have noted that, besides inadequate availability of health care services in many areas, especially the less developed countries, certain disease-specific and non-disease-specific cultural beliefs may influence people's health seeking behaviour. It has even been noted that health services may be underutilized and several health and child care instructions may be ineffective or ignored in traditional and transitional societies where people's ideas and behavioural patterns conflict with the knowledge being passed to them (Feyisetan and Adeokun 1992; Feyisetan 1992). Feyisetan and Adeokun (1992) argued that non-adoption of modern preventive and curative measures cannot be attributed to poverty alone since the costs of some preventive and curative measures are not exorbitant in several of these societies. Rather, they suggested that the gap between awareness of modern health measures and health seeking behaviour must be sought in the social and cultural determinants of behaviour in such matters as child care and disease management. Earlier studies have noted that children in Nigeria die mainly from malaria, diarrhoea, measles, neonatal tetanus, whooping cough, tuberculosis, and bronchopneumonia (Morley and MacWilliam 1961; Ogunlesi 1961; Morley, Woodland and Martin 1963, 1966; Baxter-Grillo and Leshi 1964; Animashaun 1977; Tomkins 1981). Because these diseases are preventable at low cost to the individual, there is a need to investigate why large percentages of children are still subjected to many episodes of these diseases. In this paper, we examine (1) the mothers' perceptions of the aetiology of the three most cited childhood diseases in our study areas, measles, diarrhoea and fever, and the effect of these perceptions on the mothers' suggested curative measures; and (2) the persistence of the belief in abiku and how this cultural belief can influence mothers' management of childhood diseases. Since, for most mothers, perceptions of the aetiology of the childhood diseases are rooted in cultural beliefs, a brief review of disease-specific cultural beliefs is undertaken. In order to determine the effect of socio-economic factors, the mothers' perceptions of the aetiology of the childhood diseases, their recommended curative measures and the belief in abiku are examined according to selected socio-economic variables."
12880519,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the vast scientific literature on the social determinants of health, there is still a debate on the extent to which this relationship remains in old age. The objective of this study was to examine the association between socioeconomic circumstances and health among older adults in a small town in Brazil. METHODS: The study was carried out in Bambui, a town of around 15 000 inhabitants that is located in the state of Minas Gerais, which is in southeastern Brazil. From 1 177 residents aged 65 years or older, 1 074 of them (91.2%) were interviewed and 997 (84.7%) were examined (physical measurements and blood tests). Those in the lowest third of the distribution of total household monthly income, with an income of less than US$ 240 per month, were compared with those who had an income above that level. RESULTS: Lower family income was independently associated with: (1) some lifestyle risk factors (less consumption of fresh fruits or vegetables and less frequent exercise during leisure time in the preceding 30 days), (2) several indicators of worse health status (General Health Questionnaire score, self-rated health, self-rated visual acuity, level of difficulty in walking 300 meters, inability to perform routine activities because of a health problem in the preceding 2 weeks, and seropositivity for Trypanosoma cruzi), (3) a higher number of nonprescribed medications used in the preceding 3 months, and (4) a higher number of hospitalizations in the preceding 12 months. Obesity was more frequent in the higher-income group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not confirm observations in some developed countries of a lack of association between socioeconomic status and health among the aged. Our results showed that a small difference in monthly family income was sufficiently sensitive to identify elderly persons in worse health, even within a community that appears to be uniformly poor."
17888013,0,a,"The aim of this study was to evaluate determinants of consultation for migraine in a representative sample of the French general adult population. We interviewed 10,032 subjects, of whom 1534 fulfilled the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine. These were categorized into migraine, probable migraine and chronic migraine. Information was collected on consultation experience; 436 subjects (28.4%) had never consulted for headache, 473 (30.8%) were in active consultation and 625 (40.7%) had previously consulted but lapsed. Subjects with chronic migraine showed the highest active consultation rates (51.8%). All subjects completed rating instruments for headache [Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6], psychiatric (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scale) and psychological [Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), Brief COPE Inventory and Coping Strategy Questionnaire] variables. The strongest determinants of active consultation were BIPQ scores, HIT-6 scores and migraine type. Consultation was associated with maladaptive coping strategies (social support, emotional expression and acceptance). Determinants of remaining in consultation were catastrophizing coping scores and previous consultation experience."
10363349,1,a,"The main objectives of this article are to describe the effects of mediated learning experience (MLE) strategies in mother-child interactions on the child's cognitive modifiability, the effects of distal factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, mother's intelligence, child's personality) on MLE interactions, and the effects of situational variables on MLE processes. Methodological aspects of measurement of MLE interactions and of cognitive modifiability, using a dynamic assessment approach, are discussed. Studies with infants showed that the quality of mother-infant MLE interactions predict later cognitive functioning and that MLE patterns and children's cognitive performance change as a result of intervention programs. Studies with preschool and school-aged children showed that MLE interactions predict cognitive modifiability and that distal factors predict MLE interactions but not the child's cognitive modifiability. The child's cognitive modifiability was predicted by MLE interactions in a structured but not in a free-play situation. Mediation for transcendence (e.g., teaching rules and generalizations) appeared to be the strongest predictor of children's cognitive modifiability. Discussion of future research includes the consideration of a holistic transactional approach, which refers to MLE processes, personality, and motivational-affective factors, the cultural context of mediation, perception of the whole family as a mediational unit, and the ""mediational normative scripts."""
11660018,1,a,"The results of empirical research in psychology and psychiatry are increasingly being used to formulate as well as understand problems at the interface of law and psychiatry. There has been a proliferation of studies, such as the determinants of individual competence or threat to self or others, the results of which are influencing policy and legislative decisions as well as buttressing holdings in court cases. In this article, I explore the issues of interpretation of epidemiological studies, particularly the role of ideological positions on the design and results of empirical findings, the importance of the way data are interpreted, and the role of ideologies in the way research findings are presented to provide support for policy positions. Two levels of analysis are involved in determining the validity of a study. The first addresses the questions of whether the study meets the statistical and epidemiological requirements for reliable results. These include considerations such as the appropriateness of the study design and methods for gathering and interpreting data. The second focuses on the underlying framework of the study. This involves factors such as the perspectives and values of those conducting the study, the explicit and implicit dominating ideologies where they operate, and the extent to which the study is constructed to reaffirm specific ideologies. This level of analysis is essential for disclosing the influences of ideologies on the results of studies and the way in which data are interpreted. In this article, I try to demonstrate through critiques of selected studies that the first stage of analysis is insufficient without an examination of underlying preconceived values to establish the meaningfulness of results."
9642740,1,a,"Cataracts, often associated with aging (80%), are a major cause of blindness (more than 50% of cases of blindness in Africa), and for this reason, up to 80% of cases could be predicted or prevented. The socio-economic costs (care and loss of productivity) are increased by morbidity (blindness, impaired vision, congenital, complicated or infected cataracts). The biological determinants of cataracts account for the difficulties in developing and implementing effective preventive action. These epidemiological determinants (prevalence, incidence, increase in life expectancy) account for the size of the public health problem. The surgical removal of cataracts in Africa currently only deals with about 1% of the prevalence rate or 10% of the incidence. Cataracts are, however, easy to cure, resulting in great benefits to public health. The waiting list for cataract operations is very short because of social and cultural barriers which limit the acceptability and accessibility of treatment. Rather than formalizing the dogmatic choices of surgical techniques and structures (fixed, mobile, advanced?), we should promote all phases of treatment from active screening and the selection of cases for surgery to the follow-up of interventions and their impact. We should also increase public awareness, develop a system for the transfer of information that is effective and improve the cost-effectiveness and capacity of the region to provide high quality services on a large scale. We must promote patient satisfaction at all stages of treatment: its quality, its delivery and its low cost."
15798114,0,a,"The innovative practice that resulted from the Ottawa Charter challenges public health knowledge about programming and evaluation. Specifically, there is a need to formulate program theory that embraces social determinants of health and local actors' mobilization for social change. Likewise, it is imperative to develop a theory of evaluation that fosters reflexive understanding of public health programs engaged in social change. We believe advances in contemporary social theory that are founded on a critique of modernity and that articulate a coherent theory of practice should be considered when addressing these critical challenges."
18083447,0,a,"BACKGROUND: With increased numbers of children attending child care, this setting presents an ideal opportunity to promote physical activity and the early development of healthy behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between the childcare environment and physical activity behavior of preschool children. METHODS: Aspects of the environment hypothesized to influence children's physical activity were assessed in 20 childcare centers using the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) instrument. Physical activity behavior was assessed over 2 days using direct observation. RESULTS: Children in centers with supportive environments achieved more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (15% of observations vs 9%; effect size [ES]=1.17), spent less time in sedentary activities (50% vs 61%; ES=-1.52), and had higher mean physical activity levels (2.68 vs 2.43; ES=1.41) compared to centers with less supportive environments. Facets of the physical and social environment related to physical activity behavior included active opportunities, portable play equipment, fixed play equipment, sedentary environment, and physical activity training and education. CONCLUSIONS: Previous research indicates that the childcare center that children attend significantly affects physical activity behavior. The current findings extend this evidence by identifying aspects of the childcare environment that relate to the physical activity behavior of children. These factors should be considered when identifying determinants of physical activity and designing interventions."
1966685,1,a,"Treatment of alcohol problems typically focuses on the cessation of drinking. Although cessation is necessary and important to achieving sobriety, this article suggests that maintenance of sobriety is a crucial, but oft ignored, component of effective treatment. Alcohol relapse is discussed in the context of aftercare treatment employing a relapse prevention approach. Within this model, relapse is not automatically defined as a treatment failure but as an opportunity for intervention and the interruption of the relapse process. Determinants and predictors of relapse are discussed, and assessment and intervention strategies provided. A case study illustrates the components of the relapse process and the interventions employed to maintain continued sobriety."
9561644,1,a,"International comparison of food intake and health studies amongst the aged is providing new insight into the importance of food culture in social context for healthy aging. At same time the possible variance in eating behavior compatible with good health requires consideration. The IUNS (International Union of Nutritional Sciences) FHILL (Food Habits in Later Life) Project, comprises (1) a morbidity study on about 2,000 elderly in 13 communities (now available on CD Rom) and (2) a mortality follow-up study. In the morbidity study, a total health assessment score or Later Life Status Score (LLSS) has been considered in relation to non-nutritional and nutritional factors. The elderly Greek cohorts aged 70+ in Melbourne. Australia (M = 94, F = 95) and Spata, Greece (M = 51, F = 53) have been used as a model for multivariate analyses to determine separately the importance of non-nutritional (well-being, memory, general health, medication-use, activities of daily living, exercise, social activity and social networks scores) and nutritional variables (intake of food groups g/day, food group variety scores, nutrients) in accounting for LLSS. A mortality follow-up study on the elderly cohort in Spata, Greece has also been completed and published. The findings from these preliminary analyses on the Greek cohorts will be reviewed as an example of how food culture may be influencing both quality of life and survival in Greek elderly. The most important non-nutritional determinants of LLSS in Greeks included: mobility and independence (exercise and activities of daily living), well-being and memory (collectively explained 80% of the variation of LLSS). For nutritional variables, a high intake and variety of plant foods (in particular vegetables, legumes and fruit); a high intake and variety of seafood and a low intake of meat emerged with statistical and biological significance. Results from the mortality study also agree with findings from the morbidity study--particularly the importance of the overall traditional greek food culture, with its emphasis on plant derived food of various kinds, as opposed to individual food categories, in protecting against premature death. Strategies are advanced which may optimise nutritionally related health problems amongst the aged around the globe."
10162860,1,a,"Occupational safety and health researchers seek to conduct effective cancer awareness campaigns to increase agricultural workers' skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Georgia undertook such a project using a social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) conceptual model, with its objectives focusing on personal determinants of and environmental influences on farmers' behavior. One underused strategy to increase the success of health campaigns, formative evaluation, was undertaken during year one of the demonstration project, with four goals. These included an assessment of: (1) the availability of societal resources to support farmers' practices, (2) the affordability for farmers to follow through with behaviors being promoted, (3) the social support for behaving in ways that reduce farmers' skin cancer risk, and (4) farmers' current knowledge, outcome expectations, and self-efficacy in this regard. Formative evaluation revealed an absence of information, products, services, and social support for farmers' skin cancer prevention and detection. As a result, the Georgia project's plan was refined to include specific activities aimed at increasing the environmental support for health promotion activities relating to farmers' skin cancer prevention and detection. These include a seminar for rural primary care physicians and public health nurses to increase knowledge and skills relating to conducting clinical skin exams; programs for agricultural extension agents, cotton scouts, and 4-H groups to provide opportunities to learn more about and practice sun safety; and a feed and seed store campaign."
15797980,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic illness with an unpredictable and variable course, profoundly affects the quality of life (QOL). General health questionnaires are used to assess QOL in SLE, but a disease-specific instrument could offer enhanced responsiveness and content validity. We detail the steps we took to develop and validate a new SLE-specific QOL instrument, SLEQOL. METHODS: Rheumatology professionals nominated items that they felt were important determinants of QOL of SLE patients. One hundred SLE patients were asked to assess the importance and frequency of occurrence of these items and to suggest those that had not been listed. Item reduction was performed using Rasch model and factor analyses to create a new questionnaire in English. This final questionnaire was administered to a cohort of 275 patients to study its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Fifty-one items covering a wide range of QOL concerns were identified. The patients' responses led to the elimination of 11. The new questionnaire of 40 items was found to have Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 and to consist of eight domains covering physical, mental and social QOL issues. It has good test-retest reliability, poor to fair cross-sectional correlation with the SF-36, with poor correlation with lupus activity or damage indices. The SLEQOL was more responsive to change than the SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new 40-item SLEQOL in English and showed that it is valid for use in SLE patients in Singapore. It offers better content validity and responsiveness to change than the SF-36."
12882263,0,a,"Although the place of death of patients with terminal cancer is influenced by multiple factors, few studies have systematically investigated its determinants. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of the patients' sociodemographic, clinical and support network variables on the place of death of terminally ill cancer patients under the care of home care agencies in Japan. Among 528 patients from 259 home care agencies, 342 (65%) died at home and 186 (35%) died at a hospital. From the multivariate logistic regression model, patients who expressed the desire for receiving home care at referral [odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.19, 1.09-4.40] in addition to the family caregiver's desire for the same (OR, 95%CI: 3.19, 1.75-5.81), who had more than one family caregiver (OR, 95%CI: 2.28, 1.05-4.94), who had the support of their family physician (OR, 95%CI: 2.23, 1.21-4.08), who were never rehospitalized (OR, 95%CI: 0.04, 0.02-0.07), who received more home visits by the home hospice nurse during the stable phase under home hospice care (OR, 95%CI: 1.25, 1.02-1.53), and who were in the greatest functionally dependent status during the last week prior to death (OR, 95%CI: 8.60, 4.97-14.89) were more likely to die at home. Overall, this model could accurately classify 95% of the places of death, which is higher than other published studies. A clearer understanding of factors that might influence the place of death of terminally ill cancer patients would allow healthcare professionals to modify healthcare systems and tailor effective interventions to help patients die at their place of preference."
9618614,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Marijuana use among high school seniors increased during most of the 1970s, decreased throughout the 1980s, and has been increasing again during the 1990s. Earlier analyses of the classes of 1976 through 1986 attributed the historic trends during that period to specific changes in views about marijuana. This study examined whether recent increases in marijuana use among seniors and among students in earlier grades reflect similar processes. METHODS: Multivariate regression analyses were conducted on data from large annual nationwide surveys of high school seniors from 1976 through 1996 (approximate n = 61,000) and 8th and 10th graders from 1991 through 1996 (n's = 87,911 and 82,475, respectively). RESULTS: Individual lifestyle factors (grades, truancy, religious commitment, evenings out for recreation) correlated substantially with marijuana use but did not explain the historic changes in marijuana use. Rather, decreases in perceived risk of harmfulness and in disapproval can account for the recent increases in all 3 grades and for earlier decreases among seniors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that perceived risks and disapproval are important determinants of marijuana use. Accordingly, prevention efforts should include realistic information about risks and consequences of marijuana use."
8180289,1,a,"The concerns of relatively powerless groups may not be adequately addressed by health-care decisions based on market forces and on considerations of the general population. Calculations of the number of Navajo women at risk of unintended pregnancy suggest that several hundred such pregnancies would have occurred as a result of the withdrawal of intrauterine devices from the United States' market. Analysis of birthrate data confirms this estimate: approximately four to five percent of Navajo births in 1988 may have been due to this market withdrawal. Available data are limited in their ability to assess impacts on small groups of health-policy decisions made for the population as a whole. A mechanism for surveilling such effects needs to be established to protect the interests of such groups, particularly when they have restricted alternatives."
19171669,0,a,"Despite the proposed ecological and systems-based perspectives of the settings-based approach to health promotion, most initiatives have tended to overlook the fundamental nature of ecosystems. This paper responds to this oversight by proposing an explicit re-integration of ecosystems within the healthy settings approach. We make this case by focusing on water as an integrating unit of analysis. Water, on which all life depends, is not only an integral consideration for the existing healthy settings (schools, hospitals, workplaces) but also highlights the ecosystem context of health and sustainability. A focus on catchments (also know as watersheds and river basins) exemplifies the scaled and upstream/downstream nature of ecosystems and draws into sharp focus the cross-sectoral and transdisciplinary context of the social and environmental determinants of health. We position this work in relation to the converging agendas of health promotion and ecosystem management at the local, regional and global scales--and draw on evidence from international initiatives as diverse as the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Using water as a vehicle for understanding the systemic context for human wellbeing, health promotion and disease prevention draws inevitable attention to key challenges of scale, intersectoral governance and the complementary themes of promoting resilience and preventing vulnerability. We conclude by highlighting the importance of building individual and institutional capacity for this kind of integration--equipping a new generation of researchers, practitioners and decision-makers to be conversant with the language of ecosystems, capable of systemic thought and focused on settings that can promote both health and sustainability."
9698119,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Much of the information on the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) comes from ecological, cross-sectional and longitudinal mortality studies. Such studies may present methodological problems which affect cohort studies and case-control studies to a lesser degree. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted into the relationship between SES and IHD, as reported by cohort and case-control studies in which SES had been measured by education or occupation. A bibliographic search, covering the period 1960-1993, was carried out using Index Medicus, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts, Social Scisearch and the references cited in papers identified in such databases. Finally, 34 studies were selected, with data being extracted separately by two reviewers working independently. Where differences of opinion arose, these were resolved by discussion between the two. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify determinants of inter-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Risk of IHD was inversely related to educational level in the period 1982-1993. There was a lower risk of IHD among manual workers versus non-manual workers until approximately 1970; thereafter the relationship became inverted. The odds ratio for IHD in manual workers rose progressively over the period 1960-1993, something that could not be explained by study design, study size, study country or control for confounding factors. Education- and occupation-related differences in risk of IHD affected all SES levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings agree with those yielded by ecological, cross-sectional and longitudinal mortality studies, although they cannot be extrapolated to women, non-white ethnic groups, or developing countries. The inversion of the relationship between SES and IHD, and the increase in socioeconomic differences in IHD in recent years suggest that the problem is potentially controllable and that the necessary policies should be implemented as a matter of urgency."
12949333,0,a,"The mission of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) is comprehensive in scope and establishes the capacity, structure, and function for the MCHB to continually improve the health and well-being of pregnant women and children. The MCHB works in partnership with states and has broad authority to improve access to care and ensure the provision of quality preventive and primary care services. Specific provisions of legislation establish the framework for accomplishing this mission. With the increasing recognition of the social, economic, and environmental determinants of child health and the inequities that exist in access and quality of care for children, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) has set the following 3 goals for year 2003: 1) To eliminate disparities in health status outcomes through the removal of economic, social, and cultural barriers to receiving comprehensive, timely, and appropriate health care; 2) To ensure the highest quality of care through the development of practice guidance and data monitoring and evaluation tools; the use of evidence-based research; and the availability of a well-trained, culturally diverse workforce; and 3) To facilitate access to care through the development and improvement of the maternal and child health infrastructure and systems of care to enhance the provision of necessary, coordinated, quality health care. Priority MCHB strategies to accomplish these goals include improving and expanding 1) the cultural competence of providers (in particular to decrease sudden infant death syndrome [SIDS] among minorities), 2) emergency medical services for children, 3) health and safety in child care, 4) quality of primary pediatric care, and 5) the providing of every child with a medical home."
19573222,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Identification of subpopulations at high risk of overweight and obesity is crucial for prevention and management of obesity in different socioeconomic status (SES) categories. The objective of the study was to describe disparities in the prevalence of overweight and obesity across socioeconomic status (SES) groups in 18-74 year-old French adults. METHODS: Analyses were based on a multistage stratified random sample of non-institutionalized adults aged 18-74-years-old from the French Nutrition and Health Survey (ENNS), a cross-sectional national survey carried out in 2006/2007. Collected data included measured anthropometry (weight, height and waist circumference (WC)), demographic and SES data (occupation, education and frequency of holiday trips as a marker of family income). SES factors associated with overweight (BMI > or = 25) and central obesity (WC above gender-specific references) were identified using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Almost half (49.3%) of French adults were overweight or obese and 16.9% were obese. In men, the risk of overall overweight or obesity was associated with occupation (p < 0.05), whereas the risk of central obesity was independently associated with occupation (p < 0.05) and frequency of holiday trips (p < 0.01). In women, both overall and central overweight and obesity were independently associated with educational level (respectively p < 10(-3) and p < 10(-3)) and frequency of holiday trips (respectively p < 0.05 and p < 10-3). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was found to be similar to that of several neighbouring western European countries, and lower than the UK and eastern Europe. Risk of being overweight or obese varied across SES groups both in men and women, but associations were different between men and women, indicating differing determinants."
10894258,0,a,"CONTEXT: If the national health objective of reducing unintended pregnancy is to be met, a better understanding is needed of barriers to women's acquisition and use of contraceptives. METHODS: A sample of 311 Missouri women who were seeking pregnancy tests in public health department clinics in 1997 and who said their potential pregnancy was unintended were asked about potential barriers to family planning. Factors affecting contraceptive use among these women were examined by frequency of use, insurance status, education and race. RESULTS: In general, the women mostly disagreed that particular factors were potential barriers to contraceptive use. For only one item--worry over the potential side effects of the hormonal injectable contraceptive--did a majority agree or strongly agree that it was a barrier to method use in the previous six months. Women who used a contraceptive infrequently were more likely than frequent users to identify 33 factors in nine areas as being potential barriers to contraceptive use. These ranged from factors involving access to services and condom-specific issues to cost-related concerns, social norms, pregnancy denial, embarrassment over discussing or obtaining birth control, worry about side effects and experience with forced sex, among others. Perceived barriers differed somewhat by insurance status in the areas of access, embarrassment, side effects and forced sex. For example, women with no insurance coverage reported a higher level of agreement that transportation problems had hindered their access to a clinic than did women with private insurance. Level of education affected agreement only in the area of side effects, with more-educated women expressing greater concern about side effects than less-educated women. The respondent's race affected agreement in six areas: access, social norms, pregnancy denial, embarrassment, forced sex and other miscellaneous concerns, such as condom use and relationship issues. CONCLUSION: Better education and improved access to and delivery of services might address several factors affecting contraceptive use that are associated with unintended pregnancy. Some barriers, however, such as those related to self-efficacy, self-esteem and fatalistic attitudes about pregnancy, would be much harder for family planning providers to resolve."
17915325,0,a,"The Observation Scale for Aggressive Behavior (OSAB) has been developed to evaluate inpatient treatment programs designed to reduce aggressive behavior in Dutch forensic psychiatric patients with an antisocial personality disorder, who are ""placed at the disposal of the government"". The scale should have the sensitivity to measure changes in the possible determinants of aggressive behavior, such as limited control of displayed negative emotions (irritation, anger or rage) and a general deficiency of social skills. In developing the OSAB 40 items were selected from a pool of 82 and distributed among the following a priori scales: Irritation/anger, Anxiety/gloominess, Aggressive behavior, Antecedent (to aggressive behavior), Sanction (for aggressive behavior) and Social behavior. The internal consistency of these subscales was good, the inter-rater reliability was moderate to good, and the test-retest reliability over a two to three week period was moderate to good. The correlation between the subscales Irritation/anger, Anxiety/gloominess, Aggressive behavior, Antecedent, Sanction was substantial and significant, but the anticipated negative correlation between these subscales and the Social behavior subscale could not be shown. Relationships between the corresponding subscales of the OSAB and the FIOS, used to calculate concurrent validity, yielded relatively high correlations. The validity of the various OSAB subscales could be further supported by significant correlations with the PCL-R and by significant but weak correlations with corresponding subscales of the self-report questionnaires. The Observation Scale for Aggressive Behavior (OSAB) seems to measure aggressive behavior in Dutch forensic psychiatric inpatients with an antisocial personality disorder reliably and validly. Contrary to expectations, a negative relationship was not found between aggressive and social behavior in either the OSAB or FIOS, which were used for calculating concurrent validity."
8218426,1,a,"Post-psychotic depression (PPD) is defined as the development of depression during the phase of remission of schizophrenia. Two groups of DSM-III-R schizophrenics, one with PPD and the other without PPD (30 subjects in each group) were compared. Significantly more patients in PPD group belonged to nuclear families, had longer duration of psychotic phase of the illness, were hospitalised more frequently and had more sadness and anxiety-somatisation during florid illness phase. The PPD group also had more past history of depression. Although PPD patients had better premorbid personal-social adjustment in comparison with non-PPD group, they perceived themselves to be lacking in social support and had experienced more stressful life events. For patients in the PPD group, stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed age of onset, sadness during florid psychotic state, premorbid adjustment, social support and life events as significant determinants of severity of depression in the post-psychotic phase."

The implicit incentives for insurers to engage in risk selection can only be curtailed using appropriate systems of risk-adjusted equalization payments among insurers. To develop these systems, predictors of individual utilization patterns have to be identified, e.g. via regression analysis using previous utilization data. In some countries such as Germany, such data are hardly ever available. In the early nineties, a number of sickness funds participated in an experiment in which individual utilization data were collected. Our data set covers more than 70,000 members of company sickness funds over a 5-year period. We analyze socio-demographic determinants of utilization which could be used as risk adjusters in a risk equalization scheme. Our results suggest that besides age and sex, the set of risk adjusters should include income, family status and a dummy for the last year of life."
12319620,1,a,"""The present study contributes to the literature on international migration by examining social, demographic and contextual factors that influence modes of labor market incorporation and occupational cost among new immigrants during their first years after migration. The data for the analysis were obtained from the 1983 Census of Population conducted by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics. The analysis focuses on men who immigrated to Israel between 1979 to 1983.... The data reveal that the likelihood of finding employment, the mode of labor market incorporation, and the size of the occupational cost are significantly affected by geocultural origin, occupation in the country of origin, and individual-level demographic and human capital resources. The meaning of the differentiated effects are discussed in detail. The findings point toward two central aspects that should be examined in the study of labor market incorporation of new immigrants: employment status and occupational cost."""
18665062,0,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study presents a case analysis of how 3 urban medical centers with differing ownership models, within 1 metropolitan area, ration access to uncompensated care to uninsured patients. METHODS: Data was triangulated from 3 sources: hospital financial reports by service line for a fiscal year, a survey of 292 self-pay patients, and the self-pay policies and practices of clerical personnel described in a previous publication. RESULTS: Although the public, for-profit and not-for-profit institutions used different strategies for managing self-pays, there were also commonalities in the experiences indigent patients reported. The public institution provided the broadest access to the largest percentage of self-pay patients but offset the burden with the most successful prepayment and collection practices. The for-profit site obeyed federal regulations mandating emergency care but severely curtailed other services, and the not-for-profit limited assess (but not to the extent of the for-profit) and pursued collection (but not to the extent of the public). At all sites, actual practices by clerical staff often diverged from institutions' written self-pay policies. The probability of being turned away because of inability to pay ranged from 0% to 40% with front line personnel exercising considerable discretion on a case-by-case basis. CONCLUSIONS: Large institutional providers balance their particular social and legal obligations with strategies to limit access and optimize prepayment and collection. Stated policies generally do not reflect the practices of personnel. Uninsured patients are forced to navigate a capricious system that manages them as a liability rather than as a legitimate client."
14571309,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Canada with wide, unexplained regional variations in heart disease mortality. However, no studies to date have explored the relationship between a number of health region characteristics and regional variation in heart disease mortality rates across Canada. INTRODUCTION: We studied the contribution of various traditional cardiac risk factors, social determinants of health and other community characteristics to regional variations in heart disease mortality rates across Canada. METHODS: Cardiovascular disease and ischemic heart disease (IHD) age-standardized mortality rates were obtained from Statistics Canada for three years - 1995 to 1997. Health region characteristics were taken from the 2000/2001 Canadian Community Health Survey, and the 1996 Canadian Census and the Labour Force Survey. Linear regression analyses and analyses of variance were employed to identify relationships between these health region characteristics and CVD and IHD mortality rates. RESULTS: Significant regional variations in CVD mortality rates per 100,000 population were observed. Newfoundland and Labrador had the highest CVD and IHD mortality rates, while Nunavut and the Northwest Territories had the lowest CVD and IHD mortality rates. Health region smoking and unemployment rates were identified as the most important factors associated with CVD and IHD mortality at the health region level. CONCLUSIONS: Significant regional variations in age-standardized CVD and IHD mortality were noted both at the provincial/territorial level and the health region level. Efforts to reduce CVD and IHD mortality in Canada require attention to both traditional risk factors (eg, smoking) and broader determinants of health (eg, unemployment rates)."
14964928,0,a,"PURPOSE: This article discusses a research study that explored how rural people in Saskatchewan, Canada, respond to stressful events and adversity, without outside interventions. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 17 individuals who were living or had lived on a farm in Saskatchewan. The participants' definitions of resiliency, their experiences with resiliency or lack of resiliency, and what they identified as the barriers to and enhancers of resiliency in their lives were discussed. FINDINGS: Resiliency was defined as a process and interactive model that included ""bouncing back"" from adversity, coping, and acquiring skills, such as problem solving and learning. Resiliency was dynamic, temporal, and relational and was both proactive and reactive. There were both internal and external barriers to and enhancers of resiliency. Barriers to resiliency included fear, isolation, and depopulation, whereas enhancers included resources, support, and control. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional resiliency models are not sufficient for understanding resiliency. It is clear that social, political, and economic factors play an important role in the resiliency and health of people who live in rural areas. A conceptualization of resiliency must be embedded in a social context and include community factors. Recommendations for enhancing resiliency, such as sustaining rural life, supporting families, and providing services, are also discussed."
24389773,1,a,"While more than 85% of the elderly in Singapore co-reside with their children, the dynamics behind this figure can only be understood through qualitative research that considers the Singaporean multi-cultural and urban context. The cultural determinants affecting living arrangements in the 3 major ethnic groups differ. In addition, within each group, cultural norms were undergoing transitions, though at different paces. More interestingly, normative obligations, which in the past had a strong impact on patterns of living arrangements, were treated as only 1 consideration among other practical and emotional issues. External influences like government housing policies, modern lifestyles, and emigration also play a part in explaining the evolving patterns of living arrangements."
12292335,1,a,"""We find that a nation's urban population percentage increases with GDP per capita; industrialization; export orientation; and possibly, foreign assistance. It decreases with the importance of agriculture. Industrialization and agricultural importance have the same implications for the concentration of urban population in cities with 100,000+ population as for the urban percentage. Greater export orientation reduces such concentration. Finally, GDP per capita, population, and export orientation reduce primacy. Political factors, such as whether a country's largest city is also its capital, affect primacy. Our results do not seem to imply that developing-country urbanization today differs fundamentally from urbanization in the past."""
7579984,1,a,"The use of anti-psychotic medication with an adult population of people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviours was investigated as part of an epidemiological study covering seven district health authorities and corresponding local authorities in North West England. The study found a high rate of prescription of anti-psychotic drugs (48.1%). Chlorpromazine was the most frequently prescribed drug, followed by Thioridazine and Haloperidol. Three variables, psychiatric diagnosis, where the person was resident (hospital disturbed ward, hospital non-disturbed ward, hostel or family home) and district of origin were found to be significant determinants of prescriptions when all other variables were controlled. Of the variables reflecting individual characteristics those significantly related to prescription suggested that the socially disruptive effects of challenging behaviour were determining prescription. The results are discussed in the context of differing prescription practices across residence and district in the context of the management of socially disruptive behaviour."
12345486,1,a,"""This paper investigates the hypothesis that ethnicity has spillover effects on the human capital accumulation process. It extends previous research by documenting the extent to which the relative importance of parental inputs and ethnic spillovers in the intergenerational transmission of skills differs both within and across immigrant and U.S.-born ethnic groups. Using data drawn from the General Social Surveys, the study documents that the second and third generations (i.e., the children and grandchildren of immigrants) experience relatively more rapid economic advancement than do other generations, and that ethnic spillovers play a stronger role in households which are at the extremes of the skill distribution."""
9745425,1,a,"The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease and depression in perimenopausal women. Thyroid function [TSH, free T4, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab)] and depression (using the Edinburgh Depression Scale) were assessed cross-sectionally together with other determinants of depression. The subjects were 583 randomly selected perimenopausal women (aged 47-54 yr) from a community cohort of 6846 women. The main outcome measures were the occurrence of thyroid dysfunction (abnormal free T4 and/or TSH or elevated levels of TPO-Ab) and the concomitant presence of depression according to the Edinburgh Depression Scale. Neither biochemical thyroid dysfunction nor menopausal status was related to depression. Apart from several psycho-social determinants (the occurrence of a major life event, a previous episode of depression, or financial problems), an elevated level of TPO-Ab (> or = 100 U/mL) was significantly associated with depression (odds ratio, 3.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.8). We conclude that women with elevated TPO-Ab levels are especially vulnerable to depression, whereas postmenopausal status does not increase the risk of depression."
17135105,0,a,"Using data from the Community Tracking Study Household Survey (1998-99), we estimate the relationship between Medigap premiums and senior Medicare beneficiaries' supplemental coverage decisions. All seniors are more likely to be enrolled in an HMO in markets with higher Medigap prices. Lower income seniors are particularly sensitive to Medigap premiums and are more likely to have no supplemental coverage when faced with higher Medigap premiums. As Medicare supplemental options evolve in response to the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, it is important to consider that lower income beneficiaries may respond to price changes and other factors differently than their higher income counterparts."
11144870,0,a,"The purpose of the present investigation was to study prevalence of periodontal disease among 30 to 39-years-old from Oporto in the north of Portugal. In addition, an attempt was made to elucidate possible periodontal disease determinants in this population. A random sample consisting of a total of 322 individuals was drawn based on electoral lists. The attendance rate was 61%. The CPITN index was used and the results indicate a high prevalence of periodontal disease and a substantial need for periodontal treatment in this population, with 41% of the individuals investigated having one or more sites with a CPITN score 4 (pockets deeper than 5.5 mm). Dental visiting habits, gender (lower CPITN scores for females) and oral hygiene were the determinants most significantly associated with variation in CPITN scores."
19531164,0,a,"In spite of vast global improvements in living standards, health, and well-being, the persistence of absolute poverty and its attendant maladies remains an unsettling fact of life for billions around the world and constitutes the primary cause for the failure of developing states to improve the health of their peoples. While economic development in developing countries is necessary to provide for underlying determinants of health--most prominently, poverty reduction and the building of comprehensive primary health systems--inequalities in power within the international economic order and the spread of neoliberal development policy limit the ability of developing states to develop economically and realize public goods for health. With neoliberal development policies impacting entire societies, the collective right to development, as compared with an individual rights-based approach to development, offers a framework by which to restructure this system to realize social determinants of health. The right to development, working through a vector of rights, can address social determinants of health, obligating states and the international community to support public health systems while reducing inequities in health through poverty-reducing economic growth. At an international level, where the ability of states to develop economically and to realize public goods through public health systems is constrained by international financial institutions, the implementation of the right to development enables a restructuring of international institutions and foreign-aid programs, allowing states to enter development debates with a right to cooperation from other states, not simply a cry for charity."
10641825,1,a,"A review of U.S. and European clinical trials and cardiovascular prevention studies indicates a strong relation among cardiovascular disease risk factors and between metabolic factors and health behaviors established in youth. Social and behavioral determinants of risk are best modified by strategies applied in schools, families, and whole communities to provide a firm base for primordial prevention of risk factor development. This is illustrated with results from a European intervention trial and from observational studies in the young."
16290129,0,a,"This paper investigates the determinants of regional variations in outpatient antibiotic consumption using Swiss data. The analysis contributes to the debate on appropriate antibiotic use by improving the understanding of its determinants, and may help to define more effective health care policies to reduce the resistance phenomenon. Findings suggest that Switzerland exhibits relatively low levels of consumption among European countries. There are significant differences between cantons both in the per capita antibiotic sales and defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants (DID). Econometric estimations suggest that DID are significantly related to per capita income, antibiotic price, the density of medical practices, demographic, cultural and educational factors. The incidence of bacterial infections is also relevant. Appropriate policies affecting antibiotic consumption in the community can be designed by looking at crucial determinants in the model and their related impact."
18075003,0,a,"We study the effects of several variables on the prereproductive mortality pattern in the isolated and rural population of La Alpujarra, located on the western Mediterranean coast (southeast Spain), in the first half of the 20th century. The study is a retrospective analysis from a total sample of 2,200 deliveries, 2,085 of which were born alive and 171 of which did not survive to the 20th birthday. The potential influences of birthdate of children, twinning, firstborn, parental inbreeding, and sex on Alpujarran mortality were analyzed through logistic regression. Parity, family size, and birth interval effects were estimated through the difference between observed and expected mortality rates. In every case four age groups of mortality were considered because of the large influence of child growth: neonatal (less than 1 month of life), postneonatal infant (between 1 month and 1 year old), childhood (1-5 years old), and youth (5-20 years old). The Alpujarran prereproductive mortality pattern can be summarized as the result of three main risk factors: biodemographic, biomechanical, and social and health determinants. In general, every factor showed a decreased effect as children grew. The most significant determinants were birthdate of children, which is more related to increased mother's awareness of child care than to health improvement, and family size associated with decreasing alimentary resources as the sibling number increased. Male mortality was higher than female mortality in children older than 1 year but not for infant mortality, possibly as a result of a reproductive behavior favorable to males. Although firstborn status and twinning appeared associated with high mortality, maternal age and birth interval were related to low risk, but these influences always ceased after the first month of life. Parental inbreeding did not show any effect on infant, childhood, or youth mortality."
9458585,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of social deprivation upon the diet, dental health behaviours and dental health status of five-year-old children in Northern Ireland. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Fifty-eight primary schools in North and West Belfast. SUBJECTS: A nine per cent (240) random sample of 2,666 five-year-old children resident and attending school in North and West Belfast. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dental health status measured by dmft index; parental assessments of the child's dental health behaviours: parental dental attendance patterns and attitudes towards dental health; parental assessments of the child's diet and snacking behaviours: parental attitudes towards snack foods; and demographic profile of child's family. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three children were examined, a 68 per cent response. The majority of the families were either in low income employment or unemployed. Sixty-eight per cent of children had experience of dental caries. Dental decay was unrelated to parental employment status but more children from unemployed families attended when in pain. The diet of the children was related to both employment status and parental attitude and was reflected in their caries experience. Caries experience was dependent upon parental dental attendance, the consumption of carbonated drinks and sugar containing bedtime drinks. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that unemployment and parental attitudes are important as determinants of dental caries in five-year-old children from North and West Belfast. These factors may influence the child's dental health care as well as type of diet."
8909107,1,a,"From retrospective survey reports 1985-87, the study examined the determinants of neonatal and post-neonatal survival in three provinces in China. Conditional logistic regression models were employed to estimate the effects of macro- and micro-level factors (such as socioeconomic conditions, familial relationships, as well as biosocial determinants) on the survivorship of neonatal and post-neonatal infants in China. The study yielded two findings: (1) Social changes in Chinese society had a strong positive effect on neonatal and post-neonatal survivorship; and (2) the magnitude of such social changes differed across regions which, in turn, led to the differential effects on neonatal and post-neonatal survivorship across provinces in China."
9386029,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether physical abuse of a woman by her partner was associated with low birthweight. DESIGN: A case-control study. SETTING: Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital of Trondheim, Norway. PARTICIPANTS/SAMPLE: Eighty-six women who were delivered of a low birthweight (< 2500 g) infant (cases) and 92 women who were delivered of an infant with birthweight > or = 2500 g (controls). METHODS: An in-depth interview, either postpartum at the maternity ward or one year after delivery. Information about abuse was obtained by direct questioning and a modified version of the Conflict Tactics Scales. RESULTS: A total of 17% of the women had experienced abuse by a partner. While 7% had been abused by their current partner before the index pregnancy only one woman reported abuse during pregnancy. Relatively more mothers of low birthweight infants were abused (20%) compared with controls (15%), but the association was not statistically significant (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.63-2.99). Abused women reported a higher consumption of alcohol and cigarettes in pregnancy compared with nonabused women. CONCLUSION: Abuse was not found to be a risk factor for low birthweight in this study."
16380367,0,a,"This paper reports on an exploratory study of nursing home bankruptcy. From state and industry data regarding nearly 1,000 California facilities, it was possible to identify 155 homes in five chains (multi-facility organizations) that were operating in bankruptcy in 2000. When compared with facilities in non-bankrupt chains, while the bankrupt chain facilities had significantly worse financial liquidity, higher administrative costs, and higher payables to related parties, they also had more Medicare residents, fewer Medicaid residents, better solvency, and were located in less competitive county markets and in areas with higher Medicaid reimbursement rates. These findings indicate that, rather than facility characteristics and local market factors, strategic decisions taken at the corporate (chain) level are the major determinants of nursing facility bankruptcy status."
15694708,0,a,"This paper suggests to rigorously test the hypothesis that there are causal links between visible light and the development of leukaemia and other cancers in children. Light can be considered as a candidate risk factor because it suppresses melatonin biosynthesis which may play a role in a series of anticancer defences. Indeed, melatonin may offer some protection against all ""hallmarks of cancer"" [i.e., self-sufficiency in growth signals; insensitivity to growth-inhibitory signals; evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis); limitless replicative potential; sustained angiogenesis; tissue invasion and metastasis] recently suggested by Hanahan and Weinberg. Already ongoing investigations into the possible nexus of light, endocrine systems and the development of cancers will be further fueled by recent insights into photoreception and -- transduction, including the discovery of ""novel"" photoreceptors in the eye. Among a variety of different photosensory tasks, these receptors constitute crucial gates for light information from the environment which is employed for the temporal organization of our physiology and it has been proposed that chronodisruption, i.e., a significant disturbance of the coordination and thus order of biological rhythms, could contribute to the development of cancers. With regard to public health, the pervasive exposures to light -- at work and in homes -- imply that visible radiation could be a strong risk factor defined epidemiologically as a causal contributor to disease in a large proportion of cases. Importantly, if light were to be corroborated as a contributor to cancers in children, it would be amenable to manipulations with the perspective of reducing inherent risks significantly. In fact, it could be much easier -- and much more effective -- to reevaluate and modify lighting systems than to manipulate other possible determinants of the chronic processes of cancer such as genetic, nutritional or lifestyle factors."
12102133,0,a,"Experimental analysis procedures have been shown to be effective means for identifying the environmental determinants of problem behaviors. A potential limitation of these procedures is that it is necessary to produce and document patterns in the occurrence of the problem behavior during the assessment. In the case of severe behavior disorders, this may place the participant or therapist at such risk as to preclude the analysis. The current study arranged experimental analysis contingencies for precursor behaviors that had been observed to reliably precede the occurrence of problem behaviors targeted for reduction. For each of the 4 participants, it was possible to infer the maintaining variables for problem behaviors based on the outcomes of precursor analysis. These results suggest that the current procedures represent a promising alternative method for reducing risk during functional analysis of problem behaviors."
8445379,1,a,"The present study documents the prevalence of deficits in the ability to carry out a variety of activities of daily living in early Huntington's disease (HD), along with the associated neuropsychological and motor deficits. Eighty patients with HD were assessed with the Huntington's Disease-Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (HD-ADL). Sixty-seven patients also completed a comprehensive assessment of cognitive and voluntary motor functioning and chorea. The latter measures were correlated with HD-ADL total score and with most HD-ADL items, but not with those items dealing with marital and family relationship adjustment. Findings suggest that psychomotor speed and the ability to regulate attention may be particularly important determinants of everyday functioning in mild HD. Consistent with previously reported observations, this appears to be true even after accounting for individual differences in the severity of chorea and voluntary motor impairment."

8079318,1,a,"We present a descriptive study of children with diabetes mellitus in Sor-Trondelag county. The study included 66 children. Eight of these children had at least one other chronic disease in addition to diabetes. 31 children used more than two insulin injections daily. The median value of HbA1c was 8.6%. HbA1c was positively correlated with duration of diabetes. However, for the children who were out of remission, HbA1c was positively correlated with age and negatively with number of meals per day. Children whose parents were divorced or single had higher HbA1c than children whose parents were married or lived together. HbA1c was also higher among children who received special lessons at school than among children who did not receive such lessons. Thus, age, duration of diabetes and psychosocial factors were the most important determinants for metabolic control in our study."
9017281,1,a,"Two recent developments have thrown into bold relief the importance of environmental forces in determining the prevalence of human obesity. The first is genetic studies that estimate the heritability of human obesity at no more than 33%. The second is the 33% increase in the prevalence of obesity in the USA during the past decade. The importance of the environment in influencing obesity is matched only by the extent of our ignorance of how it exerts its effects and of how we may favourably alter them. The most thoroughly studied measure of environmental influences is socioeconomic status. Among women in developed societies socioeconomic status is strongly (negatively) correlated with the prevalence of obesity: the lower the social class the more the obesity. Prospective studies have shown that this correlation reflects, in part, causation: socioeconomic status helps to determine the prevalence of obesity and thinness. Likewise, the presence of obesity helps to determine socioeconomic status. In developing societies there is also a strong relationship between socioeconomic status and obesity, but it is a positive one: the higher the socioeconomic status the more the obesity. Unfortunately, we know of few other social determinants of obesity and studies on the social determinants of this disorder are desperately needed."
16322486,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to identify clinical determinants able to predict which individuals are susceptible to deterioration of mobility from 1 to 3 years after stroke. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of stroke patients consecutively admitted for inpatient rehabilitation. A total of 205 relatively young, first-ever stroke patients were assessed at 1 and 3 years after stroke. Mobility status was determined by the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI), and decline was defined as a deterioration of > or =2 points on the RMI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for mobility decline. The discriminating ability of the model was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: A decline in mobility status was found in 21% of the patients. Inactivity and the presence of cognitive problems, fatigue, and depression at 1 year after stroke were significant predictors of mobility decline. The multivariate model showed a good fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow test P>0.05), and discriminating ability was good (area under the curve 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Mobility decline is an essential concern in chronic stroke patients, especially because it might lead to activities of daily living dependence and affects social reintegration. Early recognition of prognostic factors in patients at risk may guide clinicians to apply interventions aimed to prevent deterioration of mobility status in chronic stroke."
16580567,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) can be one of the major determinants of high blood pressure (BP), but there has been no study on SDB with an emphasis on shift workers. The objective of this study was to examine whether a relationship between SDB and blood pressure/hypertension is more evident among shift workers than among day workers. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we measured BP levels and oxygen desaturation index (by nocturnal pulse oximetry) among 253 male shift workers and 206 male day workers aged 30 to 62 years at nuclear power plants in Japan. RESULTS: The prevalence of SDB (3% oxygen desaturation index >or=10 and >or=15 per hour) in all subjects was 11.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 8.4-14.2) and 6.1% (95% CI 3.9-8.3), respectively, with no statistical difference between shift and day workers. Systolic and diastolic BP levels were correlated with 3% oxygen desaturation index in all subjects after adjustment for potential confounding variables. This association was primarily observed among workers aged >or=40 years, more specifically older shift workers. CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between SDB severity and diastolic BP levels among shift workers aged >or=40 years suggests the importance of screening for SDB among shift workers for BP control."
11966887,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the perceived oral health status and to explore its relationship with clinically assessed dental fluorosis among school children in Arusha town, Tanzania. METHODS: A total of 478 students (mean age 15.7 years) completed questionnaires administered in the schools during May to July 2000. Clinical photos of the upper and lower incisors were taken under field conditions. A total of 461 slides were rated under laboratory conditions. The severity of dental fluorosis in the permanent maxillary central incisors was assessed using the Thylstrup & Fejerskov Index (TFI). RESULTS: The prevalence of dental fluorosis at TFI score > or = 2 was 74%. A total of 67% of boys and 70% of girls rated their teeth as yellow to brown, 58% of boys and 68% of girls (P < 0.05) confirmed dissatisfaction with their dental appearance. Kappa values of 0.40-0.44 were obtained between dental fluorosis (TFI > or = 2) and self-reported discoloration. The proportion of school children reporting dissatisfaction with oral condition and dental appearance increased with increasing TFI scores. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis explained 21% and 32% of the variance in the dissatisfaction with oral condition and dental appearance scores; TFI scores 11% and 15% of variation in points, and social and psychological variables 11% and 17%. CONCLUSION: Whereas dental fluorosis at different diagnostic cut-off points impacts self-rated oral health negatively, social and personal factors are as important in shaping the responses of school children to oral condition and dental appearance."
11456342,0,a,"The focus of this paper is caries in populations. Caries is assessed as a phenomenon and as it occurs in populations. It is observed that in recent literature the notion of causation of caries is restricted to the biological process on the tooth surface. This may be sufficient to explain caries as a phenomenon, but it is argued that a biological causation is insufficient in order to understand caries and its variation in populations. The understanding of the determinants of a population's oral health has been seriously impeded by the absence of a theoretical framework. A framework would be useful to the extent that it would bridge relevant categories for portraying complex causal patterns of caries in populations. An approach to a framework has therefore been outlined, and the idea of such a framework has been confronted with three critical comments. The framework is as yet pragmatic, incomplete, uncertain and fragmented. Yet, even such an approach may invite greater precision in epidemiological concepts about causes of caries than presently prevails. The framework directs attention to health effects of collective phenomena that cannot be reduced to individual attributes. The image proposed in this paper is intended to spur discussion about important aspects of the epidemiology of caries in populations."
2235037,1,a,"Changes in different aspects of sexuality were investigated and related to overall quality of life and physical, psychological and social adjustment in 73 SCI subjects, who were sexually active both before and after injury. Items on sexual interest and satisfaction were treated as one composite variable, the SIS scale, measuring sexual adjustment after injury. Despite severe genital dysfunction, more than half of the subjects (57%) rated their sexual relations after injury as satisfying or at least rather satisfying. The majority continued having intercourse, although many of them more seldom than before, and about half experienced orgasm. Sexual adjustment after injury was closely and positively correlated to frequency of intercourse, willingness to experiment with alternative sexual expressions and young age at injury. Physical and social independence and a high mood level were further positive determinants of sexual adaptation after injury, whereas the neurological level and completeness of injury showed no significant correlation with sexuality. It is suggested that sexual information and counselling should be integrated in the total care of the SCI patient to reduce the negative effects on sexuality, caused by the injury."
10795960,0,a,"This paper is an introduction to the various contributions in this special issue of Social Science & Medicine which are an attempt to synthesise the main debates of the 2nd European Conference on Social and Behavioural Research on AIDS held in Paris, in January 1998. The paper discusses how the recent advent of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) and new trends in the epidemic (its concentration in the socially most vulnerable groups and countries) have affected the research agenda of European social and behavioural sciences (SBS) in HIV/AIDS. Questions which had already been thoroughly studied by SBS (like determinants of HIV-related risk behaviours, or impact of gender and socio-economic inequities as well as discrimination on the diffusion of HIV) will have to be ""revisited"" in light of these recent changes. New issues (such as risk behaviours among already infected patients. impact of therapeutic advances on psychosocial and daily life management of their disease by people living with HIV/AIDS, adherence to treatment, or ""normalisation"" of AIDS public policies) will have to be strongly and quickly dealt with, in order for SSB to keep the pace with the rapid evolution of the epidemic and of the societal responses to it. Finally, the paper argues that to face these challenges, new theoretical and methodological advances will have to go beyond the classical oppositions in internal debates among SSB between individualistic and holistic approaches, or between radical criticism of the existing state of the world and practical involvement in public health decision-making."

METHODS: The cohort of patients born in 1968 through 1972, recruited from a population based epidemiological study in southwestern Sweden, were called to a followup after a median disease duration of 7.1 years. The study group consisted of 124 patients with a median age of 17.7 years. The disability and discomfort dimensions were evaluated using the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ). The impact of the disease on social life was evaluated by patients and parents. RESULTS: The median C-HAQ disability index was 0.19 with a range from 0 to 2.75 (maximum possible score = 3). Sixty percent of the patients indicated some difficulty in daily activities. Female sex and a polyarticular disease course were risk factors for disability. The strongest determinants for disability were continuing disease activity and a positive IgM rheumatoid factor. Social impact of the disease was strongly linked to a raised C-HAQ disability index. CONCLUSION: Even in a population based study of JCA, which includes many mild cases, the majority of patients experienced some difficulty in daily activities when judged by themselves. This underlines the necessity to use the patient's own values in outcome studies, rather than the physician's. Further development of internationally accepted, standardized instruments to evaluate the handicap dimension of childhood arthritis is called for."
16970785,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to study the whole spectrum of birthweight in a population-based birth cohort in order to document the role played by social factors, which complement physiological and behavioural factors, in the development of birthweight inequalities at the population level. METHODS: The analyses were performed with data from the 'Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development 1998-2002 (QLSCD)'. The study follows a representative sample (n = 2103) of the children born in 1998 in the Canadian province of Quebec. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses adjusted for gestational age and mother's age indicate that mean birthweight was higher for boys than girls; improved with birth rank, mother's body mass index (BMI), and family socioeconomic status; and was lower for children of smoking mothers. Compared with children born to non-smoking mothers of higher socioeconomic status, the odds of having a low birthweight were between 6 and 12 times higher for children born to smoking mothers of lower or middle socioeconomic status. When maternal smoking status and mother's BMI are combined, socioeconomic status could still be seen to have a positive effect on mean birthweight except for overweight or obese smoking mothers, among whom the relationship between socioeconomic status and mean birthweight was reversed. In families of lower socioeconomic status, maternal smoking was the most important factor in birthweight inequalities, and in families of higher socioeconomic status, mother's BMI was the most important factor in birthweight inequalities. CONCLUSION: This research is not only important for children in developed nations, but also for those in developing countries, where high birthweight and obesity are becoming more prevalent."
18050152,0,a,"This paper contributes to analysing and understanding the demand for (social) health insurance of informal sector workers in Kenya by assessing their perceptions and knowledge of and concerns regarding health insurance and the Kenyan National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). It serves to explore how informal sector workers could be integrated into the NHIF. To collect data, focus group discussions were held with organized groups of informal sector workers of different types across the country, backed up by a self-administered questionnaire completed by heads of NHIF area branch offices. It was found that the most critical barrier to NHIF enrollment is the lack of knowledge of informal sector workers about the NHIF, its enrollment option and procedures for informal sector workers. Inability to pay is a critical factor for some, but people were, in principle, interested in health insurance, and thus willing to pay for it. In sum, the mix of demand-side determinants for enrolling in the NHIF is not as complex as expected. This is good news, as these demand-side determinants can be addressed with a well-designed strategy, focusing on awareness raising and information, improvement of insurance design features and setting differentiated and affordable contribution rates."
10064916,1,a,"Mbam, a focus of onchocerciasis outbreaks, is located in the forest/savannah transition zone of Cameroon. Transmission of the disease in this area is similar to that sometimes observed in West Africa. Geographical factors affecting transmission must be identified to determine the areas for priority action. The locations of breeding sites for black flies (the vector of the disease) and factors favorable to their dispersion, the social behavior of these population and the way that she occupy space, must be investigated to identify areas in which the flies and man are in close contact. This geographical study shows that the closest contact between men and black flies occurs in cocoa plantations, due to the proximity of the breeding sites. The areas of closet contact for women and children are unknown, but their identification is important because women and children may be bitten by the flies during their daily activities."
11673127,0,a,"The objectives of this study were to to identify maternal characteristics associated with traditional food consumption and to examine food items associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury body burden in pregnant Inuit women from Northern Quebec. We interviewed women from three communities at mid-pregnancy and at 1 and 11 months postpartum. We measured PCBs, Hg, and selenium in maternal blood; Hg was also measured in maternal hair. The women reported eating significant amounts of fish, beluga muktuk/fat, seal meat, and seal fat. Although consumption of fish and seal was associated with lower socioeconomic status, consumption of beluga whale was uniform across strata. Fish and seal meat consumption was associated with increased Hg concentrations in hair. Traditional food intake during pregnancy was unrelated to PCB body burden, which is more a function of lifetime consumption. This study corroborated previous findings relating marine mammal and fish consumption to increased Hg and selenium body burden. Despite widespread knowledge regarding the presence of these contaminants in traditional foods, a large proportion of Inuit women increased their consumption of these foods during pregnancy, primarily because of pregnancy-related changes in food preferences and the belief that these foods are beneficial during pregnancy."
9183339,1,a,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke represents a major economic challenge to society. The direct cost of stroke is largely determined by the duration of hospital stay, but internationally applicable estimates of the direct cost of acute stroke care and rehabilitation on cost-efficient stroke units are not available. Information regarding social and medical factors influencing the length of hospital stay (LOHS) and thereby cost is needed to direct cost-reducing efforts. METHODS: We determined the direct cost of stroke in the prospective, consecutive, and community-based stroke population of the Copenhagen Stroke Study by measuring the total LOHS in the 1197 acute stroke patients included in the study. All patients had all their acute care and rehabilitation on a dedicated stroke unit. Neurological impairment was measured by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale. Local nonmedical factors affecting the LOHS, such as waiting time for discharge to a nursing home after completed rehabilitation, were accounted for in the analysis. The influence of social and medical factors on the LOHS was analyzed in a multiple linear regression model. RESULTS: The average LOHS was 27.1 days (SD, 44.1; range, 1 to 193), corresponding to a direct cost of $12.150 per patient including all acute care and rehabilitation. The LOHS increased with increasing stroke severity (6 days per 10-point increase in severity; P < .0001) and single marital status (3.4 days; P = .02). Death reduced LOHS (22.0 days; P < .0001). Age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, claudication, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, former stroke, other disabling comorbidity, smoking, daily alcohol consumption, and the type of stroke (hemorrhage/infarct) had no independent influence on LOHS. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care and rehabilitation of unselected patients on a dedicated stroke unit takes on average 4 weeks. In general, comorbidity such as diabetes or heart disease does not increase LOHS. Efforts to reduce costs should therefore aim at reducing initial stroke severity or improving the rate of recovery."
18950922,0,a,"Research on societal determinants of health suggests the existence of an ""inverse hazard law,"" which we define as: ""The accumulation of health hazards tends to vary inversely with the power and resources of the populations affected."" Yet, little empirical research has systematically investigated this topic, including in relation to workplace exposures. We accordingly designed the United for Health study (Greater Boston Area, Massachusetts, 2003-2004) to investigate the joint distribution and health implications of workplace occupational hazards (dust, fumes, chemical, noise, ergonomic strain) and social hazards (racial discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace abuse). Focusing on blood pressure as our health outcome, we found that among the 1202 low-income multi-racial/ethnic working class participants in our cohort - of whom 40% lived below the US poverty line - 79% reported exposure to at least one social hazard and 82% to at least one high-exposure occupational hazard. Only sexual harassment, the least common social hazard, was associated with elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) among the women workers. By contrast, no statistically significant associations were detectable between the other additional highly prevalent social and occupational hazards and SBP; we did, however, find suggestive evidence of an association between SBP and response to unfair treatment, implying that in a context of high exposure, differential susceptibility to the exposure matters. These results interestingly contrast to our prior findings for this same cohort, in which we found associations between self-reported experiences of racial discrimination and two other health outcomes: psychological distress and cigarette smoking. Likely explanations for these contrasting findings include: (a) the differential etiologic periods and pathways involving somatic health, mental health, and health behaviors, and (b) the high prevalence of adverse exposures, limiting the ability to detect significant associations. As clarified by the ""inverse hazard law,"" to understand health inequities, research is needed that contrasts exposures and health status population-wide, not just among those most inequitably exposed."
19851709,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence and determinants of cigarette smoking in Morocco. METHODS: A sample of 9,195 individuals aged 15-90 years, were randomly selected, using a stratified cluster sampling technique. A cross-sectional, household, community-based survey was conducted using a tested questionnaire. The interview covered personal, social and educational characteristics of the respondents and their smoking status. The association between current smoking and sociodemographic variables was estimated. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of current smoking was 31.5% for males and 3.1% for females. In men, smoking was associated with lower educational level. In women, it was associated with higher educational level and social class. CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking remains an important public health problem in Morocco. A comprehensive strategy for tobacco control is needed."
17934578,0,a,"This exploratory research based on the Social Ecological Theory aimed to study the health promotion of 39 people working in the harvest of the sugarcane in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The objectives were to identify the individual, social and environmental factors predisposing the workers to illnesses. The data were collected through direct observation of the labor activity and a questionnaire. The main individual determinant factors were physical effort and hectic work rhythm, and among the environmental factors, intense solar radiation, dust, soot and the presence of venomous animals were highlighted. The conditions of life and work reflect the poverty of these individuals and are the main social determinants of illness. The interaction of these factors can cause respiratory, cutaneous, musculoskeletal problems, occupational accidents. Thus, eradicating poverty and improving work conditions are fundamental for the health promotion of these workers."
18268195,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although risk factors for Alzheimer disease have been well studied, much less is known about risk factors for primary progressive aphasia (PPA). OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that learning disabilities (LDs) are more common in patients with PPA and their first-degree family members. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Self-report endorsement of an individual and family history of an LD in a sample of 699 subjects from the Northwestern Alzheimer's Disease Center registry. We compared 3 dementia groups (PPA, typical amnestic Alzheimer disease, and the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia) and 1 elderly control group. A retrospective medical record review in the PPA probands was used to obtain additional information. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of LDs among probands and their first-degree relatives. RESULTS: The patients with PPA and their first-degree family members had a significantly higher frequency of LD compared with the other dementia groups and the controls. Some of the families of patients with PPA displayed unusual concentrations of LD, especially dyslexia. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LD may constitute a risk factor for PPA, providing additional clues concerning the determinants for the selective vulnerability of the language network in this syndrome."

18434246,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the personal, social and cultural factors likely to explain recourse to the Internet as a preferred source of personal health information. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a population of 2923 Internet users visiting a firmly established website that offers information on personal health. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the determinants of site use. MEASUREMENT: The analysis template comprised four classes of determinants likely to explain Internet use: beliefs, intentions, user satisfaction and socio-demographic characteristics. Seven-point Likert scales were used. An analysis of the psychometric qualities of the variables provided compelling evidence of the construct's validity and reliability. A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the correspondence with the factors predicted by the theoretical model. FINDINGS: The regression analysis explained 35% of the variance in Internet use. Use was directly associated with five factors: perceived usefulness, importance given to written media in searches for health information, concern for personal health, importance given to the opinions of physicians and other health professionals, and the trust placed in the information available on the site itself. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the importance of the credibility of information on the frequency of Internet use as a preferred source of information on personal health. It also shows the potentially influential role of the Internet in the development of personal knowledge of health issues."
14618606,0,a,"The clinical disciplines have witnessed a rapidly growing literature on the conceptualization and measurement of coping and on the role of coping in confronting stressful life circumstances and maintaining adaptive functioning. This literature has spawned a diversity of concepts and contrasting perspectives on the determinants and effects of coping. To address this complexity, we comment on dispositional and contextual perspectives on the coping process, describe the domains of coping styles and coping skills, and review some measures of these constructs. Next, we present a conceptual framework that integrates key aspects of these constructs and use the framework to guide a selective review of the linkages between personal and social resources, coping skills, and adaptive functioning. We then consider applications of the framework to clinical practice."
17558245,0,a,"PURPOSE: This study explored the influence of social support on a prognostic indicator among cardiac patients, exercise tolerance. The relationship of sociodemographic factors to social support was examined, as well as the role of social support as a potential mediator between sociodemographic factors and exercise tolerance. METHODS: Archival data were collected from a sample of 254 men referred to cardiac rehabilitation. An exercise tolerance test was completed upon entry into cardiac rehabilitation, after 14 weeks, and after 9 months. RESULTS: Sociodemographic factors and social support reported upon entry into the cardiac rehabilitation program were related to initial and post-cardiac rehabilitation exercise tolerance, after controlling for admitting diagnoses, medical history, smoking, and perceived severity of illness. Overall, 28% of the variance in exercise tolerance was explained at baseline, 19% at 14 weeks, and 20% at 9 months. Specifically, older individuals had poorer exercise tolerance, whereas those with more income had better exercise tolerance. Social support was positively related to exercise tolerance at all 3 times. Older men reported less social support than younger men did, and those with more income reported more social support. However, social support did not mediate the relationship between sociodemographic factors and exercise tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the potential use of broad social factors in examining the determinants of prognostic factors for heart patients."
15919199,0,a,"The effect of age on breast cancer survival is still a matter of controversy. Breast cancer in young women is thought to be more aggressive and to have worse prognosis but results from clinical research have been neither consistent nor definitive. In this study, we have assessed the impact of young age at diagnosis on tumor characteristics, treatment and survival of breast cancer. The study included 82 very young (< or = 35 years), 790 young (36-49), and 2125 older (50-69) women recorded between 1990 and 2001 at the Geneva Cancer Registry. Very young and young patients had more often stage II cancers (P = 0.009), poorly differentiated (P < 0.001) and estrogen receptor negative (P < 0.001) tumors. They were also more likely to receive chemotherapy (P < 0.001) and less likely to receive hormonal therapy (P < 0.001). Specific five-year survival was not different in the three groups (91%, 90%, and 89% for very young, young and older, respectively). When adjusting for all prognostic variables, age was not significantly related to mortality from breast cancer with a hazard ratio of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.3-2.0) for very young and 1.1 (95% CI: 0.8-1.4) for young patients compared to older women. Tumor stage, differentiation, estrogen receptor status, surgery, and radiotherapy were all independent determinants of breast cancer prognosis. We conclude that age is not an independent prognostic factor when accounting for breast tumor characteristics and treatment."
11522812,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined factors associated with unmet need for care among persons aged 18 and older who need help with daily living tasks. The analysis focused on two types of unmet need: not enough (or inadequate) help and no help at all. METHODS: The authors used multinomial logistic regression to examine differences between persons with long-term care needs who (a) had all their needs met; (b) received inadequate help; and (c) received no help at all. Data were from the Adult Followback to the National Health Interview Survey on Disability (NHIS-D) for 1994 and 1995. RESULTS: The determinants of inadequate care versus no care differed with respect to age, gender, level of impairment, and insurance status. Whereas age and gender were important in determining inadequate care, insurance coverage and availability of social support were key factors related to a situation of no care. DISCUSSION: The present study demonstrates that the characteristics of groups reporting inadequate care versus no care, and the factors associated with these situations, are quite different. Nevertheless, the most important demographic risk factors for both types of unmet need mirror demographic groups currently on the increase in the U.S. population."

16803777,0,a,"Social and economic exclusion and inclusion are receiving growing attention and study in North America for their usefulness as a conceptual framework that addresses the many dimensions of poverty and inequality in our society. A discussion of social and economic exclusion/ inclusion flows naturally out of the population health field in which the social determinants of health have become well-established over the last twenty years or more. The determinants of health provide a broad and inclusive outline within which to situate prevention, early detection and effective intervention of the abuse of older persons. A Social Inclusion Lens offers exciting possibilities for addressing the issue of elder abuse and neglect."

Although the paper has been written from the perspective of economics, the discipline of the two authors, it is also of relevance to researchers in other disciplines. It is argued that there is a need to ensure that, when considering measurement in this largely neglected area of research, sufficient thought is given to the relationships that are being examined or assessed. We argue further that any attempt at measurement in this area must take into account the historical backdrop and the complex nature of the relationships between these key variables."

10616674,1,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of socioeconomic status on pregnancy outcome in an urbanised area in a rapidly developing country. METHODS: A cohort of 1797 pregnant women who attended antenatal care clinics at the two 700 bed hospitals in Hatyai city was recruited from September 1994 to November 1995. The pregnant women were followed up from the 17th week of gestation until delivery. The socioeconomic indicators selected were family socioeconomic status, maternal education, maternal occupation, family income and work exposure characteristics based upon Karasek's job content questionnaires. Pregnancy outcomes were birth weight, low birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm delivery. MAIN RESULTS: Mean birth weight correlated with socioeconomic status and income but after adjustment for parity, maternal age and height, weight at delivery day, baby sex, obstetrical complications and antenatal care utilisation, only family income remained correlated with birth weight. No association with any socioeconomic status indicators was found when using dichotomous outcome (low birth weight, small for gestational age or preterm delivery). Only high psychological job demand was associated with small for gestational age. Confounder adjustment indicated that the observed social status differences in pregnancy outcomes were mainly attributable to mother's characteristics and antenatal service use. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic indicators alone were not associated with reduced fetal growth or preterm delivery in this study, which recruited mainly lower or middle class women. Karasek's psychological job demand was only weakly correlated with small for gestational age infant."
10390046,1,a,"Factors affecting the transmission of syphilis can be categorized into those acting at the level of individuals (e.g., number of sex partners) and others at the level of the sociophysical environment (e.g., availability of treatment services for curable infections). In a prior study, we identified several sociophysical factors correlated with the ten-year mean syphilis rate in a regression analysis of United States counties. In the present study we used qualitative methods to investigate additional aspects of some factors in the regression, as well as to identify entirely new factors. Twelve counties with populations less than 100,000 and ten-year mean syphilis rates that were greater or less than expected by the regression model were selected for a three to five day visit. The case study protocol included observations, unstructured interviews with care providers and county residents, and a standardized questionnaire completed by state and local sexually transmitted disease control personnel pertaining to characteristics and practices of the local health department. Comparisons of the field notes and questionnaires revealed patterns of factors of the sociophysical environment that potentially affect county syphilis rates. These included access to the health department STD clinic, race relations, employment opportunities for minorities, interagency coordination, STD outreach activities, the social acceptability of discussing STDs, and intercommunity dynamics. In addition we noted the disproportionate influence of particular individuals on these factors. Some of the factors identified are readily quantifiable and could enhance the predictive power of multivariable models of county syphilis rates. The hypotheses generated by this study may also lead to a better measurement and understanding of potentially important environmental determinants of community syphilis rates, and the development of new or enhanced prevention strategies."
17097354,0,a,"The purpose of this study was to define the influence of fatigue, depression, and clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors on the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. The study was performed on 103 adult patients who visited Erciyes University Epilepsy Outpatient Clinic between 2004 and 2005. Patients were evaluated with the Form of Negotiation, Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-89), Beck Depression Inventory, and Fatigue Severity Scale. Mean age of the patients was 34.3+/-12.6, and mean duration of disease was 12.6+/-9.3 years. Among these patients, 52.4% were men, 49.5% were married, 15.5% had a university education, 53.4% had low incomes, 45.6% had generalized seizures, and 35.0% had experienced one or more seizures per month during the preceding year. The most significant variables in the domain of Overall quality of life were seizure frequency (P<0.001), depression (P<0.001), and fatigue (P<0.001); the variables in the domain of Mental Health were seizure frequency (P<0.001) and fatigue (P<0.001); the variable in the Cognitive domain was fatigue (P<0.001); the variables in the domain of Physical Health were social insurance coverage (P<0.01), fatigue (P<0.01), and age (P<0.01); the variables in the Epilepsy Targeted domain were depression (P<0.001), seizure frequency (P<0.001), and fatigue (P<0.01). Although quality of life has multiple determinants, seizure frequency, fatigue, and depression are the most important factors affecting quality of life in patients with epilepsy. One or more seizures per month, severe fatigue, and depression are associated with lower quality of life in some but not all domains. Partial correlations demonstrated that fatigue was a significant independent predictor of quality of life. The present study confirms that fatigue can be a powerful predictor of quality of life."
16251223,0,a,"A systematic review was conducted to examine the barriers to, and facilitators of, healthy eating among young people (11-16 years). The review focused on the wider determinants of health, examining community- and society-level interventions. Seven outcome evaluations and eight studies of young people's views were included. The effectiveness of the interventions was mixed, with improvements in knowledge and increases in healthy eating but differences according to gender. Barriers to healthy eating included poor school meal provision and ease of access to, relative cheapness of and personal taste preferences for fast food. Facilitators included support from family, wider availability of healthy foods, desire to look after one's appearance and will-power. Friends and teachers were generally not a common source of information. Some of the barriers and facilitators identified by young people had been addressed by soundly evaluated effective interventions, but significant gaps were identified where no evaluated interventions appear to have been published (e.g. better labelling of food products), or where there were no methodologically sound evaluations. Rigorous evaluation is required particularly to assess the effectiveness of increasing the availability of affordable healthy food in the public and private spaces occupied by young people."
15256519,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Stature is an important determinant of several reproductive and non-reproductive health problems. Documentation of secular trends in stature has been based primarily on cross-sectional studies of special populations, primarily of men. The objective of this study is to determine how growth and socio-economic status (SES) factors relate to stature changes among lineal female relatives, maternal grandmothers to mothers. METHODS: The study base was derived from a population-based intergenerational cohort which linked several statewide databases to data from the mothers' own birth certificates: the Washington State Intergenerational Cohort. Mothers in these ethnic groups were separately studied: non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics. We generated simple, partial, and multiple correlation coefficients to investigate the association between stature and other growth and SES factors. RESULTS: A mother's stature is determined partly by her own mother's stature and partly by her birthweight. These two measures are individually stronger predictors of stature than are several available SES factors considered in combination-grandmother's age, parity, marital status, and mother's age. The maximal multiple correlation models yielded R2 values from 18% to 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Growth measures are stronger predictors of intergenerational changes in stature than are the several available socio-economic factors. However, socio-economic factors are partly responsible for the level of achieved prenatal and postnatal growth. Since grandmother's stature is a determinant of mother's birthweight, which in turn is a determinant of infant birthweight, some environmentally influenced determinants of some birth outcomes are already established before a prospective mother is conceived or born."

The article concludes that returnees are development-oriented, but that increasing population growth in a context of fundamentally limited rural resources is not an economically viable process in the long term."""
8959415,1,a,"The determinants of contraceptive implant discontinuation within six months of insertion were examined among 786 low-income women attending family planning clinics in three U.S. cities. The six-month cumulative life-table discontinuation rate was 7.6%. Menstrual side effects were the most common reasons given for early implant removal, although women who discontinued use were no more likely than those who continued with the method to report menstrual irregularities. Women who opted for early removal were more likely than those who continued with the method to experience headaches, hair loss, weight gain and arm infection. Logistic regression analysis indicates that dissatisfaction with prior contraceptive methods, a partner who wants a child within the next two years, perceived pressure from health care providers to choose the implant, exposure to negative media coverage and the number of implant side effects significantly predict early implant discontinuation. Women's social and demographic characteristics, Medicaid status and motivation to avoid an unplanned pregnancy were not significantly related to early removal."
28590572,1,a,"An examination of intra- and inter-observer error in child anthropometry and variation between two skinfold calipers was conducted as part of a large prospective study of maternal and child nutrition in Malawi, Central Africa. Measurements include length, weight, head and arm circumferences, triceps and subscapular skinfolds, and estimated cross-sectional arm fat and arm muscle areas. Total observer error, expressed as a percentage of total variance in each trait, is 3.2% for length, weight, and head circumference; 7% for arm circumference; 10% for arm fat area; and 16-20% for skinfolds and arm muscle area. When total observer error is divided into the two additive components studied, intraobserver error represents approximately 50% or more of total observer error for most traits. An exception is the subscapular skinfold for which intra-observer represents 38% of total observer error. Errors of this magnitude will cause an attenuation of approximately 10% in the correlation coefficients between anthropometric and other variables, and a loss of power in attempting to detect associations between anthropometric variables and either their determinants or outcomes. However, the effects of errors of this magnitude are minor compared to those encountered in studies correlating nutrient intake with other variables. This study also finds that the SlimGuide caliper systematically overestimates skinfolds at low readings and underestimates skinfolds at high readingss relative to the Lange caliper."

The model was developed using the constructivist grounded theory method. Data from interviews and documents was collected from 25 primary participants. Interviews were also conducted with 15 members of the participants' support networks and six experts in the field of early psychosis and rehabilitation. The model illustrates how the core constructs of activity performance and social participation are set against the natural context and influenced by shifts in three determinants: faltering personal capacities, negotiating for success and risk factors. The model suggests rehabilitation and recovery practices in early intervention work."

Our regression results indicated that a 10 per cent increase in female literacy rate is associated with approximately one-year increase in female age at marriage. However, neither the increase in female literacy nor the changes in the sex ratio of the population could explain all the increase in female age at marriage during 1971-81. This indirectly suggests that there was an increase in female age at marriage among all socio-economic groups."""
18341123,0,a,"Renewed international interest in the structural determinants of health manifests itself in a focus on the social determinants of health and the public policy antecedents that shape their quality. This increased international interest in public policy in support of the structural determinants of health has had little traction in the United States. This should be surprising since the United States presents one of the worst population health profiles and public policy environments in support of health among wealthy developed nations. The U.S. position as a health status and policy outlier results from long-term institutional changes that are shaped by political, economic, and social forces. U.S. public health researchers' and workers' neglect of these structural and public policy issues conforms to the dominant ideological discourses that serve to justify these changes. The author presents some means by which public health researchers and workers can challenge these dominant discourses."
2068599,1,a,"A study of subject compliance within an experimental anti-HIV drug protocol was conducted with 40 asymptomatic HIV seropositive persons participating in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of the effectiveness of ZDV. Subject compliance was assessed through the use of study nurse independent ratings. The 20 most compliant and 20 least compliant subjects were surveyed at a 6-month interval using a self-report instrument designed to assess perceived social support and other psychosocial factors thought to effect compliance. Results indicated that more adherent subjects lived further from their treatment site, did not live alone, saw their study nurse as supportive, and were more likely to depend on a significant other for a wide range of social, economic, and emotional support. Implications for the practical use of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are proposed."
17242835,0,a,"Agriculture and health are linked in many ways. First, agriculture is essential for good health: it produces the world's food, fibre and materials for shelter; in many countries it is also an important source of livelihood among the poor. At the same time, agriculture can be linked with poor health, including malnutrition, malaria, foodborne illnesses, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), livestock-related diseases, chronic diseases and occupational ill-health. Health also affects agriculture: people's health status influences the demand for agricultural outputs, and in agricultural communities, poor health reduces work performance, reducing income and productivity and perpetuating a downward spiral into ill-health. This paper presents an overview of the bidirectional links between agriculture and health with a focus on the developing world. It develops a conceptual framework that brings together the various links between agriculture and health into a single broad framework. The framework comprises the core components of the agricultural supply chain (producers, systems and outputs), key health concerns and the mechanisms of common interaction between the agricultural and health components: income, labour, environment and access -- all key social determinants of health. These links between agriculture and health present an opportunity for the two sectors to work together to find solutions to each other's problems. Yet the health and agricultural sectors remain poorly coordinated. Leadership from global health and agricultural institutions is needed to build policies and good governance to facilitate integration, while capacity building is needed at all levels to help translate the conceptual links into comprehensive action on the ground. Health and agricultural researchers likewise need to work more closely together to achieve common goals."
19770127,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This study explores the current patterns of reproductive health service use among young women in the USA and the changing influence of socio-demographic factors on the types of services used over time. METHODS: The study population, drawn from the two last cycles of the National Survey of Family Growth, consists of women aged 15-24 (n = 2543 in 1995, n = 2157 in 2002). We examined trends in use of 'contraceptive services' and 'other reproductive health services for preventive care' and tested for changes in the patterns of use of these services over time. Logistic regression models were used to further clarify the factors associated with the use of the two types of services in 2002. RESULTS: Results show no difference in the overall use of reproductive health services in the past year but did reveal changes in the type of service sought. Use of services for contraception increased by 10 percentage points (39.3% in 1995 to 49.7% in 2002, P < 0.001), although the use of other services remained stable (53.2% in 1995, 50.2% in 2002, P = 0.14). The patterns of use varied over time, exhibiting growing social disparities. In 2002, the use of contraceptive services depended on women's age, number of partners, personal and mother's level of education, and menstrual problems. The use of other reproductive health services for preventive care varied across women's socio-economic background. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates increasing social differentials in the use of reproductive health services for preventive care among young women in the USA between 1995 and 2002, a finding which calls for careful monitoring in the context of limited resources."

19183131,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This study assesses racial/ethnic disparities in negative social consequences of drinking and alcohol dependence symptoms among white, black, and Hispanic Americans. We examine whether and how disparities relate to heavy alcohol consumption and pattern, and the extent to which social disadvantage (poverty, unfair treatment, and racial/ethnic stigma) accounts for observed disparities. METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2005 U.S. National Alcohol Survey, a nationally representative telephone-based survey of adults ages 18 and older (N = 6,919). Given large racial/ethnic differences in abstinence rates, core analyses were restricted to current drinkers (N = 4,080). Logistic regression was used to assess disparities in alcohol-related problems at 3 levels of heavy drinking, measured using a composite variable incorporating frequency of heavy episodic drinking, frequency of drunkenness, and maximum amount consumed in a single day. A mediational approach was used to assess the role of social disadvantage. RESULTS: African American and Hispanic drinkers were significantly more likely than white drinkers to report social consequences of drinking and alcohol dependence symptoms. Even after adjusting for differences in heavy drinking and demographic characteristics, disparities in problems remained. The racial/ethnic gap in alcohol problems was greatest among those reporting little or no heavy drinking, and gradually diminished to nonsignificance at the highest level of heavy drinking. Social disadvantage, particularly in the form of racial/ethnic stigma, appeared to contribute to racial/ethnic differences in problems. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in alcohol-related problems, public health efforts must do more than reduce heavy drinking. Future research should address the possibility of drink size underestimation, identify the particular types of problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities, and investigate social and cultural determinants of such problems."
7996589,1,a,"The term ""gender role"" appeared in print first in 1955. The term ""gender identity"" was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordancy between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine."
1941394,1,a,"The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of multiple psychosocial and knowledge-related antecedent factors that may predict sexual and alcohol and drug use behaviors that are associated with the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus infection. Five hundred forty-four ninth-grade urban high school students were surveyed regarding knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to STDs and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Results of multiple regression analyses indicate that higher levels of STD and AIDS knowledge were associated with lower levels of STD and AIDS anxiety (R2 delta = 0.09; p less than 0.001), fewer negative attitudes toward people with AIDS (R2 delta = 0.09; p less than 0.001), stronger perceptions of self-efficacy (R2 delta = 0.03; p less than 0.01), and stronger peer affiliation (R2 delta = 0.02; p less than 0.05). Negative attitudes toward people with AIDS were inversely related to knowledge (R2 delta = 0.08; p less than 0.001), social support (R2 delta = 0.02; p less than 0.01), and perceived self-efficacy (R2 delta = 0.01; p less than 0.05). Predictors of alcohol and drug use included perceived peer norms (R2 delta = 0.08; p less than 0.001) and strong peer affiliation (R2 delta = 0.05; p less than 0.001). The best predictor of sexual risk behavior was alcohol and drug use (R2 delta = 0.07; p less than 0.001). Lower levels of knowledge (R2 delta = 0.14; p less than 0.01) and perceived peer norms (R2 delta = 0.05; p less than 0.05) predicted nonuse of condoms. Our results indicate that several factors relate to adolescent risk for STDs: the connection between peer influence and adolescent risk behaviors, the link between alcohol and drug use and sexual risk behavior, and the role of knowledge in determining nonuse of condoms."
11324784,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the features associated with mortality in a multiethnic US cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) within 5 years of study onset. METHODS: Socioeconomic and demographic features (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education, occupation, poverty, and health-related behaviors [drinking, smoking, exercising]), clinical and immunologic features (disease duration, disease onset type, disease activity according to the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure [SLAM], disease damage according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics [SLICC] Damage Index [SDI], number of American College of Rheumatology criteria at diagnosis, organ system manifestations, fatigue and pain ratings, and medication usage and autoantibodies), immunogenetic features (HLA class II genotypes), and behavioral and psychosocial features (social support, illness-related behaviors, and helplessness), as obtained at enrollment into the study, were compared between survivors and deceased patients. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant independent risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Within 5 years of study onset, 34 of 288 patients have died. Fourteen deaths could be directly attributed to SLE and 11 to infections. In 1 patient the cause of death could not be determined. In the remaining 8 patients the cause of death was neither infectious nor disease-related. There were 10 deaths among Hispanics, 18 among African Americans, and 6 among Caucasians (P < 0.05). Variables associated with mortality in the univariable analyses included poverty, less than full-time employment, difficulty in accessing health care, shorter disease duration, cardiovascular and renal involvement, higher serum creatinine levels and lower hematocrit values, higher SLAM and SDI scores, lower use of antimalarial drugs, and higher use of (some) immunosuppressants. Specific autoantibodies and class II HLA genotypes were not associated with mortality. Poverty and higher baseline SLAM and SDI scores were independently associated with mortality in the multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Disease activity, disease damage, and poverty appear to be the most important determinants of mortality in this multiethnic US cohort of SLE patients. These results have applicability to the management of patients with SLE, a disease that more severely affects disadvantaged minority population groups."
11410405,0,a,"The major skeletal determinants of fracture risk are bone mass and postmenopausal bone loss with gradual destruction of trabecular bone architecture. Therefore, the management of osteoporosis is to prevent bone loss after menopause in women below 60 years of age. We need a screening test of bone mineral density (BMD) with the ability to identify correctly individuals with accelerated bone loss; unnecessary treatment has to be avoided. But without measurable extraskeletal factors, no technique assessing BMD as single test has the reasonable high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of fast bone losers. It is on principle the repeated volumetric bone measurement--within 12 months--in the pure trabecular bone, especially at distal radius of the non-dominant arm with the peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), being able to detect accurately the individuals as fast bone losers with trabecular bone loss > 8 mg/cm3 or > 3.5% per year (prevalence about 35%). Only women with very high trabecular BMD (in highest quintile) have no risk for osteoporosis."
18789776,0,a,"North Korea has survived the breakdown of the communist bloc and has been immune to the democratization process of the 1990s. In spite of national famines and economic collapse, the totalitarian regime in Pyongyang maintains a firm grip on its power. Reliable information on the population's biosocial welfare is scarce. Using height and weight data of 5991 North Korean pre-school children measured in 2002, we investigate determinants of height-for-age z-score (HAZ), weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) and weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) as an indicator for child health. We find a statistically significant impact of the age of the child and of the mother, as well as the sex of the child on HAZ and WAZ. In contrast, social status and wealth proxies at the individual and household level are not statistically significant possibly because of errors in these variables. We do not find a consistent effect for geographic regions or for rural-urban residents either. Yet, urban provinces seem to be better-off. Most importantly, we find that children living in families who benefit from food aid of the United Nations are healthier in terms of HAZ, WAZ and WHZ than those depending on the government. Hence, further delivery of United Nations food aid is likely to mitigate the effects of the ongoing food crisis in North Korea."
16443314,0,a,"This study examines the physical, behavioral, emotional and social determinants of self-rated health among Chinese older persons, and investigates if the effect of social support varies by gender. A representative sample of 1589 elderly community dwellers in Hong Kong were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Gender difference in the effect of social support was tested by an interaction term, 'gender x social support', in a hierarchical regression analysis. The frequency of falling ill, the number of chronic illnesses, sleep quality, mobility and positive emotions were most important determinants of self-rated health. The effect of social support was completely redundant when these factors were taken into account. The interaction term 'gender x social support' was significant and indicated a stronger effect for women, but the effect size was negligible (adding only 0.3% to the explained variance). This suggests that the effect of social support by and large is gender free. These findings suggest a high degree of similarity in the determinants of self-rated health between Western and Chinese older populations."
1619261,1,a,"This paper examines race differences in the effects of social roles on physical health. Using data from the older men cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience, we examine the impact of employment, marriage, and being a supporter on health limitations and mortality. Employment has the most consistent health-protective effect, and the benefits of employment are more pronounced for Blacks than for Whites. Marriage affects health in conjunction with employment. These findings lend further support to the growing literature on the effects of roles on health. The results further illustrate the importance of ascribed statuses as structural determinants of the relationship between roles and health, highlighting the very real differences in the meanings and expectations of social roles for Blacks and Whites."
10647902,1,a,"Heart rate variability (HRV) measures are associated with coronary heart disease incidence and mortality. Therefore insight into the genetic and environmental determinants of these measures may have clinical relevance. We assessed the role of genetic and environmental factors of time domain and frequency domain HRV indices. Participants were 451 kibbutz members, aged 15 and up, belonging to 80 families. HRV indices were calculated from Holter recordings measured over 5 min. Our data indicate that for the two time- and four frequency domain indices, a mixture of two normal distributions fit the data significantly better than a single normal distribution (P<0.05). We used complex segregation analysis to infer the modes of inheritance of these HRV measures. We found evidence for possible involvement of a recessive major gene in the inheritance of the root mean square of successive differences in RR intervals (RMSSD), which is predominantly vagally mediated. A putative major gene explains 28%-34% of the adjusted inter-individual variability. The SD, determined by a mixture of mechanisms, is influenced by environmental and polygenic effects, but not by a major gene. The findings regarding the heritability of the frequency domain indices were not conclusive. However, the involvement of genetic factors was not rejected. Additional studies in extended families are needed to confirm the involvement of major genes in the determination of the autonomic activity."
7761906,1,a,"Breastfeeding beyond the resumption of mother's menstruation plays a significant role in the proximate determinants of fertility. Breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhoea data collected from retrospective surveys usually exhibit digit preferences. Here, these heaping errors were smoothed by B-spline and used in multivariate models of risk of conception to investigate the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding. The data used come from a 1987 Indian survey. Results show that lactation, after mother's menses resume, reduces the risk of conception. Heaping in breastfeeding data attenuates this relationship. When adjustment is made, breastfeeding reduced the rate of conception by 47 per cent; the reduction, with adjusted data, was 63 per cent."
2308764,1,a,"Field management, through the use of specially trained field consultants, is a mechanism by which interdisciplinary interventions can be implemented in non-institutional settings. Management of the real environmental determinants (home, work, social) of pain and disability should improve the effectiveness of behaviorally based interventions and make these treatments more accessible. Over a 6 year period, 261 patients having various chronic somatic complaints (e.g., pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints) underwent interdisciplinary outpatient treatment based on medical and behavioral sciences. Comparison of patients having field management with patients receiving office-based treatment found a significantly greater reduction in disability with field management. 84% of field managed patients had a successful outcome as defined by: (a) return to regular work, or (b) reduced limitations on work, exercise, and daily living activities, depending on functional status at assessment. Only 61% of patients with office-based treatment were successful. Compliance, defined as the frequency with which treatment was mutually terminated, was significantly higher with field management. The availability of long-term disability benefits was highly predictive of a poorer outcome. However, field management remained effective for improving functional status regardless of the availability of benefits. Finally, determination of the cost of non-institutional treatment indicated that field management is a cost-effective modality. Implications of these findings for the treatment of disability in chronic pain and other chronic illness syndromes are discussed."
17374601,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To determine factors that independently predict health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 1 and 3 years after stroke. METHODS: Subjects numbering 397, from a population-based register of first-ever strokes were assessed for HRQOL using the Short Form 36 (SF36) 1 year after stroke. Physical (PHSS) and mental health (MHSS) summary scores were derived from the eight domains of HRQOL in the SF36. Multivariate stepwise regression analyses were conducted to determine independent predictors of these scores; beta coefficients with 95% CI were obtained.beta coefficient is the difference between average value of the variable (e.g. male) and average value under consideration (e.g. female). Demographic and stroke risk factors, neurological impairments and cognitive impairment (MMSE <24) were included in the models. Similar analyses were undertaken on 150 subjects 3 years post-stroke. RESULTS: A year after stroke, independent predictors of the worst PHSS were of females (beta coefficient -3.3: 95% CI -5.7 to -0.8), manual workers (-3.2: -5.9 to -0.4), diabetes (-4.2: -7.7 to -0.8), right hemispheric lesions (-4.9: -8.7 to -1.2), urinary incontinence (-7.8: -11.6 to -4.1) and cognitive impairment (-2.7: -5.5 to -0.1); the worst MHSS were associated with being Asian (-11.8: -20.6 to -3.0), ischaemic heart disease (-2.7: -5.4 to -0.03), cognitive impairment (-3.04: -5.8 to -0.3). Subjects aged 65-75 years (5.4: 2.5 to -8.4) had better MHSS than those <65 years. Three years post-stroke, independent predictors of worse PHSS were hypertension (-8.7: -13.5 to -3.9), urinary incontinence (-8.1: -15 to -1.1) and cognitive impairment (-8.3: -13.2 to -3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of HRQOL vary both over time after stroke and whether physical or psychosocial aspects of HRQOL are being considered. This study provides valuable information on factors predicting long-term HRQOL, which can be taken into consideration in audits of clinical practice or in future interventional studies aiming to improve HRQOL after stroke."
8621244,1,a,"To explore risk factors for testicular cancer and cryptorchidism, 2 parallel case-control studies were conducted in Denmark. The testicular-cancer study was population-based and included 514 cases and 720 controls. The cryptorchidism study included 387 cases and 416 controls and was based on 2 hospital series of men treated for cryptorchidism and a control group sampled among residents in the Copenhagen area. The 2037 men were interviewed by telephone, and self-administered questionnaires were sent to their mothers. A strong association was seen between low social class and cryptorchidism, with sons of unskilled workers having a 3-fold higher risk of cryptorchidism than sons of self-employed men. Testicular cancer was only moderately associated with high-social-class indicators, and only with such indicators pertaining to the mother. Both testicular cancer and cryptorchidism tended to occur more frequently in first-born men and in sons of older women but these associations were not statistically significant. Late puberty was associated with reduced risk of testicular cancer. The effect of age at puberty may be due both to advanced age at diagnosis and to the existence of common determinants of age at puberty and testicular cancer. Men who had been treated for cryptorchidism entered puberty later than other men, possibly because of impaired hormonal function of the testes. There was no indication of increased risk of testicular cancer or cryptorchidism in sons of mothers who smoked around the time of conception or during the pregnancy."
10884643,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this investigation were to study determinants of apical periodontitis among Lithuanians who were 35 to 44 years old and to study possible associations between apical periodontitis, relevant general diseases, and perceived general health. STUDY DESIGN: Information was collected from a randomly selected sample, consisting of 147 individuals from Vilnius, Lithuania. Aspects of oral and general health, health-related habits and attitudes, and social parameters were used as independent variables, with various aspects of apical periodontitis as the dependent variable. Associations were tested by regression analysis. RESULTS: Apical periodontitis was highly prevalent in this Lithuanian population. Oral health-related variables showed the strongest association with apical periodontitis. Decayed and filled teeth scores were found to be strongly associated with periapical disease, and sound teeth were strongly associated with periapical health. In addition, behavioral variables were found to be important disease determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Apical periodontitis appeared to be an oral health problem closely related to dental caries. No association could be detected between general diseases and apical periodontitis, but an association between perceived general health and apical periodontitis was demonstrated."
14709709,0,a,"Individual behavior and social contexts are critical determinants of health. We surveyed commissioners or their designees in 22 departments of health serving US cities of at least 500,000 people to examine their use of scientific approaches to influence individual behavior and social contexts. Each department used behavioral or social science in its work, but only four departments were judged to have integrated these approaches throughout their operations, using both centralized and decentralized structures. Degree of integration was unrelated to collaboration with universities or communities but was related to use of explicit theories. Behavioral and social sciences were employed most frequently in the areas of HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health and in the service of changing individual behavior rather than larger contexts, although across departments many health problems and approaches were involved. Commissioners generally found the approaches valuable, but articulated barriers to more widespread adoption."
8150669,1,a,"The inhibition of physiological habituation in patients with chronic aural tinnitus extends from the level of cellular processing to psychologic and psychosocial determinants. The following hypotheses were tested in 32 patients with chronic tinnitus and 30 patients of a comparable clinical control group: tinnitus patients differ concerning (1) the perception of social support, (2) a disposition to psychosomatic diseases, (3) coping with stress and (4) certain personality traits. Standard psychological tests were used as well as a detailed examination of at least 30 minutes. Results showed that the tinnitus patients statistically perceived less social support and more social distress compared to the control group. They also showed significantly poorer results in coping with stress. Increased social distress in a number of cases resulted in noticeable decompensation. Additionally, a disposition to psychosomatic disorders increased, so that conflicts arising expressed themselves in various functional diseases. In most cases psychiatric exploration showed a vocational or familial overcharge. In patients experiencing decompensation, close cooperation with a psychotherapist is required."
19436534,0,a,"Diseases of modernism, rather than infectious diseases and chronic medical conditions, increasingly cause childhood morbidity and mortality. Thus, the goal of enhancing life outcomes for all children has become imperative. Paediatricans may begin with a renewed interest in social paediatrics - the care of the disadvantaged child in Canada, requiring a focus on all the complex factors that impact families and the community. New paediatricians need the tools to impact both social determinants of health and political policies to support health for all. Such interest is as old as the field of paediatrics (social medicine began with the great pathologist, Virchow, in the 1800s). The new neuroscience of experience-based brain and biological development has caught up with the social epidemiology literature. It is now known from both domains that a child's poor developmental and health outcomes are a product of early and ongoing socioeconomic and psychological experiences. In the era of epigenetics, it is now understood that both nature and nurture control the genome. Future paediatricians need to understand the science of experience-based brain development, and the interventions demonstrated to improve life trajectories. A challenge is to connect the traditional population health approach with traditional primary care responsibilities. New and enhanced collaborative interdisciplinary networks with, for example, public health, primary care, community resources, education and justice systems are required."
7703815,1,a,"A sample of 582 injecting drug users were interviewed as part of an evaluation of an AIDS prevention programme for drug users. This paper examines the biographic and predispositional determinants of five HIV preventive behaviours--equipment sharing (not receiving and not giving) and and condom use (with regular partners, casual partners and sex clients). A two-stage sequential approach was adopted for a logistic regression analysis. Initially, to model each of the five preventive behaviours, biographical and drug use variables were entered. In a second set of models, behavioural predisposition factors were included. Age, drug use and prison experience correlate with variables in both models, although not consistently in the same direction. While a predisposition to reject sharing correlates with safer rejecting and condom use, the predisposition to safer sex only correlates with condom use. Needle exchange programmes that only target the individual would seem to be inadequate. To enhance targeted interventions changes in public and agency policy that create a social environment conductive to behaviour change are required."
10480698,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The importance of paternal determinants in the occurrence of low birthweight and prematurity is not well known. We investigated these outcomes in siblings and paternal half siblings as a function of changes in putative external determinants between two births in fathers who had experienced the birth of a premature and/or low birthweight (PTB/LBW) infant. METHODS: All fathers who, between 1980 and 1992, had an infant born before 37 completed weeks' gestation or weighing <2500 g and a following child were studied. We identified 14 147 pairs of siblings from Danish national registers. The recurrence risk was studied in three sub-cohorts defined by the outcome in the index child (PTB only, PTB/LBW, LBW only). We estimated the recurrence risk in the younger sibling according to changes of female partner, municipality type, occupation, and father's social status. RESULTS: The overall recurrence risk was 16.7% for preterm delivery and 16.8% for LBW. Changing female partner was, as expected, associated with a reduction in the recurrence risk for both outcomes (RR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.27-0.60 for preterm delivery and RR = 0.38; 95% CI : 0.26-0.56 for LBW). None of the other studied factors was associated with changes in the recurrence risk. Fathers who changed partner had offspring with similar birthweight and gestational length between the three sub-cohorts, while a difference was evident in offspring to fathers whose female partner was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify any paternal factor of importance in the occurrence of LBW and preterm delivery."
15073816,1,a,"BACKGROUND: In Sweden, large amounts of money are spent annually on natural remedies (NRs), in spite of the fact that most products in this category lack scientific documentation of their efficacy and side-effects. The usage and users of natural remedies are not well defined. This paper describes NR use and NR users in a city in southern Sweden, and tests the hypothesis that the use of natural remedies is a strategy for coping with psychosocial stressors. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 6545 men and women, aged 45-65 years, who during 1991 and 1992 participated in the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study, a large-scale prospective cohort study. Data on consumption of natural remedies were recorded during seven consecutive days, as part of a dietary assessment. Each participant also completed a questionnaire, covering education, work history, alcohol and smoking habits, perceived health, and psychosocial factors such as social network, social support, job strain and global control. Body composition was also measured. RESULTS: The prevalence of NR consumption was 26% among women and 17% among men. NR use was most common during winter and spring. The most popular products were ginseng, garlic, and various herb and plant extracts. Important determinants of NR usage were higher education, Swedish origin, and lifestyle factors like low body weight fat percentage and high alcohol consumption among women. Other determinants were higher age and non-smoking among men. None of the psychosocial factors appeared to influence the prevalence of NR consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of NR consumption is influenced by sex, demographic factors, season of the year, and lifestyle. Use of NRs does not appear to be a common strategy for coping with psychosocial stress."
7481601,1,a,"Home-related injuries are a major threat to pre-school children in the western world. In this study the behavioral determinants of 18 parental safety measures were assessed. To select behavioral determinants, the Attitude-Social influence-Self-efficacy/barriers model was used with the inclusion of variables from the Health Belief Model and the Protection Motivation Theory. A written questionnaire was completed by 1129 Dutch mothers of pre-school children. Most safety measures were explained (rather) well by the same set of determinants. Main determinants for adopting or not adopting a safety measure were the mother's belief in the necessity of the safety measure according to the child's age, her belief about her partner's opinion on the necessity and her belief about the success of taking the measure. Subsequent important determinants were the mother's belief about the inconvenience and instrumentality of the safety measure; the perceived susceptibility had a minor or moderate influence on most measures. This study did not indicate that more highly educated mothers were more knowledgeable about safety-related subjects. The theoretical implications of this study are discussed."
1560664,1,a,"A survey was conducted of drinking, drug use attitudes, beliefs, personality and demographic characteristics of students on a university campus. Gender, ethnic and social group differences were also examined. It was concluded that a biopsychosocial matrix of determinants influenced alcohol consumption and its excessive consumption. Two general factors emerged from analyses of the results. They may be interpreted as entering into a complex approach-avoidance conflict where the net approach tendency determines overall alcohol consumption. Personality characteristics and presumably their biological correlates, as well as set and setting, or attitudes, beliefs and environmental influences contribute to the approach-avoidance conflict that determines abstinence or varying amounts of alcohol consumption."
10519460,1,a,"This investigation predicted adolescents' delay of intercourse onset from attitudes, social norms, and self-efficacy about refraining from sexual intercourse. Age, gender, ethnicity, and parental education were also examined as predictors and moderators of the relationships among the 3 psychosocial determinants and onset. The participants (N = 827), part of a cohort initially surveyed in the 9th grade, reported at baseline that they had never engaged in intercourse. The multivariable proportional hazards regression model suggested that adolescents with more positive attitudinal and normative beliefs, as well as those with a parent who graduated from college, were less likely to engage in intercourse in the follow-up period (up to approximately 2 years). Interventions that include an objective to delay onset may benefit from addressing psychosocial determinants, especially attitudes and norms about sexual intercourse."
9484309,1,a,"This study examined determinants of the treatment climate in 89 psychiatric and substance abuse programs. Clearer policies giving patients more control, and more health and treatment services, were related to more supportive, autonomous, expressive, and practically oriented milieus. In contrast, more policy choice and daily living assistance were associated with less support, personal expression, and practical orientation. Programs in which staff had more paraprofessionals and better team functioning, and in which patients had more social resources and better mental functioning, tended to be more supportive and to have more emphasis on autonomy, personal expression, and practical orientation. Based on these results, we suggest some guidelines on how to change the treatment milieu to benefit patients' adjustment."
10036557,1,a,"In a cross-sectional, population-based study among community-dwelling persons of 55 years and over the incidence of falls, risk indicators for falls, specifically age, and the impact of gait problems, falls and other risk factors on functioning was determined. A randomly age-stratified sample (n = 655) was taken from all independent living persons of 55 years and over (n = 2269) and registered in a primary health care centre. They received a mail questionnaire concerning demographic data, history of falls and injuries due to falls, physical and mental health status, gait problems, functional status, including social activities. The response rate was 62% (n = 405). Of the subjects aged 55 years and of those aged 65 years and over, 25% and 31% respectively fell at least once in the previous year. Half of the people reporting falls fell more than once. Serious injury occurred in 9% of the fallers, with 4% fractures. There is a significant association between falling and age and, even more clearly, between gait problems and age. The main risk factors of single and recurrent falls were female gender, physical health status and gait problems. Logistic regression analysis reveals that the main determinants of falling in general are gait problems and female gender and, of recurrent falling female gender, physical complaints and gait problems. Falls have some negative effect on functioning, i.e. mobility range and social activities, but this is overshadowed by mental status indicators and gait problems."
7890095,1,a,"Previous studies report that neighborhood characteristics influence pregnancy and childbearing risk among African-American adolescent women. These studies, however, leave unidentified the effects of many neighborhood properties on the proximate determinants of nonmarital fertility. In this study I examine the effects of neighborhood characteristics on the risk of nonmarital first intercourse and on contraceptive use among black female adolescents. The results suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic status, female employment and marital dissolution rates, and peers' departure from mainstream lifecourse trajectories influence young black women's sexual and contraceptive behavior. The effects of female employment and socioeconomic status are greater for teens in urban neighborhoods than for teens living elsewhere."
9085396,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors that influence physical activity behavior is important in the design of intervention programs targeted at youth. METHODS: A prospective study design was used to identify the predictors of vigorous physical activity (VPA) (> or = 6 METs) and moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (> or = 3 METs) among 202 rural, predominantly African-American children. Selected social-cognitive determinants of physical activity were assessed via questionnaire in the fifth grade. Participation in VPA and MVPA was assessed via the previous day physical activity recall 1 year later in the sixth grade. RESULTS: For girls, participation in community sports, self-efficacy in overcoming barriers, enjoyment of school physical education, race (white > black), and perception of mother's activity level (active vs inactive) were significant predictors of VPA. For MVPA, participation in community sports and self-efficacy in overcoming barriers were significant predictors. For boys, self-efficacy in overcoming barriers was the only significant predictor of VPA, while beliefs regarding activity outcomes and participation in community sports were significant predictors of MVPA. CONCLUSION: Social-cognitive constructs such as physical activity self-efficacy, access to community physical activity outlets, and positive beliefs regarding physical activity outcomes are important predictors of future physical activity behavior among rural, predominantly African-American children."
9674763,1,a,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are common degenerative disorders in the elderly. Most AD patients are cared for at home by family members, usually elderly spouses. Although caregiving is associated with significant psychological and physical morbidity, there are wide individual differences among caregivers in how well they adapt to caregiving demands. In addition, recent data suggest that caregiver variables can be important determinants of AD patient institutionalization and that AD patients living with highly distressed caregivers may exhibit higher frequencies of behavioral problems and agitation than those living with less distressed caregivers. Predictors of caregiver outcome, predictors of institutionalization, and the effect of the caregiver on the course and symptomatology of dementia are described. A model of assessment and intervention for the physician, referral processes, and resources for the caregiver are presented."
16174145,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To test the role of social determinants-including race, education, income, and demographic factors-of child mental health services use, defined as having had a visit to a mental health professional for depression, attention-deficit, or for any reason. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Child/Young Adult supplement, a nationally representative sample of 7-14-year-old children born to women who were 14-22 years old at the start of data collection, in 1979. African Americans and Latinos were over-sampled, and population weights are available to make nationally representative inferences. STUDY DESIGN: Indicators of mental health service use were regressed on social and economic determinants, family structure variables, and insurance variables, controlling for need as captured by several different symptom scales. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Girls are much less likely to obtain needed treatment for externalizing behavior disorders than are boys, and are somewhat less likely to obtain needed treatment for depression than boys. Middle children are less likely to obtain needed treatment for any mental health problem than are oldest, youngest, or only children. The presence of the father inhibits the likelihood that the child will receive treatment, particularly for depression. African Americans and Latinos are less likely than white children to receive treatment. In contrast to these rich results for the social and demographic determinants of children's specialty mental health utilization, the economic and insurance variables (including maternal education and income) seem to hold little predictive power. CONCLUSIONS: These results argue for interventions to sensitize parents-especially fathers-to the need to pay attention to the mental health needs of their children, in particular girls and middle children. The analysis also suggests that the literature on intrahousehold decision making and on the gender dimensions of investment in children is worth extending to mental health treatment decisions."
15797980,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic illness with an unpredictable and variable course, profoundly affects the quality of life (QOL). General health questionnaires are used to assess QOL in SLE, but a disease-specific instrument could offer enhanced responsiveness and content validity. We detail the steps we took to develop and validate a new SLE-specific QOL instrument, SLEQOL. METHODS: Rheumatology professionals nominated items that they felt were important determinants of QOL of SLE patients. One hundred SLE patients were asked to assess the importance and frequency of occurrence of these items and to suggest those that had not been listed. Item reduction was performed using Rasch model and factor analyses to create a new questionnaire in English. This final questionnaire was administered to a cohort of 275 patients to study its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Fifty-one items covering a wide range of QOL concerns were identified. The patients' responses led to the elimination of 11. The new questionnaire of 40 items was found to have Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 and to consist of eight domains covering physical, mental and social QOL issues. It has good test-retest reliability, poor to fair cross-sectional correlation with the SF-36, with poor correlation with lupus activity or damage indices. The SLEQOL was more responsive to change than the SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new 40-item SLEQOL in English and showed that it is valid for use in SLE patients in Singapore. It offers better content validity and responsiveness to change than the SF-36."
19560371,0,a,"PURPOSE: In middle-income countries, interest in the study of inequalities in health has focused on aggregate types of health outcomes, like rates of mortality. This work moves beyond such measures to focus on disease-specific health outcomes with the use of national health survey data. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the national Health and Welfare Survey 2003, covering 52,030 adult aged 15 or older, were analyzed. The health outcomes were the 20 most commonly reported diseases. The age-sex adjusted concentration index (C *) of ill health was used as a measure of socioeconomic health inequality (values ranging from -1 to +1). A negative (or positive) concentration index shows that a disease was more concentrated among the less well off (or better off). Crude concentration indices (C) for four of the most common diseases were also decomposed to quantify determinants of inequalities. RESULTS: Several diseases, such as malaria (C * = -0.462), goiter (C * = -0.352), kidney stone (C * = -0.261), and tuberculosis (C * = -0.233), were strongly concentrated among those with lower incomes, whereas allergic conditions (C * = 0.174) and migraine (C * = 0.085) were disproportionately reported by the better off. Inequalities were found to be associated with older age, low education, and residence in the rural Northeast and rural North of Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-equity health policy in Thailand and other middle-income countries with health surveys can now be informed by national data combining epidemiological, socioeconomic and health statistics in ways not previously possible."
15847699,0,a,"This debut editorial of Globalization and Health introduces the journal, briefly delineating its goals and objectives and outlines its scope of subject matter. 'Open Access' publishing is expected to become an increasingly important format for peer reviewed academic journals and that Globalization and Health is 'Open Access' is appropriate. The rationale behind starting a journal dedicated to globalization and health is three fold:Firstly: Globalization is reshaping the social geography within which we might strive to create health or prevent disease. The determinants of health - be they a SARS virus or a predilection for fatty foods - have joined us in our global mobility. Driven by economic liberalization and changing technologies, the phenomenon of 'access' is likely to dominate to an increasing extent the unfolding experience of human disease and wellbeing.Secondly: Understanding globalization as a subject matter itself needs certain benchmarks and barometers of its successes and failings. Health is one such barometer. It is a marker of social infrastructure and social welfare and as such can be used to either sound an alarm or give a victory cheer as our interconnectedness hurts and heals the populations we serve.And lastly: In as much as globalization can have an effect on health, it is also true that health and disease has an effect on globalization as exemplified by the existence of quarantine laws and the devastating economic effects of the AIDS pandemic.A balanced view would propose that the effects of globalization on health (and health systems) are neither universally good nor bad, but rather context specific. If the dialogue pertaining to globalization is to be directed or biased in any direction, then it must be this: that we consider the poor first."
2030286,1,a,"A typology of the social climates of group residential facilities for older people was developed by a cluster analysis of seven social climate attributes obtained on a national sample of 235 nursing homes, residential care facilities, and congregate apartments. The analysis yielded six distinct types of social climate: Supportive, Self-Directed; Supportive, Well-Organized; Open Conflict; Suppressed Conflict; Emergent-Positive; and Unresponsive. Facility and resident characteristics were related to social climate type. In addition, the type of social climate was related to resident adaptation. Supportive, Self-Directed and Supportive, Well-Organized facilities had residents who rated higher in well-being and levels of self-initiated activities and who used fewer health services. A configural approach to describing social climates and their determinants and effects may help to develop more humanistic residential facilities and to better match individual residents to appropriate housing placements."
7503131,1,a,"The average life expectancy at birth of Americans has increased 30 years since the turn of the century and is mostly attributable to public health measures. Although death rates for cardiovascular diseases have declined in the past two decades, cardiovascular diseases still cause more deaths in the United States than all other causes combined. The major etiologies of heart disease, atherosclerosis and hypertension, are associated with modifiable risk factors--high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diet, and inactivity. Social status and access to medical care are also important contributors. Consequently, the greatest potential for reducing heart disease mortality and morbidity rests with prevention and public health practice. Recent directions in health-care reform emphasize fiscal management, medical care, and clinical medicine, and not general health. This emphasis exacerbates policy and financing imbalances between preventive and curative medicine. Consequently, the concept of a health system needs to be designed more rationally to allocate resources that include prevention and health promotion. The Bogalusa Heart Study provides understanding of the early origin of cardiovascular problems and the environmental and lifestyle factors that contribute to development of adult heart disease. To apply this information, public health models of intervention, like the school Health Ahead/Heart Smart program, are needed to address heart disease in the population. Changes in the true determinants of poor health, such as environmental factors and unhealthy behaviors, are the directions for prevention and future improvement in quality of life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
15446350,0,a,"This study investigated the importance of socioeconomic factors such as education, income, religion, family structure and residence in explaining the increased risk of mortality among vulnerable populations aged less than 20 years in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Data used were from the 1991 Brazilian Demographic Census and comprised 121,060 women aged 15-49 residing in Rio de Janeiro. Two alternative statistical methods were used to calculate the risk of death: the widely used Brass method (an indirect estimate which assesses population risks) and a case-control study (which assesses individual risks). The study also focused on the importance of indicators of human and social capital, the lack of which may explain the higher risk of death among children and adolescents. Lack of education was found to be a major determinant of mortality at young ages. Residence in a favela (shantytown), families in which mothers were the head of the family, and a lower median level of income were found to be significant determinants of mortality among vulnerable populations in Brazil. However, religion was not found to be as important a predictor of high mortality."
2263988,1,a,"The need of increasing the amount and quality of applied research in the health field es emphasized. The social and economical determinants of health and health care services require a multidisciplinary approach. The most important issue is the utilization of research results in the definition of policies and in the decision making process. Some of the barriers and obstacles to implement research results are discussed as well as the strategies that can be put forward to overcome the former. It is suggested tah participatory research could be an innovative methodology to improve the application of research results. Participative research is a collaborative effort that involves different actors of the health arena including administrators, health personnel, community members, and the researchers themselves. This type of research carries out diagnostic and intervention activities from the very beginning of the studies; its main strength is that decision made and the community members are active participants, impinging a scientific approach to their daily work and so the application of results is facilitated through out the process."
12349133,1,a,"""This article reviews the post-Second World War literature on explanations for Australia's immigration program. It discovers three main schools of thought based on net pull factors: the official explanation and two unofficial explanations which focus on migrants as workers and on migrants as consumers. However the growing importance of net push factors after 1974 means that some of this work is less relevant today. Explanations focusing on net push factors have yet to cohere into a distinct perspective (or perspectives) but some research has been done on chain migration and family-based migration strategies, asylum seekers, temporary movement, and migration and the law."""
10724473,1,a,"While it is established that socioeconomic status and social integration influence the distribution of health and illness among men and women, little attention has been paid to the different ways in which women and men experience socioeconomic opportunities and social attachments to others. Drawing on evidence from the literature, the position developed in this article is that gender mediates the influence of both socioeconomic status and social integration on health, and for women, these are intricately linked. Women's relationship to the labour market establishes and perpetuates their socioeconomic inequality relative to men, and may produce contradictory influences on women's health. Furthermore, for women, the marital relationship is paradoxical: marriage may at once improve economic and social support opportunities, while diminishing control over paid and unpaid work--potentially increasing as well as compromising the health status of women. The article is intended to contribute to the growing body of literature on gender and the determinants of health."
19628619,0,a,"The term 'social vaccine' is designed to encourage the biomedically orientated health sector to recognize the legitimacy of action on the distal social and economic determinants of health. It is proposed as a term to assist the health promotion movement in arguing for a social view of health which is so often counter to medical and popular conceptions of health. The idea of a social vaccine builds on a long tradition in social medicine as well as on a biomedical tradition of preventing illness through vaccines that protect against disease. Social vaccines would be promoted as a means to encourage popular mobilization and advocacy to change the social and economic structural conditions that render people and communities vulnerable to disease. They would facilitate social and political processes that develop popular and political will to protect and promote health through action (especially governments prepared to intervene and regulate to protect community health) on the social and economic determinants. Examples provided for the effects of social vaccines are: restoring land ownership to Indigenous peoples, regulating the advertising of harmful products and progressive taxation for universal social protection. Social vaccines require more research to improve understanding of social and political processes that are likely to improve health equity worldwide. The vaccine metaphor should be helpful in arguing for increased action on the social determinants of health."
8463204,1,a,"Operant and biological theories of the cause of self-injurious behavior (SIB) in people with a mental handicap are often viewed as mutually exclusive. In this single case study, interactions between features of Rett syndrome and operant conditioning as determinants of SIB are examined. Functional analysis by analog methodology indicated different functions for two forms of SIB shown by the subject: automatic reinforcement by sensory stimulation and escape from social interactions. It is suggested that features of Rett syndrome established conditions under which operant conditioning of self-injurious responding was maximized. The implications of this interaction between features of syndromes and operant conditioning for the conceptualization of the cause of SIB are discussed and it is proposed that the notion of a unitary cause of SIB is inappropriate. It is more productive to consider operant conditioning as the process that maintains responding against a background of predisposing and mediating factors which may be biologically determined."
16186737,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the independent association between socioeconomic conditions and the risk of all-cause hospitalization or death during the course of HIV disease in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. METHODS: Patients in the French PRIMO multicenter prospective cohort of 319 individuals were enrolled during primary HIV-1 infection between 1996 and 2002. Associations between social characteristics (ie, employment status, stable partnership) and the risk of hospitalization or death were assessed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 109 hospitalizations among 84 patients (26.3%) and 3 deaths occurred. Even after adjustment for classic determinants of HIV-infected patients' health status, social characteristics were independently associated with the risk of hospitalization or death, with a significantly increased risk for patients with temporary employment compared with those with stable employment (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 5.6) and for patients without a stable partnership compared with those with a stable partnership (OR = 1.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 2.7). CONCLUSIONS: In the era of HAART, adverse social conditions constitute independent risk factors of hospitalization or death during the course of HIV disease."
19252200,0,a,"Despite the Canadian record of concern with the social determinants of health (SDOH), actual public health activities consistent with such an approach are sporadic at best. Canadian research and advocacy activities in the service of strengthening the SDOH are so divorced from everyday public policy activity, media discourse and public awareness as to metaphorically suggest that SDOH researchers and advocates exist in a Phantom Zone of irrelevance. Why this might be the case and means of escaping from such irrelevance are presented. Implications for jurisdictions where the situation appears to be even worse-such as the USA-and for those where the situation may be somewhat better are also presented."
9623686,1,a,"The study aim was to compare the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis and eczema in children living in Munster, western Germany, and Greifswald, eastern Germany, and to investigate associations of several characteristics and exposures with atopic disease symptoms. In 1994 and 1995, questionnaire information was gathered on 5-8 yr old children (n=3,741 in Munster and n=2,857 in Greifswald) and 12-15 yr olds (n=4,003 and n= 3,153, respectively) using the phase I protocol of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). The 12 month period prevalences of reported atopic disease symptoms in 5-8 yr olds were generally higher in Munster than in Greifswald, whereas only a few prevalence differences were observed in 12-15 yr olds. In both age groups the reported lifetime prevalences of asthma, hay fever and eczema were lower in Greifswald. Indoor exposures such as wood or coal heating and feather bedding were negatively associated with symptoms, whereas exposures such as truck traffic in a residential street or active smoking were positively associated with symptoms. Wood or coal heating could partly explain the prevalence difference of allergic rhinitis symptoms among 5-8 yr olds between Munster and Greifswald. The findings provide additional evidence for a role of several characteristics and exposures as potential determinants of asthma and allergies in children."
10719008,0,a,"The social, medical and economic effects of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis on individual patients and the resource implications of this disease for the healthcare sector are considerable. Optimizing the selection of patients who should receive antibiotics according to stringent clinical criteria is the first step in promoting good clinical practice and cost-effectiveness. Antibiotic efficacy is then the major driver of cost, especially when it reduces the need for hospitalization. Resistance to first-line antibiotics can be expected to increase the risk of treatment failure. Other drivers of cost include non-compliance, which predisposes to therapeutic failure, and the selection of resistant strains. Treatment regimens of short duration, once-daily dosing and good tolerability are determinants of good compliance and cost savings. The expenses of first-line antibiotics typically account for only a small proportion of the overall costs of healthcare and the cheapest antibiotics are not necessarily the most cost-effective. The clinical success rate of first-line therapy is the primary determinant of the overall expenditure on healthcare because of the high costs associated with treatment failure, especially if it leads to hospitalization. Factors such as poor patient compliance and high antibiotic resistance rates, which undermine the clinical efficacies of first-line therapy, will increase the overall costs of treatment."
9144822,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Characteristics of individual mental health providers and of treatment settings were examined to determine their effects on providers' expectations about the improvement of patients with serious mental illness. METHODS: The sample consisted of 1,567 treatment providers working in 107 inpatient and outpatient units or programs in 29 Veterans Affairs mental health facilities. They completed a questionnaire about their prognostic expectations and a broad range of attitudes toward job satisfaction, professional relations, and team functioning. Unit or program directors of all 107 units completed another questionnaire about the average functional ability of patients, unit workload, and unit size. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to assess the effects of both individual and unit-level attributes on providers' expectations of improvement in clinical symptomatology and social-functional skills of patients in their care. RESULTS: The providers had generally low expectations about the improvement of patients with serious mental illness. Expectations were higher among staff in units or programs that were smaller and that had an outpatient focus, a greater proportion of staff involved in the treatment team, and higher-functioning patients. Individual characteristics significantly associated with prognostic expectations were occupation, age, and membership on the treatment team. CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic expectations among providers of care to persons with serious mental illness vary with identifiable individual and unit or program characteristics. The latter may be amenable to manipulation and intervention to improve mental health providers' prognostic expectations."
19545045,0,a,"The purpose of this review of the literature is to present factors possibly affecting the spread of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa over the next 20 years. Malaria is a vector-borne disease that depends on environmental and human constraints. The main environmental limitations involve susceptibility of the vector (mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus) and parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) to climate. Malaria is a stable, endemic disease over most of the African continent. Climatic change can only affect a few regions on the fringes of stable zones (e.g. altitude areas or Sahel) where malaria is an unstable, epidemic disease. Higher temperatures could induce a decrease of malaria transmission in regions of the Sahel or an increase in the highlands. The extent of these overall trends will depend on the unpredictable occurrence of major meteorological phenomenon as well as on human activities affecting the environment that could lead to dramatic but limited outbreaks in some locations. The most influential human factors could be runaway demographic growth and urban development. Estimations based on modeling studies indicate that urbanization will lead to a 53.5% drop in exposure to malaria by 2030. However this reduction could be less than expected because of adaptation of Anopheles gambiae and An. arabiensis, the main vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, to the urban environment as well as increasing vector resistance to insecticides. Another unforeseeable factor that could induce unexpected malaria epidemics is mass migration due to war or famine. Finally immunosuppressive illnesses (e.g. HIV and malnutrition) could alter individual susceptibility to malaria. Social constraints also include human activities that modify land use. In this regard land use (e.g. forest clearance and irrigation) is known to influence the burden of malaria that is itself dependent on local determinants of transmission. Overall the most important social constraint for the population will be access to malarial prevention and implementation action to control this scourge."
20589143,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a growing public health problem in Uganda and Africa as a whole. We conducted a study to determine the prevalence and identify factors associated withy hypertension among residents of the rural district of Rukungiri, Uganda. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was used to conduct this study. Between January and February 2006, a random sample of consenting district residents, aged 20 years or older were enrolled to participate in this study. Trained research assistants administered a standardized questionnaire and performed the physical measurements. The questionnaire collected data on demographics, social economic and exposure history to various potential risk factors for hypertension. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) equal or greater than 140mmHg and/or diastolic BP equal or greater than 90mmHg, and/or being on regular anti-hypertensive therapy. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with hypertension. RESULTS: Of the 842 study participants, 252 were hypertensive. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 30.5%, with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 26.6 - 34.3%. Factors found to be associated with hypertension included: past alcohol use, Odds Ratio (OR)=2.28, [1.42 - 3.64], present alcohol use OR=1.64 [1.12 - 2.43], being overweight OR=1.95 [1.37 - 2.79], obesity OR=5.07 [2.79 - 9.21], female sex OR=1.44 [1.03 - 2.06], having attained tertiary education OR=1.91 [1.03 - 3.56], and older age OR=1.42 [1.27 - 1.59]). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hypertension in this rural Ugandan district is relatively high. The findings confirm the growing concern about hypertension as a public health problem in Uganda. More studies are however required to determine the distribution and determinants of hypertension in other parts of the country."
2212095,1,a,"Failure to recognize symptoms which signal cancer may delay contact with the medical care system, thus decreasing the chances of diagnosis at an early stage of disease. We investigated the determinants of cancer symptom recognition and delay in seeking medical care in a population-based sample of 625 newly diagnosed lung, breast and colorectal cancer patients. Although the majority (79.5%) of patients reported noticing symptoms prior to diagnosis, one quarter of these patients (24.7%) delayed longer than three months in seeking medical care. Contrary to the findings of research based on clinic samples, logistic regression analysis revealed that no demographic or social support factors were predictive of symptom recognition or delay, with the exception that older colorectal cancer patients were less likely to notice symptoms, but also less likely to delay. Lung and colorectal patients diagnosed with advanced disease were more likely to notice symptoms than patients with local disease. Results of a content analysis of patients' remarks indicate that breast cancer patients were significantly more likely than lung or colorectal cancer patients to attribute their symptoms to cancer (p less than .001). Symptoms common to lung and colorectal cancer appear to be attributed to other, less serious causes. Given the lack of demographic predictors of symptom recognition and delay in seeking care, we suggest that education programs address risk groups for specific cancers, rather than the general public as a whole, grouping together all cancers and cancer symptomatology."
9246691,1,a,"This multilevel study of spatial variability in, and determinants of, birthweight was conducted using individual and ecological data in a geographically defined prospective birth cohort for 1986 in northern Finland. The study area comprises three large areas defined by latitude: Northern Lapland (NL), Southern Lapland (SL) and Oulu province (OP), comprising 74 localities with a total study population of 9216 singleton births. The mean birthweight was 3482 g for NL, 3537 g for SL and 3587 g for OP (NL vs. OP and SL vs. OP: P < 0.05). The crude rate for stillbirths was highest in NL. The women in the northernmost area were socially less privileged and the localities less prosperous compared with those in the southernmost area. Significant spatial clustering of mean birthweights was found (P = 0.0016), with highest birthweight in the south-western part of the study area. A variable expressing the wealth of each locality, the financial capacity category (FCC), had its lowest mean value in NL, with a range of one to six for the localities studied here. A multilevel multiple regression model showed that, after allowing for sex, gestational age, mother's age, height and hypertensive disorders, parity, body mass index, previous low birthweight child and smoking as individual determinants of birthweight, part of the residual variation could be explained by the locality wealth parameter. Using the multilevel model, the differences in mean birthweight across the three latitude areas persisted but were reduced (difference OP vs. NL reduced from 105 g to 86.5 g). The relationship between birthweight and FCC was inverse U-shaped with the highest mean birthweight estimated for localities occurring in the middle of the range (FCC = 3). The wealthiest urban localities (FCC = 6) and the most deprived localities (FCC = 1) both had a predicted birthweight about 60 g below the maximum at FCC = 3, if all other factors were held constant. This result, taken together with the spatial clustering of birthweights, suggests that there may be important social and environmental determinants of birthweight that have yet to be identified."
12973577,0,a,"This article presents the relationship between wage labor, housewifery, and health from a gender perspective. The relationship between the two types of work determines the characteristics and meaning of daily life. The methodology combined quantitative and qualitative techniques. An individual questionnaire was applied to 256 male and 121 female workers (n = 377) in a modern pharmaceutical factory in Mexico. In addition, seven in-depth interviews were performed with selected employees. Despite important similarities between female and male wage-earners, there were two key differences: gender segregation in the workplace and the division of household work. The social determinants of this uneven situation result from a complex gender relationship, leading to different disease profiles and health concepts."
1879391,1,a,"Employed data from two longitudinal surveys of gay men in San Francisco (a) to examine for cohort (Study 1) and attrition (Studies 1 and 2) bias effects on reported changes in condom use by gay men and (b) to investigate predictors of condom use (Study 2). Substantial increases in condom use were observed, and these changes were unrelated to attrition and cohort bias. In terms of predictors of condom use, men who always used condoms had higher levels of social support from informal sources of help, had more positive expectations that condoms would have positive interpersonal and personal consequences, and were more likely to be HIV positive than men who used condoms occasionally or never. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for HIV-prevention research."
17472062,0,a,"Health is an axiological category, which does not possess measurable matter parameters. The problem of health is sometimes raised in families, social circles and institutions. Due to the fact that students of special pedagogy have contacts with school children with health deficits, they have to be fully aware of the fact how significant predicator health is in their own development. The target of this study was to show the output of the research aimed at seeking an answer to the following question: What level of knowledge about health and its determinants in their own perception is presented by the students on the grounds of the educational specialty they have chosen? The research comprised 84 students of 1st, 3rd and 5th years of the faculty of special pedagogy (different specialties) aged from 18 to 24. The research material was collected by an interview questionnaire elaborated by themselves and categorized conversation (""a ladder"") concerning three of the following basic questions: 1) the amount of general knowledge about health they possessed; 2) the amount of their knowledge of factors conditioning a human's state of health; 3) the amount of the awareness of the importance of one's care for his or her own health and for that of others. The output received in the research shows a mean degree of satisfaction of special pedagogy students with the level of their knowledge concerning health. Their statements connected with their self-assessment of that level should make one reflect upon the subject in question."
19323024,0,a,"Local health determinants, perceived by a local community in Mueang District, Khon Kaen Province, were explored using a qualitative approach during November 2006. Health determinants could be classified into three categories: environmental, individual and family, and institutional factors. Community perspectives on health determinants included flooding, habits of lottery buying, fluctuation of vegetable market prices, and job opportunities. Community participants gave high value to the social determinants of health as opposed to environmental/biomedical factors, considering that such conditions could positively build social cohesion and even lead to better well-being. They prioritized flooding as a major environmental health determinant that affected villagers' physical and mental health, as well as family income. For social health determinants, they also indicated that many villagers were addicted to lottery buying that led to mental and financial problems within families."
17903329,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is considered a major public health issue in most developed countries nowadays. This paper provides an overview of current population data available in Spain and the approach to develop preventive strategies in the country. METHODS: Review of population data available is based on individually measured weight and height as well as determinants. On this basis, the approach used in the country to develop preventive strategies is discussed. RESULTS: According to the DORICA study, the prevalence of obesity (BMI >or=30 kg m-2) is 15.5% in Spanish adults aged 25-60 years (13.2% in men and 17.5% in women). Obesity rates are higher among women aged 45 years and older, low social class, living in semi-urban places. Population estimates for the prevalence of obesity in Spanish children and young people based on the enKid study are 13.9% for the whole group. In this study, overweight and obesity is related to absence of breastfeeding, low consumption of fruit and vegetables, high consumption of cakes, buns, softdrinks and butchery products, low physical activity levels and a positive association with time spent watching TV. In 2005, the Spanish Ministry of Health jointly with the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition launched the multifaceted NAOS strategy for nutrition, physical activity and the prevention of obesity. The important role of the family and the school setting as well as the responsibility of the Health Administration and Pediatric Care in the prevention of obesity is highlighted in the document. The need for environmental actions is recognised. The PERSEO programme, a multicomponent school-based intervention project is part of the strategy currently in place. CONCLUSION: Obesity is a public health issue in Spain. A national multifaceted strategy was launched to counteract the problem. Environmental and policy actions are a priority. Young children and their families are among the main target groups."
12294798,1,a,"""This paper investigates the patterns and determinants of interprovincial migration streams in China for the period 1985-1990.... Migration flow data from the 1990 Chinese census permit us to examine these issues and policies, and to ascertain the degree to which the objectives of the country's migration policies are being met. We address these and related matters by developing a human ecological model of interprovincial migration that is grounded in a straightforward gravity model which should help us better understand the patterns of migration to, and from, each of the provinces of China between 1985 and 1990."""
2019096,1,a,"The purpose of this paper is to develop an analytic framework and methodology for estimating the demand for psychiatric hospitalization in state facilities, either new admissions or readmissions of clients from the Community Services Boards (CSBs) of Virginia. The combination of community and organizational factors with inpatient characteristics for the CSBs can help identify pertinent predictors of psychiatric hospitalization. Review of the literature on psychiatric epidemiology shows that the predictors of psychiatric hospitalization can be classified into four major dimensions including community resources, socio-demographic factors, CSB client characteristics, and CSB organizational factors. It is postulated that the rates of first admissions and readmissions to state facilities are influenced by four dimensions. Furthermore, the variation in readmissions rates is contingent upon previous first admission rates and the average length of stays in state institutions while other conditions-such as community resources and demographics, CSB client mix, and CSB organizational factors-are simultaneously considered. The data were compiled from multiple sources. A path analytic model, using a linear structural relations program (LISREL VI), was validated. After the model was carefully fitted, the estimation equations for the rates of first admissions and readmissions were finalized. The estimates for psychiatric hospitalization, both first- and re-admissions, were made for each of the study CSBs."
19712011,0,a,"Menopause is a natural physiological event that usually begins in women between the ages of 48 and 55 years. In many cases, this event is associated with unpleasant somatic-vegetative, urogenital or psychological symptoms. To test the health and social demographic factors (especially household income level) that influence willingness to pay (WTP) for a new hormone-free treatment in women of menopausal age. 1365 women between the ages of 45 and 73 years were surveyed about their health and WTP for the new treatment. WTP was evaluated with a closed-ended binary questionnaire (four groups with different levels of co-payment between euro15 and euro60), using the contingent valuation method. The average WTP was calculated according to the area under the demand function. Factors contributing to payment readiness were examined by means of binary logistic regression. WTP was significantly affected by women's opinion of the new medication, the level of co-payment required, net household income, whether currently in treatment for menopausal symptoms, and Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) values. Compared with other factors, the level of co-payment was predicted to have a negative impact on WTP. Income level is an important factor in WTP and correlates highly with several other health-related variables (WHO-5 index, MRS value, receipt of other menopause medicines and existing co-morbidity). The average co-payment that our group of women was willing to pay was between euro17 and euro35 per month, or euro24 to euro42 for women who were currently receiving treatment for symptoms of menopause. While interpreting the results, it should be considered that the hypothetical therapy was assumed to be a new non-reimbursable alternative to conventional therapy offered under the existing statutory framework for health insurance in Germany. Despite some methodological limitations, these results are useful for examining the factors affecting WTP and incremental utilities for future medicine dealing with menopause."
8602490,1,a,"The first nation-wide Quit and Win Contest in Sweden was held in 1988 with 12,840 participants. This corresponds to a participant rate of 6.4 per 1,000 daily tobacco users in Sweden. In order to follow up the long-term effects of cessation and to analyse the determinants for successful cessation, a panel (n = 946) of randomized participants were followed-up at 6 and 12 months with a mailed questionnaire. This gave a complete set of data for 557 (panel) respondents. Available baseline data from the participants' entry forms included sex, age, occupation, specific tobacco habits, quitting attempts during the previous year, and place of residence. At the 12-month follow-up 21% had been tobacco-free for the whole year. In addition 9% of the participants relapsed into tobacco-use, then quit again and were tobacco-free at the 12-month follow-up. The success rate for those participants (14%) who used smokeless tobacco (oral snuff) was similar to that of smokers. The logistic regression showed a significantly better prognosis for success among those without any earlier quitting attempts during the previous year (OR 2.35), if the subjects participated of their own volition rather than having been recruited by a non-tobacco user (OR 1.74), and if they were married/co-habiting (OR 1.92), the results were also significantly improved. The results also show that as a population-based method, Quit and Win produced many successful tobacco quitters, and one year after the contest one-fifth of the participants were still abstinent."
9084798,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of HIV/AIDS on the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and to analyse the determinants of TB presenting as the first indicative disease of AIDS. DESIGN: Analysis of TB and AIDS surveillance data. SETTING: Catalonia, north-east Spain. PATIENTS: Two separate sources were used: (i) TB cases reported to the Catalan TB registry diagnosed between January 1982 and December 1993; (ii) AIDS cases reported to the AIDS Catalan registry diagnosed between January 1982 and December 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected and observed TB cases, and number and characteristics of AIDS cases presenting with TB. RESULTS: From 1987 to 1993 the annual TB crude incidence rate increased by 50% to a rate of 49.7 per 100,000, with a least 60% of the increase directly due to AIDS. During that period specific rates among children aged 0-4 years remained high at around 40 per 100,000. A total of 7,010 AIDS cases were diagnosed between 1988 and 1994, of whom 24.3% had TB. Multivariate analysis from those AIDS cases showed that besides male sex, young age, and urban residence, the strongest predictors of TB among AIDS cases were history of imprisonment (odds ratio, 2.16; P < 0.001) and intravenous drug use (odds ratio, 1.65; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The high rates of TB among children and young adults suggest that TB transmission has increased during this period, especially among people at high risk of AIDS. The determinants of individual risk of TB among AIDS patients act together, especially in prisons. The HIV/TB coepidemic is an emerging threat potentially for all and requires expanding targeted measures to prevent and control both disease in our setting."
10120999,1,a,"Coronary heart disease deaths have declined in New Zealand, as in other Western countries, during the past two decades. This is probably due to a combination of population lifestyle changes and improved treatment of the disease. However, the social class gradient for coronary disease has reversed and it is now more common in lower socio-economic groups who are increasingly disadvantaged in our community. Socioeconomic factors are powerful, primary determinants not only of coronary disease but also of many of the other health problems outlined in the New Zealand Health Charter. Policy making and health services delivery shape societal conditions essential for true health. These factors are considered in relation to the spectrum of human communication and the current transitional changes in our health system."
12119990,0,a,"A decline in daily physical activity levels is clearly a major factor contributing to the current obesity epidemic affecting both developed and developing countries in the world. This escalating problem is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and reduced psychosocial health. Thus, increasing physical activity has become the strategy of choice in public health strategies to prevent obesity. Efforts to improve levels of physical activity in the population rely upon an accurate understanding of the determinants of physical activity. Most research has focused on environmental and social influences, while the potential for physical activity to be controlled by intrinsic biological processes has been largely overlooked. This review presents some of the compelling and diverse evidence that has emerged recently showing that physical activity energy expenditure is a critical factor in both the successful regulation of energy balance in normal individuals, as well as the abnormal regulation of energy balance that characterizes obesity. Although the metabolic and genetic factors involved in these regulatory processes remain mostly unidentified, some novel discoveries have been made in this area recently and these are described within this review."
15128709,0,a,"The aim of this study was to identify socioeconomic factors associated with mortality among cities in Japan. Sex-specific and age-adjusted mortality rates for 1990 and 1995 were calculated by 779 local administrative units across the nation. One hundred indicators related to socioeconomic factors were compiled and divided into eight categories: economy, education, living conditions, vegetation and open space, transport, preventive activities, medical care and demography. Composite socioeconomic indices were formulated using factor analysis of the socioeconomic indicators by category, and the association between the indices and mortality rates was examined by correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. Nineteen composite socioeconomic indices were obtained from factor analysis, and all indices except educational expenditure-related index were significantly correlated with mortality rates. Unemployment, old housing, primary health resources and density were independently positively associated, and higher education, public library activity, health check-up participation and population growth were independently negatively associated with both 1990 and 1995 male mortality rates. For female mortality, higher income, unemployment, spacious dwelling, old housing, less vegetation, road facility, numbers of cars per population, primary health resources and density were independently positively associated, and higher education, public library activity and health check-up participation were independently negatively associated. The relationship between mortality and socioeconomic conditions was stronger in males than in females, and higher income and less vegetation were associated with higher mortality only for females. The present study demonstrated a close link between mortality and a wide range of socioeconomic conditions by using a number of indicators compiled from various data sources. The results promote a deeper understanding of socioeconomic health determinants and development of multi-sectoral health policy to improve population health."
16211164,0,a,"Oral health is an important element of general health and well-being. Although largely preventable, many people across the world still suffer unnecessarily from the pain and discomfort associated with oral diseases. In addition, the costs of dental treatment are high, both to the individual and to society. Effective evidence-based preventive approaches are needed to address this major public health problem. The aim of this paper is to outline public health strategies to promote oral health and reduce inequalities. An extensive collection of public health policy documents produced by WHO are reviewed to guide the development of oral health strategies. In addition a range of Cochrane and other systematic reviews assessing the evidence base for oral health interventions are summarized. Public health strategies should tackle the underlying social determinants of oral health through the adoption of a common risk approach. Isolated interventions which merely focus on changing oral health behaviours will not achieve sustainable improvements in oral health. Radical public health action on the conditions which determine unhealthy behaviours across the population is needed rather than relying solely on the high-risk approach. Based upon the Ottawa Charter, a range of complementary strategies can be implemented in partnership with relevant local, national and international agencies. At the core of this public health approach is the need to empower local communities to become actively involved in efforts to promote their oral health."
18569355,0,a,"The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the merits of evaluating new public health campaign materials in the developmental phase using an experimental design. This is referred to as experimental pretesting. In practice, most new materials are tested only after they have been distributed using nonexperimental or quasiexperimental designs. In cases where materials are pretested prior to distribution, pretesting is usually done using qualitative research methods such as focus groups. Although these methods are useful, they cannot reliably predict the effectiveness of new campaign materials in a developmental phase. Therefore, we suggest when pretesting new materials, not only qualitative research methods but also experimental research methods must be used. The present study discusses an experimental pretest study of new campaign materials intended for distribution in a national sexually transmitted infection (STI) AIDS prevention campaign in the Netherlands. The campaign material tested was the storyline of a planned television commercial on safe sex. A storyboard that consisted of drawings and text was presented to members of the target population, namely, students between the ages of 14 and 16 enrolled in vocational schools. Results showed positive effects on targeted determinants of safe sexual behavior. The advantages, practical implications, and limitations of experimental pretesting are discussed."
10401873,1,a,"Because previous findings have been inconsistent, we explored the association of serum concentrations of uric acid with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality and myocardial infarction prospectively. We used data from 1,044 men who are members of the World Health Organization Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases (MONICA) Augsburg cohort. The men, 45-64 years of age in 1984-1985, were followed through 1992. There were 90 deaths, 44 of which were related to cardiovascular disease; 60 men developed incident nonfatal or fatal myocardial infarction. We estimated hazard rate ratios from Cox proportional hazard models. Uric acid levels > or =373 micromol/liter (fourth quartile) vs < or =319 micromol/liter (first and second quartile) independently predicted all-cause mortality [hazard rate ratio = 2.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6-5.0] after adjustment for alcohol, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, hypertension, use of diuretic drugs, smoking, body mass index, and education. The adjusted risk of cardiovascular disease mortality was 2.2 (95% CI = 1.0-4.8), and that of myocardial infarction was 1.7 (95% CI = 0.8-3.3). Although residual confounding cannot be excluded, our results are among the few, in men, demonstrating a strong positive association of elevated serum uric acid with all-cause mortality. Future investigations may be able to evaluate whether uric acid contributes independently to the development of cardiovascular disease or is simply a component of the atherogenic metabolic condition known as the insulin resistance syndrome."
7781734,1,a,"The prevalence of antibodies to Chlamydia pneumoniae was examined in a stratified random sample of 581 Jerusalem adult residents between August 1987 and March 1989. IgG and IgA titres were measured by microimmunofluorescence, and associations with smoking and socio-demographic variables were assessed. IgG antibodies were found in 84.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 80.4-87.9) of men and 68.7% (95% CI: 61.6-75.0) of women (P < 0.0001 for sex difference), indicating a very high rate of exposure in this population. IgA antibodies, postulated to represent persistent infection, were present in 45.1% (95% CI: 40.1-50.2) of men and 23% (95% CI: 17.4-29.7) of women (P < 0.0001 for sex difference). Factors associated with IgG seropositivity included family size, education and social class. On the other hand age (in men) and smoking were associated with IgA seropositivity. These findings support the hypothesis that low socioeconomic status and household crowding may be predictive of exposure to or infection with this organism (IgG seropositivity), whereas they do not explain persistence of the infection putatively expressed as IgA seropositivity."
1468852,1,a,"The deaths of children aged 1-4 years were studied in a cohort of 5914 Brazilian liveborns. A total of 29 early childhood deaths were recorded (cumulative mortality risk of approximately 6 per 1000), 17 of which (59%) were due to infectious diseases. The death rate was highest in the second year. Deaths were highly concentrated in children from low income (< US $50/month) families, where the cumulative risk of early childhood death was about 10 per 1000; on the other hand, there were no deaths among the 616 children from families with a monthly income of US $300 or more. Birthweight was also associated with mortality: the cumulative risk of children weighing less than 2000 g at birth was 21 per 1000, compared to 4 per 1000 among those with birthweights of 3500 g or more. Simultaneous adjustment for income and birthweight did not substantially change these differentials. These findings confirm the strong association between early childhood mortality and socioeconomic conditions, but also make evident the long-term effects of low birthweight."

18201794,0,a,"In recent years, interest on researching on antenatal care issues and other health promotion and prevention interventions has increased. However, even though there is a growing interest in publishing about antenatal care use, evidence concerning which, and how socioeconomic conditions influence whether a pregnant woman demands or not antenatal consultations on the assumption that the theoretical access to this service has not entry barriers, is still limited. In order to generate this evidence, a two-stage analysis was performed with data gathered on the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) carried out by Profamilia in Colombia during 2005. The first stage was run as a logistic regression model showing the marginal effects on the probability of attending the first visit and an ordinary least squares model was performed for the second stage accounting for the absences to antenatal consultations once at least one visit was carried out. It was found that mothers living in the Pacific Ocean region as well as young mothers seem to have a lower probability of attending the first visit but these factors are not related to the number of absences to antenatal consultation once the first visit has been achieved. The effect of health insurance was surprising because of the differing effects that the health insurers showed. Some familiar and personal conditions such as willingness to have the last children and number of previous children, demonstrated to be important in the determination of demand. The effect of mother's educational attainment was proved as important whereas the father's educational achievement was not. This paper provides some elements for policy making in order to increase the demand inducement of antenatal care, as well as stimulating research on demand for specific issues on health."
9204701,1,a,"This research examines the social, demographic, and family-planning-program factors that influence the occurrence of IUD discontinuation among Chinese women, using a sample of 14,639 IUD use segments from the 1988 Chinese National Survey of Fertility and Contraceptive Prevalence. A discrete-time competing-risk event history method is employed to identify the determinants of IUD discontinuation by five kinds of reasons: contraceptive failure, expulsion, switching method, side-effects and other nonmethod-related reasons. The predictors of IUD discontinuation suggest that a number of mechanisms are in operation. Some of the determinants may reflect the effects of the family planning program; some may illustrate women's physiological and biological reactions to IUD's; some may be related to women's previous history of contraceptive use; and still others may indicate social characteristics of women that lead them to have their IUD's removed."
16880215,0,a,"There is an extensive literature within anthropology, sociology and psychology about lay concepts of determinants of health and illness. Many of these studies have used single sex or social class samples, often in narrow age bands, and many are qualitative in approach. We asked respondents in a health survey to say how important (on a five-point scale) they thought seven potential influences on health (habits, self-care, the environment, family relationships, one's constitution, money and luck) were. The first three were regarded as very important, the second three as less important and luck as least important. Responses were consistent with current public health and epidemiological knowledge; these respondents endorsed prevailing views about personal responsibility for health and about the role of the physical and social environment in influencing health. In mutually adjusted models, there were no significant gender differences, social class differences and neighbourhood differences in three out of seven influences, and age differences in four out of seven influences. Thus, socio-demographic differences were less marked than might be inferred from studies of specific social groups, indicating a need for caution in health education and health promotion practice against always assuming socio-demographic differences."

The authors examine data from in-depth interviews to illuminate actions taken by community members to reduce stressors or minimize their impact on health. Finally, the authors describe the use of this context-specific stress process model and data gathered regarding actions to address community stressors to inform the development of interventions by the ESVHWP to reduce stressors or strengthen the conditioning factors that reduce the impact of stress on health. On the basis of these results, the authors discuss opportunities and challenges for partnership approaches to addressing social determinants of health in urban communities."
16299386,0,a,"Myxococcus xanthus has two different mechanisms of motility, adventurous (A) motility, which permits individual cells to glide over solid surfaces, and social (S) motility, which permits groups of cells to glide. To identify the genes involved in S-gliding motility, we mutagenized a delta aglU (A-) strain with the defective transposon, magellan-4, and screened for S- mutants that form nonmotile colonies. Sequence analysis of the sites of the magellan-4 insertions in these mutants and the alignment of these sites with the M. xanthus genome sequence show that two-thirds of these insertions lie within 27 of the 37 nonessential genes known to be required for social motility, including those necessary for the biogenesis of type IV pili, exopolysaccharide, and lipopolysaccharide. The remaining insertions also identify 31 new, nonessential genes predicted to encode both structural and regulatory determinants of S motility. These include three tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, several regulators of transcription that may control the expression of genes involved in pilus extension and retraction, and additional enzymes involved in polysaccharide metabolism. Three insertions that abolish S motility lie within genes predicted to encode glycolytic enzymes, suggesting that the signal for pilus retraction may be a simple product of exopolysaccharide catabolism."
17538057,0,a,"Research has shown that married women's greatest risk for HIV infection is their husbands' extramarital sexual activities. Using 6 months of ethnographic research in southeastern Uganda, I examined how the social and economic contexts surrounding men's extramarital sexuality and the dynamics of marriage put men and women at risk for HIV infection. I found that Uganda's HIV prevention messages may be inadvertently contributing to increased difficulty in acknowledging HIV risk and to newer forms of sexual secrecy and that structural determinants, including persistent poverty, intersect with gender inequalities to shape marital risk. After examining a community effort to regulate men's sexuality, I suggest that HIV prevention strategies should focus more on endogenous forms of risk reduction while simultaneously addressing structural factors that facilitate opportunities for men's extramarital sex."
1898500,1,a,"In Manitoba, Canada, a representative cohort of elderly individuals ages 65 to 84 (n = 3,573) were interviewed in 1971 and the survivors of this cohort were reinterviewed in 1983. This analysis assesses the determinants of successful aging--whether or not an individual will live to an advanced age, continue to function well at home, and remain mentally alert. Over 100 separate indicators of demographic and socio-economic status, social supports, health and mental status in 1971 were available as potential predictors of successful aging. Indicators of access to health care over the period 1970-82 and indicators of diseases over this period were also available as predictors. Those who aged successfully were shown to have greater satisfaction with life in 1983 and to have made fewer demands on the health care system than those who aged less well. Despite the large number of potential predictors of successful aging which were examined, only age, four measures of health status, two measures of mental status, and not having one's spouse die or enter a nursing home were shown to be predictive of successful aging."
19944934,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Kalihi Valley is a densely populated, low-income community (28,958 residents in approximately 6 square miles) with insufficient sidewalks, bike lanes, and public green space to support regular physical activity for its residents. Kokua Kalihi Valley (KKV), a community health center formed in 1972, sought to improve Kalihi Valley's built environment based on its history of community- and partnership-based preventive health initiatives that have focused on the social determinants of health. INTERVENTION: Kokua Kalihi Valley used a flexible partnership model and a focus on direct community action to develop an unused 100-acre state park (the Kalihi Valley Nature Park) and establish a bicycle repair and recycling program that mobilized thousands of community volunteers, attracted widespread media coverage, and established a number of innovative programs for active living. Kokua Kalihi Valley and its partners also contributed to the successful passage of a city charter amendment to prioritize Honolulu as a bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly city. RESULTS: This initiative was successful in reclaiming a substantial amount of land for active living and in stimulating both public governmental support and widespread private community involvement in programs and activities. LESSONS LEARNED: Projects that engaged community members in activities with tangible accomplishment were shown to be most successful. CONCLUSIONS: This initiative showed that community health centers may be uniquely positioned to provide leadership and assume responsibility for cross-sectoral active-living health projects."
19272301,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study is to identify predictors of current cigarette smoking in adolescents within the school, home, and broader social environment. METHOD: A two stage cluster sample design was used to select a representative sample of students from all middle and high schools in Cyprus in 2005-2006. Standardized Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) methodology was employed in administering the questionnaires and processing the results. Analyses were conducted using logistic regression with the outcome variable being current smoking. RESULTS: After adjusting for the effect of other predictors in the model, the strongest predictor of adolescent smoking was smoking peers. Having parents and grandparents that smoke, concerns about weight, access to pocket money, ease of buying cigarettes, owning an item with a cigarette logo on it, the belief that smokers are less attractive, and the false consensus effect all remain statistically significant predictors. CONCLUSION: In designing smoking prevention programs, factors pertaining to the school, social and familial circle of adolescents as well as misconceptions on the link between smoking and physical appearance need to be considered. Such programs can act as empowering tools to complement legal measures which need to be firmly enforced and constantly revised to be effective."
20198904,0,a,"Drug use is a complex behavior with multidimensional determinants, including social, psychological, cultural, economic, and biological factors. Blood borne viral infections including hepatitis C virus are transmitted when an uninfected intravenous drug user (IVDU) uses injection equipment, especially syringes, that have previously been used by an infected person. The transmission can also result from sharing other injection equipment such as 'cookers' and 'cottons'. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse have declined substantially since the introduction of needle exchange. Infection with hepatitis C may spontaneously resolve during the acute stage and never progress to chronic infection, or the infection may become chronic without medical complications, or the infection may become chronic with progressive medical complications. Regular testing for infection is an important strategy for secondary prevention of chronic hepatitis C infection. Care for hepatitis C is a vital component of a comprehensive health program for persons using illicit drugs. Such care includes screening for transmission risk behavior, prevention counseling and education, testing for HCV antibody and RNA. IDUs found to have chronic HCV infection should be assessed for the presence and degree of liver disease and evaluated for treatment for HCV Hepatitis C care also requires providing access to treatment for substance use and abuse. Therapy with opioid agonists, including methadone maintenance treatment, has been shown to diminish and often eliminate opioid use and reduce transmission of infection. Approval of buprenorphine makes office-based pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction possible. When considering treatment for hepatitis C, particular attention must be paid to mental health conditions. As a group, IDUs exhibit higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders than the general population. IFN-based regimens for hepatitis C are often complicated by neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including depression, insomnia, and irritability. Strong linkages with mental health services, whether on-site or within the community, are a vital component of comprehensive health programs for IDUs and are particularly important during treatment for hepatitis C. Past episodes of depression or other psychiatric disorders are not absolute contraindications for the treatment for HCV infection. Some authors recommend prophylactic antidepressant therapy before initiating treatment for HCV in patients thought to be at a high risk of depression."
9571573,1,a,"This paper describes development of Padres Trabajando por la Paz, a violence prevention intervention for Hispanic parents to increase parental monitoring. The intervention was developed using an innovative new program planning process: intervention mapping. Theory and empirical evidence broadly defined performance objectives and determinants of parental monitoring. These objectives were further refined through group and individual interviews with the target parent group. Learning objectives for the intervention guided the content of the intervention that used modeling as the primary method and role model stories as a strategy delivered through newsletters. Stage-matching members of the target population for their readiness to implement the parental monitoring behaviors further refined the social cognitive message design strategies. Intervention mapping provides an explicit theory- and data-driven guide for intervention development that maximizes intervention impact for a specific target population."
1946862,1,a,"The aims of this study were, first, to estimate the prevalence of depressive disorders in Australian nursing home residents using international diagnostic criteria, and second, to explore environmental determinants of such disorders. Residents of 24 nursing homes were surveyed using the Canberra Interview for the Elderly (CIE) and a range of environmental measures was also taken. Of 323 residents who were screened for cognitive impairment, 165 (51%) scored 18 or above on the Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al. 1975), and were interviewed with the CIE. According to DSM-III-R criteria and the CIE, the prevalence of major depressive episode was 9.7%. Using ICD-10 criteria, 6.1% of residents suffered from a severe depressive episode, 6.7% from a moderate depressive episode and 6.7% from a mild depressive episode. Some measures of the social environment were significantly related to depressive symptoms."
21431819,0,a,"This paper introduces a series of research projects designed to fulfill the societal role of environmental health studies by investigating (1) the dynamic and complex relationships between environmental conditions and (2) health in an urban setting. Research in this first category has revealed the existence of the combined influence of multiple physical environmental factors on health and its mechanisms. In the second category, there have been a number of studies of the integrated influence of social environmental factors on health employing an aggregate modeling of multiple determinants of health and studies of individual topics related to social determinants of health. These research projects have contributed to the formulation of specific remedies and the development of comprehensive health policies. Participatory approaches have been used to enhance capacity building opportunities and to ensure that research results reflect the actual conditions in urban societies. Healthy Cities projects and programs have been developed in close collaboration with this type of research. Urban societies have become interdependent and share the same issues globally. Further research into the relationships between health and the environment in the context of urbanization will expand the base of evidence applicable to the complex realities in modern societies."
16813040,0,a,"Results of longitudinal studies suggest that the stability of preferences varies across individuals, although it is unclear what variables account for these differences. We extended this work by conducting periodic assessments of preference for leisure activities over 3 to 6 months with 10 adults with developmental disabilities. Although previous research has collectively shown that preferences identified via repeated assessment are highly variable, our results showed that preferences were relatively stable for the majority (80%) of participants. In an attempt to identify some environmental determinants of shifts in preference, we provided extended daily access to high-preference items (preference-weakening manipulation) and paired access to low-preference items with social and edible putative reinforcers during brief sessions (preference-strengthening manipulation). Preference assessments continued over the course of these manipulations with 2 participants. Results showed that changes in preference across time could be produced systematically and suggest that naturally occurring changes in establishing operations or conditioning histories contribute to temporal shifts in preference. Implications for preference assessments, reinforcer usage, and planned attempts to change preferences are discussed."
9862278,1,a,"Elevated circulating total homocyst(e)ine concentrations are associated with a higher prevalence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). We utilized data from the Caerphilly Prospective Cohort Study to assess the predictive power of the serum total homocyst(e)ine concentration for future IHD. Serum total homocyst(e)ine concentrations were measured in 2290 men in the Caerphilly cohort, a representative population sample of men aged 50-64 years. During a 5-year follow-up period, 56 men suffered fatal IHD, 77 had a non-fatal myocardial infarction, while 21 were found to have ECG evidence of myocardial infarction (MI) when examined at follow-up. The mean serum total homocyst(e)ine concentration in the total of 154 men who experienced an incident IHD event was 12.4 micromol/l, whereas the 2136 men who experienced no such event had a mean level of 11.7 micromol/l. The difference between these means, examined by logistic regression and standardising for the effects of differences in age, social class, smoking, BMI, diabetes, HDL-cholesterol and prevalent IHD is 0.47 micromol/l (95% CI = -0.13 to 1.11 micromol/l). The mean difference for the 56 men who died, and whose death was attributed to IHD, is 0.81 micromol/l (95% CI= -0.17 to 1.88 micromol/l) after correction for confounding factors. Vitamin nutritional status and alcohol intake were significant negative determinants of serum total homocyst(e)ine concentrations; the effect of alcohol is explained by the folic acid content of beer, which is the preferred alcoholic beverage in Caerphilly. It is concluded that the serum total homocyst(e)ine concentration is weakly predictive of IHD events, though in the present data adjustments for other factors attenuated the relationship and it became not statistically significant (P > 0.05)."
8880401,1,a,"PURPOSE: To study the distribution, prevalence, determinants, and association between substance use (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs) and eating attitudes and behavior of high school students in the Negev region of Israel in order to provide an improved basis for prevention and health services. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire regarding attitudes and behavior related to substance use and eating (e.g., breakfast before school, a snack or meal during school time, and three meals a day) was answered by 1,513 high school age youth. RESULTS: The study participants were at greater risk of poor eating behavior if they: (1) used cigarettes, alcohol, and/or illicit substances (p < .01); and (2) were female (p < .01). It was found that girls who used cigarettes were more likely than other young people studied not to eat properly and not to know about the relation between proper eating behavior and personal health (p < .05). Regardless whether cigarettes, alcohol, or illicit substances were used or not used, more than 50% of the youth reported not eating breakfast and 30% indicated they did not eat three meals daily. CONCLUSIONS: There are many concerns about the use and abuse of both licit and illicit substances among adolescents. More attention, however, needs to be given to the relationship between substance use and the attitudes and behavior of young people toward their health, including proper eating habits. The results support the need to develop drug prevention and health programs that are more comprehensive in terms of addressing the broad range of factors associated with adolescent growth and development."
17880613,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There is a need to identify factors explaining why some people stop donating blood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A random mail survey of first-time (FT) and repeat (RPT) current (donating within 6 months before survey) and lapsed (donating >2 years prior) donors was conducted. The self-administered questionnaire included questions on personal, social, and behavioral characteristics. RESULTS: Among 1280 current and 1672 lapsed donors with valid addresses, the participation rate was 66.8 and 39.2 percent, respectively. In FT donors, the odds of lapsing increased with education (odds ratio [OR], 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-3.55 for college or higher vs. Grade 12 or less education). Lapsed FT donors were more often asked to donate (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.32-2.70) and had less interest in incentives (p < 0.001) than current FT donors. In RPT donors, lapsed status was associated with being younger (p < 0.001) and female (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.42). Lapsed status was inversely associated with satisfaction with the last donation experience in both FT (p = 0.043) and RPT (p < 0.001) donors. Lapsed and current donors did not differ in perceived need for blood, personal transfusion experience, or mean reported altruistic behavior score. CONCLUSION: A positive donation experience appears to be a major determinant of donor return behavior. Lapsed donors do not appear, on average, to engage in fewer altruistic behaviors than currently active donors. Retention marketing strategies that appeal solely to altruistic values need to be further evaluated for their effectiveness."
12282988,1,a,"The authors examine the determinants of the personal distribution of income and wealth using an overlapping generations model in which all individuals are assumed to be identical except for their inherited wealth. ""It is shown that, in general, higher tax rates reduce distributive inequality as long as the rate of interest is exogenously given. In steady state, however, where the rate of interest is determined endogenously, increasing taxation and higher social security payments both diminish the capital labor ratio so that the rate of interest rises. If this interest effect is strong enough then it may outbalance the tendency toward more equality because higher interest rates enhance initial differences in the distribution of both income and wealth and, eventually, the inequality in the distribution of income and wealth in the society."" The geographical focus is on developed countries."
17132545,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study assesses neuropsychological and psychosocial determinants of judgements of personality change (PC) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from 87 participants with TBI analysed using hierarchical binary regression. METHODS: Interview of participants assessed, injury severity (post-traumatic amnesia), degree of cognitive impairment (IQ and memory), presence of orbitofrontal and/or medial temporal damage (olfaction) and emotional reactions (anger, depression and anxiety questionnaires). Separate interview of relatives assessed their own response to the injury (emotional reactions and critical comments from the Expressed Emotion index) and their judgements of participants' behavioural change. RESULTS: As expected, memory loss and impaired olfaction predicted relatives' PC judgements. However, the most striking and novel result was that social-emotional factors (participants' and relatives' reactions) predicted PC judgements best. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the need (a) for future studies measuring social behaviours (e.g. impulsivity and emotional perception) (b) to explore the differing determinants of relatives' and participants' PC judgements and (c) to develop and to tailor clinical responses to the various psychosocial determinants of PC."
9621377,1,a,"Recently, professionals in France have noticed an increase in newborns with Down syndrome (DS) being placed for adoption. The aim of this study was to investigate DS babies given up at birth for adoption and to consider the possible determinants of this in order to assess social acceptance of DS. A retrospective cohort of all living DS babies was collected from two birth-defect registries (Paris: 1981-1990; Marseilles area: 1984-1990). Follow-up data were collected: characteristics of the baby, biological parents and maternity units, age when given up for adoption, and type of foster care. The results showed that 19.4 per cent of infants with DS (115/593) were rejected by their parents. Multiple regression analysis indicated that foreign origin of the mother, area of residence, no associated major malformation, maternal age (15-24 years), and birth rank (> 2) variables were significantly associated with a lower placement rate. Among the 115 abandoned infants with DS, 88 came from unknown parentage (76.5 per cent). For half of them, adoptive placement (88/115) occurred before the age of 6 months. Socio-cultural attitudes play a great part in these family decisions. Equally important is the manner in which professionals propose adoption as an alternative to these parents of DS babies. They should be encouraged to consider all options before making a decision, so that the best solution can be found for the interest of all."
19936550,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Characterize diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in Bogota, Colombia and examine the extent and determinants of patient delay. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a census approach we identified 1 106 women with breast cancer. Information was gathered through personal interviews and the review of medical records. Patient delay was defined as the time elapsed from first symptoms to initial consultation. RESULTS: More than 80% of the women (902) consulted due to symptoms; the majority had advanced-stage disease. Patient delay was established in 20.3% and the main related factors were older age, lack of social security and advanced clinical stage. Higher education in patients was associated with reduced delays. DISCUSSION: Women do not recognize breast cancer symptoms. Patient delay and related factors are similar to those found in other studies. There is an urgent need to develop communication and education strategies regarding breast cancer symptoms and early detection."
12087482,0,a,"An individual's leisure time (pastime) engagements are in a way important for society. Irrespective of whether leisure time activities are causal determinants of health or health is a prerequisite for taking full part in society, the interaction is a challenge for Public Health. The first question is whether the sum of their influence results in coherence between enjoying good health and having leisure time activity. The aim of this study was to estimate their covariance.A random sample was drawn from the adult population of Stockholm County, Sweden. The residents were mailed a questionnaire regarding their social circumstances, their health complaints, the social repercussions of the complaints, and if they had any leisure time activity. Altogether, 7252 (about 93%) individuals responding to the questionnaire constituted our cohort. The individuals aged 18-65 y in November 1969 were followed up to the age of 65 y, or to 1996 as to mortality. The main outcome measure was mortality irrespective of cause of death. More than two-thirds of the respondents (71%) reported that they had some leisure time activity. Leisure time activity was a determinant of survival in the statistical sense. The risk ratio was 0.77 and its 95% confidence interval was 0.68-0.87 for those reporting leisure time activity when age, sex, baseline health and baseline alcohol consumption was discounted. The conclusion was that having leisure time activity, unspecified, covaried with health. Further studies should specify the pastime activities."
9732071,1,a,"Data from a cohort of young HIV-negative gay and bisexual men were analyzed to identify determinants of sexual risk-taking at baseline. Gay/bisexual men aged between 18 and 30 completed a self-administered questionnaire including demographics, depression, social support, substance use, and consensual versus nonconsensual sex. Risk-takers were defined as those who had unprotected anal sex with casual male sex partners in the previous year; non-risk-takers were defined as those who reported consistent condom use during anal sex with all male partners in the previous year. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of sexual risk-taking. Of 439 men studied, risk-takers had less education, a higher depression score, less social support, and were more likely to report nonconsensual sex and recreational drug use relative to non-risk-takers. Independent predictors of sexual risk-taking were low education, nitrite use, low social support (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.65; 95% CI, 1.04-2.59), and nonconsensual sex experienced as a youth or adult (AOR=1.85; 95% CI, 1.15-2.96). Young gay/bisexual men reporting nonconsensual sex, low social support, or nitrite use were significantly more likely to have recently had unprotected anal sex with casual partners. HIV prevention programs aimed at young gay/bisexual men should include sexual abuse counselling and foster community norms supporting safer sex practices."
11008088,0,a,"PURPOSE: To investigate a broad range of social influence-related and global determinants of smoking to aid in the design of comprehensive multiethnic interventions by testing the most important factors of initiation and escalation of smoking across various subgroups. METHODS: Cross-sectional (N = 2546) and cohort (N = 736) samples of multiethnic middle school students near a large Southwestern metropolis were surveyed through self-report questionnaires. The confidential questionnaires included information on demographics, risk factors, and smoking behavior and were administered in class by trained data collectors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the statistical significance and strength of the factors. RESULTS: Those lower in self-esteem and higher in social assertiveness appeared to be most at risk for the onset of smoking, whereas those low in optimism appeared to be the most at risk for the escalation of smoking. Attitudes, friends' norms, parents' norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived prevalence were consistent predictors of all smoking status outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral-specific determinants of smoking appear to be important predictors of smoking status outcomes in all demographic subgroups. The relationships of the global determinants were more dependent on the smoking outcome variable and subgroup examined. The findings may serve to help facilitate the targeting of comprehensive interventions aimed at reducing adolescent smoking in multiethnic and ethnic group-specific populations."
9041742,1,a,"The study reported here sought to assess Pap test coverage of a group of asymptomatic Argentine women from the poor urban district of La Matanza in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area Initially, all 2495 women who voluntarily enrolled in a program for early detection of breast cancer between January 1991 and June 1993 were included. After removing those who did not meet various study criteria, there remained 779 study subjects with no gynecologic or mammary symptomatology. Two subgroups of these 779 were established-women who had received a Pap test at any time and those who had received such a test within the previous three years. Using these subgroups, the influence of certain sociodemographic and other variables upon the likelihood of Pap testing was assessed. The results indicated significant associations between past Pap testing and age, formal education, parity, and a family history of cancer Likewise, significant associations were found between Pap testing within the preceding three years and age, formal education, and parity. The study findings affirm the idea that it would be advisable to seek Pap testing for all study population women once every three years instead of every year. Since the study population was not necessarily representative of Buenos Aires population, however, and the findings could have been affected by self-selection and other biases, additional studies are needed to determine actual Pap test coverage among women of the metropolitan area."
9823996,1,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Despite the availability of curative chemotherapy, mortality remains high among patients hospitalized for tuberculosis. Although the elevated mortality rate is often attributed to the presence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) or concomitant infection with the HIV, other factors must be contributory, especially among the HIV-negative population. Therefore, we performed a study to define the factors associated with mortality following the in-hospital diagnosis of tuberculosis in a region with low levels of MDRTB and coinfection with HIV. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The eight hospitals in the Barnes-Jewish-Christian (BJC) Health System, which is a network of community and tertiary-care level facilities serving the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area. PATIENTS: All 203 patients hospitalized with culture-positive tuberculosis at one of the BJC system hospitals between 1988 and 1996. INTERVENTIONS: Follow-up information was obtained by telephone interview and review of medical and public health records. Death was verified through a search of the death certificate registry of Missouri and the records of the Social Security Administration. Mortality was defined as death from any cause during the 14 months following the initial date of hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The cumulative all-cause mortality rate for this cohort was 28.1%. The incidence of HIV positivity was 7.9% and of MDRTB was 1.5%. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.0 to 7.0; p < 0.001) and the presence of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (AOR = 7.0; 95% CI = 3.7 to 13.3; p = 0.002) were the largest contributors to mortality. Other variables independently associated with mortality included the presence of malnutrition (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI = 2.1 to 4.9; p = 0.007), age > 60 years (AOR = 3.5; 95% CI = 2.4 to 5.2; p < 0.001), drug-induced immunosuppression (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.6 to 5.2; p = 0.018), and dyspnea at the time of hospital presentation (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.4 to 3.1; p = 0.048). Overall, 45.3% of the patients had a > 7-day delay in the suspicion of the diagnosis of tuberculosis and the institution of antituberculosis therapy following hospital admission. There was no association between the presence of these delays and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the 14-month mortality rate is high among patients diagnosed as having tuberculosis during hospitalization, despite low incidences of HIV infection and multidrug resistant disease. The factors that appear to contribute to this elevated mortality rate are markers of disease chronicity and severity of not only the tuberculosis, but also of the patient's underlying health status. Thus, while HIV positivity and multidrug resistance can be important determinants of mortality in some populations, other demographic factors and comorbid conditions may play a role as well. These data also suggest that tuberculosis is often superimposed on chronic illnesses that are important determinants of patient outcomes."
14962415,0,a,"PURPOSE: To investigate the determinants of participation in daily activities in people with impaired vision using the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) instrument. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We recruited 319 participants with no vision rehabilitation history, distance visual acuity (VA) <6/12 (better eye), the ability to converse in English, and 18 years or older. Participants completed the 32-item IVI questionnaire and provided demographic, personal, cultural, and environmental details on vision-related functioning. Visual acuity data were either abstracted from the participants' files or assessed by qualified personnel. Participants also completed the SF-12 to evaluate physical (PCS-12) and mental health (MCS-12). RESULTS: The areas of greatest restriction of participation were associated with reading, outdoor mobility, participation in leisure activities, and shopping. In stepwise linear regression presenting VA, the PCS-12 and MCS-12 explained the variance in leisure and work (60 participants or 19%), consumer and social interaction (92 participants or 30%), household and personal care (76 participants or 24%), mobility (92 participants or 30%), emotional reaction to visual loss and (106 participants or 33%), and total IVI score (114 participants or 36%). Having age-related macular degeneration contributed marginally to the IVI domains and total score (P <.05-.01), except for the emotional domain. Belonging to a social group explained 3% and 2% of the variance in the consumer and social interaction and emotional domains, respectively (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: Distance VA and physical and mental health explained more than a third of the variance of the total score, suggesting that an intervention aimed at improving quality of life may include strategies to improve not only vision-related rehabilitation but also mental and physical health."
17457370,0,a,"Nutrition might induce, at some loci, epigenetic or other changes that could be transmitted to the next generation impacting on health. The slow growth period (SGP) before the prepubertal peak in growth velocity has emerged as a sensitive period where different food availability is followed by different transgenerational response (TGR). The aim of this study is to investigate to what extent the probands own childhood circumstances are in fact the determinants of the findings. In the analysis, data from three random samples, comprising 271 probands and their 1626 parents and grandparents, left after exclusions because of missing data, were utilized. The availability of food during any given year was classified based on regional statistics. The ancestors' SGP was set at the ages of 8-12 years and the availability of food during these years classified as good, intermediate or poor. The probands' childhood circumstances were defined by the father's ownership of land, the number of siblings and order in the sibship, the death of parents and the parents' level of literacy. An earlier finding of a sex-specific influence from the ancestors' nutrition during the SGP, going from the paternal grandmother to the female proband and from the paternal grandfather to the male proband, was confirmed. In addition, a response from father to son emerged when childhood social circumstances of the son were accounted for. Early social circumstances influenced longevity for the male proband. TGRs to ancestors' nutrition prevailed as the main influence on longevity."
19055806,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on the development, implementation and evaluation processes of physical activity promotion programmes among older adults. More integrative insights into interventions describing the planned systematic development, implementation and evaluation are needed. METHODS AND DESIGN: The purpose of this study is to give an integrative insight into the development of the Active plus programme applying the six-step Intervention Mapping protocol. The Active plus programme consisted of two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity promotion interventions, both comprising three tailored letters delivered over four months and aimed at raising awareness of insufficient physical activity, and stimulating physical activity initiation and maintenance among the over-fifties. The first intervention, the basic tailored intervention, provided tailored letters that intervened on the psychosocial determinants of physical activity. The second intervention, the intervention plus, provided the same tailored information but additionally provided tailored information about physical activity opportunities in the specific environment in which the older adults lived. This environment-based component also provided access to a forum and e-buddy system on a website. A plan for implementation and evaluation is also described. DISCUSSION: The planned development of the Active plus programme resulted in two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity interventions targeted at the over-fifties. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register NTR 920."
17960295,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Alcohol misuse in college students represents a significant public health problem. Toward improving the understanding of determinants of collegiate alcohol misuse, the current study examined several dimensions of impulsivity in relation to hazardous drinking in college students. METHOD: A one-way, two-group, cross-sectional design was used to compare hazardous drinkers (HZD) with social drinkers (SOC). HZD drinkers were required to score 6 or more on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT); SOC drinkers were required to score 1-5 on the AUDIT. The sample comprised 93 participants (56% HZD; 76% male) who were recruited from a medium-sized public university. Participants were assessed under neutral conditions using the Eysenck Impulsivity Questionnaire (EIQ), Delay Discounting Task (DDT), and Stanford Time Perspective Inventory (STPI). RESULTS: Consistent with predictions, HZD participants exhibited significantly greater impulsivity on the EIQ-Impulsivity subscale (p < .001), the STPI-Present Hedonism subscale (p < .01), and the STPIFuture subscale (p < .01); however, no differences were evident on the DDT (p > .40). The HZD group also scored marginally higher than the SOC group on the EIQ-Venturesomeness subscale (p < .10). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that greater impulsivity is associated with alcohol misuse in college students, most prominently in the area of propensity toward risk-taking and nonplanning (EIQ-Impulsivity subscale). The correspondence between these findings and previous studies, methodological considerations, and the need for prospective studies on impulsivity and alcohol misuse in college students are discussed."
8360226,1,a,Differentials in child survival in Bangladesh have been examined using a number of socioeconomic and environmental factors on data from the 1989 Bangladesh Fertility Survey. Multivariate analysis reveals that both wife's and husband's education and household electricity show a significant positive association with child survival. The respondent's working status exerts a significant negative influence. Wife's education has a greater influence on child survival in Bangladesh than that of husband's education.
14974014,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Depression is the fourth most important disease in the estimation of the burden of disease Murray 1996 and is a common problem with prevalence rates estimated to be as high as 8% in young people. Depression in young people is associated with poor academic performance, social dysfunction, substance abuse, suicide attempts, and completed suicide (NHMRC 1997). This has precipitated the development of programmes aimed at preventing the onset of depression. This review evaluates evidence for the effectiveness of these prevention programmes. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether psychological and/or educational interventions (both universal and targeted) are effective in reducing risk of depressive disorder by reducing depressive symptoms immediately after intervention or by preventing the onset of depressive disorder in children and adolescents over the next one to three years. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group trials register (August 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to December Week 3 2002), EMBASE (1980 to January Week 2 2003), PsychInfo (1886 to January Week 2 2003) and ERIC (1985 to December 2002) were searched. In addition, conference abstracts, the reference lists of included studies, and other reviews were searched and experts in the field were contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Each identified study was assessed for possible inclusion by two independent reviewers based on the methods sections. The determinants for inclusion were that the trial include a psychological and/or educational prevention programme for young people aged 5 to 19 years-old, who did not meet DSM or ICD criteria for depression and/or did not fall into the clinical range on standardised, validated, and reliable rating scales of depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The methodological quality of the included trials was assessed by two independent reviewers according to a list of pre-determined criteria, which were based on quality ratings devised by Moncrieff and colleagues (Moncrieff 2001). Outcome data was extracted and entered into Revman 4.2. Means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes and number of events for dichotomous outcomes were extracted where available. For trials where the required data were not reported or could not be calculated, further details were requested from first authors. If no further details were provided, the trial was included in the review and described, but not included in the meta-analysis. Results were presented for each type of intervention: targeted or universal interventions; and educational or psychological interventions and if data were provided, by gender. Where possible data were combined in meta-analyses to give a treatment effect across all trials. Sensitivity analysis were conducted on studies rated as ""adequate"" or ""high"" quality, that is with a score over 22, based on the scale by Moncrieff et al (Moncrieff 2001). The presence of publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. MAIN RESULTS: Studies were divided into those that compared intervention with an active comparison or placebo (i.e. a control condition that resembles the intervention being investigated but which lacks the elements thought to be active in preventing depression) and those that used a ""wait-list"" or no intervention comparison group. Only two studies fell into the former category and neither showed effectiveness although one study was inadequately powered to show a difference and in the other the ""placebo"" contained active therapeutic elements, reducing the ability to demonstrate a difference from intervention. Psychological interventions were effective compared with non-intervention immediately after the programmes were delivered with a significant reduction in scores on depression rating scales for targeted (standardised mean difference (SMD) of -0.26 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -0.40 to -0.13 ) but not universal interventions (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.48, 0.06), with a significant effect maintained on pooling data (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.36, -0.15). While small effect sizes were reported, these were associated with a significant reduction in depressive episodes. The overall risk difference after intervention translates to ""numbers needed to treat"" (NNT) of 10. The most effective study is the targeted programme by Clarke (Clarke 2001) where the initial effect size of -0.46 is associated with an initial risk difference of -0.22 and NNT 5. There was no evidence of effectiveness for educational interventions. Reports of effectiveness for boys and girls were contradictory. The quality of many studies was poor, and only two studies made allocation concealment explicit. Sensitivity analysis of only high quality studies did not alter the results significantly. The only analysis in which there was significant statistical heterogeneity was the sub-group analysis by gender where there was variability in the response to different programmes for both girls and boys. For the most part funnel plots indicate findings are robust for short term effects with no publication bias evident. There are too few studies to comment on whether there is publication bias for studies reporting long-term (12-36 month) follow-up. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Although there is insufficient evidence to warrant the introduction of depression prevention programmes currently, results to date indicate that further study would be worthwhile. There is a need to compare interventions with a placebo or some sort of active comparison so that study participants do not know whether they are in the intervention group or not, to investigate the impact of booster sessions to see if effectiveness immediately after intervention can be prolonged, ideally for a year or longer, and to consider practical implementation of prevention programmes when choosing target populations. Until now most studies have focussed on psychological interventions. The potential effectiveness of educational interventions has not been fully investigated. Given the gender differences in prevalence, and the change in these that occurs in adolescence with a disproportionate increase in prevalence rates for girls, it is likely that girls and boys will respond differently to interventions. Although differences have been reported in studies in this review the findings are contradictory and a more definitive delineation of gender specific responses to interventions would be helpful."
8754600,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of smoking among young women is of particular concern in most countries as it does not decline as in men. We studied smoking behaviour in Greenlandic and Danish women over a 2 year period to provide information on the social and behavioural determinants of smoking in women. METHODS: In 1986, samples of 800 women aged 20-39 years were drawn at random from Nuuk/Godthab (Greenland) and Nykobing Falster (Denmark). A total of 586 and 661 women were interviewed in Greenland and Denmark, respectively. In 1988, new random samples of 150 women were drawn from the same areas. Totally, 129 Greenlandic and 126 Danish women were included in this study. In 1987, a sample of 732 women aged 20-49 years from Copenhagen was randomly drawn from the computerized Central Population Register. Of these, 623 women completed a questionnaire. RESULTS: Smoking behaviour was almost the same among women in Nykobing Falster and Copenhagen (54% smoked) while a significantly higher percentage of smokers was observed among women in Greenland (88% smoked). Heavy smoking was most prevalent among Danish women and associated with early debut of smoking. Among Danish women, smoking was associated with use of oral contraceptives, early age at first intercourse, and multiple sexual partners. In Greenland, smoking was associated with early sexual debut and multiple sexual partners. In an extended analysis on a subgroup of Danish women, smoking was also associated with low education and infrequent intake of vegetables. The study showed no development in smoking behaviour in any age group over the two year period between the two studies, neither in Nykobing Falster nor in Nuuk. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of moderate smoking among women in Greenland suggests that broad anti-smoking initiatives are urgently needed. The high prevalence of heavy smoking and a social gradient among Danish women may indicate that a strategy focusing on restrictions of smoking may be more relevant than merely continuing a pure anti-smoking information strategy."
12292846,1,a,"""Croatia ranks among those parts of Europe which have taken very high part in all forms of emigration flows in almost all periods of the last few centuries. The emigration from Croatia was caused by different reasons, such as historical, political, national, religious, social and other. It started in the 16th century and has been going on more or less intensively in different historical periods up to now.... We would like to emphasize that the problem of emigration was and is still actual for the Croatian nation, especially in view of the fact that emigration from Croatia did not stop and continues up to this day."""
15798074,0,a,"With the growing problem of childhood obesity, recent research has begun to focus on family and social influences on children's eating patterns. Research has demonstrated that children's eating patterns are strongly influenced by characteristics of both the physical and social environment. With regard to the physical environment, children are more likely to eat foods that are available and easily accessible, and they tend to eat greater quantities when larger portions are provided. Additionally, characteristics of the social environment, including various socioeconomic and sociocultural factors such as parents' education, time constraints, and ethnicity influence the types of foods children eat. Mealtime structure is also an important factor related to children's eating patterns. Mealtime structure includes social and physical characteristics of mealtimes including whether families eat together, TV-viewing during meals, and the source of foods (e.g., restaurants, schools). Parents also play a direct role in children's eating patterns through their behaviors, attitudes, and feeding styles. Interventions aimed at improving children's nutrition need to address the variety of social and physical factors that influence children's eating patterns."
19459050,0,a,"Incarceration is associated with multiple and concurrent partnerships, which are determinants of sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV. The associations between incarceration and high-risk sex partnerships may exist, in part, because incarceration disrupts stable sex partnerships, some of which are protective against high-risk sex partnerships. When investigating STI/HIV risk among those with incarceration histories, it is important to consider the potential role of drug use as a factor contributing to sexual risk behavior. First, incarceration's influence on sexual risk taking may be further heightened by drug-related effects on sexual behavior. Second, drug users may have fewer economic and social resources to manage the disruption of incarceration than nonusers of drugs, leaving this group particularly vulnerable to the disruptive effects of incarceration on sexual risk behavior. Using the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, we conducted multivariable analyses to estimate associations between incarceration in the past 12 months and engagement in multiple partnerships, concurrent partnerships, and unprotected sex in the past 12 months, stratified by status of illicit drug use (defined as use of cocaine, crack, or injection drugs in the past 12 months), among adult men in the US. Illicit drug users were much more likely than nonusers of illicit drugs to have had concurrent partnerships (16% and 6%), multiple partnerships (45% and 18%), and unprotected sex (32% and 19%). Analyses adjusting for age, race, educational attainment, poverty status, marital status, cohabitation status, and age at first sex indicated that incarceration was associated with concurrent partnerships among nonusers of illicit drugs (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-2.22) and illicit drug users (aPR 2.14, 95% CI 1.07-4.29). While incarceration was also associated with multiple partnerships and unprotected sex among nonusers of illicit drugs (multiple partnerships: aPR 1.66, 95% CI 1.43-1.93; unprotected sex: aPR 1.99, 95% CI 1.45-2.72), incarceration was not associated with these behaviors among illicit drug users (multiple partnerships: aPR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79-1.35; unprotected sex: aPR 0.73, 95% CI 0.41-1.31); among illicit drug users, multiple partnerships and unprotected sex were common irrespective of incarceration history. These findings support the need for correctional facility- and community-based STI/HIV prevention efforts including STI/HIV education, testing, and care for current and former prisoners with and without drug use histories. Men with both illicit drug use and incarceration histories may experience particular vulnerability to STI/HIV, as a result of having disproportionate levels of concurrent partnerships and high levels of unprotected sex. We hypothesize that incarceration works in tandem with drug use and other adverse social and economic factors to increase sexual risk behavior. To establish whether incarceration is causally associated with high-risk sex partnerships and acquisition of STI/HIV, a longitudinal study that accurately measures incarceration, STI/HIV, and illicit drug use should be conducted to disentangle the specific effects of each variable of interest on risk behavior and STI/HIV acquisition."
7481601,1,a,"Home-related injuries are a major threat to pre-school children in the western world. In this study the behavioral determinants of 18 parental safety measures were assessed. To select behavioral determinants, the Attitude-Social influence-Self-efficacy/barriers model was used with the inclusion of variables from the Health Belief Model and the Protection Motivation Theory. A written questionnaire was completed by 1129 Dutch mothers of pre-school children. Most safety measures were explained (rather) well by the same set of determinants. Main determinants for adopting or not adopting a safety measure were the mother's belief in the necessity of the safety measure according to the child's age, her belief about her partner's opinion on the necessity and her belief about the success of taking the measure. Subsequent important determinants were the mother's belief about the inconvenience and instrumentality of the safety measure; the perceived susceptibility had a minor or moderate influence on most measures. This study did not indicate that more highly educated mothers were more knowledgeable about safety-related subjects. The theoretical implications of this study are discussed."
9792369,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To report the findings of qualitative studies designed for use in improving sexually transmitted disease (STD) programs. The studies explore illness conceptions and treatment behaviors for STD in five African countries. These targeted intervention research (TIR) studies were performed on clinic-based and community-based samples in representative communities and utilized a variety of qualitative research methods (e.g. in-depth and key informant interviews, focus group discussions). FINDINGS: Study findings revealed that community members' explanations of symptoms, classification of illnesses, and perceptions of whether symptoms are pathological or serious influence individual health-care-seeking behaviors. Data also showed that local terms for STD are often disparaging and do not fit into biomedical designations. STD patient care-seeking frequently reflects an ordered, albeit loosely constructed, process of elimination in pursuit of symptom relief, wherein alternative treatments are tried and proven effective or abandoned. CONCLUSIONS: The TIR studies highlight the importance of community-specific strategies aimed at increasing prompt care seeking at qualified biomedical facilities. Information from study data should lead programs to sensitize health professionals to community understanding about STD and to design services and communication programs that are meaningful and appropriate to local contexts."
9004368,1,a,"The aim was to study the associations of childhood living conditions, together with past and present socioeconomic status, with adult health among Finnish men and women. The data were derived from a nationwide interview Survey on Living Conditions collected by Statistics Finland in 1986. The sample represents the non-institutional Finnish population aged 15 years or older. The number of respondents was 12,057 and the response rate 87%. In this study we analysed 30-year-old and older subjects. Two health indicators were analysed: first, limiting long-standing illness; and second, self-assessed health as ""below good"". Four different indicators of childhood living conditions were included: one concerning economic problems, and three concerning family related social problems during childhood. Additionally, the degree of urbanisation of the childhood living area was examined. Past and present socioeconomic status were measured by the status of origin, i.e. the respondent's father's and mother's education, and the status of destination, i.e. the respondent's own current education. Economic problems during childhood were associated with current health. The association of childhood social problems with health was somewhat weaker and less consistent than that of economic problems. A comparison of the mutual impacts of economic and social problems, respectively, shows that economic problems are stronger and more independent determinants of adult health than social problems. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, past and, particularly, present socioeconomic status are both important determinants of adult health. Current socioeconomic status showed strongest associations with adult health, but living conditions during upbringing, particularly economic problems and status of origin, were also significant predictors."
15578812,0,a,"AIM: To examine infant growth characteristics and their socio-demographic determinants in Severodvinsk, northwest Russia. METHODS: Length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length Z-scores of 1,067 infants born in 1999-2000 in Severodvinsk were calculated on the basis of the data on the length and weight obtained from the medical files. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate independent effects of maternal age, education, occupation, marital status, weight, parity, sex of the baby, and breastfeeding duration on infant growth. RESULTS: At the age of 12 months, 1.1% of the infants were stunted, 1.1% underweight, and 0.5% wasted in comparison with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 reference population. The mean Z-scores for length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length were 0.48+/-0.93, 0.38+/-1.04, and 0.65+/-1.03, respectively. Mean weight-for-length Z-scores considerably increased from birth to 12 months, while length-for-age Z-score remained largely unchanged. In regression analysis, length-for-age Z-scores were lower by 0.43 (p=0.028) and by 0.30 (p<0.001) in infants born to mothers with basic and unknown education, respectively. Positive trends between linear growth and maternal age (p=0.027) and education (p=0.024) were observed. No social variations in weight-for-length Z-scores were found. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting were lower than previously reported from Russia, which may reflect good overall socio-economic conditions in the town. Social variations in linear growth indicate the existence of inequalities in infant health, which may further increase with age."
17606277,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This paper presents further analysis of a study aimed at examining the determinants of good health and successful ageing in an area of deprivation. In this paper we report findings from the quantitative data related to two of the original eight research questions: (1) To what extent can health in old age be attributed to psychological/personality variables? and (2) What is the role of religious beliefs and 'spirituality' in healthy ageing? STUDY DESIGN: In-depth interview study in which standardized measures of personality and beliefs were administered, along with measures of beliefs devised for the study. METHODS: One hundred matched pairs of healthy and unhealthy 'agers' were interviewed face-to-face. Healthy ageing was assessed in terms of hospital morbidity and self-reported health. The sample comprised 106 males and 94 females (53 male matched pairs and 47 female matched pairs) ranging in age from 70 to 90 years of age with the majority (n=165) falling into the 71-80 age group and the remaining 35 in the 81-90 age group. All study participants were survivors of the Paisley/Renfrew (MIDSPAN) survey, a longitudinal study commenced in 1972 with continuous recording of morbidity and mortality since. Questionnaires assessing extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism, health locus of control, sense of coherence, optimism, and religiosity were filled in by participants during the interviews. RESULTS: Compared to the unhealthy group, the healthy participants were less neurotic, more likely to endorse an internal locus of control belief and less likely to endorse a powerful others locus of control belief, and to report a greater sense of coherence. The unhealthy group scored higher on the religiosity/spirituality measure devised for this study. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are interesting in that, although they cannot address the issue of cause and effect, the very fact that the personality traits measured in this study were linked to health status in old age, further strengthens the argument that in general practice and hospital settings, an understanding of personality aids practitioners in dealing with patients. Finally, with the growing body of evidence that personality traits have a high degree of heritability, the routine gathering of information on personality traits would aid epidemiologists in their understanding of the determinants of healthy and successful ageing."
10530425,1,a,"The current 6-month quarantine system for all cats and dogs entering the UK has kept the UK rabies-free since 1922. However, pressure is mounting for a change to a system of vaccination, microchip identification and serological testing. In response to the increasing controversy surrounding the quarantine system, the UK government recently set up an independent review panel to assess the alternatives. This paper quantifies public preferences for the current policy and three alternative rabies-prevention measures. A survey was used not only to assess the overall preferences for rabies-prevention policies but also to assess the importance of policy attributes and socio-economic characteristics in determining policy preferences. We interviewed a sample of pet-owners in North Yorkshire. The results showed that the existing system was the single most-preferred policy option. However, a large proportion of the sample preferred the vaccination-based policies. A logistic-regression model and ordered probit models were used to find that safety and animal welfare were the most-important factors determining policy preferences. The respondents' awareness of the rabies-policy review, a desire to take a pet abroad, the amount of foreign travel, occupation and previous experience of quarantine were all important factors in policy choice. Socio-economic characteristics such as income, pets owned and the number of children were not significant determinants of policy preference."
2270509,1,a,"Only limited fertility and general reproductive health data exist on American Indians. Using data from the 1987 Montana American Indian Health Risk Assessment, we found that the fertility of American Indians in Great Falls and on the Blackfeet Reservation was similar to blacks in the U.S. and relatively high when compared with fertility of whites in the United States. The influence of the direct determinants of fertility (nuptiality, contraceptive use, and lactation) was very different for the populations examined in this study. Great Falls American Indians and the U.S. black population were similar regarding age at first sexual intercourse (very young), breastfeeding (low prevalence and short duration), planning status of pregnancies (high unplanned), and contraceptive use (only moderate use). In contrast, Blackfeet women on the reservation and the U.S. white population married relatively late, had very high contraceptive use, used effective methods of contraception, and had moderately high levels of breastfeeding. However, Blackfeet fertility was much higher than that of whites. Three interrelated reasons are suggested as possible explanations. Blackfeet couples either wanted high fertility, were relatively poor users of family planning methods, or used less effective methods until they had exceeded their desired family size after which time they turned to sterilization. These finds raise numerous questions concerning the social and economic factors that may account for these group similarities and differences. Further studies with much larger data sets are needed to address these issues adequately."

The selective effects are examined in terms of five personal factors: sex, nativity, education, period of marriage, and sibling status.... Primary and onward migrations were much more important than return migrations so that marriage migrations increased the non-native's share of the population of every type of [prefecture]. Marriage migrations resulted in further deterioration of the quality of human capital in peripheral prefectures.

11450925,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to identify 'non-medical' datasets holding routinely collected information that might be used to measure and monitor the wider determinants of community health and well-being. METHODS: An expert panel discussion, involving public health and environmental health academics and professionals with expertise in a variety of backgrounds (including environmental health, housing, transport, community safety, public health, primary and secondary care), and interrogation of the Office for National Statistics database were carried out for the West Midlands region. The aim was to identify routinely collected 'non-medical' datasets containing information on the following factors: physical environment, crime, housing and homelessness, social services, socio-economic environment including employment, lifestyles, education, leisure and culture, transport and accidents. RESULTS: Fifty-six datasets were identified. Although 43 (77 per cent) were collected at least annually, few (17; 30 per cent) held data that were disaggregated and routinely available at the sub-local authority level. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a number of datasets that hold information relevant to health. However, no single dataset is likely to provide information on all dimensions of health and the determinants of health, and local agencies should consider carefully the strengths and weaknesses of each. Through the development of inter-sectoral working and multi-agency involvement at the local level there is now considerable scope to improve the quality of many of these datasets and to promote their use in the measurement and monitoring of community health."
8970719,1,a,"SCOPE: This review summarizes the main issues discussed during Track D, which examined the societal impact of HIV/AIDS, and responses to the epidemic by individuals, families, communities and societies worldwide. Micro- and macrolevel issues addressed included the development, implementation and evaluation of programmes for prevention and care; policy development and implementation; structural issues such as the impact of gender relations, development and migration on the development of the epidemic; and the social and economic impact of HIV/AIDS on affected societies and communities. RECURRENT THEMES: Presentations provided strong evidence that peer-led, community-based programmes offer particularly effective ways of working, and that participatory research involving affected communities provides useful results for the design and evaluation of programmes and policies. This is the case across settings, issues, populations and countries. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Emerging needs include how best to ensure sustainability of national and international responses, how best to scale up successful interventions for wider reach, and how best to work with systematically marginalized, neglected groups and populations. Research priorities include the characterization of the multiple determinants of HIV-related vulnerability, and the evaluation of interventions that take these complex determinants as their starting point. A more coherent and strategic response requires less separation between the different constituencies involved in AIDS work, and the more sustained involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS themselves."
15259048,0,a,"We estimate the determinants of utilisation of physician and hospital services in Belgium using a one- and two-part panel count data model, and a one- and two-part pooled count data model. We conclude that the two-part panel count data model is most appropriate as it controls for unobserved heterogeneity and allows for a two-part decision-making process. The estimates of the determinants of utilisation of health care are then used to calculate indices of horizontal inequity. We find that inequity for general practitioner and hospital services is stable across time and in favour of low-income individuals, in the sense that, overall, they consume more than one would expect on the basis of their need, albeit the indices for hospital care are not significant. Horizontal equity applies to specialist care in all years, but from 1999 onwards, some evidence (although not statistically significant) of pro-rich inequity is found."
11731714,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown that social determinants not directly involved in the disease process may be implicated in the timing of dementia diagnosis. This study explores the relationship between a patient's living situation and the severity of dementia at diagnosis. METHODS: Data were collected from the baseline interviews of 1,325 patients with cognitive decline enrolled in the Consortium for the Investigation of Vascular Impairment of Cognition study. Data collected included: age, sex, living situation and scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), the Functional Rating Scale (FRS), the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) scale and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). Living situation was grouped as: (1) lives alone, (2) lives with spouse, (3) lives with child, relative or other and (4) lives in a nursing home. A general linear model univariate analysis was used to compare patients by their respective living situations for differences in mean scores on each of the 4 measures of dementia severity. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of both unadjusted data and data adjusted for age, sex and CIRS scores showed significant differences among the groups. Those who lived alone were diagnosed at an earlier stage (mean scores: MMSE 21.4, GDS 3.6, FRS 20.0, DAD 29.8) followed by those who lived with a spouse (mean scores: MMSE 20.5, GDS 3.7, FRS 20.4, DAD 28.0), those who lived with a child or other (mean scores: MMSE 19.3, GDS 3.9, FRS 22.5, DAD 24.9) and finally those who lived in a nursing home (mean scores: MMSE 15.2, GDS 4.8, FRS 27.5, DAD 16.9). CONCLUSION: Living situation is related to the severity of dementia at diagnosis. Primary care providers should have a low threshold for case-finding in older adults who live with family or friends."
16539965,0,a,"We describe the magnitude and trends of obesity in Spain and of its main determinants, associated both with the increase in energy intake and the reduction of energy expenditure. Such determinants include factors from the individual subjects and from their environment. We also present the main features of the strategy for the Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Obesity, fostered by the Ministry of Health, as well as plans and activities carried out by the Regional Governments, to control this health disorder. We conclude that effective and sustained implementation of these activities is badly needed. It should be made along with the monitoring of obesity and its determinants in the general population. Research in this field should also be strengthened because social determinants of obesity are not known in depth, and the effectiveness of many of the interventions proposed by the national and regional initiatives is not well established yet. Moreover, in the next future, the effectiveness of intervention models applied to control the smoking epidemic must be assessed to examine its usefulness in the control of obesity. An example of this type of interventions is the limitation of the publicity of nutrient-poor and energy-dense foods addressed to children."
7492816,1,a,"Psychosocial reluctance is a major obstacle to the success of mass screening. In France, several opinion polls demonstrated that the fear of cancer as a disease, the fear of a positive result and the fear of the possible therapeutic consequences were the major determinants opposed to screening despite information often known to the public. The psychological obstacles appear less important in the US population, except for minorities. Age seems to be a discriminating factor, indeed after 50 years, reluctance to screening is increased probably due to a generation effect influencing the meaning of the disease and the interest of screening. Site specific constraints also exist, in colorectal cancer, 30% of the people feel as an embarrassment the manipulation of the stools. If false positives are responsible for a supplementary anxiety, it doesn't last long and it doesn't influence the observation of future campaign. These psychosocial obstacles as a whole justify the need of converging information that must take into account cultural problems. The favourable influence of the general practitioner explains his essential role for the success of mass screening."
1480790,1,a,"Today, we know the caries aetiology and prevention rather well. We also know that caries-related levels of dental health are inequitably distributed among social classes: on the average, disadvantaged people experience higher DMFS then privileged people. This difference can be explained by a differential access to health care, which can be shown by the study of components of the DMFS index: proportion of filled surfaces (F/DMFS), proportion of missing surfaces (M/DMFS), and proportion of recurrent caries (secondary caries/filled surfaces). Though we are able to describe the social distribution of levels of dental care, we cannot ""explain"" the differences we observe. The explanation of those differences defines the field of social epidemiology. This consists in determining the social aetiology of diseases, starting from social determinants of attitudes and behaviors influencing health."
10024209,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Childhood diarrhoea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Nicaragua. Amongst the risk factors for its transmission are 'poor' hygiene practices. We investigated the effect of a large number of hygiene practices on diarrhoeal disease in children aged <2 years and validated the technique of direct observation of hygiene behaviour. METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was carried out in a rural zone of Nicaragua. From the database of a previously conducted case-control study on water and sanitation 172 families were recruited, half of which had experienced a higher than expected rate of diarrhoea in their children and the other half a lower rate. Hygiene behaviour was observed over two mornings and diarrhoea incidence was recorded with a calendar, filled out by the mother, and collected every week for 5 months. RESULTS: Of 46 'good' practices studied, 39 were associated with a lower risk of diarrhoea, five were unrelated and only for two a higher risk was observed. Washing of hands, domestic cleanliness (kitchen, living room, yard) and the use of a diaper/underclothes by the child had the strongest protective effect. Schooling (>3 years of primary school) and better economic position (possession of a radio) had a positive influence on general hygiene behaviour, education having a slightly stronger effect when a radio was present. Individual hygiene behaviour appeared to be highly variable in contrast with the consistent behaviour of the community as a whole. Feasible and appropriate indicators of hygiene behaviour were found to be domestic cleanliness and the use of a diaper or underclothes by the child. CONCLUSION: A consistent relationship between almost all hygiene practices and diarrhoea was detected, more schooling producing better hygiene behaviour. The high variability of hygiene behaviour at the individual level requires repeated observations (at least two) before and after the hygiene education in the event one wants to measure the impact of the campaign on the individual."
9017281,1,a,"Two recent developments have thrown into bold relief the importance of environmental forces in determining the prevalence of human obesity. The first is genetic studies that estimate the heritability of human obesity at no more than 33%. The second is the 33% increase in the prevalence of obesity in the USA during the past decade. The importance of the environment in influencing obesity is matched only by the extent of our ignorance of how it exerts its effects and of how we may favourably alter them. The most thoroughly studied measure of environmental influences is socioeconomic status. Among women in developed societies socioeconomic status is strongly (negatively) correlated with the prevalence of obesity: the lower the social class the more the obesity. Prospective studies have shown that this correlation reflects, in part, causation: socioeconomic status helps to determine the prevalence of obesity and thinness. Likewise, the presence of obesity helps to determine socioeconomic status. In developing societies there is also a strong relationship between socioeconomic status and obesity, but it is a positive one: the higher the socioeconomic status the more the obesity. Unfortunately, we know of few other social determinants of obesity and studies on the social determinants of this disorder are desperately needed."
10926127,0,a,"The aim of this study was to evaluate possible changes in predisposing factors in sexual preventive behaviors that could result from the availability of an efficient new antiretroviral therapy. A total of 136 young adults were randomly assigned a vignette to read describing AIDS as a lethal or chronic disease. After reading the vignette, the participants completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial determinants of intention to use a condom with a new sexual partner. The variables were measured according to Ajzen's (1985, 1988, 1991) theory of planned behavior and Triandis's (1977) theory of interpersonal behavior. The experimental manipulation was more successful when the disease was described as lethal (66 of the 68 subjects) rather than chronic (30 of the 68 subjects). For the 96 participants who correctly identified the expected outcome of the disease presented in the vignette, a significant difference in intention was found between the two experimental situations (p < .05). Regression of intention to use condoms on the psychosocial variables yielded an adjusted R2 of .62. Perceived behavioral control, social norms, personal normative belief and anticipated affective reaction were the significant variables explaining this intention. The results suggest that intention to use condoms with a new sexual partner is likely to be modified by the expected outcome of the disease, that is, whether lethal or chronic. Thus, it is suggested that interventions aimed at young adults take into account the impacts the new antiretroviral treatments are likely to have on preventive behaviors."
2287963,1,a,Only limited research has been conducted on the patterns and determinants of changes over time in the extent and duration of breast-feeding. Methods are used that allow the examination of the effects of changes in population characteristics and behavioral factors on breast-feeding outcomes. Comparable national surveys are employed to examine the factors associated with the combination of a decline in the extent of and an increase in the duration of breast-feeding between 1973 and 1983 in the Philippines. Important differences are found in the factors explaining the extent and duration of breast-feeding between 1973 and 1983.

8666516,1,a,"Establishing causal relationships has been and is today a matter of debate in epidemiology. The observational nature of epidemiological research rends difficult the proving of these relationships. Related to this, different models and causal criteria have been proposed in order to explain health and disease determinants, from pure determinism in Koch postulates, accepting unicausal explanation for diseases, to more realistic multicausal models. In occupational health it is necessary to formulate causal models and criteria to assess causality, and frequently causal assessment in this field has important social, economic and juridical relevance. This paper deal with evaluation of causal relationships in epidemiology and this evaluation is illustrated with a recent example of an occupational health problem in our milieu: the Ardystil case."
15896895,0,a,"Almost a third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the organism that causes tuberculosis disease. Most of those infected never fall ill, but individuals who do can recover if they have access to effective therapies. This paper discusses certain ethical and ethnographic issues raised by cases in which patients are infected with M. tuberculosis strains resistant to at least the two most powerful drugs on which therapy is usually based. In most poor countries, people with such multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were, until very recently, considered ""untreatable."" In addition to being consigned to a permanent state of ill health, they were also at risk of transmitting their resistant strain to others. In this paper we discuss the logic of ""cost-effectiveness,"" which international health policy-makers utilized to make the case that treatment of MDR-TB is not feasible in resource poor settings. These analyses, which have held sway in public health policy for many years, are flawed, we argue, because they ignore and conceal the social determinants of access to health services and often rely on assumptions rather than evidence. We propose that policies based solely on analyses of cost-effectiveness of specific interventions for individual settings can be short-sighted and, because they do not pay sufficient attention to the social, political, economic, epidemiological and pathophysiological factors influencing the production of health, will ultimately hinder progress toward effective global TB control."
8336571,1,a,"A community interview scheme was designed to provide preclinical medical students with an opportunity to investigate the role of social and psychological variables in patient care and gain insight into interpersonal aspects of the interview process. Evaluation of the scheme showed that students and community interviewees found their participation valuable. Eighty per cent of interviewees were willing to take part in the scheme in the following year. The strongest predictor of willingness to participate was interviewees' rating of the extent to which they had enjoyed the experience. Students valued the opportunity to meet 'real people', to explore social and psychological determinants of health and illness and to develop communication skills. A significant positive change in perceived interviewing competence was observed. It is suggested that the scheme might be further developed by using feedback from interviewees to provide students with evidence of both their own skill development and the benefits of self-disclosure to the patients involved."
19237481,0,a,"The BBC comedy show ;Harry and Paul' sparked media controversy in the UK and around the world for inciting stereotyped racial discrimination, vulgarity and violation of human rights when it portrayed a Filipino domestic worker as a sex toy in Episode 4 of the series. This incident raises the issue concerning the media's role in framing social issues and how it affects the wider determinants of health. There is a need for health psychology as an academic discipline to engage more in these issues. The Journal of Health Psychology provides a unique platform for discussion and debate of perspectives on racism, the media and health."
9090699,1,a,"PURPOSE: Study purpose was to develop a theoretical framework that will explain pharmacists' behavior relative to the provision of pharmaceutical care. The model was developed from four attitude models by testing their predictive validity relative to pharmaceutical care implementation. Four hypotheses and one research question were investigated to identify determinants of behavioral intention and behavior. METHODS: 617 community pharmacists in the state of Florida, U.S.A., were surveyed twice using mail survey methodology to collect data. The first survey assessed community pharmacists' attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, past behavior recency, self-efficacies, instrumental beliefs and affect. The second survey assessed pharmacists' behavior relative to the implementation of pharmaceutical care. After establishing reliability and validity of measures, regression analysis was used to test hypotheses and research question investigated. RESULTS: The Pharmacists' Implementation of Pharmaceutical Care (PIPC) model developed postulates that (i) behavior is directly determined by past behavior recency, behavioral intention and perceived behavioral control; (ii) psychological appraisal processes-instrumental beliefs, self-efficacies, and affect toward means-influence behavior through past behavior recency; and (iii) behavioral intention is determined by attitude, social norm and perceived behavioral control. CONCLUSIONS: The PIPC model provides a formal scientifically validated theoretical framework which can be used to design successful intervention for pharmaceutical care implementation."
12322262,1,a,"""Is geographical migration a consequence of the end of unemployment or does it help in finding a job? This question is approached within the general framework of human capital theory.... A model is introduced in the form of a system of two simultaneous equations with qualitative endogenous variables. The test is based on a 1993 survey of 1,176 young rural people of seven areas of France. A main finding is that migrations of young rural people are essentially the result of professional preoccupations. However, migration is not a factor which always helps in finding a job, when people are unemployed. When a young person has a good initial training, he or she has to migrate (and leave a rural area) to get a job. Yet, migration does not seem to be necessary for less trained people."""
16861190,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of contextual and individual factors on self-reported psychological health. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/MEASUREMENTS: The 2000 public health survey in Scania is a cross-sectional postal questionnaire study with a 59% participation rate. A total of 13,715 persons aged 18-80 answered the questionnaire. A multilevel logistic regression model, with individuals at the first level and municipalities/city quarters at the second, was performed. The effect (intra-class correlation, cross-level modification, and odds ratios) of individual and municipality/city quarter factors on self-reported psychological health was analysed. RESULTS: The crude variance between municipalities/city quarters was small but significant. It was particularly affected and lowered by individual civil status, country of origin, economic stress, and social participation. The inclusion of all individual factors age, sex, civil status, country of origin, education, economic stress, and social participation lowered the between municipality variance to not-significant levels, which is the reason why no contextual variables were included in the calculations. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that poor self-reported psychological health is affected mainly by individual characteristics of the population and not by contextual factors at the municipality/city quarter level."
19168935,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In Canada the incidence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 1 in 100 live births. FASD is the leading cause of developmental and cognitive disabilities in Canada. Only one study has examined the cost of FASD in Canada. In that study we did not include prospective data for infants under the age of one year, costs for adults beyond 21 years or costs for individuals living in institutions. OBJECTIVE: To calculate a revised estimate of direct and indirect costs associated with FASD at the patient level. METHODS: Cross-sectional study design was used. Two-hundred and fifty (250) participants completed the study tool. Participants included caregivers of children, youth and adults, with FASD, from day of birth to 53 years, living in urban and rural communities throughout Canada participated. Participants completed the Health Services Utilization Inventory (HSUI). Key cost components were elicited: direct costs: medical, education, social services, out-of-pocket costs; and indirect costs: productivity losses. Total average costs per individual with FASD were calculated by summing the costs for each in each cost component, and dividing by the sample size. Costs were extrapolated to one year. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to identify significant determinants of costs and to calculate the adjusted annual costs associated with FASD. RESULTS: Total adjusted annual costs associated with FASD at the individual level was $21,642 (95% CI, $19,842; $24,041), compared to $14,342 (95% CI, $12,986; $15,698) in the first study. Severity of the individual's condition, age, and relationship of the individual to the caregiver (biological, adoptive, foster) were significant determinants of costs (p < 0.001). Cost of FASD annually to Canada of those from day of birth to 53 years old, was $5.3 billion (95% CI, $4.12 billion; $6.4 billion). CONCLUSIONS: Study results demonstrated the cost burden of FASD in Canada was profound. Inclusion of infants aged 0 to 1 years, adults beyond the age of 21 years and costs associated with residing in institutions provided a more accurate estimate of the costs of FASD. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed. Key words: Alcohol, pregnancy, cost, economic burden, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder."
18209291,0,a,"While infrastructure conditions constitute 'primary routes', contamination of water within households and other behavioural determinants are considered as 'secondary routes'. However, recontaminated water has been considered not to constitute a serious risk though it occurs commonly in poorer societies. A study was conducted in Delhi where individual risk factors were located within a larger socio-economic, political and administrative framework, as they were often independent variables. This component of the larger study hypothesised that behavioural factors at individual household levels lose significance as major determinants of diarrhoeal diseases once they are analysed in a holistic epidemiology frame. Determinants at the household level were explored through a dataset based on a primary survey of 300 households in three slum clusters. Amongst households storing municipal water (proven to be safe at source), adhering to the best storage practices did not translate into lower incidence rates as compared to those with relatively unsafe practices. The explanation lay in factors which were external to the home and beyond the control of the affected household. Thus, household level behavioural factors such as storage practises should not be analysed in isolation as determinants of diarrhoeal illness particularly when pitted against stronger neighbourhood and external determinants."
2236224,1,a,"The purpose of this article is to examine movement science research on personal and social-environmental motivational influences in physical activity contexts. Motivation is defined as a process in which internal and external factors direct and energize thoughts, feelings, and actions. Motivation is described as a consequence of meaning, which is derived from a combination of personal and social factors, including personal goals or incentives, expectations of personal efficacy, movement-related perceptual and affective experiences, and social and physical features of the environment. Recent literature from sport and exercise psychology is presented on these variables, their determinants, and their consequences for choice, effort, persistence, and performance behavior in exercise and sport contexts."
9672392,1,a,"This study examines social structural and family status factors as determinants of food behaviour. The data were derived from the FINMONICA Risk Factor Survey, collected in Finland in spring 1992. A multidimensional framework of the determinants of food behaviour was used, including social structural position, family status and gender. The associations between the determinants of food behaviour were estimated by multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age and regional differences. Food behaviour was measured by an index including six food items which were chosen based on Finnish dietary guidelines. In general, women's food behaviour was more in accordance with the dietary guidelines than that of men. The pattern of association between educational level and food behaviour was similar for both genders, but slightly stronger for men than women. Employment status was associated only with women's food behaviour, but the tendency was the same for men. Marital status was associated with men's as well as women's food behaviour. The food behaviour of married men and women was more in line with the dietary guidelines than the food behaviour of those who had been previously married. Parental status, however, was only associated with women's food behaviour, that is, the food behaviour of women with young children was more closely in line with the dietary guidelines than that of the rest of the women."
17003160,0,a,"PURPOSE: Students' idealism and desire to work with underserved populations decline as they progress from preclinical training through clerkships and residency. With an increasingly diverse population and increasing health disparities, academic health centers need to incorporate changes in their curricula to train socially responsible and idealistic physicians. International electives can provide valuable learning experiences to help achieve these goals. METHODS: Sixty-six preclinical medical students at the University of Texas Medical Branch participated in an international elective from 1997 to 2005. After 1 week of didactics, they spent 3 weeks as part of a multidisciplinary medical team in rural Nicaragua. Postelective questionnaires were administered. From students' responses, we identified common learning themes and grouped them under the categories of attitudes, awareness, and skills. Limitations included a self-selection bias, lack of a control group, and limited follow-up. RESULTS: After the elective, students had an increased interest in volunteerism, humanitarian efforts, and working with underserved populations both in the United States and abroad, as well as more compassion toward the underserved. Students also reported a heightened awareness of social determinants of health and public health, and a broadened global perspective, as well as increased self-awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate that a well-structured, mentored experience in international health can have a positive impact on preclinical students' attitudes, including their compassion, volunteerism, and interest in serving under-served populations, all measures of idealism."
18274042,0,a,"Disasters have been and will continue to be relatively common events in the human experience, and they make important contributions to variations in population health. There is a need, therefore, for conceptual models that identify the social and ecological factors influencing post-disaster consequences on population health. This article presents one such conceptual model which links the health consequences of natural, technological, and human-made disasters to a set of nested socioecological factors. Specifically, we attempt to link post-disaster consequences to aspects of the global and local environment and to highlight the roles played by social and ecological factors, including the social infrastructure, cultural beliefs, demography, and underlying historical and geographical circumstances. Examples from existing population-based health and disaster research are used to illustrate and amplify connections drawn from the model. From an applied standpoint, the model suggests that the role of multiple contextual determinants in shaping population health is likely to be complex. Practitioners interested in mitigating the consequences of disasters should pursue strategies that improve the underlying determinants of health, as well as practicable population-based interventions that could be implemented rapidly."
18181819,0,a,"This paper is based on a critical discourse content analysis of 40 stories from the 20 highest circulating English-language mass magazines available in Canada and published in Canada or the USA in 2001. It examines the presence or absence of the social determinants perspective in the portrayal of the two most significant causes of morbidity and mortality in these countries: cancer and heart disease. The media analysis documents an absence of reflection of the social determinants viewpoint on these, the most important causes of disease and death. Thus, magazine stories ignore the role of such considerations as income, education level, ethnicity, visible minority or, Aboriginal status, early life experiences, employment and working conditions, food accessibility and quality, housing, social services, social exclusion, or unemployment and employment security in explaining health. Instead, the magazine articles underscore an individualistic approach to disease that assumes that health care is accessible and available to all, and that these diseases are preventable and treatable through individual lifestyle choices in combination with the measures prescribed through conventional medicine. Although cancer and heart disease are framed by a medical discourse, articles tended to emphasise the independence, freedom and power of the individual within the medical care system. The research documents a continuation of the dominance of conventional medicine buttressed by individualism in media stories. Theoretical and methodological issues are discussed. Some of the practical consequences for policy-makers and professionals are noted."
8865822,1,a,"This paper presents a brief review of the attributes of effective learning environments in clinical settings. Recent studies articulate the perceived importance of social and organizational factors as determinants of learning. Differences are evident among hospitals and among departments within hospitals with regard to the quality of the learning environment they offer. These differences are reflected in the orientation towards teaching and learning, the level of autonomy, variety and workload, and the quality of supervision and social support. Differences are also evident in the type and quality of opportunities for practice of important skills and in the availability of educational resources. These factors are perceived as major determinants of the effectiveness of learning in clinical settings. The implications for clinical teachers and administrators are discussed. The authors argue that emphasis should be given to the creation of supportive and well-organized learning environments in clinical settings. This may require a great emphasis on the role of clinical teachers as designers of opportunities for learning and managers of learning resources."
9041742,1,a,"The study reported here sought to assess Pap test coverage of a group of asymptomatic Argentine women from the poor urban district of La Matanza in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area Initially, all 2495 women who voluntarily enrolled in a program for early detection of breast cancer between January 1991 and June 1993 were included. After removing those who did not meet various study criteria, there remained 779 study subjects with no gynecologic or mammary symptomatology. Two subgroups of these 779 were established-women who had received a Pap test at any time and those who had received such a test within the previous three years. Using these subgroups, the influence of certain sociodemographic and other variables upon the likelihood of Pap testing was assessed. The results indicated significant associations between past Pap testing and age, formal education, parity, and a family history of cancer Likewise, significant associations were found between Pap testing within the preceding three years and age, formal education, and parity. The study findings affirm the idea that it would be advisable to seek Pap testing for all study population women once every three years instead of every year. Since the study population was not necessarily representative of Buenos Aires population, however, and the findings could have been affected by self-selection and other biases, additional studies are needed to determine actual Pap test coverage among women of the metropolitan area."
7792367,1,a,"This paper discusses minor psychiatric morbidity in the community and its relation to help-seeking. The research is aimed at identifying the demographic and social characteristics that enhance the likelihood of minor psychiatric morbidity, as measured by the General Health Questionnaire, and to reveal how these determinants relate to health status. In the second stage of the study, the same characteristics are related to their effect on the decision to decision to consult a general practitioner and, specifically, on presenting psycho-social problems to the GP. At the population level, the likelihood of a high GHQ score was greater for women, divorced persons and the unemployed, other variables remaining equal. However, GHQ score was contaminated by poor subjective health perception, especially for unemployed persons. Chronic physical illness did not have an independent effect on the GHQ score. Chronic physical illness did influence help-seeking. In addition, several socio-demographic characteristics showed an independent effect on consulting behaviour for both GHQ-positive and GHQ-negative patients. Women, unemployed persons and publicly insured patients with a minor psychiatric disturbance were more apt to visit their GP, regardless of their physical health status. However, no socio-demographic characteristics increased the likelihood that a GHQ-positive patient would present unambiguous psycho-social complaints as a reason to see their doctor."
11119174,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, sociodemographic determinants, and depression correlates of intimate partner abuse among an ethnically diverse population of women patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone survey in English and Spanish of a random sample of women patients aged 18 to 46 years. SETTING: Three public hospital primary care clinics (general internal medicine, family medicine, and obstetrics/gynecology) in San Francisco, Calif. PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed 734 (74%) of the 992 eligible participants. Thirty-one percent were non-Latina white, 31% African American, and 36% Latina. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using questions adapted from the Abuse Assessment Screen, we determined recent and lifetime history of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. Overall, 15% reported recent abuse by an intimate partner (in the preceding 12 months); lifetime prevalence was 51%. Recent abuse was more common among women aged 18 to 29 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 3.7), non-Latinas (adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.9), and unmarried women (adjusted OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.7). The prevalence of abuse did not differ by education, employment, or medical insurance status of the women. Compared with women with no history of abuse, a greater proportion of recently abused women reported symptoms of depression (adjusted OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.2 to 5.5). CONCLUSIONS: Because a substantial proportion of women patients in primary care settings are abused, screening for partner abuse and depression is indicated. In contrast to other studies, lower socioeconomic status was not associated with partner abuse history."

METHOD: Data were collected using a monthly risk factor surveillance system where each month a representative random sample of South Australian is selected from the Electronic White Pages with interviews conducted using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). RESULTS: In total, 4.7% of South Australian, aged 16 years and over, were determined to have suicidal ideation. There was no change in the trend over the years when surveys between 1997 and 2005 were compared. A wide range of variables were significant with suicidal ideation at the univariate level. In the final multivariate model, marital status, money situation, psychosocial stress (K10), physical activity, fruit consumption, health service use and mental health service use proved to be best joint predictors of suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Suicidal ideation in the community has not increased (or decreased) over time and questions assessing suicidal ideation can be used effectively in a surveillance system."
1489240,1,a,"Prevalence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) reflects community and individual risk factors. Cultural and behavioural factors influence community prevalence of sexually transmitted disease (STD), illegal abortion, puerperal sepsis and contraceptive usage--all of which influence risk of PID. The relative importance of these factors will vary by region. Individual risk factors for the ascent of a lower genital tract infection are still poorly understood but are thought to be behavioural and immunological. Prevention of PID must be undertaken at several levels. At primary level, it requires a reduction in community risk. At secondary level, individual risk can be modified by ensuring diagnosis and treatment of STD before damage of the upper genital tract occurs. More attention to cultural factors should increase the potential for prevention at both levels."
1921101,1,a,"Correlations among body weight and sociodemographic factors, including life-style were tested as social determinants of health in a sample of 5,201 adults in Korea. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which sociodemographic variables and life-style associated health behaviors explain body weight distribution. A second aim was to explain the relation of body weight and health status to stress the importance of body weight as an early risk indicator of health status. The canonical correlation between the weight distribution (underweight and overweight) and the independent variables was 0.29, 17% of the total variance was explained. Perceived health level represented the highest contribution (canonical coefficient 0.82) to body weight. Sociodemographic factors such as sex, economic status, and life-style factors such as smoking, exercise, regular meals and sleep showed comparatively high contributions to body weight. The relevance of body weight for health status including the rate of chronic disease and the rate of medical utilization was significant. Especially, underweight was clarified as being more important than overweight to morbidity level and medical utilization. These findings suggest that perceived body weight is an important indicator of health status and is thus a valuable variable to be considered for nursing intervention and health education related to the promotion of health."
9785693,1,a,"This paper examines the factors that influence a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) to shift risk to doctors through an incentive arrangement called capitation, where physicians are paid a fixed amount per patient for a period of time for any and all medical services required by the patient. Multispecialty-medical-group (Group) HMOs are more likely to shift risk than Independent Physician Associations (IPA) HMOs. Within IPA HMOs, larger enrollment per physician is positively associated with more risk shifting. We find that institutional factors signaling legitimacy play an important role in determining risk shifting. For-profit HMOs are less likely to shift risk, which we interpret as reflecting consumer distrust of for-profit HMOs. However, for-profit HMOs that are federally qualified, which we interpret as a signal of legitimacy, are more likely to shift risk."

11428201,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Data from two consecutive households surveys undertaken in mid-80s and mid-90s allow to characterize and analyse secular trends in infant and child anaemia in the city of S. Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: The two surveys included random population samples aged from zero to 59 months (1,016 in the period of 1984-85 and 1,280 in 1995-96). Capillary blood samples, collected by digital puncture in the two surveys, were analysed regarding their haemoglobin concentration. The anaemic status was determined when haemoglobin concentration was below 11 g/dL. For each survey, the study of the social distribution of child anaemia took into account tertiles of the per capita family income. For the study of the determinants of secular trends, hierarchical causal models, multivariate regression analyses and calculations analogous to the ones used to assess population attributable risks were applied. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: In the time span from the first to the second survey, there was a significant reduction in the average haemoglobin concentration (from 11.6 g/dl to 11.0 g/dl), as well as a considerable increase in anaemia prevalence (from 35.6% to 46.9%). Unfavourable trends were observed in both sexes, all age groups and all income strata. Trends were still less favourable among the poorest families, aggravating the social burden related to child anaemia. Changes in distal (family income and maternal schooling) and proximal determinants (breast or bottle-feeding) of child anaemia were positive in the study period and therefore they cannot explain the increase in the disease. A low iron diet could explain the high prevalence of anaemia in both surveys but could not explain its further increase."
18314472,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Wage losses after breast cancer may result in considerable financial burden. Their assessment is made more urgent because more women now participate in the workforce and because breast cancer is managed using multiple treatment modalities that could lead to long work absences. We evaluated wage losses, their determinants, and the associations between wage losses and changes for the worse in the family's financial situation among Canadian women over the first 12 months after diagnosis of early breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study among women with breast cancer from eight hospitals throughout the province of Quebec. Information that permitted the calculation of wage losses and information on potential determinants of wage losses were collected by three pretested telephone interviews conducted over the year following the start of treatment. Information on medical characteristics was obtained from medical records. The main outcome was the proportion of annual wages lost because of breast cancer. Multivariable analysis of variance using the general linear model was used to identify personal, medical, and employment characteristics associated with the proportion of wages lost. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Among 962 eligible breast cancer patients, 800 completed all three interviews. Of these, 459 had a paying job during the month before diagnosis. On average, these working women lost 27% of their projected usual annual wages (median = 19%) after compensation received had been taken into account. Multivariable analysis showed that a higher percentage of lost wages was statistically significantly associated with a lower level of education (P(trend) = .0018), living 50 km or more from the hospital where surgery was performed (P = .070), lower social support (P = .012), having invasive disease (P = .086), receipt of chemotherapy (P < .001), self-employment (P < .001), shorter tenure in the job (P(trend) < .001), and part-time work (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Wage losses and their effects on financial situation constitute an important adverse consequence of breast cancer in Canada."
9745425,1,a,"The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease and depression in perimenopausal women. Thyroid function [TSH, free T4, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab)] and depression (using the Edinburgh Depression Scale) were assessed cross-sectionally together with other determinants of depression. The subjects were 583 randomly selected perimenopausal women (aged 47-54 yr) from a community cohort of 6846 women. The main outcome measures were the occurrence of thyroid dysfunction (abnormal free T4 and/or TSH or elevated levels of TPO-Ab) and the concomitant presence of depression according to the Edinburgh Depression Scale. Neither biochemical thyroid dysfunction nor menopausal status was related to depression. Apart from several psycho-social determinants (the occurrence of a major life event, a previous episode of depression, or financial problems), an elevated level of TPO-Ab (> or = 100 U/mL) was significantly associated with depression (odds ratio, 3.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.8). We conclude that women with elevated TPO-Ab levels are especially vulnerable to depression, whereas postmenopausal status does not increase the risk of depression."

The authors predicted that procedural fairness would positively influence people's reported self-esteem if the leader adopted a style of rewarding behavior for a job well done. Results from a scenario experiment, a laboratory experiment, and an organizational survey indeed show that procedural fairness and rewarding leadership style interacted to influence followers' self-esteem, such that the positive relationship between procedural fairness and self-esteem was more pronounced when the leadership style was high in rewarding behavior. Implications in terms of integrating the leadership and procedural fairness literature are discussed."
16000340,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The new public health rejects old individualist attempts at improving health and embraces community-based approaches in reducing health inequalities. Primary Care Trusts in England face the challenge of converting community participation in health into reality. This study explores differences in perception of participation between lay and professional stakeholders of a community health project for a South Asian population in Greater Manchester. METHODS: In-depth interviews and focus groups were used to explore the views of professional and lay stakeholders. All data were audio-taped, transcribed and analysed for emerging themes using a qualitative framework. RESULTS: Professionals talked of working in partnership with the community but lay stakeholders did not feel that they had control over the project. There were problems in engaging the community and local health professionals in the project. Lack of cultural awareness hampered participation in the project. There was agreement that the project improved the self-confidence of participants and created a more informed population. However, there was little support for claims of improvements in social cohesion and changes in lifestyle directly as a result of the project. CONCLUSION: Converting the rhetoric of community participation in health into reality is a greater challenge than was envisaged by policy makers. Marginalized communities may not be willing participants and issues of language and cultural sensitivity are important. Project outcomes need to be agreed to ensure projects are evaluated appropriately. Projects with South Asian communities should not be seen to be dealing with all 'ethnic health' issues without addressing changes in statutory organizations and other wider social determinants of health."
7953220,1,a,"The present study distinguished between personal self-esteem (PSE) and collective self-esteem (CSE) as determinants of in-group bias in an intergroup context. Subjects performed a group task, the product of which they subsequently evaluated ('own' group), along with solutions allegedly produced by another 'in-group' (similar nationality), and an 'out-group' (different nationality). This provided the opportunity for intragroup discrimination (own vs. in-group), and both direct (own vs. out-group) and indirect (in-group vs. out-group) strategies of intergroup discrimination. It was predicted that subjects high in CSE would differentiate more than subjects low in CSE, both directly and indirectly, but that intergroup discrimination would also result from high PSE. The relationship between the in-group and out-group was also manipulated by varying the salient out-group. It was predicted that subjects motivated to enhance social identity (high CSE) would differentiate more, directly and indirectly, when the out-group was seen as having a more competitive relationship with the in-group. Although this manipulation was unsuccessful, a follow-up suggested that the out-group predefined as less competitive was actually a more relevant comparison group in the context of the task, which is consistent with effects of this manipulation. Overall PSE and CSE were both found to influence differentiation at the intragroup and intergroup level, both independently and interactively. However, whereas high PSE led to greater positive differentiation, low CSE had this effect, and a combination of high PSE and low CSE produced the most consistent pattern of positive in-group differentiation across both out-group conditions. Possible mechanisms which account for this pattern are discussed and the relationship between dimensions of self-esteem and group differentiation is reappraised in the light of these findings."
16299386,0,a,"Myxococcus xanthus has two different mechanisms of motility, adventurous (A) motility, which permits individual cells to glide over solid surfaces, and social (S) motility, which permits groups of cells to glide. To identify the genes involved in S-gliding motility, we mutagenized a delta aglU (A-) strain with the defective transposon, magellan-4, and screened for S- mutants that form nonmotile colonies. Sequence analysis of the sites of the magellan-4 insertions in these mutants and the alignment of these sites with the M. xanthus genome sequence show that two-thirds of these insertions lie within 27 of the 37 nonessential genes known to be required for social motility, including those necessary for the biogenesis of type IV pili, exopolysaccharide, and lipopolysaccharide. The remaining insertions also identify 31 new, nonessential genes predicted to encode both structural and regulatory determinants of S motility. These include three tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, several regulators of transcription that may control the expression of genes involved in pilus extension and retraction, and additional enzymes involved in polysaccharide metabolism. Three insertions that abolish S motility lie within genes predicted to encode glycolytic enzymes, suggesting that the signal for pilus retraction may be a simple product of exopolysaccharide catabolism."

The group of male alcoholic in-patients and the random sample were subdivided with respect to alcohol consumption and use of hepatotoxic drugs: (IA) men from the random sample with low or moderate alcohol consumption and no use of drugs (n = 169); (IB) men from the random sample with low or moderate alcohol consumption with use of drugs (n = 31); (IIA) alcoholic in-patients with use of alcohol but no drugs (n = 171); (IIB) alcoholic in-patients with use of alcohol and drugs (n = 40). Earlier and more severe alcohol-related and anti-social problems were found among subjects with an alcoholic parent than among subjects without an alcoholic parent. The highest level of problems was noted for subjects with alcoholism in both parents and among the alcoholic in-patients. Groups which resembled each other were the drug users in the alcoholic group and in the general sample. Both inherited and environmental factors are important determinants and many of these individuals have psycho-social problems as children and adults. The children of those adults who used alcohol in combination with drugs (IIB) had most problems and the most severe problems. In the general population sample, those who used alcohol in combination with drugs (IB) had so many problems in the family and psycho-social problems themselves that they resembled the alcoholic in-patients and especially the group with high alcohol consumption in combination with drugs (IIB). A new finding is that the high-risk groups IB and IIB, who used both alcohol and drugs, had experienced a more disturbed school career and were more aggressive, had more nervous problems, and were more emotionally disturbed than the other groups. It is concluded that alcohol and drug use by parents may be predictive of future alcoholism in their children."
9133901,1,a,"This article describes a growing body of evidence showing the adverse effects of the widening income gap on the health and welfare of children and young people. The effects of this go well beyond morbidity and mortality and can also be seen in the areas of crime, violence, and educational attainment. There is a need for evidence based policy in this area, but meanwhile there is scope for intervention in pregnancy and the early years, and good evidence that this is effective. A number of well evaluated interventions not necessarily directly related to health, such as early learning programmes and social support for parents, promise to have beneficial health effects."
1583037,1,a,"This research examines determinants of infant and child mortality in rural Egypt, primarily the effects of household economic status and the availability of health services. Certain features of the health service environment affect survival in the neonatal period. In early childhood, survival chances improve markedly as income increases and if the household depends almost exclusively on employment income. In infancy and in early childhood, mortality is strongly associated with region of residence and maternal demographic characteristics, and is weakly associated with parental schooling."
19652692,0,a,"During the past several decades, smoking prevalence among youth has fluctuated in puzzling and unexpected ways. To help understand these changes, this study tests seven explanations: (a) compositional changes, (b) sample selection, (c) adult smoking, (d) social strain, (e) cigarette prices, (f) tobacco advertising, and (g) other drug use. Figures on smoking prevalence come from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Surveys from 1976-2002, whereas figures on aggregate determinants for the same time period come from government publications. Graphs of the time-series trends to determine temporal correspondence and time-series regression models to test for statistical influence reveal two variables that have expected effects. Increases in cigarette prices reduce smoking, particularly in the most recent years, and higher marijuana initiation (or use) is associated with greater smoking during most of the time period. However, much of the change in youth smoking, particularly the most recent rise and fall, remains unexplained."
15778630,0,a,This study examined the relationship between early childhood caries (ECC) and measures of socioeconomic status as environmental determinants of oral health inequalities. Dental caries and quality of oral hygiene were reported on 384 young inner-city children (24-35 months) by clinical examination. Early childhood caries was diagnosed in 18.5% of children. Ethnicity (P < 0.001) and neighborhood (P < 0.001) were the social variables significantly predictive of ECC in a logistic regression model. Living in a deprived neighborhood and the mother being of East European descent were the social variables with strongest association with ECC. These variables can be considered adequate criteria to identify groups at risk within the overall population.
15935588,0,a,"Centenarians represent an intriguing model for ageing studies, since they demonstrate extreme longevity by definition, and at the same time a proportion of them have aged successfully. Here, we present data from the first nationwide study on Greek centenarians concerning their functional health status and life-style characteristics. We have identified 489 individuals (77% women) born in 1900 or before who were still alive between the years 2000 and 2002. Socio-demographic characteristics, activities of daily living (ADLs), living conditions, dependence on other people, former and current diseases and health disorders, current medication, nutrition and personal habits were recorded for every subject. Interestingly, only 2% of Greek centenarians lived in nursing homes, while the majority lived with their family or relatives. Furthermore, 6% were free from severe health disorders, autonomous (based on simple criteria for ADLs) and also leading an active social life, and hence may be considered as being in optimal condition. This group of centenarians may serve as a valuable source of information on genetic, environmental, and psychosocial determinants of successful ageing."
9809712,1,a,"Poor countries can ill-afford ineffective health care. An effective disease intervention is one which produces a net improvement in beneficiaries' quality of life and/or increases life expectancy. Unlike developed countries, very little research has been done in developing countries on the measures of the ultimate output of health care. The objectives of this study were to: (i) apply the existing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) methods in eliciting health state valuations from farmers, teachers and health professionals living and working in the schistosomiasis endemic Mwea Irrigation Scheme in Kenya; (ii) determine whether there is significant difference between average health states valuations from the three main groups of people at risk of schistosomiasis infection; and (iii) assess the relative effect of different respondent characteristics and health states prognosis on valuations. The instrument consists of seven health state descriptions-each defined along six functional dimensions: self-care, mobility, livelihood activities, energy, social participation and pain. Cardinal health state values were measured using a visual-analogue-scale (VAS). Values were elicited from three random samples of farming general public, medical professionals and teachers. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test showed that there is significant difference in the average health state values (for mild, moderate, severe, very severe and comatose states) obtained from the three samples. Generally, except for the valuation of the immediately following state, the other explanatory variables are not statistically significant determinants of valuations for the mild, moderate, severe and very severe states. The results suggest that VAS valuations are primarily affected by prognosis. There is urgent need for more representative and systematic HRQoL studies to test the relevance of the Western-based generic instruments in African countries contexts, with a view to developing more appropriate tool(s) if necessary."
11676587,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A clear, up-to-date picture of smoking prevalence and its determinants is needed to inform the development of an effective tobacco control policy in Ukraine, particularly given the way in which the tobacco industry has targeted post-Soviet countries since transition. METHODS: A nationally representative household survey was undertaken in Ukraine in February 2000. RESULTS: Data were available on 1,590 individuals (response rate 72%). Fifty-seven percent of men and 10% of women were current smokers and an additional 21 and 7%, respectively, were ex-smokers. Smoking behavior has changed considerably over successive generations, with an increase in the proportion of women smoking and a reduction in the mean age at first smoking. Factors associated with smoking include young age, urban residence (among women), and material hardship, particularly unemployment. Involvement in social networks appears to reduce the probability of smoking. Smoking commonly occurs in public places and smokers differ from nonsmokers in their health beliefs about smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of smoking among men are already high and among young women are increasing rapidly. Unless an effective tobacco policy response is developed to address the issues identified, tobacco will continue to make an increasingly large contribution to premature morbidity and mortality in Ukraine."
19583043,0,a,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between cognitive and behavioural factors of preadolescents and those of their mothers, assessed in terms of self-efficacy beliefs and toothbrushing among Turkish and Finnish population in the framework of Social Cognitive Theory. The specific objective was to test if this possible association worked regardless of cultural differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires for Finnish (n = 338) and Turkish (n = 611) pre-adolescents and their mothers were used to collect the information on cognitive (pre-adolescent and maternal self-efficacy) and behavioural factors (toothbrushing frequencies). RESULTS: Turkish mothers and pre-adolescents reported lower levels of self-efficacy and toothbrushing than did their Finnish counterparts (P < 0.005). Finnish pre-adolescents reporting high self-efficacy were more likely to have mothers with high levels of self-efficacy (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.16 to 3.93), (P = 0.014). Similar positive associations emerged between Turkish (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.70 to 3.52), (P = 0.001) and Finnish (OR = 6.76, 95% CI = 2.21 to 20.65), (P = 0.001) pre-adolescent self-efficacy and maternal recommended (twice daily) level of toothbrushing behaviour. For pre-adolescents' toothbrushing, their own self-efficacy was the common explanatory variable. Binary logistic regression models revealed that the maternal toothbrushing accounted for the Turkish pre-adolescents' toothbrushing behaviour, whereas maternal self-efficacy did so for the Finnish pre-adolescents' (P < 0.001) toothbrushing behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: This study underlines the need for integration of pre-adolescent self-efficacy and maternal cognition and behaviour into oral health intervention programmes because of their relation to recommended toothbrushing behaviour among pre-adolescents, regardless of cultural differences. These findings seem to fit with the Social Cognitive Theory, which emphasises the significance of cultural factors and cognition as the determinants of behaviour."
15098428,0,a,"Despite significant debate about the efficacy, ideology, and ethics of the method, condom social marketing (CSM) has become the dominant approach to AIDS education in many sub-Saharan African countries. However, critics have charged that social marketing (SM) distracts from the structural determinants of health-related behavior and excludes genuine community participation. This article argues that the diffusion of SM techniques in Africa is not driven by demonstrated efficacy but is attributable to the promotion of privatization and free markets in the structural adjustment era across the region. The CSM experience in a central Mozambican community reveals the dangers of using the method at the expense of community dialogue and participation to confront the AIDS epidemic. The advertising campaign developed to sell condoms has clashed with Pentecostal and Independent Churches, now a majority of the population, that have expanded rapidly across the region spreading a contrasting message about sexuality and risky behavior."
18486291,0,a,"An increase in the social unacceptability of smoking has dramatically decreased tobacco use in the USA. However, how policies (e.g., smoke free air laws) and social factors (e.g., social norms) drive the social unacceptability of tobacco use are not well understood. New research suggests that the stigmatization of smokers is an unrecognized force in the tobacco epidemic and could be one such mechanism. Thus, it is important to investigate the sources of smoker-related stigmatization as perceived by current and former smokers. In this study, we draw on the broader literature about stigma formation in the context of the tobacco epidemic and examine the role of attribution, fear, tobacco control policies, power and social norms in the formation of smoker-related stigma. We test hypotheses about the determinants of stigma using a population-based sample of 816 current and former smokers in New York City. The results show that perceptions of individual attributions for smoking behavior and fear about the health consequences of second hand smoke are important influences on smoker-related stigmatization. Structural forms of discrimination perpetrated against smokers and former smokers (e.g., company policies against hiring smokers) are also related to smoker-related stigma. Respondents with more education perceive more smoker-related stigma than respondents with less education and, Black and Latino respondents perceive less smoker-related stigma than White respondents. Social norms, specifically family and friends' expressed disapproval of smoking, contribute to the formation of smoker-related stigma. These findings suggest important points of leverage to harness the powerful role of stigma in the smoking epidemic and raise concerns about the possible role of stigma in the production of smoking disparities."
2093232,1,a,"This paper investigates the effects of maternal demographic characteristics and social and economic statuses on infant mortality in rural Colombia. Demographic characteristics include the age of the mother, parity and length of preceding interbirth interval, and sex of infant. Measures of women's status at the time of birth include education, wage labor and occupation, economic stratum, place of residence, and whether the mother is living with a husband. The life history data for the study (involving 4,928 births) were collected in 1986 from a representative sample of two cohorts of women resident in rural central Colombia. Overall differentials in infant mortality by measures of women's status are small and are in good part associated with the differing reproductive behaviors of the women and variations in breastfeeding practices. The sharp declines in infant mortality recorded in rural Colombia in recent years appear less related to improved status of women than to reductions in fertility that enhance infant survivorship and to public health interventions shared by all segments of the population."
11042429,0,a,"The study aimed to determine the factors associated with a delay in seeking health care for symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among a sample of 1482 patients attending STD clinics. Of the sample 78% were male, 58% sought help from the clinic within the first 6 days of noticing symptoms, 24% waited between 7 and 10 days and 17% waited longer than 10 days before seeking health care. Patients who delayed were those who treated themselves prior to seeking health care, who were female, whose friends waited before seeking treatment, who held misconceptions regarding the cause of STDs, who perceived STDs not to be serious and who valued personal autonomy in sexual behaviours less and had less positive outcome expectations of refusing sex. The data suggest that targeted interventions should be directed specifically at women and the youth. Early health care seeking could be facilitated through improved basic knowledge regarding STDs, control over one's own sexual behaviour and social support for early health care seeking."
8088702,1,a,"A model of determinants of psychosocial adaptation in chronic disease includes general and specific disease characteristics, life events and stress, personality, family and social environment. This model is used as a guide for the analysis of the individual process of psychosocial adaptation in order to assist the patient. Furthermore, based on findings of empirical studies, the increased risk of psychiatric disorders reflecting maladaptive coping processes is outlined. Finally, some fundamental considerations regarding psychological rehabilitation within paediatric care are presented."
9003886,1,a,"Research articles on the prognosis of stroke patients were analysed to identify studies that met sound methodological principles of prognostic research as well as to identify variables capable of predicting functional outcome (ADL) after stroke. Data sources comprised a computer-aided search of published prognostic studies and references to literature used in prognostic studies. Seventy-eight studies were tested for adherence to the following key methodological criteria: reliability and validity of measurement instruments used to assess dependent and independent variables; inclusion of an inception cohort; adequate and uniform end-point of observation; control for drop-outs during period of observation; statistical testing of presumed relationship between dependent and independent variables; sufficient sample size in relation to number of determinants; control for multicollinearity; specification of patient characteristics (i.e. age, type, recurrent stroke and localization of stroke); description of interfering treatment effects during the period of observation, and cross-validation of the prediction model in a second independent group of patients. Only three studies satisfied nine out 11 criteria and ten studies eight criteria for the determination of valid prognostic research. The results of these studies indicate that the following variables are valid predictors for functional recovery after stroke: age; previous stroke; urinary continence; consciousness at onset; disorientation in time and place; severity of paralysis; sitting balance; admission ADL score; level of social support and metabolic rate of glucose outside the infarct area in hypertensive patients. This study supports the general opinion that not only are differences in objectives and heterogeneity in stroke patients responsible for the lack of accuracy in predicting functional outcome, but also the methodological flaws in published prognostic research."
9785712,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To consider the power of principles derived from evolutionary biology to explain the causes and determinants of some forms of child and adolescent mental disorders. METHOD: The authors reviewed the scientific literature for evolutionary mechanisms proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of early-onset disorders. RESULTS: A diverse set of evolutionary mechanisms has been proposed. With the exception of certain genetically determined conditions, many of the proposed mechanisms have little empirical data to support them. One mechanism focuses on the vulnerabilities associated with conserved behavior patterns, such as separation anxiety and other alarm responses. These behavioral patterns are adaptive if they appear in some situations, but not in others. Other attractive theories include a co-optation of underlying neurobiology systems (substance abuse), environmental shifts (transformation of present day environments away from primeval environments), and evolutionary arms races as may occur in putative autoimmune disorders with neuropsychiatric sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Evolutionary biology provides a potentially powerful framework for understanding disease pathogenesis in child psychiatry and should permit the integration of new knowledge from a broad range of scientific disciplines. Evolutionary explanations are typically population-based and fail to account for why a particular individual is disciplines. Evolutionary explanations are typically population-based and fail to account for why a particular individual is affected. Consequently, any adequate account of disease pathogenesis requires that environmental events that impinge on CNS development be considered. Finally, the empirical testing of specific theories may prove to be difficult if not impossible."
16533103,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively identify attitudinal and psychosocial determinants of early prenatal care among Black women of low socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: Focus group discussions were conducted among Black women who attended community clinics for prenatal care. RESULTS: Early initiators of prenatal care, compared with late initiators, had positive attitudes toward pregnancy, were knowledgeable about pregnancy signs/symptoms, and thought prenatal care was important. All participants indicated strong social support during pregnancy. Late initiators, particularly multiparous women, perceived clinic staff to be insensitive. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide valuable insight into overcoming barriers to early initiation of prenatal care among low SES Black women."
1492502,1,a,"Complex associations between alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, eating habits and physical exercise are explored. Data from the 1985 German Cardiovascular Prevention Study are used to explore associations between these behaviours, separate for young men (n = 561) and young women (n = 509) between 25 to 34 years of age. Analyses concern three forms of associations: 1. associations between different categories of single health behaviours; 2. associations between various health behaviours, and 3. associations between health behaviours, and their social determinants. Contingency tables, cluster analyses and logistic regression analyses are applied. Cluster analyses identified subgroups with particular health behaviour patterns. One distinct pattern, similarly among men and women, was typified by increased physical exercise, less smoking and increased beer consumption. For young men, results from regression analyses showed significant effects of higher income and positive health attitudes on belonging to this distinct cluster. For young women cluster membership was significantly correlated with higher education and positive health attitudes. Results of the statistical analyses demonstrate the usefulness of a multi-methods approach in studying complex behaviour patterns. Finally the relevance of the present findings for future studies and applications is indicated."
15357207,0,a,"As a consequence of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, 30% of victims may develop chronic Chagas disease, which presents a spectrum of pathology including cardiomyopathy, megacolon and megaesophagus. The outcome of infection in a particular individual is the result of a set of complex interactions among the host genetic background, environmental and social factors, and the genetic composition of the parasite, all of which can be complicated by mixed infections and re-infections. Initially we consider what is known about the genetic structure and biological properties of the protozoan. Currently, six distinct subgroups have been characterized by different combinations of four distinct genotypic classes. The recent demonstration of genetic exchange via non-meiotic cell fusion illustrates a mechanism by which maintained heterogeneous polyploidy may have been generated in these parasites. Subsequently, we consider factors in humans and in experimental mouse-infection and tissue culture models that have contributed to our understanding of the host's susceptibility or resistance to disease. Identification of the direct players in host-pathogen interactions at the establishment and chronic phases of the disease is perhaps the best hope of a clinical handle for treatment. At some point in the future, these disparate areas of study will have to come together. It is to be hoped that this scientific fusion will result in better prognosis and treatment of Chagas disease."
19573229,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In the past decade in activities aiming at return-to-work (RTW), there has been a growing awareness to change the focus from sickness and work disability to recovery and work ability. To date, this process in occupational health care (OHC) has mainly been directed towards employees. However, within the working population there are two vulnerable groups: temporary agency workers and unemployed workers, since they have no workplace/employer to return to, when sick-listed. For this group there is a need for tailored RTW strategies and interventions. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the structured and stepwise process of development, implementation and evaluation of a theory- and practise-based participatory RTW program for temporary agency workers and unemployed workers, sick-listed due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). This program is based on the already developed and cost-effective RTW program for employees, sick-listed due to low back pain. METHODS: The Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol was used to develop a tailor-made RTW program for temporary agency workers and unemployed workers, sick-listed due to MSD. The Attitude-Social influence-self-Efficacy (ASE) model was used as a theoretical framework for determinants of behaviour regarding RTW of the sick-listed worker and development of the intervention. To ensure participation and facilitate successful adoption and implementation, important stakeholders were involved in all steps of program development and implementation. Results of semi-structured interviews and 'fine-tuning' meetings were used to design the final participatory RTW program. RESULTS: A structured stepwise RTW program was developed, aimed at making a consensus-based RTW implementation plan. The new program starts with identifying obstacles for RTW, followed by a brainstorm session in which the sick-listed worker and the labour expert of the Social Security Agency (SSA) formulate solutions/possibilities for suitable (therapeutic) work. This process is guided by an independent RTW coordinator to achieve consensus. Based on the resulting RTW implementation plan, to create an actual RTW perspective, a vocational rehabilitation agency is assigned to find a matching (therapeutic) workplace. The cost-effectiveness of this participatory RTW program will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. CONCLUSION: IM is a promising tool for the development of tailor-made OHC interventions for the vulnerable working population."
17279444,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This study examined health related quality of life (HRQOL) and its predictors among African-, Asian-, Latina-, and European American breast cancer survivors (BCS) using a socio-ecologically and culturally contextual theoretical model of HRQOL. METHODS: We employed a case-control, cross sectional design with a population-based sample from the California Cancer Registry. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The sample included 703 BCS: 135 (19%) African-, 206 (29%) Asian-, 183 (26%) Latina-, and 179 (26%) European Americans. Latinas reported the lowest HRQOL (p < 0.0001). The final regression model explained 70% of variance in HRQOL. Years since diagnosis, number of comorbidities, role limitation, emotional wellbeing, quality of doctor-patient relationship, social support, and life stress are significant HRQOL determinants. Exploratory regression analyses indicate ethnic differences in significant predictors for HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL among this multiethnic sample ranged from fair to good. Bivariate analysis suggests that ethnic differences in HRQOL exist. However, regression analyses demonstrated that socio-ecological factors in conjunction with medical characteristics are more salient to HRQOL outcomes, and that ethnic group membership may be a proxy for socio-ecological context. Furthermore, the influence of ethnicity, culture, and social-ecology are complex; research with large, population-based samples are necessary to disentangle the impact of contextual factors on HRQOL."
18656859,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the umbilical cord blood lead levels (BLLs) of Pakistani neonates and to identify determinants for umbilical BLLs. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of mothers and infants at one of the two obstetric units of two tertiary care hospitals in Karachi during January-August 2005. Information from 540 mothers selected randomly from those registered for delivery was obtained about their pregnancy, diet, and current and past lead exposures. We collected umbilical cord blood for lead levels analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. We computed geometric and arithmetic means. We performed multiple linear regression analysis to identify factors associated with log-transformed umbilical cord BLLs. We also performed logistic regression analysis to identify determinants of high lead cord BLLs (10 microg/dl). RESULTS: The geometric mean cord BLL of the neonates was 9.6 microg/dl; arithmetic mean (S.D.) was 10.8 microg/dl (5.7) with a median of 9.7 microg/dl and a range of 1.8-48.9 microg/dl. Women who reported intake of less than 58.5mg of elemental iron supplement per day during pregnancy had cord BLL of 10.0 microg/dl; in comparison those women who had higher iron intake had lower cord BLL (8.4 microg/dl). Those who used surma (an eye cosmetic) daily had higher cord BLL (11.5 microg/dl) as compared to those who used it less frequently (9.4 microg/dl). In multivariable linear regression model, higher iron intake, owning a car, and being in 2nd quartile of mid-arm circumference were associated with low lead levels while father's occupation in lead-based industry was associated with significantly higher umbilical cord BLLs. There was interaction of daily surma use and ethnicity. Geometric mean BLLs were varied among surma users by ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical cord BLLs are high in Karachi, Pakistan, in comparison to those in developed countries such as United States. Measures are needed to reduce fetal lead exposure to prevent adverse affect on neurocognitive development. Association of low iron (below RDA of 60 mg per day) with high umbilical cord has implications for strengthening iron supplement intake during pregnancy. Umbilical cord BLLs differed among surma users by ethnicity."
8488633,1,a,"Care giving behaviour was investigated in pigs as a form of maternal behaviour and its effects on the youngs. The objective of observation was to compare the identified phenomena in their biological, social and experience variables of the behaviour of the investigated animals. The observations included 40 sows and 280 youngs of the Landrace x Large White breed, of the female sex. They took place in semi-natural conditions while the standard criteria of management were maintained. Two categories of sows and their youngs were investigated. The first group included 20 sows (first-litter gilts) and their youngs: A (1-20). A study unit comprised one sow and seven youngs. The other category, B (1-20), had analogical numbers of individuals but the sows were after their third parturitions. As an indicator of maternal behaviour the average index of sociability (IS) had the value mean = 1.7 for the first category and the value mean = 2.0 for the second category. Evaluation of these differences enables to determine a significant difference between the average IS for both groups (Fig. 1). This fact, which spoke in favour of B (1-20) group, made us follow the different litters. That means we wanted to know how the maternal behaviour determined piglet sociogenesis. IS was calculated from the average values of IS determined in both categories within their adequate litters. The value mean A (a-g) = 1.8 was determined for the first category (Tab. II) while for the second category B (1-20) the value mean B (a-g) made 2.0 (Tab. III).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
15798119,0,a,The National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal (NSNR) is a central component of British policy to reduce health disparities. This program seeks to improve local socioeconomic and physical environments through the intensive regeneration of disadvantaged communities. We describe the challenges facing evaluators tasked with assessing the impacts of 1 component of the NSNR--the New Deal for Communities initiative--and explore techniques that may be adopted in the evaluation process.
18537814,0,a,"This paper investigates the determinants of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture utilization for cancer patients who are simultaneously having conventional Western medical treatments. This study used five leading cancers in Taiwan, namely cervical, breast, lung, liver and colorectal cancers. A total of 2499 cancer patients were interviewed, of which 2034 had full information and were analysed. Logistic regressions were used for both TCM and acupuncture. The results showed that type of cancer and cancer duration determine the utilization for alternative treatments. While socio-economic factors also affect choice of alternative medicine, the magnitude differs by types of alternative treatment and cancer. Compared with men and older patients, women and younger patients tend to prefer alternative medicine, and patients from south have higher preference for alternative medicine, which could be a reflection of local culture. Our results are useful for the government to determine higher users of TCM and acupuncture among cancer patients, and make policies to suit these patients' needs."
12348140,1,a,"""The U.S. economy experienced significant increases in the degree of income inequality over the past two decades.... In this paper we consider the effects of race, age, female headship, and college education on the distribution of family income by developing a multivariate methodology that allows us to gauge the influence of one factor while holding other determinants of family incomes constant. Over the period studied we find that race had only a minor effect on the overall size distribution of income. Age had a somewhat greater effect than race. In contrast, the impact of female heads and college education were quite substantial. The multivariate estimates reveal that the effects of female heads and college education both increase the Gini to a much greater extent than the progressivity of federal income taxes decreases it. The effects of college education and female headed families on inequality have grown larger across time, while the influence of age has declined. We find that the effects of race on inequality have changed little over the 1976 to 1989 period."""
8696125,1,a,"The concept of voluntarism, as it applies to models of health education, underpins the nursing care of people who are chronically confused and their relatives. This article argues that voluntarism needs to be balanced by the notion of collectivism which takes full account of the contribution made by sociopolitical determinants of health. The central concepts of voluntarism and health education are defined and then the article proceeds to examine the extent to which voluntarism has underpinned various models of health education which can be used to support nursing practice. A critique of the concept of voluntarism, as used in health education, is provided. It is argued that models of health education which are polarized towards either voluntarism or collectivism are based on an inadequate understanding of human social action and that this polarization undermines the usefulness of these models of health education."
18846895,0,a,"Children and youth with cerebral palsy (CP) experience difficulties in their ability to move, problem solve, socialize, and communicate, associated with limitations in activities in all environments. They are at risk for lower participation in social and leisure activities critical in fostering friendships, developing interests, and promoting well-being. Little is known about involvement in leisure activities and their determinants. This systematic review aims to describe participation in leisure activities by children with CP and identify personal and environmental factors that influence participation. The following databases were reviewed--CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane, Web of Science, OT-seeker, and REHABDATA--using the keywords participation, cerebral palsy, leisure, and recreation. The literature to date suggests that children with physical disabilities are less involved in leisure activities than their peers; activities are more passive, home based, and lack variety. Several factors influence participation in leisure activities, including age, gender, activity limitations, family preferences and coping, motivation, and environmental resources and supports."
2363060,1,a,"As malaria grows more prevalent in the Amazon frontier despite increased expenditures by disease control authorities, national and regional tropical disease control strategies are being called into question. The current crisis involving traditional control/eradication methods has broadened the search for feasible and effective malaria control strategies--a search that necessarily includes an investigation of the roles of a series of individual and community-level socioeconomic characteristics in determining malaria prevalence rates, and the proper methods of estimating these links. In addition, social scientists and policy makers alike know very little about the economic costs associated with malarial infections. In this paper, I use survey data from several Brazilian gold mining areas to (a) test the general reliability of malaria-related questionnaire response data, and suggest categorization methods to minimize the statistical influence of exaggerated responses, (b) estimate three statistical models aimed at detecting the socioeconomic determinants of individual malaria prevalence rates, and (c) calculate estimates of the average cost of a single bout of malaria. The results support the general reliability of survey response data gathered in conjunction with malaria research. Once the effects of vector exposure were controlled for, individual socioeconomic characteristics were only weakly linked to malaria prevalence rates in these very special miners' communities. Moreover, the socioeconomic and exposure links that were significant did not depend on the measure of malaria adopted. Finally, individual costs associated with malarial infections were found to be a significant portion of miners' incomes."
7809663,1,a,"A cross-sectional study design was used to investigate psychosocial effects in the population exposed to PCB contamination and remediation in Smithville, Ontario, Canada. Psychosocial effects were defined as the complex of distress, dysfunction and disability manifested in a wide range of psychological, social and behavioural outcomes as a consequence of actual or perceived contamination. This paper describes the results of logistic regression analyses conducted to investigate the determinants of psychosocial effects of exposure. The data come from an epidemiologic survey of a sample (N = 272) of Smithville households within 3 km of the site, and a sample from a matched comparison community (N = 263). Two types of outcome variables were used as indicators of psychosocial effects. Scores on the general measures of psychosocial health and well-being (the GHQ-20 and the somatic complaints checklist of the SCL-90) for the Smithville sample did not differ from those expected in a 'normal' population, nor did they differ from those in the comparison community. Scores on these outcomes were associated with plausibly linked independent variables, but were not associated with exposure to the PCB site. Results for site-specific outcome measures (concern and health concern) showed that moderate levels of concern reported by Smithville respondents were explained by concern about another local hazardous waste issue and could not be explained by PCB site exposure. We conclude from these results that local community context exerts an important influence on psychosocial effects of environmental contamination. Furthermore, the types of outcome measures employed and the timing of the research in the context of the site history were important factors in our ability to detect psychosocial effects of the PCB contamination and remediation in Smithville."
9224176,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the long-term association between religious attendance and mortality to determine whether the association is explained by improvements in health practices and social connections for frequent attenders. METHODS: The association between frequent attendance and mortality over 28 years for 5286 Alameda Country Study respondents was examined. Logistic regression models analyzed associations between attendance and subsequent improvements in health practices and social connections. RESULTS: Frequent attenders had lower mortality rates than infrequent attenders (relative hazard [RH] = 0.64;95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53,0.77). Results were stronger for females. Health adjustments had little impact, but adjustments for social connections and health practices reduced the relationship (RH = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.64, 0.93). During follow-up, frequent attenders were more likely to stop smoking, increase exercising, increase social contacts, and stay married. CONCLUSIONS: Lower mortality rates for frequent religious attenders are partly explained by improved health practices, increased social contacts, and more stable marriages occurring in conjunction with attendance. The mechanisms by which these changes occur have broad intervention implications."
16140897,0,a,"Whether the determinants of linear growth can have independent effects beyond the critical infancy period has been questioned. This research uses uniquely suited data from >2000 youths from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Study in the Philippines to examine the association between diet and height in the postinfancy period. Anthropometric, diet, and other data were collected bimonthly from 0 to 2 y, and at the mean ages of 8, 11.5, 15.5, and 18.5 y. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to quantify the mean effects of diet diversity and energy intake on height across increments demarcated by the postinfancy data (2-8.5, 8.5-11.5, 11.5-15.5, and 15.5-18.5 y). We examined whether the effects differed by socioeconomic status (SES) and age. Effects with P < 0.05 were considered significant. Each additional unit of diet variety (range 0-8 U) was associated with a significant 0.33-cm increase in height in boys. Each additional 100 kcal (4186 kJ) was associated with significant increases in height of 0.05 cm in boys, and 0.02 cm in girls. Significant interactions (P < 0.15) with SES showed that each 100 kcal increase in energy intake was associated with a 0.08-cm increase in height at low SES with no difference at high SES. In both boys and girls, the effects of energy intake decreased with age, as shown by a significant age interaction (P < 0.15). The methods used incorporate the longitudinal nature of the data to offer a unique examination of the association between diet and height in the postinfancy period."
9514067,1,a,"We analysed determinants of risk of cervical cancer in women aged less than 45 years using data from a case-control study conducted in Italy. Cases were 261 women aged < 45 years with histologically confirmed invasive cervical cancer. Controls were 257 women aged < 45 years, with acute, non-neoplastic conditions, judged to be unrelated to any of the known or suspected risk factors for cervical cancer. In comparison with women reporting one or no sexual partner, the multivariate odds ratio (OR) of cervical cancer was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.3-4.6), for women reporting two or more sexual partners, and, in comparison with women reporting their first intercourse at 17 years of age or before, the multivariate OR was 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-0.9) in women aged > or =23 years at first intercourse. The risk of cervical cancer was higher in parous women and increased with number of births (OR = 8.1 for three or more births). Among parous women the risk tended to increase with later age at last birth; in comparison with parous women reporting their last birth before age 25, the OR was 1.9 in those reporting their last birth at > or =35 years. No clear association emerged between oral contraceptive use, smoking, education, social class and risk of cervical cancer."
17391344,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have highlighted the prevalence, severity and persistence of the disability associated with bipolar disorder (BPD). Reliable instruments are needed to support research into the factors associated with disability and treatment response. Contextual factors (e.g., availability of supported employment programs) can affect functionality, posing a challenge to such investigations. We present preliminary findings regarding the validity of the Multidimensional Scale of Independent Functioning (MSIF) in BPD. The MSIF provides discrete ratings of support separate from both role responsibility and performance quality in work, residential and educational environments. These distinctions allow the 'correction' for variability explained by contextual factors that allows the comparison of studies conducted in different environments and time. METHODS: Participants with BPD were administered the MSIF, the Social Adjustment Scale II (SAS-II) and an interview recording objective data regarding work, school and residential activities as part of an ongoing longitudinal study of BPD disability. RESULTS: Construct validity estimated using standardized Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.76 (n = 58). MSIF global ratings were significantly lower (reflecting higher functionality) for subjects engaged in productive activity compared with participants who were not active (t = -3.6, p = 0.001) demonstrating external validity. Inter-rater reliability estimates ranged from 0.86 to 0.99 (n = 49). Significant, high correlations were demonstrated between comparable MSIF and SAS-II global ratings (criterion validity = 0.70-0.79) and low correlations were found between non-comparable ratings (discriminant validity = -0.07 to -0.35) (n = 14). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the MSIF is a valid and reliable instrument optimally designed for studying determinants of disability and treatment response in BPD."
19231726,0,a,"Interventions implemented by governments are very frequently related to the determinants of health. Health impact assessment (HIA) is used as a predictive tool to include health in nonhealth policymaking. This paper defines HIA, describes its methods, procedures and applications, and discusses opportunities and challenges associated with HIA. Doing a HIA implies studying the intervention, profiling the target population, and estimating its impacts on health by means of combining quantitative and qualitative evidence. HIA has been used in different kinds of policies (transports, urban regeneration, culture, energy development etc.), at different levels (local, national, European) and in many countries. Despite its scarce use in Spain, HIA allows to consider health in sectorial policymaking, taking into account social inequalities in health, so that healthier public policies can be designed. On the other hand, HIA is a tool under methodological development which use is hindered due to the existing narrow biomedical perspective on the determinants of health, and to the difficulties in working in public policy-making with multisectorial and participative perspectives."
15793014,0,a,"Community-academic partnerships in the training of doctors offer unique learning opportunities of great importance. Such partnerships can induce a paradigm shift such that physicians view community as a teaching resource and partner rather than as a passive recipient of services or solely as a placement site. The authors describe a model of a community-academic partnership in New York City, begun in 1995, in which, for training and service, pediatric residents are integrally involved in a community-based program. Principles adapted from the Community-Campus Partnerships for Health's principles of partnership provide a framework for portraying the essential elements of developing and maintaining the partnership. The authors explain the clashes that may arise between partners and show how the principles of partnership guide partnership members in working and learning within a setting that by its nature entails conflict and inequality. This report is based on the knowledge gained from the structured reflections of both members of this partnership: the residency program at a large academic health center and the community-based social service organization. Such partnerships provide the training ground for the development of physicians who understand the social and cultural determinants of health and constructively use community agencies' input in promoting child health and well-being. Within this framework, community-based organizations are not solely service providers but become educators of physicians-in-training who, with new knowledge gained through the partnership, more effectively contribute to the overall health of the communities they serve."
8409134,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine and compare the food preferences of patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with those of age- and sex-matched controls. DESIGN: We administered two questionnaires, one assessing preferences for 88 food items (according to a nine-point hedonic scale) and the other assessing factors influencing dietary habits. SUBJECTS: Thirty-three patients on HD, 17 patients on CAPD, and 30 control subjects with normal renal function. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 88 foods were grouped into 14 classes to compare preferences. Taste aversions, food preparation details, and psychological and social determinants of food intake were also compared. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The preference ratings of the HD, CAPD, and control groups were compared using analysis of variance. The dietary habits results were examined using a chi 2 analysis. RESULTS: Sweet foods (P = .002), vegetables (P = .003), red meats (P = .010), and fish and poultry (P = .015) were less pleasant for patients on HD than for control subjects. Red meats (P = .019), fish and poultry (P = .032), and eggs (P = .005) were less pleasant for patients on HD than for patients on CAPD. Red meat was the most unpopular food group for all dialysis patients. The most common factor affecting dietary intake was a loss of interest in food and/or cooking. CONCLUSION: We conclude that chronic renal failure influences patients' food preferences and food habits. Knowledge of these preferences will help dietitians plan more adequate and enjoyable diets for such patients."
11728789,0,a,"Excessive alcohol consumption and related problems are common among clients in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), yet relatively little is known about the psychological and social determinants of alcohol-related attitudes and behaviors during treatment. This study reports on the prevalence of alcohol dependence, patterns of alcohol consumption and preliminary findings about clients' beliefs that they will change their drinking behavior in the future. Data were gathered from personal interviews with 66 clients attending a MMT program in South London (some 80.5% of the eligible caseload). Forty-one percent of the overall sample met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence in the past 12 months. Among clients who reported drinking in the past month (n = 50), 54% were classified as dependent, and these clients reported consuming an average of 23.5 UK standard units of absolute alcohol (188g/6.58 ounces) on a typical drinking day in the past month. Exploratory analyses suggested that expectations to change drinking behavior were predicted by subjective norms (social pressures), perceived functions of alcohol use, past drinking levels and current dose of methadone. Clinicians engaged in alcohol problems assessment and counseling during MMT could usefully examine these influences to strengthen treatment provision."
16510888,0,a,"Affective factors are likely to play a major role in determining the extent to which offenders are able to engage with, and benefit from, treatment. In this article, it is argued that the relationship between affect and treatment engagement may be understood in three ways: the access the client has to emotional states, the ability to express such states, and the willingness of the client to do this in the therapeutic session. It is suggested that affective determinants of treatment readiness can be understood with reference to models of emotional regulation and that attention to these affective factors in the early stages of treatment is likely to promote engagement, reduce attrition, and consequently improve treatment outcomes for violent offenders."
8930590,1,a,"The purposes of this survey were to describe dental health in a group of alcoholics and to analyze the influence of social background, dental health behavior and alcohol-related variables on dental health among alcoholics. The dental health in a group of consecutively admitted alcoholics (n = 195) was described with respect to number of teeth present, DMFS, DS and the prevalence of dental erosion, removable dentures, edentulousness, and untreated dental decay. No major differences were found with respect to number of teeth and dental caries (DMFS), when compared to reference figures of the general population. As to untreated decay, however, 3-5 x more actual decayed surfaces were found among the alcoholics. In the multivariate analyses, neither DMFS, nor untreated decay were found to be associated with alcohol-related indicators. These variables were, however, related to variables of social background and dental health behavior. As to number of teeth present, an association was found with duration of alcoholism, but this relationship was eliminated, when the analysis was controlled with respect to social situation. In contrast, dental erosion was related to duration of alcoholism irrespective of confounding control of dental health behavior and social situation. Hence, the study indicates that oral health in alcoholics can be explained mainly by social situation and dental health behavior and not by variables associated directly with alcohol consumption. An exception was the presence of dental erosion, which was associated with the exposure to alcohol."
8666516,1,a,"Establishing causal relationships has been and is today a matter of debate in epidemiology. The observational nature of epidemiological research rends difficult the proving of these relationships. Related to this, different models and causal criteria have been proposed in order to explain health and disease determinants, from pure determinism in Koch postulates, accepting unicausal explanation for diseases, to more realistic multicausal models. In occupational health it is necessary to formulate causal models and criteria to assess causality, and frequently causal assessment in this field has important social, economic and juridical relevance. This paper deal with evaluation of causal relationships in epidemiology and this evaluation is illustrated with a recent example of an occupational health problem in our milieu: the Ardystil case."
10067904,1,a,"Analysis of vital statistics for the Czech Republic between 1986 and 1993, including 3,254 infant deaths from 350,978 first births to married and single women who conceived at ages 18-29 years, revealed a neonatal survival advantage for low-weight infants born to disadvantaged (single, less educated) women, particularly for deaths from congenital anomalies. This advantage largely disappeared after the neonatal period. The same patterns have been observed for low-weight infants born to black women in the United States. Since the Czech Republic had an ethnically homogenous population, virtually universal prenatal care, and uniform institutional conditions for delivery, Czech results must be attributed to social rather than to biologic or medical circumstances. This strengthens the contention that in the United States, the black neonatal survival paradox may be due as much to race-related social stigmatization and consequent disadvantage as to any hypothesized hereditary influences on birth-weight-specific survival."
16195472,0,a,"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of psychological distress (PD) and its determinants in under-privileged women in the outskirts of Beirut, Lebanon. A cross-sectional survey of 1,869 ever-married women aged 15-59 was carried out. PD levels were determined using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (Appendix). Health status, living conditions, social support, and physical symptoms as reported by women were recorded. Logistic regression was used to test the independent effect of each variable on PD. 46.6% of women had PD. Psychologically distressed women had more children, less education, lower income, less social support, an uncomfortable relationship with their husband, participated in the labor force and were more likely to reside in a predominantly Moslem community. Reporting a health or living problem were significant predictors of PD. The presence of limb, back and stomach pain, and headache were associated with PD. Compared to similar populations in other countries, our sample had a high prevalence of mental distress."

1558650,1,a,"The purpose of the current research was to identify demographic and psychosocial factors important in the decision to breastfeed among a sample of WIC participants in a rural area. One hundred and ninety-eight women completed both a prenatal interview during their third trimester of pregnancy and a second interview within one to three weeks postpartum. Twenty-seven percent of these WIC participants initiated breastfeeding. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that prenatal behavioral beliefs about the consequences of breastfeeding and formula feeding were the strongest predictors of breastfeeding initiation. The results suggest that education to improve the current low rates of breastfeeding among WIC participants should emphasize that formula feeding is neither more convenient nor easier than breastfeeding, and that breastfeeding need not limit mothers in public or social settings."
8180289,1,a,"The concerns of relatively powerless groups may not be adequately addressed by health-care decisions based on market forces and on considerations of the general population. Calculations of the number of Navajo women at risk of unintended pregnancy suggest that several hundred such pregnancies would have occurred as a result of the withdrawal of intrauterine devices from the United States' market. Analysis of birthrate data confirms this estimate: approximately four to five percent of Navajo births in 1988 may have been due to this market withdrawal. Available data are limited in their ability to assess impacts on small groups of health-policy decisions made for the population as a whole. A mechanism for surveilling such effects needs to be established to protect the interests of such groups, particularly when they have restricted alternatives."
18257061,0,a,"We analyzed the nutritional status of urban and rural schoolchildren from Mendoza (Argentina), but avoided rural and urban categorization by generating subpopulations as a function of their socioenvironmental characteristics. We transformed weight and height data into z-scores using the CDC/NCHS growth charts; defined underweight, stunting, and wasting by z-scores of less than -2 SD; and calculated overweight and obesity, according to the cutoff proposed by the International Obesity Task Force. Socioenvironmental characteristics included housing, public services, parental resources, and farming practices; we processed these variables by categorical principal-component analysis. The two first axes defined four subgroups of schoolchildren: three of these were associated with urban characteristics, while the remaining subgroup was considered rural. Nutritional status differed across groups, whereas overweight was similar among the groups and obesity higher in urban middle-income children. Urban differences were manifested mainly as underweight, but rural children exhibited the greatest stunting and wasting. Thus, the negative effects of environment on nutritional status in children are not restricted to poor periurban and rural areas, though these are indeed unfavorable environments for growth: some urban families provide children with sufficient quantity and diversity of foods to expose them to obesity. By contrast, the more affluent urban families would appear to have greater possibilities for allowing their children to adopt a healthy life-style. Although the causes of differences in nutritional status between middle- and high-income urban groups are not clear, these determinants probably involve economic as well as educational influences."
15715914,0,a,"BACKGROUND: About half of all newly presented episodes of shoulder complaints (SC) in general practice are reported to last for at least six months. Early interventions aimed at the psychological and social determinants of SC are not common in general practice, although such interventions might prevent the development of chronic SC. The Education and Activation Programme (EAP) consists of an educational part and a time-contingent activation part. The aim of the EAP is to provide patients with the proper cognitions by means of education, and to stimulate adequate behaviour through advice on activities of daily living. DESIGN: The article describes the design of a randomised clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an EAP in addition to usual care, compared to usual care only, in the prevention of chronic SC after six months. It also describes the analysis of the cost and effect balance. Patients suffering from SC for less than three months are recruited in general practice and through open recruitment. A trained general practitioner or a trained therapist administers the EAP.Primary outcome measures are patient-perceived recovery, measured by self-assessment on a seven-point scale, and functional limitations in activities of daily living. Questionnaires are used to study baseline measures, prognostic measures, process measures and outcome measures. DISCUSSION: The inclusion of patients in the study lasted until December 31st 2003. Data collection is to end in June 2004."
17170020,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Parent child relationships and parenting processes are emerging as potential life course determinants of health. Parenting is socially patterned and could be one of the factors responsible for the negative effects of social inequalities on health, both in childhood and adulthood. This study tests the hypothesis that some of the effect of socioeconomic risk on health in mid childhood is transmitted via early parenting. METHODS: Prospective cohort study in 10 USA communities involving 1041 mother/child pairs, selected at birth at random with conditional sampling. EXPOSURES: income, maternal education, maternal age, lone parenthood, ethnic status and objective assessments of mother child interaction in the first 4 years of life covering warmth, negativity and positive control. OUTCOMES: mother's report of child's health in general at 6 years. Modelling: multiple regression analyses with statistical testing of mediational processes. RESULTS: All five indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) were correlated with all three measures of parenting, such that low SES was associated with poor parenting. Among the measures of parenting maternal warmth was independently predictive of future health, and among the socioeconomic variables maternal education, partner presence and 'other ethnic group' proved predictive. Measures of parenting significantly mediated the impact of measures of SES on child health. CONCLUSIONS: Parenting mediates some, but not all of the detectable effects of socioeconomic risk on health in childhood. As part of a package of measures that address other determinants, interventions to support parenting are likely to make a useful contribution to reducing childhood inequalities in health."
7959400,1,a,"The main determinants of rehospitalization of elderly people were studied with a longitudinal sample of 264 persons older than 60 years at a midwestern, urban, university-affiliated hospital. Path analysis was applied to survey data collected for this study. Seventeen percent of subjects were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Controlling for health and socioeconomic factors, the main determinant of readmission was the discharge placement; those placed back into the community for care in the home were more likely to be rehospitalized than those discharged to institutions. Contrary to predictions in the literature and the authors' expectations, patient involvement in discharge planning had no discernible effect on placement decisions and subsequent hospitalization. The implications of these findings for discharge planning by social workers are discussed."
10514157,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which observed associations at population level between income inequality and mortality are statistical artefacts. DESIGN: Indirect ""what if"" simulation by using observed risks of mortality at individual level as a function of income to construct hypothetical state level mortality specific for age and sex as if the statistical artefact argument were 100% correct. SETTING: Data from the 1990 census for the 50 US states plus Washington, DC, were used for population distributions by age, sex, state, and income range; data disaggregated by age, sex, and state from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used for mortality; and regressions from the national longitudinal mortality study were used for the individual level relation between income and risk of mortality. RESULTS: Hypothetical mortality, while correlated with inequality (as implied by the logic of the statistical artefact argument), showed a weaker association with states' levels of income inequality than the observed mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations in the United States at the state level between income inequality and mortality cannot be entirely or substantially explained as statistical artefacts of an underlying individual level relation between income and mortality. There remains an important association between income inequality and mortality at state level over and above anything that could be accounted for by any statistical artefact. This result reinforces the need to consider a broad range of factors, including the social milieu, as fundamental determinants of health."
9690286,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This work was aimed at identifying differences in HIV and HCV risk behaviors among intravenous drug users (IDUs) according to the gender and their determinants. METHODS: IDUs over 18 years, having had sexual intercourse and able to answer the questionnaire were interviewed in 10 drug abuse treatment centers or social institutions using a questionnaire adapted from the one used in the survey of sexual lifestyle in France. RESULTS: Over 612 eligible IDUs, 595 completed the questionnaire (women: 29%);37% had multiple partners with no difference according to the gender; 14% of the women and 7% of the men reported trading sex. More women reported inconsistent condom use (46% vs. 55%) and inconsistent clean equipment use (65% vs. 73%). A younger age, independently associated to sharing equipment (men: OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.90-0.99; women: OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.85-0.99) and inconsistent HIV serology testing, independently associated to inconsistent condom use (men: OR = 3.36; 95% CI = 2.02-5.60; women: OR = 10.72; 95% CI = 3.18-36.18), were the only risk markers common to both genders. For women, being HIV negative increased the risk of inconsistent condom use. Low educational level increased the risk of inconsistent clean equipment use. No risk marker among those analyzed was associated to having had multiple partners. For men, low socioeconomic status markers, a steady sexual partner or not living in couple and educational level were associated with sexual risk behaviors (inconsistent condom use and having multiple partners); low socioeconomic status markers were associated with injecting risk behaviors (inconsistent clean equipment use and sharing). CONCLUSIONS: Women were more likely to have both sexual and injecting risk behaviors; their significant risk markers are less numerous thus harm reduction could be more difficult than for men."
10064934,1,a,"All 151 patients registered at a palliative home care facility in Sollentuna from its inception in 1995 to the end of 1997 were studied to identify factors contributing to the patients' possibility of dying at home. Of those registered, 117 had died by the end 1997, 69 at home, 40 at a hospice, seven at emergency facilities, and one abroad. Comparison of those who died at a hospice and those who died at home showed no significant differences to exist between the two subgroups in age, gender, diagnosis, stage of disease, degree of symptom control, or treatment given. Psychosocial factors were the most important determinants of whether the patients died at home. The availability of psychological support for family members, and access to a hospital bed when they needed to relax, were also important factors, as were patient and family consent to home care."
26815750,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Due to remarkable improvements in emergency and intensive care medicine in the recent past, the mortality rate for severely injured patients is decreasing. Outcome research therefore should no longer focus only on questions of survival, but also on aspects of the quality of life after severe trauma. This study examined the long-term effect of different sociodemographic, economic, trauma, and hospital-related factors on the health-related quality of life (SF-36) of severely injured patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A written questionnaire was sent to 121 trauma patients who received treatment in two hospitals in Cologne/Northrhine-Westfalia between 1996 and 2001. The inclusion criteria were more than one injury and a sum of abbreviated injury score of the two worst injuries >/= 6. The response rate after using the total-design-method was 77.6% (n = 90). RESULTS: Severely injured patients showed significant reductions for all subscales of the SF-36, on average 4 years after discharge on average, in comparison to a German norm population. Specifically, aspects of the physical-component scale were dramatically reduced. Linear regressions controlling for time after discharge suggested that higher age, lower socioeconomic status, living together with a partner, and the severity of trauma and injury of extremities were significant predictors for a reduced quality of life, while satisfaction with the hospital stay had a positive effect. DISCUSSION: All in all, it is important to identify trauma- patients who will suffer a reduced quality of life. In so doing, it will be possible to take into account the specific circumstances of their recovery during medical treatment, care, and rehabilitation."
2236478,1,a,"Judgement is central to the practice of medicine and occurs between making clinical observations and taking clinical decisions. Clinical judgment analysis has developed as a method of making statistically firm models of doctors' judgments. Computed models reveal the differential importance attached to items of clinical, social, or other data which are determinants of clinical decisions. These models can both reveal the causes of conflicts of judgment and may help resolve them in a way that unaided discussion cannot. Revealing experts' models to students speeds learning of diagnostic skills. Clinical judgment analysis offers a method of probing the judgments not just of students and doctors but also of patients who have shown systematic differences in their perceptions of risk and benefit. The power and relevance of clinical trials can be improved by the consistent application of judgment policies generated from both the trialists and those who will use their results."
18673067,0,a,"This study used qualitative methods to explore the social and psychological context of sexual behavior and HIV risk among African American non-gay-identified men who have sex with men. Analysis of men's narratives on their sexual behaviors revealed four social and psychological factors contributing to risk for HIV infection: (a) a tendency to compartmentalize and personally disengage from same-sex behavior, (b) traditional gender roles that reinforce men's adherence to masculine images and ambivalent attitudes toward women, (c) cultural norms that favor secrecy and privacy about any personal matters, and (d) spontaneous and unplanned sexual episodes with other men. Findings indicate that innovative HIV prevention and risk reduction strategies are necessary to reach this group and question the legitimacy of conventional sexual orientation categories for these men. Interventions must address social contextual determinants of risk, reinforce men's public identifications as straight/heterosexual, and maintain men's need for privacy about same-sex behaviors."

1390784,1,a,"Sexuality is a fundamental quality of human life, important for health, happiness, individual development, and indeed for the preservation of the human race. During the dynamic period of adolescence in which the passage from childhood to maturity takes place, sexuality takes on new dimensions; feelings become more intense, relationships become more complex, and the consequences of sexual behavior are radically altered. This not only affects the behavior of young people but also of those who interact with them, their families and peers, and those who work in the health, education, youth, social welfare, and other sectors. In the contemporary world the conditions of life for many young people have also changed, and with it patterns of sexual behavior. In general, earlier puberty, later marriage, a decline in the family leading to less control and more autonomy, and intense exposure to sexual stimuli via the mass media and travel across cultural boundaries have made pre-marital adolescent sexual activity more common. This has added to traditional problems of early marriage, newer problems of early pregnancy, childbirth, and induced abortion outside of marriage, sexually transmitted diseases, and human immunodeficiency syndrome infection leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. But the work of the World Health Organization (WHO), along with many others in the field, strongly suggests that given appropriate information and services, trust and equity between the sexes, young people will behave responsibly and well. In this paper some of the findings from methods developed by WHO for research, training, advocacy, and evaluation, and findings in relation to patterns and determinants of sexual and reproductive health and development will be described, and future directions suggested."

PARTICIPANTS: Student AINs, AINs, ENs and RNs from any of the eight hospitals. CONCLUSION: Framed within a critical social perspective it applies a theory of culture to understand the determinants of social divisiveness that was occurring between different levels of the nursing workforce. These results are further analysed within a theoretical discussion of culture and power in nursing."
8666086,1,a,"Of 1,327 children younger than two in 1986 whose mothers were participants in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 61% were wanted, 34% were mistimed and 5% were unwanted. Planning status is associated with the level of developmental resources the child receives at home: At ages one and older, mistimed and unwanted children score significantly lower on a scale measuring opportunity for skill development and on a scale measuring nonauthoritarian parenting style than their wanted peers; by preschool age, they also have significantly less-positive relationships with their mothers. Measures of the direct effects of planning status on development also indicate that mistimed and unwanted children are at a disadvantage: Those younger than two have higher mean scores for fearfulness than wanted infants and lower scores for positive affect; unintended preschoolers score lower on a measure of receptive vocabulary."
19828251,0,a,"Studies on the determinants of pain-related support are needed to enhance couples-based treatments for pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which pain catastrophizing and perceived entitlement to pain-related support (i.e., support entitlement) were associated with perceived and observed social support. Participants were 106 chronic pain couples recruited from the community. They completed surveys as well as an observational discussion task. Greater support entitlement in persons with pain was correlated positively with pain catastrophizing, punishing spouse responses, and observed spousal invalidation but negatively correlated with perceived spousal support, solicitous spouse responses, and observed validation. Catastrophizing was correlated with perceptions of general spousal support but not the other support variables. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that among persons with lower levels of support entitlement, catastrophizing was associated with greater solicitous spouse responses. Among those with a greater entitlement to support, catastrophizing was associated with greater punishing spouse responses and observed invalidation by the spouse. These results suggest that support entitlement plays an important role in couples' supportive interactions about pain. Continued research is needed to determine how a desire for pain-related attention and support and catastrophizing translate into behaviors that affect support provision and receipt."
10632790,0,a,"As the significance of social determinants of health has been revealed and the socio-environmental perspective of health promotion has become prominent, family nurses have attempted to move away from disease-treatment models of practice towards emancipatory, health promoting practice. This paper describes a multidisciplinary team's pedagogical experience of developing emancipatory family health promoting practices. The discussion includes a description of the significant educational processes that supported the development of health promoting family practice and an outline of the transformative changes the team members experienced as they evolved their health promoting practices."
7492816,1,a,"Psychosocial reluctance is a major obstacle to the success of mass screening. In France, several opinion polls demonstrated that the fear of cancer as a disease, the fear of a positive result and the fear of the possible therapeutic consequences were the major determinants opposed to screening despite information often known to the public. The psychological obstacles appear less important in the US population, except for minorities. Age seems to be a discriminating factor, indeed after 50 years, reluctance to screening is increased probably due to a generation effect influencing the meaning of the disease and the interest of screening. Site specific constraints also exist, in colorectal cancer, 30% of the people feel as an embarrassment the manipulation of the stools. If false positives are responsible for a supplementary anxiety, it doesn't last long and it doesn't influence the observation of future campaign. These psychosocial obstacles as a whole justify the need of converging information that must take into account cultural problems. The favourable influence of the general practitioner explains his essential role for the success of mass screening."
10429746,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Major life transitions (e.g., graduation from high school) are times when many changes occur in a person's social and physical environment. Men and women likely experience aspects of these changes differently. As a result, health-related behaviors likely change at these times with possible differences in these changes by gender. METHODS: Gender differences in the performance of chronic disease risk-related behaviors (fruit, juice, and vegetable intake; physical activity; tobacco and alcohol use; and sexual practices) through the transition out of high school (HS) were assessed in a secondary analysis of a nationally representative sample from the 1992 National Health Interview Survey-Youth Risk Behavior Survey. The survey was completed by 5881 young people aged 14 to 21 years. Regression discontinuity analysis with piecewise regression was performed. RESULTS: Statistically significant gender by transition effects were obtained for exercise/physical activity (decreases at the transition point for males), snuff use (decrease for females in HS), binge drinking and number of days drinking alcohol (increases for males at the transition point), and use of alcohol or drugs before sexual intercourse (decrease for females post HS). Fruit intake decreased for males and females and daily and heavy cigarette smoking increased during the HS years. Effect sizes were small but promising, given that the data set was not designed to test this hypothesis. CONCLUSION: These data offer evidence of differences by gender in chronic disease risk behaviors through the HS transition. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess the true nature of these differences, the tracking of these risk behaviors and their personal, social, and environmental determinants, including gender-specific determinants, that may explain these changes and inform future intervention development."
1774617,1,a,"The cognitive-developmental formulation of self-image disparity holds that an increasing disparity between the real and ideal self-image is due to (a) increasing differentiation of the real from the ideal self with maturity and (b) the increased capacity for incorporation of social mores with a greater propensity for guilt as a result. Guilt and self-image disparity were assessed in 47 young adults in Study 1, and in 108 children, of varying intellectual abilities, in the 5th, 8th, and 11th grades in Study 2. In both studies, guilt was related to self-image disparity. At all age levels, guilt was related to a higher ideal self-image. Guilt was related to a higher real self-image among 5th graders, but not among older individuals. Brighter children had a higher ideal self-image, greater self-image disparity, and marginally more guilt than children of average intellectual abilities. Guilt and self-image disparity were not related to grade level. The pattern of findings indicated that self-image is influenced by both cognitive-developmental and experiential determinants."
20025778,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Substantial empirical evidence has demonstrated that individuals who are socially isolated or have few positive social connections seem to age at a faster rate and have more chronic diseases. Oxytocin is a neurohypophyseal hormone hypothesized to coordinate both the causes and effects of positive social interactions, and may be involved in positive physiological adaptations such as buffering the deleterious effects of stress and promoting resilience. The proposed research will examine whether and how oxytocin influences responses to stress in humans and will consider effects in relation to those of social support. METHODS/DESIGN: Experimental research will be used to determine whether exogenously administered oxytocin (intranasal) influences psychological and physiological outcomes under conditions of stress across gender and age in adulthood. Hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Oxytocin ameliorates the deleterious neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and subjective effects of stress; 2) Oxytocin and social support have similar and additive stress-buffering effects; 3) Oxytocin effects are stronger in women versus men; and 4) Oxytocin effects are similar across a range of adult ages. Hypotheses will be tested with a placebo-controlled, double-blind study using a sample of healthy men and women recruited from the community. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either oxytocin or placebo. They undergo a social stress manipulation with and without social support (randomly assigned), and outcome measures are obtained at multiple times during the procedure. DISCUSSION: Understanding the determinants of healthy aging is a major public health priority and identifying effective measures to prevent or delay the onset of chronic diseases is an important goal. Experimental research on oxytocin, social relationships, and health in adulthood will contribute to the scientific knowledge base for maximizing active life and health expectancy. At conclusion of the study we will have solid evidence concerning the effects of oxytocin on stress response and whether it has similar effects across age and gender groups. A neurobiological understanding of resilience can inform efforts for both prevention and intervention of diseases or problems common in later life."
19027442,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study was to examine the need for psychosocial support in a consecutive sample of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). Out of an initial sample of 250 patients, 239 patients could be assessed at the beginning of their RT. Two hundred eight patients were reassessed at the end of RT 4-8 weeks later. METHODS: Measures comprised the Hornheide Screening Instrument, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, the Resilience Scale, and the Short Form 12 as a measure of health-related quality of life (QoL). Medical and radiological data were continuously registered. RESULTS: Within the sample, the need for psychosocial support as reflected in the screening instrument was high (>70%). Patients with the need for psychosocial support revealed significantly higher fatigue scores than patients who where not identified as needing psychosocial support. Furthermore, a negative correlation of the need for psychosocial support and QoL as well as resilience could be observed. QoL turned out to be the strongest predictor for the need of psychosocial support. CONCLUSION: The study confirmed that the need for psychosocial support is an important aspect in the treatment of cancer patients undergoing RT, which appeared to be powerfully predicted by the patients' health-related QoL. Fatigue turned out to be an important illness- and treatment-related factor that affects QoL. Psychological interventions for cancer patients should explicitly focus on decreasing patients' fatigue and increasing their resilience, thus improving their QoL."
1444596,1,a,"The body burden of cadmium, as estimated from 24-h urine cadmium levels, was determined in 1,523 subjects who were not occupationally exposed and who lived in five areas of Belgium. Urinary cadmium levels differed significantly with place of residence. These differences persisted after standardization for the other significant determinants (i.e., age, body mass index, smoking habits, social class, alcohol consumption, and menopause). The highest 24-h urine cadmium levels were found in subjects who lived in areas that contained cadmium-polluted soils. The body burden overload has been attributed mainly to the consumption of locally grown vegetables and the use of contaminated well water for cooking and drinking. Blood cadmium levels were also dependent on place of residence. However, the geographical differences in blood cadmium did not parallel those of urine cadmium. Blood cadmium is more influenced by recent exposure; therefore, this latter observation might reflect the recent implementation of preventive measures in some areas."
17371603,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Subjective risk factor perception is an important component of the motivation to change unhealthy life styles. While prior studies assessed cardiovascular risk factor knowledge, little is known about determinants of the individual perception of stroke risk. METHODS: Survey by mailed questionnaire among 1483 participants of a prior public stroke campaign in Germany. Participants had been informed about their individual stroke risk based on the Framingham stroke risk score. Stroke risk factor knowledge, perception of lifetime stroke risk and risk factor status were included in the questionnaire, and the determinants of good risk factor knowledge and high stroke risk perception were identified using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Overall stroke risk factor knowledge was good with 67-96% of the participants recognizing established risk factors. The two exceptions were diabetes (recognized by 49%) and myocardial infarction (57%). Knowledge of a specific factor was superior among those affected by it. 13% of all participants considered themselves of having a high stroke risk, 55% indicated a moderate risk. All major risk factors contributed significantly to the perception of being at high stroke risk, but the effects of age, sex and education were non-significant. Poor self-rated health was additionally associated with high individual stroke risk perception. CONCLUSION: Stroke risk factor knowledge was high in this study. The self perception of an increased stroke risk was associated with established risk factors as well as low perception of general health."
17450311,0,a,"Individual and family factors have been hypothesized to influence adolescent sexual behavior, but the extent to which this is true for adolescents in Jamaica as a whole and for those in rural areas in particular, has not been well studied. The objective of this study was to identify individual and family factors associated with initiation of sexual activity before the age of 16 among rural adolescents in Jamaica. We analyzed data for 469 sexually experienced adolescents attending public high schools in the rural parish of Hanover. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict independent influences of these factors. The mean age at sexual debut was 11 years for boys and 15 years for girls. Early adolescent sexual activity was associated with liberal attitudes about negative sexual outcomes (OR = 1.96, 95%CI = 1.34-2.87) and first sexual partner not being a steady boyfriend or girlfriend (OR = 4.19, 95%CI = 1.62-10.84). Female gender (OR = 0.16, 95%CI = 0.07-0.36) and older age at time of survey were protective (OR = 0.40, 95%CI = 0.32-0.52). Girls who were early starters were more likely to have been initiated by partners who were not steady boyfriends. They also reported liberal attitude towards negative sexual outcomes. Boys were mainly influenced by liberal attitude towards negative sexual outcomes. Being older was protective for both genders. Considering the high rates of HIV and adolescent pregnancy in this population, reproductive health programs that attempt to delay age at first sex should begin early in primary school before adolescents become sexually active."
10790939,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine which socio-demographic factors, health-related behaviours and physical health conditions are associated with non-drinking, binge drinking and hazardous/harmful drinking in young Australian women. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from the baseline survey of 14,762 young women (aged 18-23 years) enrolled in the Women's Health Australia study in 1996. Associations between a range of drinking patterns and socio-demographic factors, health-related behaviours and health conditions were examined. RESULTS: Half the women were 'low intake' drinkers, a third 'rarely drank' and 9% were non-drinkers; however, 70% reported binge drinking with one-quarter of the binge drinkers doing so at least weekly. Non-drinkers were more likely than drinkers to be married, pregnant, non-smokers, born in non-English speaking countries, to live in the Northern Territory, and to have lower levels of education, employment, and private health insurance. 'Low intake/binge weekly' drinkers (12%) and 'hazardous/harmful' drinkers (5%) were more likely than 'low risk' drinkers to be unmarried; to live in shared accommodation, alone or with their parents; to live in rural or remote areas; to have ever had any sexually transmitted infection; to be current smokers or ex-smokers and to have used unhealthy weight-control practices. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm findings from other countries about the importance of social conditions as determinants of alcohol consumption by young women. IMPLICATIONS: Health promotion to reduce young women's alcohol consumption needs to be carefully targeted to take account of their demographies, living environments and beliefs."
16442195,0,a,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of cognitive functioning, psychopathology, and severity of extrapyramidal side effects on community outcome in a group of Greek outpatients with schizophrenia. Participants were 40 outpatients with schizophrenia (25 men). Social adjustment was assessed with the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Severity of symptoms of schizophrenia was measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS), and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS). Finally, a battery of neuropsychological tests was administered in order to assess the following cognitive domains: executive functioning/set shifting, executive functioning/inhibition, fluency, verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, attention, visuospatial ability, and psychomotor speed/visual scanning. Total scores on the QLS were significantly correlated with negative symptoms, parkinsonism, and performance on the fluency tasks. Interpersonal relations subscale was significantly related with negative symptoms and fluency. No significant relationship was found between the Instrumental Role Functioning subscale and the PANSS, ESRS, or any cognitive domain. Scores on the Intrapsychic Foundation subscale were significantly correlated with negative symptoms and fluency. Finally, scores on the Common Objects and Activities subscale were significantly related with severity of negative symptoms, parkinsonism and visual memory. Our findings suggest that severity of negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, especially performance on fluency tasks and visual memory, as well as parkinsonism, are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia."
8097476,1,a,"A major goal in assessing biological determinants of behavior lies in studying the effect(s) of rearing on the development of the central nervous system. Specifically, a series of neuroanatomic analyses have been undertaken to identify potential neuropathological changes seen in monkeys exposed to early social deprivation, which leads to profound psychopathology and inappropriate responses to stress. The animals used in this study were either raised with their mother and peers (socially reared) or raised without maternal/peer contact (socially deprived). Within this context, the distribution of tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and arcuate nucleus of rhesus monkeys was determined by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for dopamine-containing systems. Additionally, the distribution of corticotropin-releasing factor-containing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus was assessed immunohistochemically. The majority (97.5%) of dopaminergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus were parvicellular, with a small (2.5%), but consistently observed population of magnocellular neurons immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase. Within the arcuate nucleus, tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons were similar in morphology to the parvicellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus. Qualitative assessment of corticotropin-releasing factor-immunoreactive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus revealed a parvicellular population of neurons located in medial aspects of the nucleus, similar to what has been observed in the rat. Quantitative analysis revealed no differences in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase- and corticotropin-releasing factor-immunoreactive neurons between rearing conditions, suggesting that these neurons were not affected, in terms of overall cell counts, by the early environmental insult of social deprivation."
15770290,0,a,"In health care today, scientific and technological frontiers are expanding at unprecedented rates, even as economic and financial pressures shrink profit margins, intensify competition, and constrain the funds available for investment. Therefore, the world today has more economic, and social opportunities for people than 10 or 100 years since globalization has created a new ground somewhat characterized by rapid economic transformation, deregulation of national markets by new trade regimes, amazing transport, electronic communication possibilities and high turnover of foreign investment and capital flow as well as skilled labor. These trends can easily mask great inequalities in developing countries such as importation and spreading of infectious and non-communicable diseases; miniaturization of movement of medical technology; health sector trades management driven by economics without consideration to the social and health aspects and its effects, increasing health inequalities and their economic and social burden creation; multinational companies' cheap labor employment promotion in widening income differentials; and others. As a matter of fact, all these factors are major determinants of ill health. Health authorities of developing countries have to strengthen their regulatory framework in order to ensure that national health systems derive maximum benefit in terms of equity, quality and efficiency, while reducing potential social cost to a minimum generated risky side of globalization."
1492742,1,a,"Socio-cultural, biological, psychological and environmental determinants of health develop within the community. Therefore, any intervention aimed at promoting health must derive from and evolve within the community itself, with the participation of all its members, each of whom charged with a specific and well-defined role to play. Deep changes have occurred in modern society, as a consequence of industrialization and urbanization. This notwithstanding, the biological and social role of women in family management has remained unchanged, even after the spreading of female work. The community-based control of chronic and degenerative diseases calls for the acquirement of a lifestyle more suitable to maintaining health. To this purpose, women can be charged with the responsibility of carrying our activities aimed at improving scientific knowledge to the benefit of the whole community."
12293594,1,a,"""Beginning in 1993, Israel began importing large numbers of foreign workers, replacing its traditional Palestinian labor force. This article presents a descriptive history and theoretical analysis of the migration, placing it in the context of Israel's reliance on noncitizen labor from the occupied territories. Dual labor market theory is particularly helpful in analyzing labor migration to Israel, but only by also analyzing the determinants of state policy can we understand how these recent flows began. The Israeli case thus suggests a cumulative model of the initiation of labor migration flows: structural factors create a predisposition toward use of foreign labor, and political factors determine whether and how that predisposition will be actualized."""
19841546,0,a,"AIM: To assess the impact of socio-demographic and clinical variables on the oral hygiene and periodontal status in a sample of mentally disabled subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample comprised of 171 mentally disabled subjects attending a special school in Udaipur, India. Oral hygiene status was assessed by Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) and periodontal status by Community Periodontal Index. RESULTS: Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that the best predictors in the descending order for oral hygiene index were disabled sibling, medical diagnosis, IQ level, education of mother and father. Having Down syndrome, less educated parents, poor economic status and a disabled sibling were the most important predictors for poor periodontal status. CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlighted that the oral hygiene and periodontal status of the present study population is poor and was influenced by medical diagnosis, IQ level, disabled sibling, parent's level of education and economic status."
8189722,1,a,"A growing literature supports genetic contributions to familial resemblance for alcohol use characteristics, but few studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying alcohol use among older persons. We report patterns of alcohol use in a U.S. volunteer sample of 3,049 female and 1,070 male twins aged 50 to 96. Significant gender and age effects were found for self-report measures of current and lifetime alcohol use, with greater intake among males and current and lifetime abstinence more common among older participants. Comparisons with data obtained 4 years previously revealed high stability for quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption. Twin pairs with more frequent social contact tended to be more similar for lifetime and current alcohol use. Biometrical genetic modeling results indicate that use of alcohol is highly familial, with both genetic and shared environmental factors contributing to initiation of alcohol use among men and women. Among drinkers, however, the degree of twin resemblance for consumption behaviors is low to moderate and appears to be regulated by shared genes rather than shared environments. These data are consistent with a multidimensional process, suggesting that the determinants of whether one drinks in older age differ from those underlying how much or how often alcohol is consumed."
15552859,0,a,"The international congress called ""Birth Quality-Life Quality"" has been a key scientific event in Poland resulting in great changes in perinatal care. Improvements in the quality of care at maternity wards were not limited to purely medical issues. Attention became increasingly focused on psycho-social problems of women after parturition. Emphasis is now directed to support by the doctors and nurses and efforts to acquaint young mothers with the benefits of natural feeding, as well as to prepare them for taking good care of their child. Social support is seen as an important tool in the improvement of care over the mother and child. The present study has classified social support according to J. House as informational, emotional, instrumental and worthing. Informational support consists of methods to cope with specific problems that require delivery of information and teaching of new skills. Emotional support focuses on demonstrating care, winning trust and showing empathy. Instrumental support is reflected by delivery of goods or services to persons in need. Finally, worthing support aims at promoting self-esteem. The aim of this study was (1) to analyze the determinants of informational, emotional, instrumental and worthing support and to compare the needs for different types of support among primiparas and multiparas at an obstetrics ward with the rooming-in system; (2) to study correlations between availability and demand for social support; (3) to determine the expectations of patients as to sources of informational, emotional, instrumental and worthing support and as to methods and means used during delivery of informational support. The study was done in a group of 200 women giving birth at the Department of Obstetrics and Perinatology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin. A special questionnaire was developed to determine the needs for support. A modified Social Support Score was also used. It was found that the demand for all determinants of informational support was greater among primiparas than multiparas. In the lactation part, significant differences were noted for 25 determinants (Tab. 1). Similarly, significant differences were noted for 13 determinants of neonatal care and nursing (Tab. 2) and for 9 determinants of postpartum self-care (Tab. 3). A large demand for most determinants of emotional support was noted in the study and reference groups. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were revealed as to 3 determinants representing feeling of safety by the woman during hospitalization (Tab. 4). It was found that the demand for all determinants of instrumental support was greater among primiparas than multiparas (Tab. 5). There were no significant differences in worthing support needs (Tab. 6). Primiparas significantly more often expected informational and instrumental (p < 0.001), as well as emotional support (p < 0.05) (Tab. 7) in comparison to multiparas. The need for social support at a maternity ward was found to be independent of the available support (Tab. 8). The most frequently expected source of informational support is the nurse/midwife at the maternity ward, as well as the doctor at the ward and the outpatient unit. Worthing and instrumental support is usually expected of the husband and the family. The usual methods of delivering support include discussions, training, and demonstration. Brochures remain the preferred vehicle for delivering support (Tab. 9)."
11682918,0,a,"Given the longevity achievable with current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for persons with HIV infection, quality of life (QOL) has emerged as a significant medical outcome measure, and its enhancement as an important goal. This review highlights current knowledge about the relevance and complexity of physical, psychological, and social factors as determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infected persons. Existing data suggest physical manifestations, antiretroviral therapy, psychological well-being, social support systems, coping strategies, spiritual well-being, and psychiatric comorbidities are important predictors of QOL in this population. Health care professionals are encouraged to become familiar with the full spectrum of predictors of HRQOL, which may eventually contribute to the development of multiple entry points for interventions in promoting QOL in these patients. Identifying variables influencing QOL among diverse groups, particularly women, injection drug users, and adolescents, and designing effective interventions specific to the social and psychological well-being of HIV-infected individuals are areas for research."
9353675,1,a,"With a tenth of the labour force involuntarily out of work, unemployment has become an important element among the socioeconomic determinants of health in the rich countries. Unemployed men have an excess cancer mortality of close to 25% compared with that of all men in the labour force. The available data from various countries indicate that this excess risk is found both in periods when the unemployment rate is about 1% and in periods when it is about 10%. Furthermore, it persists long after the start of unemployment and it does not disappear when social class, smoking, alcohol intake, and previous sick days are controlled for. The excess cancer mortality comes mainly from lung cancer, and the increased risk of lung cancer does not disappear when social class and number of previous sick days are controlled for. Unemployment does not increase smoking, but unemployed men have a slightly higher smoking prevalence before unemployment. However, as the excess lung cancer risk among unemployed men remains after controlling for social class, it seems unlikely that it can be explained only by differences in smoking prior to unemployment."
11580765,0,a,"PURPOSE: Part of our research intended to explain ""Quality of Life"" (QoL) differences between people with epilepsy. To this end, a series of already existing generic and disease-specific health status measures were used. In this study, they were considered as determinants of people's QoL, whereas QoL itself was conceived as a general ""value judgment"" about one's life. METHODS: From the records of four outpatient clinics, 210 persons with epilepsy were randomly selected. During their visit to the outpatient clinic, they completed a questionnaire assessing, among other things, health perceptions and social and psychological functioning. Additional information about their medical and psychosocial status was gathered from the patient files. Data were analysed by using a hierarchical regression analysis. RESULTS: In decreasing order of importance, ""psychological distress,"" ""loneliness,"" ""adjustment and coping,"" and ""stigma perception"" appeared to contribute most significantly to the outcome QoL as judged by the patients themselves, regardless of their physical status. In the final model, none of the clinical variables (onset, seizure frequency, side effects of antiepileptic drugs) contributed significantly anymore to the patients' ""quality-of-life judgement."" Apparently the effect of other variables such as seizure frequency and health perceptions, medication and side effects, life fulfillment, self-esteem, and mastery is mediated by these variables. CONCLUSIONS: Because all of the variance in QoL of the patients was explained by the psychosocial variables included in this study, health professionals should be aware of the significance of the psychosocial functioning of the patients and the role it plays in the achievement of a good QoL. Both informal and professional support may be an adjunct to conventional treatment. In future research, this issue should be given high priority."
7983098,1,a,"This paper examines the effects of a child's place of birth, mother's education, region of residence and rural and urban residence on infant mortality in Nigeria between 1965 and 1979, using data from the 1981/82 Nigeria Fertility Survey. Infant mortality rates declined in all regions between 1965 and 1979. Children born in modern health facilities, irrespective of their mothers' place of residence, experienced significantly lower rates of infant mortality than those born elsewhere. Logistic regression analysis showed that all other variables tested were also significant, although some to a lesser degree. Efforts to reduce infant mortality in Nigeria should include policies that rectify rural and urban differentials in the distribution of health facilities and encourage their use."
10955383,0,a,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by obesity, nocturnal breathing abnormalities, arterial hypertension, and an increased number of cardiovascular events. Sympathetic activity is increased during nocturnal apneic episodes, which may mediate the cardiovascular complications of sleep apnea. We studied 15 male subjects with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and associated hypertension, 54 subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension, and 25 healthy normotensive men. Cardiovascular autonomic control was assessed using frequency domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) during a controlled breathing test and during orthostatic maneuver. Compared with normotensive and hypertensive groups, total power and low- and high-frequency components of HRV during controlled breathing were significantly (analysis of variance, p<0.0001) lower in the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. During the orthostatic maneuver, the change in total power of HRV was different between the 3 groups (analysis of variance, p = 0.004). The total power of HRV tended to increase in the normotensive (4.11+/-12.29 ms2) and in hypertensive (2.31+/-12.65 ms2) groups, but decreased (1.13+/-1.23 ms2) in the hypertensive group with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. According to multivariate regression analysis, age and sleep apnea were the major independent determinants of HRV. This study found that an abnormal response to autonomic nervous tests characterizes hypertension in overweight subjects with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This could be due to autonomic withdrawal or supersaturation of the end-organ receptors by excessive and prolonged sympathetic stimulation. Our results also show the reduced response of orthostatic maneuver and controlled breathing in the hypertensive group compared with the normotensive group."
1898500,1,a,"In Manitoba, Canada, a representative cohort of elderly individuals ages 65 to 84 (n = 3,573) were interviewed in 1971 and the survivors of this cohort were reinterviewed in 1983. This analysis assesses the determinants of successful aging--whether or not an individual will live to an advanced age, continue to function well at home, and remain mentally alert. Over 100 separate indicators of demographic and socio-economic status, social supports, health and mental status in 1971 were available as potential predictors of successful aging. Indicators of access to health care over the period 1970-82 and indicators of diseases over this period were also available as predictors. Those who aged successfully were shown to have greater satisfaction with life in 1983 and to have made fewer demands on the health care system than those who aged less well. Despite the large number of potential predictors of successful aging which were examined, only age, four measures of health status, two measures of mental status, and not having one's spouse die or enter a nursing home were shown to be predictive of successful aging."
18785182,0,a,"Individuals adapt to changes in their environment, such as food availability and temperature, by adjusting the amount of time spent in different behavioral activities. These adjustments in behavior should vary across age-sex class according to specific physiological and social needs. We studied the activity budgets of three social Japanese macaque groups inhabiting either vegetated or nonvegetated enclosures in order to compare the effects of access with vegetation, as both food and substrate on resting, feeding, grooming and moving activities over a 12-month period. Daily access to natural foods for monkeys in the vegetated enclosure seems to be largely responsible for the differences in daily time budgets of these three groups. Resting time in all three groups was longer than the time devoted to other activities. Resting and moving time in the two nonvegetated enclosures was significantly longer than in the vegetated enclosure. In contrast, feeding and grooming time was significantly longer in the vegetated enclosure. Seasonal variation in time spent feeding, resting and grooming was significantly effected by enclosure type. In all three enclosures, immatures, particularly females, spent more time feeding and moving, whereas adults spent more time resting. Significant monthly variation in time spent by age-sex class was noted only for feeding and resting. Interestingly, in the vegetated enclosure, time spent feeding on natural vegetation was equal to the amount of time spent feeding on provisioned food. This suggests that factors other than energetic and nutritional needs may be important determinants of the activity budget of the species. These results have important implications for the enrichment of captive primates and our understanding of the maintenance of activity patterns by primates in the wild."
12291886,1,a,"""Data on women from the British 1958 Cohort Study is used as evidence on the determinants of their labour force participation at age 33. A conventional cross-sectional model of full or part-time employment makes use of some longitudinal material not normally included in such models. Whether the woman made the hitherto customary break from employment at the time of the first maternity is included in recognition that this cohort was among the first generation to be offered Statutory Maternity Leave. Results suggest that the presence of children (still) inhibits full-time employment and raises the probability of part-time employment; that income effects on participation have continued to weaken while wage elasticity for full-time employment is high. Continuity of employment straight after childbearing raises the chances of subsequent full-time employment, but by no means guarantees it. Gains from maternity leave and other family friendly employment policies have been far from uniform."""
18160643,0,a,"Impulsive behavior and novelty seeking are dimensions of temperament that are behavioral determinants of risk for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and its neurocognitive endophenotypes, and variation in the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) explains at least a portion of the variance in the traits. To further characterize the dimensional phenotype associated with impulsiveness, adolescent male monkeys were evaluated using ecologically valid tests of impulsive approach and aggression in response to social or nonsocial stimuli; subsequently, a delayed response task was implemented to assess spatial working memory performance. Subjects were selected into this study based on their response to the social challenge task or by DRD4 genotype, resulting in three groups: low-impulsivity/common DRD4 allele, high-impulsivity/common DRD4 allele, or rare DRD4 allele. All animals acquired the delayed response task and could perform at near ceiling levels when a approximately 0 s delay version was imposed, but as delays were lengthened, high-impulsive animals, regardless of DRD4 genotype, made fewer correct responses than did low-impulsive subjects; an inverse relationship existed for working memory and impulsivity. Notably, impulsive behavior evoked by social and nonsocial stimuli explained overlapping and independent portions of the variance in working memory performance. CSF levels of monoamine metabolites did not significantly differentiate the high- and low-impulsive animals, although monkeys carrying the DRD4 rare allele tended to exhibit higher monoamine turnover. These data indicate that dimensions of impulsivity may impact on working memory performance in qualitatively similar ways but through different mechanisms."
8209391,1,a,"In recent years, increased focus on the quality of family planning and other reproductive health services has led to a better understanding of women's reproductive health needs and has drawn attention to program-client interactions as a critical and neglected dimension of program effort. In this article, the relevant methods and experience related to studying client-provider interactions within family planning programs in southern countries are reviewed. The policy relevance of this work is highlighted first by stressing the operational usefulness of examining what happens when people engage with service-delivery systems that offer family planning or reproductive health services. Subsequently, the content areas encompassed by program-client interactions are clarified by identifying manifest and latent dimensions and by distinguishing the variables that define these interactions from variables related to their determinants and consequences. Finally, a critical review of existing methods is presented, with examples of research and a discussion of ethical issues."
9577516,1,a,"BACKGROUND: It is hypothesised that, despite recent initiatives to improve asthma self-management including asthma education, detailed investigation of the sequence of events culminating in hospital admission will lead to the identification of important management errors and thus the likelihood that the majority of severe asthma attacks are preventable by currently available strategies, and that psychological, health care and socioeconomic factors are risk factors for such management errors. METHODS: A cross sectional study was undertaken of 138 patients aged 15-50 years admitted to hospital (general ward or intensive care unit) with acute severe asthma who were assessed within 24-72 hours of admission using a number of previously validated instruments. A detailed history of events of the attack was assessed against predetermined criteria for non or delayed use of oral corticosteroids and non or delayed use of emergency ambulance services. RESULTS: Subjects had evidence of severe chronic asthma and had acute severe asthma at presentation (n = 90, pH = 7.3 (0.2), PaCO2 = 7.2 (5.0) kPa) but duration of hospital stay was short (3.7 (2.6) days). Serious management errors occurred very frequently and most were deemed to have been made by the patient. Forward stepwise regression revealed that delayed or non-use of oral corticosteroids was predicted independently by lack of paying job (p = 0.02), high total use of inhaled beta agonists in the 24 hours before index admission (p = 0.04), loss of a job in the last year (p = 0.04), low frequency of use of oral corticosteroids in the last year (p = 0.06), concerns during the index attack about medical expenses (p = 0.07), and delay in the use of ambulance services (p = 0.05)--the model being responsible for 23% of the variance. Delayed or non-summoning of emergency ambulance services was predicted independently by total life events (p = 0.03), having something stolen in the last year (p = 0.003), panic during the index attack (p = 0.01), and concerns during the index attack about taking time off work (p = 0.07)--the model being responsible for 21% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that, despite recent educational advances, serious management errors are common in those admitted to hospital with acute severe asthma and that most management errors relate to patient self-management behaviour. Serious management errors are predicted by a variety of socio-economic and psychological factors. While the results of this study are consistent with the widely held view that most acute severe attacks are theoretically preventable, the challenge for the future is to change patients' behaviour in the face of considerable adverse socioeconomic and psychological factors."
23978888,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of admitted patients and the patterns of their service utilization over a decade from March 1988 to March 1998. METHODS: Prospective data compilation using a structured questionnaire, hospital records and follow-up observations at King Fahd Hospital of the University in Al-Khobar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 1366 patients (683 of each sex) had 2217 admissions in 10 years. By the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition criteria, 19.5% had schizophrenia, 15.2% bipolar disorder, 9.9% depressive episodes, 8.6% acute and transient psychotic disorders, 7.7% adjustment disorders and 7.6% dissociative disorders. Males were more frequently admitted for schizophrenia and females for mood and anxiety disorders. Most non-Arab expatriates were diagnosed as acute and transient psychotic, stress-related or dissociative disorders. Re-hospitalizations constituted 28% of all admissions. The mean length of stay was 25 days per admission and 41 days per patient. The overall bed occupancy rate was 84.9%. A subgroup of 16.9% of patients, mostly with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, consumed 62.3% of the bed occupancy. CONCLUSION: Gender and immigration were the main determinants of variance in patient characteristics, nosological distribution and pattern of service use. More beds are needed. Psycho-educational programs should be intensified to reduce the social stigma and societal intolerance to mental patients. Active family involvement improves compliance and might reduce re-hospitalization rates. Heavy service consumers should be transferred to long-stay facilities."
19077263,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The former soviet Republic of Armenia entered a turbulent and long-lasting economic transition when it declared its independence in 1991. This analysis sought to identify the determinants of poor self-rated health as an indirect measure of health status and mortality prognosis in an adult female population during a period of socio-economic transition in Armenia. METHODS: Differences in self-rated health in women respondents were analyzed along three main dimensions: social, behavioral/attitudinal, and psychological. The data used were generated from cross-sectional household health surveys conducted in Armavir marz in 2001 and 2004. The surveys utilized the same instruments and study design (probability proportional to size, multistage cluster sampling with a combination of interviewer-administered and self-administered surveys) and generated two independent samples of households representative of Armavir marz. Binary logistic regression models with self-rated health as the outcome were fitted to the 2001 and 2004 datasets and a combined 2001/2004 dataset. RESULTS: Overall, 2 038 women aged 18 and over participated in the two surveys (1 019 in each). The rate of perceived ""poor"" health was relatively high in both surveys: 38.1% in 2001 and 27.0% in 2004. The sets of independent predictors of poor self-rated health were similar in all three models and included severe and moderate material deprivation, probable and possible depression, low level of education, and having ever smoked. These predictors mediated the effect of women's economic activity (including unemployment), ethnicity, low access to/utilization of healthcare services, and living alone on self-rated health. CONCLUSION: Material deprivation was the most influential predictor of self-rated health. Thus, social reforms to decrease the gap between the rich and poor are recommended as a powerful tool for reducing health inequalities and improving the health status of the population."
8192221,1,a,"The author cites significant changes in the conduct of the psychiatric profession between the fourth and ninth decades of this century. Determinants of the changes included the impact of World War II, the National Mental Health Act of 1946, the evolution of multiple modes of psychotherapy, the move from a system of involuntary incarceration and treatment in public institutions to a voluntaristic and pluralistic system, the provision of public and private insurance support for office, outpatient, and inpatient psychiatric care, the resurgence of psychopharmacology, and the pursuit of research in biological and psychosocial fields. The social goals of the profession are also discussed."
7949275,1,a,"Social support is increasingly attracting interest in as a factor in epidemiological research of disease risks. However, at present, few methods for measuring social support that can be credited as having reliability and validity exist in Japan. Therefore a perceived social support scale was developed in relation to a population study of a town in Fukuoka prefecture. A method for measuring functional support from several external sources was designed consisting of a self-administered test provided with only two available response options--yes & no. Pretests were conducted twice in order to evaluate content validity and adjust the number of determinants and resulted in spouse, family members, and friends being selected to be primary sources of support. A factor analysis was applied to select 10 conditions with high internal consistency for each of the sources. Responses were scored 0 or 1, for 'no' or 'yes,' respectively. Subsequently each set of 10 variables was summed into an index ranking social support conditions for each of the three sources. The three highest ranking indicators from each of the respective sources were then integrated into a single comprehensive total social support score of the individuals. The inquiry method was applied on 277 adults, aged from 40 to 69 years, in the town. Intercorrelation between the indicators of support derived from the three sources was low and coefficients of reliability ranged from 0.892 to 0.978. The score of each set of the 10 variables were incorporated into a principal components analysis in order to determine factorial validity. All of the first factor loadings of the items measuring support from both spouse and family were greater than 0.7 and high eigenvalues were obtained. Therefore the methods applied to spouse and family were considered adequate to measure a given construct. The items measuring support from friends were divided into two factors, emotional support and tangible support."
10130406,1,a,"Hospitals face a paradigm shift: from planning service delivery to population-based community health planning. Comprehensive community health planning is a two-step process: assessment and action, in that order. Assessment identifies community problems and resources; action follows planning, which determines which of those problems should be addressed with which resources. This paper provides an overview of the community assessment process. The first challenge in launching a community health initiative is to identify and recruit partners drawn from the ranks of prominent community organizations, such as school boards, public health agencies, and elected officials. The best enlistment strategies are those that empower persons outside the hospital to take visible control. Defining the community is the first step in analyzing the community. It is important that everyone involved in the assessment process agree on the definition, which should take in those characteristics that make the community unique, including its social systems, environmental factors, and demographics. The next step in the process is developing a community health profile, a set of key community indicators or measures that will help you set priorities, document successes and failures, and monitor trends. There are a number of models available to consult in developing indicators, whether traditional, medically oriented determinants of health or broader parameters, such as housing and public safety. Criteria for selecting indicators include validity, stability and reliability, and responsiveness. Most indicators will be developed using secondary, or already existing, sources of data, such as census data, Medicare and Medicaid files, police records, and hospital admission and exit records. Conducting the community assessment involves putting together a list of problems to be solved and a list of available resources, both of which can be compiled using the same four-step process of gathering and analyzing data: obtaining community input, identifying problems already being addressed, consulting with professional experts, and analyzing existing data. Demographics are one way of analyzing data; another is using a ""community scoreboard"" that groups causal factors into four categories: lifestyle, environment, human biology, and health services. Once the community assessment is complete, planning and implementation of programs can begin. At the same time, it is essential to mobilize the community to support your initiative. Again, you must look beyond the hospital walls to build a constituency for change, to community leaders in education, employment, transportation and recreation, housing, and the physical environment, as well as health education and preventive services.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

16250705,1,a,"This study examined social cognitive and physical health factors that might explain variations in exercise adherence in a 3-month supervised exercise intervention for a group of mildly symptomatic, HIV-1 seropositive men and women. The social cognitive predictor variables were outcome expectations and self-efficacy. The physical health predictor variables included CD4+ cell counts, self-report inventories of physical symptoms, and physicians' examinations. Self-report inventories of physical symptoms were associated with physicians' examinations and combined into a composite measure of physical health. Criterion variables included exercise adherence rates, VO2max change, and status as a 'remainder' versus 'drop-out.' The composite measure of physical health emerged as a significant predictor of adherence rate and gave perfect prediction of remainers and a moderate prediction of dropouts. No significant associations were observed between the social cognitive predictors and adherence. Results suggest that for this population physical health status is a better predictor of exercise adherence than either perceived self-efficacy or outcome expectancy."
1753246,1,a,To evaluate the medical educational and functional determinants of employment after stroke a total of 204 Patients were assessed for functional changes during rehabilitation and after one year. Additionally the educational and social background of each patient was documented. One year after discharge from the rehabilitation unit 11.3% of the patients worked full-time and 2.7% part time. Another 14.7% had the decision pension versus employment still pending and 0.5% were classified as unemployed. 70.8% received regular retirement plan payments or disability pensions. Generally a similar level of functional capabilities can be observed after one year for working and non-working patients except for manual dexterity. Early admission to rehabilitation (within the first 12 weeks) favours return to work. A high school degree qualifying for university entrance and a well paid and better qualified profession as well are correlated with a higher percentage of patients regaining their employment. An other determining factor of employment after CVA is the physical requirement of the former work. Most of the working patients (92%) had been either transferred onto a job suited for an handicapped people or their work plan had been restructured accordingly.
12623523,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although behaviours regarded as unhealthy are widespread, behaving in an unhealthy manner in several respects is relatively uncommon. However, people with multiple unhealthy behaviours exist and their number is larger than expected if the behaviours were not related to each other. The aim of this study was to examine sociodemographic determinants of multiple unhealthy behaviours, with special reference to independent and combined effects of the determinants. METHODS: Data on unhealthy behaviours were derived from nationwide surveys among Finnish adults. The mean number of unhealthy behaviours practised on a daily basis and the probability of reporting three or four of these behaviours was examined across sociodemographic groups. RESULTS: Age, educational level and marital status predicted reporting of three or four unhealthy behaviours. Interactions were observed between education and age in both genders as well as between marital status and age in men and educational level and living area in women. Mean numbers of unhealthy behaviours showed similar patterns to having three or four unhealthy behaviours but few differences between the means were statistically significant and there were no interactions. CONCLUSION: The influence of each sociodemographic determinant on multiple unhealthy behaviours was relatively independent from the other sociodemographic determinants. As the effect of these determinants tends to be cumulative, engaging in multiple unhealthy behaviours is common in population subgroups with several unfavourable characteristics. In health promotion initiatives special attention should be paid to such population groups and their social circumstances."

These challenges are considered in three fields: biosecurity, surveillance systems and descriptive epidemiology techniques."
8510469,1,a,"Herbal pharmacoepidemiology concerns itself with herbal drug uses and effects in large numbers of people. This new methodology can make substantial contributions to our understanding of herbal drug markets. Not only can it improve the timely detection and the quantitation of adverse reactions to botanical medicines, it can also help us to recognize beneficial effects of herbal preparations. Moreover, it can increase our social and economic knowledge about herbal drugs by correlating the utilization patterns of these preparations to socially relevant determinants and prices. Since such studies may require an internationally accepted herbal drug classification, a special set of herbal classification codes is proposed, which is fully compatible with the so-called ATC-classification. This latter system is endorsed by the Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organization as the drug classification to be used in international pharmacoepidemiological studies."
2046408,1,a,"Although access to health services has improved considerably in the past two decades, there is growing concern about the locus of health care for the poor and ethnic minorities. In urban areas, in particular, the use of hospital outpatient departments and emergency rooms by the indigent has been increasing. This article examines the determinants of regular source of care and illuminates the ethnicity-poverty-health care nexus. The data set analyzed includes blacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and non-Hispanic whites residing in poverty areas in Chicago, IL. Multinomial logit analysis is used to estimate the likelihood of having a particular kind of regular source of care. The findings demonstrated considerable ethnic group differences. In particular, blacks tend to utilize hospital facilities as a result of past constraints and their current dependence on public insurance programs. Mexicans are the least likely to have a regular source of care due to social and cultural barriers such as language, migration status, and low community participation. The implications of social isolation associated with poverty are also examined and discussed."

The study revealed a very high level of reported problems, especially regarding pain and anxiety. The mean subjective assessment of health state was poor in comparison with results obtained in other (usually western) countries. Presence of major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases had an important impact on QL. Elevated blood pressure and unsatisfactory level of physical activity were the strongest factors deteriorating QL in the studied population. There is a need for implementing effective interventions in the society, especially in the area of prevention and management of hypertension and sedentary lifestyle."
8475428,1,a,"The shortage of empirical studies on socio-economic factors influencing demand for health care and inequalities across social groups is dramatic in the case of Italy. The present study aims at discussing these issues, although its results are to be considered mainly methodological, given the small dimension of the sample (n = 807). A survey was carried out in a 'qualitative' sample of 9 Local Health Units of different Italian regions. Attention was paid to report every 'illness episode', considered as a cause of demand for health services, within the reference period (4 weeks) in order to properly link health needs with utilization of health services and relative expenditure. The assessment of health status across social groups, using 4 different indicators, shows the weakest social groups as the most vulnerable. The same groups report higher per capita health services uses and expenditures than their morbidity conditions would require. Assuming equity to be defined as 'equal use for equal need' a particular use-need ratio is developed (i.e. health services used per illness episode) able to capture the 'intensity' of health services use and expenditure per need. The 'over-equity' towards the less favoured groups is interpreted as a possible accomplishment of the N.H.S. fundative goals. A structural model of determinants of health services utilization, carried out through the LISREL technique (R2 = 0.36), confirms the irrelevance of the social variables with respect to need variables."

14986809,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of low socioeconomic status indicators, specifically parental educational and occupational characteristics on neonatal health outcomes. METHODS: Analysis of 3372 newborn infants admitted to five National Collaborative Perinatal Neonatal Network centers (1 February 2000 to 31 January 2002). Outcomes included birth weight, gestational age, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and length of hospital stay. The independent effects of mother's education and occupation as well as father's occupation on health outcomes were assessed by means of stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 271 (8.0%) infants were of low birth weight, 306 (9.1%) were preterm, 410 (12.2%) had NICU admissions and 240 (7.1%) were hospitalized for more than a week. After adjusting for maternal gravidity, age, smoking during pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications, parental socioeconomic characteristics had no significant impact on low birth weight or preterm birth. NICU admission and prolonged hospitalization were significantly correlated with skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled paternal occupations. Illiterate mothers had nearly 3-5 times the risk of NICU admission and prolonged hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Both father's occupation and mother's education play an important role as determinants of neonatal morbidity characteristics."
19803115,0,a,"This study assesses the importance of customer-contact intensity at the service encounter level as a determinant of service quality assessments. Using data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, it shows that performance-driven human resources practices play an important role as determinants of employee customer orientation and service capability in both high-contact (outpatient healthcare) and low-contact (benefits claim processing) human service contexts. However, there existed significant differences across service delivery settings in the salience of customer orientation and the congruence between employee and customer perceptions of service quality, depending on the intensity of customer contact. In both contexts, managerial attention to high-performance work systems and customer-orientation has the potential to favorably impact perceptions of service quality, amplify consumer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency."
17278673,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To promote multiculturalism among grade school students through drama education. PARTICIPANTS: Grade 3-6 students (N = 665) from 6 targeted schools including lead-class students (n = 158) representing each school. SETTINGS: Elementary schools in Windsor-Essex County, Ontario, Canada. INTERVENTION: In this non-experimental design study, group discussions conducted with each lead class to explore students' understanding of multiculturalism were developed into an interactive drama performance and performed for all grades 3-6 students in their respective schools. A follow-up drama workshop was offered to each lead class one week after the drama performance. All students completed a 7-item questionnaire before and after the drama performance and after the drama workshop. Pre-test and post-test data collected were analyzed using T-test and ANOVA to determine the effects of drama education on students' attitudes toward multiculturalism. OUTCOMES: Statistical analysis at 0.05 significance level revealed that both the performance and the drama workshop heightened students' awareness of racism, and instilled cultural respect through ""talking with others"", ""accepting others"", and ""believing that they can make a difference"" in multiculturalism promotion. CONCLUSION: Drama education was an effective experiential tool for promoting multiculturalism in a school setting. The key to promoting inter-racial harmony is to respect and accept individual differences and to broaden the social determinants of health by providing culture safety care."
11128887,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the domain-specific quality of life (QOL), including physical, social and role functioning, mental health, vitality, bodily pain, and general health domains, and to assess QOL's clinical and sociodemographic correlates in patients who were disabled by ischemic stroke. DESIGN: One-year prospective study of an inception cohort of patients with first-ever brain infarction. SETTING: Stroke unit of a neurologic department of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Eighty-five consecutive patients (36 women, 49 men; mean age +/- SD, 65+/-12.5 yr) with first-ever stroke of a mild to moderate nature caused by brain infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were examined at 3 and 12 months poststroke. QOL was measured using the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. The variables studied were lateralization of cerebral lesion, neurologic and functional status, depression, age, gender, marital status, and living conditions. Depression was evaluated according to the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition. Neurologic impairment was assessed by Scandinavian Stroke Scale, performance in activities of daily living by the Barthel index, and the intellectual deterioration by the Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: QOL was poorer for the patients with mild to moderate stroke impairments at 3 months poststroke. The test domains most prone to being affected were physical functioning, physical role limitations, vitality, and general health. Only the domains of physical functioning and physical role limitations improved during the follow-up at 1 year. Depression, although mostly minor, was the most important reason for impaired QOL. Depression, being married, and age emerged as significant independent contributors to the low score value of vitality. Depression and being married were related to the low score value of physical role limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke affects QOL, impairing its physical and psychosocial domains. The most important determinants of low QOL seem to be depression and being married. These findings provide new challenges for stroke rehabilitation, calling for identification of patients and spouses in need of supportive services."
19775869,0,a,"Deficits in everyday living skills and social skills are associated with the pervasive disability seen in schizophrenia. Cognitive impairments are determinants of these skills deficits and it is known that positive and negative symptoms add to the influence of cognitive impairments for prediction of real-world outcomes. This study examined the relative importance of cognitive impairments measured with a neuropsychological battery, performance-based measures of social and everyday living skills, and positive and negative symptoms for the prediction of real-world outcomes in social and residential domains. In contrast to most previous studies, we examined the importance of individual symptoms, as well as total subscale scores, for predicting clinician rated outcomes in 194 older outpatients with schizophrenia. Symptoms were rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; everyday living skills were measured by the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment; and social skills were measured with the Social Skills Performance Assessment. For prediction of real-world social outcomes, blunted affect and passive-apathetic social withdrawal accounted for all of the predicted variance, while social competence and cognitive impairments did not enter the final equation. For residential functioning, everyday living skills were the most important predictor, followed by lack of spontaneity. The positive symptoms of hallucinatory behavior and suspiciousness also predicted real-world residential outcomes. These results suggest that real-world disability is the product of a complex array of ability deficits and symptoms, indicating interventions will need to be carefully targeted. For social and everyday living outcomes, variance accounted for by the entire array of predictive variables was less than 40%, suggesting that other factors, such as social and cultural influences, are involved as well."
9866093,1,a,"Health policy changes intended to achieve cost control in OECD countries run the risk of reintroducing financial barriers to health care. However, although the problems faced are similar, different countries are dealing with the situation in different ways. For example, Canada and Australia, which share many similarities, have taken quite different policy paths in the last decade: Canada has preserved universal access, whereas Australian policy is promoting a two-tier system through the provision of public subsidies for private insurance. The evidence is that country-specific factors such as institutional arrangements, attitudes, and values intersect with economic and financial factors to shape policy outcomes. Moreover, the Canadian and Australian experiences suggest that in relation to access issues, attitudes and values are the key policy determinants."
14742058,0,a,"Medical education has historically relied on the rational choice model as a vehicle for promoting health behavior change, and has largely overlooked the powerful relationships between social class and health behaviors. The rational choice model, which assumes that people can choose to pursue behaviors that are needed for their health, has some clinical utility, especially in some circumstances, but it runs the risk of missing key sources of influence and of blaming the victim. The biopsychosocial model provides an alternative basis for teaching about health behavior change. Health behavior needs to be understood in a broad social context, in which social class is recognized as playing a large part in shaping many people's health behaviors through multiple pathways, including limited opportunities for self-fulfillment, financial constraints, health beliefs, self-efficacy, stress, and social support. In addition to highlighting the limitations of the rational choice model, we illustrate how to integrate the socio-cultural context into teaching about behavior change. Specific curricular suggestions include exercises for: (1) increasing students' awareness of their own biases regarding unhealthy behaviors and individual responsibility for change; (2) enhancing knowledge of social factors that impact health; (3) building advocacy skills; (4) learning from patients; and (5) practicing counseling skills through role-plays."
1845572,1,a,"Vulnerability to substance abuse is an important social and scientific issue. A critical aspect of this phenomenon is the degree to which individuals who abuse one substance are likely to abuse other substances. The extent to which several pharmacologically distinct drugs will come to serve as positive reinforcers within genetically defined subjects defines their community with respect to abuse liability. Questions in this area are directed at determining whether reinforcement from and abuse of alcohol and other drugs define variations within a single behavioral phenomenon, or whether reinforcement and abuse must be individually defined for each substance involved. Previous studies have shown that ethanol can be readily established as a positive reinforcer in LEWIS rats and C57BL/6J mice. In low ethanol preferring F344 rats, ethanol maintains significant but low levels of responding. Ethanol does not maintain behavior in BALB/cJ or DBA/2J mice. These genotypic patterns of reinforcement from ethanol appear to correlate highly with patterns of reinforcement from cocaine and opiates. Other studies suggest that some aspects of drug self-administration may be mediated in part by common dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms, and animals which differ in ethanol drinking behavior show substantial differences in parameters of serotonergic function. Thus, there may exist important genetic determinants of drug reinforced behavior."
9720645,1,a,"Russia has the lowest life expectancy among industrialised countries, but little is known about other health outcomes and determinants of health in the Russian population. Here we report a cross-sectional study in a national sample of the Russian population of social and psychosocial determinants of two self-reported health indicators: self-rated health (shown to predict mortality in prospective studies) and physical functioning (validated against more objective health measures). A multi-stage sample of the Russian population aged 18 years and more was interviewed (n=1599, response rate 66%). The questionnaire included political attitudes, social and economic circumstances, psychosocial factors, smoking, alcohol consumption, self-rated health and physical functioning (from the SF36 instrument). Scores of perceived control over life and over one's health were calculated from 6 and 3 questions, respectively. Data were analysed in logistic regression for two dichotomised outcomes: poor self-rated health (worse than average) and low physical functioning (less than 60% of maximum). Overall, 25% of subjects rated their health as worse than average; this is substantially more than in western countries. Perceived control over life was strongly related to both outcomes; age- and sex-adjusted OR for 1 standard deviation increase in control were 0.60 (95% CI 0.52-0.69) for poor self-rated health and 0.67 (0.57-0.81) for low physical functioning. Adjustment for a battery of other factors reduced these estimates only slightly. Associations between control over one's health and both outcomes were also significant, but weaker and attenuated in multivariate models. Material deprivation was also strongly related to both outcomes. Education was inversely related to self-rated health, and unmarried men reported poor physical functioning substantially more often. Subjects not approving the economic changes reported poorer health but this association was removed by adjustment for socioeconomic factors and control. Subjects who could not rely on informal social structures when in problems reported worse health; this effect largely persisted in multivariate analyses. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that poor health status in Russia is related to dysfunction of social structures, socioeconomic deprivation, and lack of perceived control. The absence of informal social networks, vital for maintaining general welfare, seems to affect adversely self-rated health. Deprivation and low perceived control may be important mediators between the broad social environment and health in populations undergoing transition and can provide a useful framework for many biological and behavioural factors. Prospective studies are needed to address the issue of temporality and reporting bias, the major problems in interpreting these findings."
10180676,1,a,"Drawing on experiences from China and Russia (the world's two largest transitional economies), this paper empirically examines the impact of economic reforms on health status. While China's overall health status continued to improve after the economic reform, Russia experienced a serious deterioration in its population health. The observed differences in health performance between China and Russia can be explained by the different impacts of economic reforms on three major socioeconomic determinants of health. Depending on whether or not the reform improves physical environment (as reflected in income level and nutritional status), social environment (including social stability and security system), and health care, we would observe either a positive or a negative net effect on health. Despite remarkable differences in overall health development, China and Russia share some common problems. Mental and social health problems such as suicides and alcohol poisoning have been on the rise in both countries. These problems were much more serious in Russia, where political and social instability was more pronounced, associated with Russia's relatively radical reform process. With their economies moving toward a free market system, health sectors in China and Russia are undergoing marketization, which has had serious detrimental effect on the public health services."
11809144,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Smoking during pregnancy poses a health risk for the fetus which may later extend to the child and adult, with higher probability of respiratory problems. The aim of this study was the to investigate the correlation between smoking during pregnancy and the neonatal characteristics and sociodemographic determinants of smoking habit during pregnancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study subjects were 419 mothers and their newborns in Barcelona, Spain. Data on smoking habits were collected using a structured questionnaire. We measured cotinine in umbilical cord blood as a biomarker of exposition to tobacco smoke. Concentrations of cotinine were determined using a radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: 29% interviewed mothers declared daily cigarette consumption during the third trimester of pregnancy, while the biomarker test showed that 34% mothers were smoking at the end of pregnancy. Smoking habit during pregnancy, assessed by means of either the questionnaire or the biomarker, correlated negatively with anthropometric parameters (weight, length and head circumference) of the newborn. The smoking habit was not associated with social class and age, although it was lower in primigravid mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other European countries, there is a widespread smoking consumption during pregnancy in Spain, regardless of the social class and maternal age. Reduction of both active smoking and exposition to environmental tobacco smoke represent key elements in the prevention of newborns' morbidity and mortality."
15702749,0,a,"The purpose of this article is to explain how globalization has evolved, in order to provide a context for assessing the health care restructuring that is occurring worldwide. The authors begin by defining globalization and introducing a framework for considering pathways that can affect social organization and health. They then draw attention to current trends, such as the GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services), that promise to open health services provision to increased pressures of globalization."
9245679,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Within the CINDI framework, a European ""Quit and Win"" contest was organized in 1994. In Finland the number of participants was 5,879 (0.6% of smokers). In the CINDI demonstration area, North Karelia (NK), the participants numbered 618 (2.0% of smokers). This study compared abstinence maintenance among the participants in NK with the rates found elsewhere in Finland and analyzed determinants for successful quitting. METHODS: A follow-up study was conducted 12 months after the quit date with a sample of 2,114 participants. Response rates of 67-68% were achieved (n = 1,419). The abstinence was assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months. Two estimates are presented: (1) the proportion of abstainers among the respondents and (2) the proportion of abstainers among the sample, considering all nonrespondents smokers. The determinants for maintenance of smoking cessation were analyzed with logistic regression. RESULTS: Using the first estimate, the rates at 1/6/12 months were 75/36/28% in NK and 70/28/21% elsewhere (P < 0.01). Using the second estimate, the corresponding rates were 50/24/19% in NK and 46/19/14% elsewhere. The most significant determinants for successful quitting were sex, age, marital status, level of withdrawal symptoms, previous quitting attempts, and support received. CONCLUSIONS: The recruitment of smokers and the maintained cessation were more successful in the demonstration area. The difference between areas was explained by differences in the combined professional and lay support and by the sex and age distributions."
10081241,1,a,"Using a sub-sample of ever-married women from the 1993 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS), this study examines differentials in contraceptive use in six cultural groups: Ga-Adangbe, Twi, Fante/other Akans, Ewe, Guan/others and Mole-Dagbani. Multivariate analysis is used to explore whether reported ethnic differentials in contraceptive use can be attributed to ethnicity or to other characteristics that distinguish the ethnic groups. Overall, the findings are generally more consistent with the 'characteristics' hypothesis, because contraceptive use differentials by ethnic group is accounted for by differences in socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of these women. However, for the Fante/other Akans, even after the necessary controls, ethnicity continued to emerge as a significant determinant of contraceptive use. Programmatic implications of these results are discussed."
19402801,0,a,"A brief summary of key presentations at the 15th Annual International Society for Quality of Life conference is presented. Special highlights of this conference were its location (South America) and its aim to present current and potential contributions of the health-related quality of life (QoL) field to equity in healthcare at a clinical and population level, providing crucial inputs for decision-making in a person-centered health conception. Present and future utilization of health-related QoL measures, norms and bank items were introduced by David Cella, who also called for researchers' cooperation, stating that efforts towards a commonly shared language and metric are better than a relentless pursuit of perfection. Other central topics in the search of equity were stigma and poverty. The importance of negative attributes by others in stigma severity perception and low self-reported QoL was demonstrated by Donald Patrick, who suggested interventions for reducing stigma. Poverty impact on children's QoL and the importance of social determinants were demonstrated through a unique, longitudinal Brazilian study. Complementarily, the importance of a biological basis of oncologic symptoms, particularly cytokines, and the impact of their control on health-related QoL were addressed by Charles Cleeland. The meeting stressed the combined importance of social, psychological and biological factors in determining patient-reported outcomes."
9774918,1,a,"WHO is commissioned to create the World AIDS Program and to elaborate the strategy for the fight against the AIDS pandemic. The standardised strategy for African countries developed in Geneva in 1987 favours the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV without communicating the methods for such. The external and exclusive nature of the technical intervention of WHO and the lack of its adaptation to the dynamics of the epidemic in the 90s, (increase in seroprevalence among pregnant women, increase in the number of sick and HIV infected children, and economical and social consequences of the disease) explain in part the fact that the objectives haven't been reached on the continent a decade later. It seems important to us that the national authorities take responsibility concerning the development of an integrated strategy for AIDS prevention-care that takes into account the determinants of the propagation of the virus in Africa, advocates widespread access to testing-counselling for the general population and pregnant women, provides training for all health personnel concerning care for infected people, and promotes the implementation of social mechanisms for the future and financing for care, including symptomatic treatment for opportunistic infections."
15370610,0,a,"This study aimed to identify factors at diagnosis that are related to cancer patients' utilization of hospital care during the first 2 years after diagnosis, and thereby improve identification of patients with an increased need for close follow-up. Data from a prospective intervention study of psychosocial support and from a computerized patient administration system were used. A total of 393 newly diagnosed patients were included. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to determine whether the addition of information regarding age, comorbidity, functional status, symptoms, and socioeconomic variables improved the prediction of utilization of specialist inpatient care beyond that afforded by cancer-related factors. In addition to cancer diagnosis and treatment, comorbidity, physical function, and pain determined use of inpatient care. Patients living in rural areas and those with a low income utilized hospital care more often. The results suggest that thorough assessment can identify patients at diagnosis with an increased need for follow-up, e.g. intensified home care services."
9693925,1,a,"The association between laryngeal contact granuloma and demographic/psychological variables was examined by using a psychosomatic approach to health research. A stepwise procedure of logistic regression analyses was utilized to get a final multivariate model of variables associated with the clinical finding of a laryngeal contact granuloma. The subjects consisted of 47 patients with contact granulomas and 110 patients with voice disorders due to other causes. Our analysis of 22 variables uncovered the following statistically significant factors for developing a contact granuloma: male gender (P = 0.0001), low achievement orientation (P = 0.0007), fear of physical lesions (P = 0.0038), impulsiveness (P = 0.0016), age > 60 years (P = 0.0012), low extraversion (P = 0.004), high achievement orientation (P = 0.0079), fear of appearing in public (P = 0.0216) and strain (P = 0.03). These results show that a variety of variables are important for predicting the development of a laryngeal contact granuloma. The usefulness of this set of risk variables for predicting a contact granuloma remains to be proved in a prospective study. It is possible that not only the nature but the number of risk factors are the prime determinants of outcome."
19129323,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about public beliefs concerning the treatment of mental disorders in developing countries. AIMS: To assess preferences on sources of help and treatment and the perception of prognosis for schizophrenia and depression. METHOD: A household survey was carried out in 2002 with a probabilistic sample of 1000 individuals, residents of Sao Paulo city, Brazil, with ages ranging from 18-65. Vignettes in colloquial language describing individuals with schizophrenia and depression (according to DSM-IV and ICD-10) were presented, together with a structured questionnaire with questions about the vignette. RESULTS: Results indicated the same general tendencies for schizophrenia and depression. The public considered the help of lay people and psychologists the most useful. Medical professionals are viewed less favorably. The treatments and activities most recommended are psychotherapy and general activities, such as physical activities and attending church services. Medical treatments are seen as more harmful than helpful. The more important determinants were: identification as mental illness, religion, sex and years of school completed. Prognosis with treatment for both disorders is viewed as favorable. CONCLUSIONS: These results may indicate that the public need to receive more information on the full range of treatments options, especially those related to medical treatment."
10453105,1,a,"Studies of migrants and comparisons of rural versus urban communities are potentially informative study designs because they allow examination of genetically similar population subgroups exposed to diverse environmental conditions. These designs have been underused in Africa, where recent urbanization has created many situations in which nearby communities of common ethnicity and culture live under different social and economic circumstances. The International Study of Hypertension in Blacks (ICSHIB) conducted several overlapping surveys in Nigeria starting in 1993. These surveys were based primarily in the rural village of Idere and the urban community of Idikan, both inhabited by people defined ethnically as Oyo Yoruba and sharing a common language and culture. Survey teams collected standardized blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, and some study participants provided 24-hr urine samples and questionnaire data on psychosocial stress and social integration. Rural and urban groups differed substantially in blood pressure and related characteristics. Age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension (blood pressure > or = 140/90 mm Hg) for participants aged 25 years and older was 7-8% in Idere and 24-27% in Idikan. The distributions of overweight, sodium/potassium ratio, perceived stress, and social integration scores all contributed to lower hypertension risk in Idere. The effects and interactions of these identified risk factors remain poorly understood, even among people who share a common genetic background, similar diet, and many other lifestyle features. Nonetheless, the rural-urban distinction is sufficiently salient to engender a nearly threefold difference in hypertension prevalence. This disparity in disease prevalence demonstrates the sensitivity of human beings to the environmental determinants of disease and provides a sobering example of the difficulty in identifying subtle genetic effects, which can be easily overwhelmed by small differences in environmental exposures."
9263464,1,a,"Although mixing patterns are thought to be important determinants of the spread of airborne infectious diseases, to our knowledge, there have been no attempts to directly quantify them for humans. We report on a preliminary study to identify such mixing patterns. A sample of 92 adults were asked to detail the individuals with whom they had conversed over the period of one, randomly assigned, day. Sixty-five (71%) completed the questionnaire, providing their age, the age of their contacts and the social context in which the contacts took place. The data were analysed using multilevel modelling. The study identified, and allowed the quantification of, contact patterns within this sample that may be of epidemiological significance. For example, the degree of assortativeness of mixing with respect to age was dependent not only on the age of participants but the number of contacts made. Estimates of the relative magnitude of contact rates between different social settings were made, with implications for outbreak potential. Simple questionnaire modifications are suggested which would yield information on the structure and dynamics of social networks and the intensity of contacts. Surveys of this nature may enable the quantification of who acquires infection from whom and from where."
7664129,1,a,"Following two previous articles which described changes that are occurring in suicide rates and trends in factors known to be associated with suicides, this article examines in greater depth the effect of occupation and geography on suicide mortality. For both men and women the highest risk occupations are mostly in Social Class I or II. The occupations at highest risk, which include several medical-related professions, and the method of suicide they choose, suggest that easy access to means of suicide is an important factor. Suicide rates for men aged 15-44 are generally higher in Inner London, rural areas, resort and retirement areas, and urban manufacturing areas."
12733243,0,a,"The purpose of this study was to identify how women with breast cancer perceive themselves as subjects in the process of making decisions on their own treatment. Two objectives were pursued: (a) to identify social and political determinants that, by affecting the socialization process of these women, might have influenced them in adopting a style of participation, and (b) to understand the meaning of such participation, as it was perceived by these women at the time they decided on their treatment options. The theoretical-methodological support adopted was that of Symbolic interactionism. The population sample included nine women with breast cancer. Semi-structured interviews allowed data to be gathered, and led to collecting further field notes and data from medical records. The hermeneutic dialectic method was employed as a compass for data interpretation, which made it possible to identify two broad theme units: 'construction of the female identity' and 'style of participation when choosing one's own treatment'. By means of these units it was possible to grasp what it meant for these women to deal with the issue of limits and, therefore, of ethics. In their view, they did not participate in the decision-making process, being regarded as unqualified to decide on the fate of their own bodies and lives. They were thus seen as obedient subjects in relation to medical decisions that are based on the principle of beneficence, where health care delivery is dependent on hierarchical social relationships and power structures are present between classes, genders, and levels of knowledge."

17855469,0,a,"This article explores issues relating to the concept of social capital which has been become an important explanation for inequalities in health. It is based on an analysis of in-depth interviews with working class men living in two contrasting socio-economic areas--one relatively disadvantaged and one advantaged. It highlights the role of different community contexts in the nature and extent of local social capital. In particular, it demonstrates how de-industrialization and economic change as well as material deprivation and a perceived dis-investment in local communities impacted on the men's levels of social capital. Analysis also shows the ways in which gender mediates the processes through which social capital is developed and accessed as a personal and social resource, and how the norms and values associated with working class masculinities appeared to preclude the men from building supportive health-enhancing relationships with others in their community. The prominence of social capital has focused attention on the subjective dimensions of community life as potential determinants of health. This article has, therefore, sought to contribute to this field by widening our understanding about the relationship between social capital, gender and health."
9068572,1,a,"In this issue (page 639) Dr. Ellen L. Lipman and colleagues show that single motherhood is associated with an increased risk of affective disorder and poverty and with increased rates of mental health services utilization. These findings have important implications for primary prevention interventions that focus on the social determinants of family health. Studies have shown that higher levels of psychological distress among single mothers are more closely related to their exposure to stressors than to their personal vulnerability to stress. Research has also shown that the stresses that affect single-parent families are greater in degree but not in kind than those that affect other families. Therefore, intervention programs that address the needs of all families are preferable to those that target specific types of families. Community-based primary prevention programs can promote the well-being of all families by improving the social and economic conditions in which they live."

18243207,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although mission statements are one of the most popular management instruments, little is known about the nature and direction of the presumed relationship between mission statements and organizational performance. In particular, empirical insights into the degree of mission statement use by individual organizational members are insufficient. OBJECTIVES: We address the observed knowledge gap by (a) measuring the level of mission statement use (e.g., explaining the mission statement, making linkages to extant programs or practices, communicating enthusiasm, and adapting the mission statement to the personal work situation) by individual organizational members, and (b) identifying the antecedents that influence mission statement use. DESIGN: Questionnaires were used to collect data from a sample of 510 nurses from three Flemish hospitals. Mission statement use was measured by means of Fairhurst's Management of Meaning Scale. Antecedents of mission statement use were derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior and the mission statement literature. RESULTS: The findings indicate that mission statement use is low on average. Attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and formal involvement in mission statement communication proved to be significant determinants of mission statement use and accounted for 43% of the variance. The results of the conducted regression analyses indicate that nurses (a) who have a positive attitude towards the mission statement, (b) who perceive pressure from superiors and colleagues to use the mission statement, (c) who feel they are in control of performing such behavior, and (d) who are formally involved in the mission statement communication processes are more likely to use the mission statement. Furthermore, the results indicated that demographic characteristics are not associated with mission statement use. CONCLUSIONS: To effectively increase mission statement use, investments should focus on redesigning a work environment that stresses the importance of the organizational mission statement and provides detailed information on the ways that individual organizational members can contribute in realizing the mission statement."
17852976,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Rate of non-attendance following invitation for breast cancer screening is related to several socioeconomic conditions. To what extent this reflects differences with regard to individual and environmental circumstances, respectively, has received little attention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of individual socioeconomic and area-level determinants on variations in non-attendance among geographic areas in an urban mammographic service screening programme. METHODS: The study population consisted of 32,119 women invited for mammographic screening in 1990-93, residing in 97 neighbourhoods in the city of Malmo in Sweden. The influence of the individual factors age, marital status, education, housing accommodation, household income, and area-level circumstances, e.g. rate of migration and rate of being gainfully employed, on the rate of non-attendance was assessed by multilevel analysis. RESULTS: Area rates of nonattendance ranged from 18% to 63%. Of the total variability in non-attendance, 4.3% was between neighbourhoods. This effect was significantly reduced when adjusting for the individual factors. The area-level factors, migration, and rate of being gainfully employed reduced and almost erased the neighbourhood variance in non-attendance. CONCLUSION: In addition to individual socioeconomic factors, area-level factors seem to be important determinants of neighbourhood rates of non-attendance in an urban mammographic screening programme. In a public health perspective neighbourhoods may be targeted in order to affect the problem of non-attendance in mammographic screening."
19477880,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Early family-level and social-level stressors are both assumed to be the components of two main path models explaining the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and its long-term consequences on mental health explored through life-course epidemiological studies. AIMS: To investigate the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and mental health outcomes in adulthood when taking into account early family and social stressors. METHODS: A retrospective French cohort study of 3023 adults representative of the general population in the Paris metropolitan area was conducted in 2005 through at-home, face-to-face interviews. The outcomes measures were current depression and lifetime suicide attempt, intimate partner violence, violence against children and alcohol dependence. RESULTS: The adults exposed to interparental violence during childhood had a higher risk of psychosocial maladjustment. After adjusting for family- and social-level stressors in childhood, this risk was, respectively, 1.44 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.00) for depression, 3.17 (1.75 to 5.73) for conjugal violence, 4.75 (1.60 to 14.14) for child maltreatment and 1.75 (1.19 to 2.57) for alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: The adult consequences of parental violence in childhood-and this independently of the other forms of domestic violence and the related psychosocial risks-should lead to intensifying the prevention of and screening for this form of maltreatment of children."
19451199,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Despite a high prevalence of smoking for decades, recent research has documented an increase in the rates of both male and female smoking in post-Soviet Russia. As yet, however, little research has taken place on smoking at the subnational level. The current study addresses this deficit by examining smoking in Moscow -- the city that has been at the forefront of the entry into the Russian market of transnational tobacco corporations (TTCs) in the transition period. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Moscow Health Survey 2004 -- a stratified random sample of 1190 people representative of Moscow's larger population. Information was obtained about subjects' smoking habits and age of smoking initiation. RESULTS: The prevalence of smoking was high among both men (55.5%) and women (26.9%), with significantly higher rates in the younger age groups. There was also a high prevalence of smoking initiation before age 15 years, especially in the youngest women (18-30 years). Logistic regression analysis showed that respondents' age, binge drinking, locus of control and economic situation were important determinants of smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Although lifestyle factors seem to underpin the generally high levels of smoking, other things, such as its high prevalence in the younger generations and the factors associated with smoking (locus of control), nevertheless suggest that the TTCs may have played an important role in the spread of smoking in transitional Russia's changing social environment."

1490130,1,a,"Though the rate of stroke mortality in the United States has been declining for all race-sex-specific groups, rates for blacks are among the highest in the world. Studies of the geographic and social variation of stroke mortality between populations have focused solely on either trends or social determinants, but not on both. In addition, conclusions have concentrated on the comparison of whites to nonwhites. The purpose of this study was to investigate the variation in stroke mortality trends, from 1968 to 1987, between US black populations categorized by the socioeconomic structure of the state economic area. The educational achievement profile of the population (percentage of the state economic area that had not completed high school) was used as an indicator of socioeconomic development. This aggregate study assessed whether (1) an inverse relationship existed between stroke mortality and educational achievement category, and (2) levels and trends of stroke mortality by educational achievement category varied from 1968 to 1987, for each age-gender-specific group (35 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84 years). Results showed an inverse relationship between educational achievement level of communities and stroke mortality, as well as a rank-ordering in level of educational achievement for all age-gender-specific groups. The absolute difference in rates among educational achievement levels clearly converged over time, with greater convergence in the period 1968 to 1978 than 1979 to 1987. The percent declines were similar across education categories. Results suggest that geographic inequalities in stroke mortality, in relation to socioeconomic structure, have converged over time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

If tooth decay prevalence decreases, this disease is still unequally distributed: 20% of the children, those with the weakest socio-economic statute (SES), concentrate 60% of the decays. Edentulism strikes significantly more people with weak SES. The inequalities of oral health reflect those of general health. Evidence of the inequalities in oral health is exposed even in the developed countries. Different models of intervention are presented: risk groups identification and targeting by specific programs; oral health community approach which includes socio-economic and public health measures aiming all the population; insurance approach to be combined with the preceding ones."
19740880,0,a,"In sexually dimorphic and polygynous mammals, sexual selection often favours large males with well-developed weaponry, as these secondary sexual characters confer advantages in intrasexual competition and are often preferred by females. Little is known, however, about the effects of sexually selected paternal traits on offspring phenotype in wild mammals, especially when considering that shared phenotypic traits and selection can also differ greatly between genders. Here, we conducted molecular parentage analyses in a long-term study population of mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), an ungulate exhibiting high sexual dimorphism in mass, to first assess the determinants of yearly reproductive success (YRS) in males. We then examined the effects of paternal characteristics on offspring mass at 1 year of age. Paternity was highly skewed, with 9 per cent of 57 males siring 51 per cent of 96 offspring assigned over 12 years. Male YRS increased with age until apparent reproductive senescence at 9 years, but mass was a stronger determinant of siring success than age, horn length or social rank. Mass of sons increased with paternal mass, but the mass of daughters was negatively related to that of their father, a finding consistent with recent theory on intralocus sexual conflict. Because early differences in mass persisted to early adulthood, sex-specific effects of paternal mass can have important fitness consequences, as adult mass is positively linked with reproduction in both sexes. Divergent father-offspring phenotypic correlations may partly explain the maintenance of sexual dimorphism in mountain goats and the large variance observed for this homologous trait within each gender in polygynous mammals."
9080569,1,a,"This is an analysis of system integration, social stratification and work for health status and health care in East and West Germany. It is based on aggregate data and representative survey data of random samples of 2554 adults in both subsystems. Findings show that there were marked differences in life-expectancy prior to unification. The integration of the two systems, which occurred almost totally with regard to terms of West German health care organization, shows adjustment problems in the East for the public Health-Care-Funds and few if any for ambulatory care. The work situation has an impact on health, but there are no significant differences for East versus West. Social stratification variables show an influence on subjective health status for education (East) and for income, social status (West), while physician utilization (despite a preference of specialists by those with higher status) is not significantly determined by stratification variables in either East or West Germany. Beyond the central focus on work and stratification determinants a major finding pertains to a comparatively worse health situation for the aged and for women in what was the former East Germany. System models of Capitalism versus Socialism fit the results and recent history of the two systems to only a limited degree, as the West German corporate health system shows clear limits in following free market principles. The East German system, regardless of its centralized organization and move towards a socialist system, never fully abandoned the traditional model of German health care. Unlike the East German health system, that of West Germany, with its general expansion to 92% of the population, shows an increasing effect for social redistribution. The latter may be a reason why standard indicators of social stratification show less of an impact on health and health care than expected, while conditions at work clearly determine the health of people-the latter being the case in both the former East and West Germany."

10564848,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: While trends in the prevalence of smoking and ex-smoking in Catalonia, Spain have been monitored, the characteristics of those smokers who quit have not been investigated. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the prevalence of cessation, or quit ratio, in Catalonia and to study its sociodemographic, life-style, and smoking correlates. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data collected in the Catalan Health Interview Survey conducted in 1994. This is a cross-sectional study based on a representative sample of the non-institutionalized population of Catalonia. We included for analysis a total of 5,424 subjects (3,649 males and 1,775 females) who declared to be current smokers (2,335 males and 1,331 females) or past smokers (1,314 males and 444 females). We computed the crude and age-standardized quit ratios (QR) or prevalence of cessation, as well as the odds ratio (OR) of quitting smoking, according to gender and the variables studied. RESULTS: The age-standardized QR was 31. 8% for males and 30.9% for females and increased with age. The QR was, both in males and females, greater among married subjects, with higher socioeconomic status, and with healthy life-styles (moderate and heavy leisure physical activity and moderate alcohol consumption). The OR of quitting smoking was higher in heavy smokers (OR = 2.9; 95% CI: 2.2-3.8; smokers of > 30 cigarettes/day vs. 1-10 cigarettes/day) in males, while it was < 1 for females of medium intensity, conforming a shaped curve rather than a linear trend (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.0-2.9, in heavy smokers). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a positive association in males and females between quitting smoking and increasing age, a higher socioeconomic level, heavy smoking, and healthy life-styles. The identification of these groups should facilitate the planning of successful interventions. Further effort is also necessary to target groups with low cessation rates, such as individuals in disadvantaged social classes and light smokers."
9871112,1,a,Group B streptococci (GBS) colonizing the vagina and rectum of pregnant women cause invasive disease of the offspring in a small number of cases. The immune status of the host and differences in virulence among strains appear to be the main determinants for neonatal infection. A high-virulence clone (HVC) was proposed to cause much of the morbidity and mortality when a collection of GBS isolates was examined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. HVC isolates could be further distinguished by their inability to grow at 40 degrees C. This characteristic was used in the present study to examine a collection of 57 GBS isolates from Mexico City for the HVC. Three serotype III invasive strains were classified in the HVC. The other eleven invasive strains and all carrier isolates had growth curves unaffected at 40 degrees C. These results demonstrate the presence of the HVC in Mexico. Such a low prevalence could explain in part the low rate of GBS invasive neonatal disease in Mexico.
1469676,1,a,"The beginning of the 1980s saw the birth of Zimbabwe as a result of a protracted liberation war. It coincided with global interest in primary health care, the concept of universal primary school education and, unfortunately, moves towards economic stabilization and structural adjustment programmes. Economic structural adjustment was adopted by several sub Saharan African countries with dire consequences for the poor and vulnerable. Zimbabwe's commitment to social justice and to equitable distribution of resources demonstrated a practical move away from the culture of rhetoric so characteristic of many governments and non-governmental organisations and agencies. This commitment has been translated into impressive improvements in health and education. Current evidence shows that education has had a positive impact on health and related areas like contraceptive use, child mortality and the nutrition status of children. Conversely nutrition and health conditions among school children are important determinants of educational outcomes. Hitherto Zimbabwe's economy has been sufficiently strong to avoid excessive dependence on the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other foreign financial institutions. Unfortunately, however, the current economic recession together with economic structural adjustment programmes are beginning to have a negative impact on health and education. Will true synergism between health and education weather these structural problems? It seems that the people and government of Zimbabwe have the capacity and resolve to weather such a storm."
9010897,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated clinicians' compliance with delivering written advice and information against tobacco use (prevention prescriptions) to adolescent patients. METHODS: Clinicians in 77 orthodontic offices were trained (and asked) to provide anti-tobacco counseling and prescriptions to 10- to 18-year-olds for 2 years. Each of eight prescriptions was provided for distribution to adolescent patients. Information concerning prescription-tracking methods and operant learning theory variables such as modeling and feedback was obtained using a cross-sectional interview of clinical staff. The proportion of prescriptions written was regressed on possible ""determinants."" Analyses were replicated for two time periods. RESULTS: Mean anti-tobacco prescription compliance was 66 and 73% for two separate time periods. Multiple regression analyses were computed for the first (R = 0.45, F(7,63) = 2.29, P < 0.001) and second (R = 0.48, F(7,63) = 2.76, P < 0.001) time periods. Prescription tracking and praise from patients were significant correlates for the first time period; praise and modeling were significant for the second time period. Twenty and twenty-three percent, respectively, of the variance in office prescription rate was explained. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that compliance with primary prevention procedures may be influenced by feedback from patients, staff modeling, and formal office tracking information."
7794544,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: To study trends in prevalence and to ascertain risk factors for HIV-1 among sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attenders in Trinidad. DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial cross-sectional studies were conducted in 1987-1988 and 1990-1991 at a centralized STD clinic in Port of Spain. A case-control study was carried out to examine in greater detail the demographic and behavioral risk factors for HIV-1 among self-declared heterosexuals in this population. RESULTS: HIV-1 prevalence increased from 3.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3-3.9] in 1987-1988 to 13.6% (95% CI, 11.8-15.6) in 1990-1991. Age > or = 40 years [odds ratio (OR), 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8], urban residence (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.0), and human T-lymphotropic virus-I seropositivity (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.6-6.0) were significant risk factors for HIV-1 in 1990-1991. In the case-control analysis, significant independent risk factors for men included current genital ulcer disease (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.2-12.5), current genital warts (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.0), having ever had syphilis (OR, 3.2; 95% CI 1.6-6.1), and use of crack cocaine in the preceding 6 months (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.7-14.2). Corresponding risk factors for women were commercial sex work (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.3-25.7), initiation of sexual activity before age 14 years (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.5-16.0), and past non-gonococcal cervicitis (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.3-13.1). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 in this setting is primarily heterosexually transmitted in a milieu of unprotected sexual activity fuelled by a crack cocaine epidemic. Targeted interventions to prevent, detect and treat STD and crack cocaine addiction, as well as disrupt their adverse synergism, may substantially reduce HIV-1 transmission in this population."
17446148,0,a,"Sub-Saharan Africa has one of the highest levels of teenage pregnancies in the world. In spite of that, there is paucity of empirical research on causes of teenage pregnancies in African countries. This paper investigates the determinants of teenage pregnancies based on a case study of Busia District in Kenya. The data are from a household survey conducted in 1998/1999. Empirical results indicate that girls' education level has significant influence on the probability of teenage birth, with non-schooling adolescents and those with primary school level education being more vulnerable. Among the variables used as proxies for access to sex education, availability of church forums that educate adolescents about sex and family life issues reduce probability of teenage pregnancy. Age is positively related to teenage pregnancies, with older adolescents being more predisposed to pregnancies. Though use of contraceptives is found to have a positive effect, only a small proportion of adolescents were using modern contraceptives and, supply side factors such as quality and availability were not accounted for. Other key factors as outlined by the adolescents themselves include peer pressure and social environment-related factors like inappropriate forms of recreation, which act as rendezvous for pre-marital sex, as well as lack of parental guidance and counselling. Overall, lack of access to education opportunities, sex education and information regarding contraceptives, as well the widespread poverty predispose girls to teenage pregnancies. The problem of teenage pregnancies should be viewed within the broader socio-economic and socio-cultural environment in which the adolescents operate. For instance, lack of parental guidance on issues of sexuality and sex education was reinforced by cultural taboos that inhibit such discussions. Adolescents should be equipped with the relevant knowledge to enable them make informed choices regarding sexual relationships. This should be complemented with broader programmes aimed at promoting girl education and poverty alleviation."
23529205,1,a,"Existing models of attitude-behavior relationships, including the Health Belief Model, the Theory of Reasoned Action, and the Self-Efficacy Theory, are increasingly being used by psychologists to predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related risk behaviors. The authors briefly highlight some of the difficulties that might arise in applying these models to predicting the risk behaviors of African Americans. These social psychological models tend to emphasize the importance of individualistic, direct control of behavioral choices and deemphasize factors, such as racism and poverty, particularly relevant to that segment of the African American population most at risk for HIV infection. Applications of these models without taking into account the unique issues associated with behavioral choices within the African American community may fail to capture the relevant determinants of risk behaviors."
15935621,0,a,"To compare the health-related quality of life (HRQL) for patients with epilepsy and health subjects, we collected the clinical and demographic data and information on health states by using the Taiwan version of World Health Organization quality of life (WHOQOL)-BREF questionnaire in 296 patients (aged 19-73 years) with confirmed active epilepsy visiting the clinic of National Taiwan University Hospital, and 296 age-, gender-, municipal- and education-matched Taiwanese healthy subjects sampled from a national health interview survey. Multiple regression analyses with stepwise selection strategy were conducted to study risk factors for impairment of HRQL. Patients with epilepsy have poorer HRQL than the healthy population in physical, psychological and social domains but not in environment domain (p<0.005). Patients with less than 4 attacks during the previous 1 month had a better score in the availability and quality of health and social care in environment domain than healthy subjects (p<0.05). After controlling other determinants, seizure frequency, and comobid with other diseases are the important factors in predicting HRQL for epilepsy patients. Patients with employment and married had a significantly better HRQL. Effective control of seizure frequency and thoughtful promotion of positive attitudes in community are essential to improve the HRQL of epilepsy patients."
14698795,0,a,"Compliance with therapeutic regimens constitutes an important but infrequently studied precursor of treatment engagement and is a necessary condition of successful treatment. This study builds on recent treatment process research and provides a theory-driven analysis of treatment compliance. Five hypotheses are formulated to predict treatment noncompliance among criminal justice-mandated clients. These hypotheses tap different determinants of treatment progress, including physical prime, supportive social network, conventional social involvement, treatment motivation, and risk-taking propensity. Data from 150 addicted felons participating in a diversion program are analyzed to test the hypotheses. Predictors related to these hypotheses correctly identify 58% of the fully compliant clients and 55-88% of the noncompliant clients. Most hypotheses are at least partially corroborated and a few strong correlates emerge across analyses. Clients in their physical prime, those with poorer social support, and those lacking internal desires for change were found especially likely to violate treatment program rules. Clinical implications are discussed."
16646923,0,a,"The nursing profession has renewed its commitment to social and political mandates, resulting in increasing attention to issues pertaining to diversity, vulnerable populations, social determinants of health, advocacy and activism, and social justice in nursing curricula. Narratives from a qualitative study examining undergraduate nursing student learning in five innovative clinical settings (corrections, international, parish, rural, and aboriginal) resonate with these curricular emphases. Data were derived from focus groups and interviews with 65 undergraduate nursing students, clinical instructors, and RN mentors. Findings of this study reveal how students in innovative clinical placements bear witness to poverty, inequities, and marginalization (critical awareness), often resulting in dissonance and soul-searching (critical engagement), and a renewed commitment to social transformation (social change). These findings suggest the potential for transformative learning in these settings."
7950738,1,a,"A study designed to identify the principal determinants of use of inpatient facilities in NHS hospitals in England used the data and methods outlined in the previous paper. The model for the psychiatric sector contains mortality, self reported morbidity, and social variables indicating deprivation and the level of care at home. The non-acute model contains mortality and several socioeconomic variables. The models lay less weight on age than the current formula, and a national formula based on these models would, in the acute sector, redistribute resources to poorer areas compared with the current formula."
15464009,0,a,"The increase of physical stature in the developed countries and their socio-economic correlates has been well documented for nearly two centuries. In this study, the secular changes in height, weight and the BMI of Hungarian university students and conscripts are analyzed for the years 1933-1998. During the first half of this period these body measurements changed little, while in the second half the rates of change accelerated rapidly: height increased by 1.7 cm among males and 1.8 cm among female university students per decade, and 1.8 cm among male conscripts. Differences were found according to the place of birth and residence as well as parental occupation and educational level."
2255820,1,a,"Self-assessed well-being has been shown to be related to earlier medical events and to be a predictor of mortality. 50-year-old men and women (n = 314) in Kungsor were invited to an examination for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and different aspects of self-assessed well-being. The differences between men and women concerning their well-being could not explain the differences in the expected mortality between the sexes. A well-developed social network and physical exercise were the most positive determinants of well-being, while drug intake, angina pectoris, and smoking were the most negative."
10477860,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the mean length of temporary work disability (TD) and to assess some of its possible determinants. METHODS: During 1995, we registered 12,570 cases of TD among people from the Inspection Area of Alcala of Henares. We obtained a random sample of 600 cases. In addition to TD length, we obtained information about patients' sociodemographic characteristics, social security group, diagnosis, and type of primary care. Analysis of variance was used to compare means and Cox regression models were used to estimate risk ratios for factors influencing return to work. RESULTS: The mean and the median of the TD were 44.5 and 11 days respectively. The TD length was less than one month in 72.9% of the cases. The TD length was similar in both sexes and showed a positive association with age (p=0.0002). The General group had higher TD length than the Insalud group and lower than the Autonomous and Housework groups. The Insalud personnel showed an adjusted relative effect (and 95% confidence intervals) in the probability of returning to work of 2 (1.07-3.73) compared to the General group. The adjusted relative risk was 0.89 (0.88-0.90) for an increase of 5 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The most important factors in the TD length were age and social security group. The improvement in the health system accessibility is one of the factors that may positively affect the probability of returning to work."
16040212,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the determinants of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use and possible health-related outcomes in Germany. METHODS: 827 current HRT users (age range 31-78 years, who had taken HRT products in the last 7 days before the medical interview) and 2371 age-matched nonusers were identified from five population-representative National Health Surveys performed from 1984 to 1999 in Germany. Cross-sectional comparisons between HRT users and nonusers were performed for socioeconomic factors and possible health-related outcomes. Regression models were used to obtain odds ratios of HRT use. RESULTS: HRT use increased dramatically from 3% in 1984/1985 to 21% in 1998/1999 among German women aged 40-69. Regression analysis and comparison between HRT users and nonusers suggested that HRT use was closely associated with socioeconomic factors and personal lifestyle that may favor better health. In HRT users, however, we did not observe any health-related benefits in satisfaction with life or health. While HRT users appeared superior to nonusers with respect to the glycemic status, histories of cardiovascular diseases, despite a favorable lipid profile, occurred not less than in the group of nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: In the settings of our cross-sectional studies in Germany HRT did not improve users' health benefits and did not show cardioprotective effects. The better glycemic status should be balanced against the higher risks of cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer."
8351536,1,a,"Much of child illness in developing countries can be explained by what have been called, 'proximate determinants,' principally infant feeding practices and preventive and curative care. During previous field research in a small village in Yemen the author observed that despite the uniformly unhealthy environment, a minority of the families carried most of the burden of child illness and death. This study was carried out to document that observation, and to suggest an explanation. The study used quantitative techniques to map child health in the community and identify a sub-sample for subsequent in-depth questioning and observation. What distinguished women with healthy and unhealthy children was the level of resources under their control and the way they managed them; their social support or lack of it; and their passive or active attitudes toward life. Detailed stories are presented for five of the women. Although biological explanations for ill health can lead to useful interventions, the social and economic problems of the 'multi-problem family'--well-recognized in industrialized countries--must also be addressed to improve child health."
2056748,1,a,"Two correlational studies using English nurses and working adults are reported that examined the relationship between the three measures of person-environment (P-E) fit as derived from Holland's (1973) theory and three dependent work-related variables. In the first study, the P-E fit measures of congruence, consistency, and differentiation were correlated with two measures of absenteeism, frustration, and various demographic variables. Contrary to predictions, two measures of absenteeism were positively correlated with congruence and consistency. In accordance with the hypothesis, however, frustration was highly negatively correlated with congruence and consistency. In the second study, consistency, but not congruence or differentiation, was significantly negatively correlated with stress, as predicted. These studies provide some support for Holland's theses, although not all hypotheses were supported, both for methodological and theoretical reasons. It is argued that P-E fit measures are useful predictors of occupational behavior in conjunction with other major determinants."
1289087,1,a,"The predictive power of height for future ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was examined in 4860 men from two communities in South Wales and the West of England. At follow-up, men in the shortest fifth of the height distribution had experienced twice as many incident IHD events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction) as was the case for men from the tallest fifth. Adjustment for age, social class and smoking habit failed to alter these relationships significantly. In the data from South Wales, determinants of height were examined; birth rank and number of siblings showed a trend with height. This trend was found only in men whose fathers were manual workers and may be related to inadequate nutrition in the higher birth ranks and larger families. These results support the suggestion that early childhood factors may be relevant to IHD in middle age and possible mechanisms are discussed."
8961415,1,a,"Policy makers and scientists are increasingly concerned with the use of formal care services by the elderly. This article demonstrates that there are three different care systems: the informal, the commercial and the formal (public) system. In terms of prevalence, the formal system is the least important one. By means of a cross-sectional sample of the elderly population of Antwerp, an Andersen model is estimated to explain the use of formal services. This model shows that the level of functional capacity of the elderly is a crucial factor. Yet, the effect this has on the use of care varies according to the different living arrangements. ""Need"" as such, therefore, does not determine the use of formal services, since its effect is modified by the different alternatives that are at the disposal of the elderly person (living arrangements, informal care, income, availability of commercial alternatives). In the conclusion it is argued that the Andersen model, in a cross-sectional design, is inadequate to construct a theory concerning the use of care services."
1760800,1,a,"Research has shown that African-American men have a higher incidence, a higher death rate, and a lower survival rate for most cancers. But currently there are few studies addressing factors influencing the health care trends of this high-risk population. A study focused on identifying factors that contribute to early cancer detection and cancer risk-reduction health behavior in African-American men was therefore implemented. There is evidence to support the conclusion that perceptions do significantly contribute to the health behavior of African-American men. Those having the greatest impact were related to methods of early cancer screening. Clearly, if the National Cancer Institute's goal to reduce the mortality from cancer in the general population by 50% from the base rate in 1984 is to be met by the year 2000, there must be an increase in programs targeting African-American men. Every day African-American men can take steps to help protect themselves from cancer. Our charge as health care clinicians, educators, and researchers is to pinpoint ways to encourage them to do so."
11777189,0,a,"The object of this study was to investigate how the information status with regard to diagnosis, in addition to social and clinical factors, influenced emotional functioning and quality of life in a group of cancer patients in Turkey. A consecutive sample of 100 cancer patients being treated for different diagnoses in a tertiary care centre were prospectively evaluated. Data on patient disease and social characteristics, clinical factors, and scores on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) were analysed by logistic regression models. A significant proportion (44%) of the patients did not know of their diagnosis of cancer. The scores on functional and symptom scales and global health status/quality of life according to QLQ-C30 did not differ according to the information given or not given on diagnosis. However, the independently significant determinants of good emotional functioning were male gender (P=0.002), low serum alanine transferase levels (P=0.025), good social functioning (P=0.002), and the absence of constipation (P=0.005). In Turkey, it is still common for cancer patients not to be informed of their diagnosis, and there is a great need to improve this situation. Honest disclosure of the truth does not worsen any dimension of quality of life in general or emotional functioning in particular. On the contrary, those with hepatic dysfunction, female gender, poor social functioning and constipation are the ones at increased risk of poor emotional functioning, and these patients may benefit from psychological screening."
8044971,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify determinants of coronary artery reactivity among premenopausal female monkeys. Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal females modulates reactivity of atherosclerotic coronary arteries. However, no studies have evaluated the factors that modulate coronary artery reactivity among premenopausal females. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five adult premenopausal female monkeys were fed an atherogenic diet for 32 months. During this time, monkeys were housed in small social groups and determined to be socially dominant (associated with normal ovarian function) or subordinate (associated with impaired ovarian function). After 32 months, coronary artery vasomotor responses to intracoronary acetylcholine, nitroglycerin, and serotonin were assessed by computer-assisted quantitative coronary angiography. Coronary arteries of dominant monkeys dilated (+9 +/- 2%), whereas those of subordinate monkeys constricted (-6 +/- 2%) in response to acetylcholine (P < .05). There was no effect of social status on vascular response to nitroglycerin or serotonin (P > .10). Vascular responses to acetylcholine were independent of social status effects on plasma lipids, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis extent. The correlation between acetylcholine responses and plasma estradiol concentration measured on the day of angiography was r = .7 (P = < .01). Furthermore, dilation occurred only if plasma estradiol concentrations were greater than 60 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial factors and endogenous estrogen production are important modulators of acetylcholine-mediated dilation of atherosclerotic coronary arteries among premenopausal female monkeys."
9783862,1,a,"This paper briefly describes the rise of the thrifty genotype hypothesis as an explanation for the late twentieth century epidemic of diabetes, particularly in post-colonial indigenous societies. It looks at some of the ethical consequences of the biological deterministic paradigm, particularly the popular confusion of ""genes"" with ""race"" and how this paradigm served to exclude consideration of social determinants of disease in epidemiological thinking. Some alternative hypotheses to the thrifty gene theory are explored, together with the consequences of acceptance of these other theories in terms of public health action. Finally, there is a need for epidemiology to be continually conscious, critical and transparent with respect to the general disease (and wellness) theory under which it operates if it is to be truly a science rather than a collection of methodologies."
9702829,1,a,"The relation between marital status, social integration and the mortality from all causes was examined in a population based cohort study. The 5-year-cohort consisted of 1,030 men and 957 women, aged 55-74 years who participated in the second MONICA Survey Augsburg, F.R.G., 1989/90 (MONICA = Monitoring of trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease). They were followed for mortality until 1995. Altogether 120 men and 45 women had died. Social integration was measured by an index of social ties. The index of social ties examined in these analyses includes (a) presence of a spouse, (b) number of close friends and relatives, (c) reported contact with close friends and relatives. Age standardized mortality rates (per 10,000 person years) were computed for men and women. Sex-specific Cox-proportional hazard models were used and hazard rate ratios (HRR) were calculated adjusting for age, hypertension, cigarette smoking, cholesterol, drinking alcohol, number of chronic diseases and self-reported health. Mortality rates were higher for men who were living alone (437.3) than for married men (235.3). Respectively in women the rates were 121.6 compared to 80.7. After controlling for age and self-reported health a HRR of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0-2.4) was observed for single, divorced or widowed men and a HRR of 1.6 (95% CI: 0.8-3.0) for women living alone. Low mortality rates were observed in people with many social ties (men: 180.1, women: 29.9). Mortality rates of people who gave no informations about social ties (men: 349.5, women: 124.9) were similar to those who had only few social ties (men: 321.1, women: 132.5). The findings showed that people with few social ties were more likely to die in the follow-up period than those with more extensive contacts. After adjusting for age and self-reported health the HRR for those with few ties compared to those with many social ties were 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.5) for men and 2.7 (95% CI: 1.1-6.6) for women. Similar results were found for people who gave no informations about their social ties (men: HRR = 1.4, 95% CI: 0.9-2.3; women: HRR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.0-6.9). Social relationships were shown to be important predictors of mortality in elderly women and men. These findings confirm the need for further research, which enables to take steps against high mortality of the social isolated elderly."
12084810,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The present study explored factors that influenced older individuals' subjective perception of hearing problems. In addition to objectively screened hearing ability, nonauditory factors such as stressful life conditions (visual impairment, chronic disease, disability, and recent stressful life events), neuroticism, and social resources were hypothesized to be predictors of self-perceived hearing problems. METHODS: These hypotheses were tested with a hierarchical regression model using a stratified sample of 425 community-dwelling older individuals (mean age = 72.2). RESULTS: Individuals with more recent stressful life events, higher levels of neuroticism, and less emotional support reported greater hearing problems after controlling for objectively screened hearing. In addition to the main effects, a significant interaction was observed between neuroticism and screened hearing, indicating that the combination of poor hearing and high neuroticism increased the level of self-perceived hearing problems. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the effects of nonauditory factors should be taken into account in the application of self-assessed measures of hearing problems."
9446197,1,a,"This is the burning issue of the hour. In attempting to resolve it within the context of advanced age, it is important to clarify the meaning of the words involved: Independence and autonomy are far from being synonyms. Independence refers to the ability to perform physical activities of daily living (bathing, eating, preparing meals, shopping, money management), whereas the second word, autonomy, refers more to the ability to make decisions, to reason, to express an appropriate opinion in a given situation. Hazard and inevitability are totally at variance. Hazard implies the likelihood of occurrence of an event harmful to health, or to the length or quality of life. Hazard is more or less predictable, whereas inevitability is the expression of a supernatural power controlling all events. To find out whether ""dependency is a hazard or an inevitability"", it is necessary to conduct a historical review of the extension in human longevity and in particular of the current ""weight"" of aging both on individuals and on society at large. In Geneva, the proportion of the over 65-year-olds grew from 5.1 percent in 1880 to 13.4 percent in 1990. During that time, the gain in life expectancy was 52.4 percent for Geneva males of 80 years of age and 93 percent for Geneva females of the same age. This drastic change in age groups was coupled with a noteworthy change in household sizes. In 1860, the number of persons per household was 4.5. In 1990, it was down to 2.2. Conversely, the number of inmates in Geneva's medico-social institutions went up from 649 to 1168 between 1982 and 1992. In this socio-economic and cultural perspective, the concept of ""globality of the individual"" throughout his lifetime explains: age-related physiological changes; the long-term repercussion of physical, professional or leisure activities; the consequences of the accumulation of such varied risk factors as overweight or its opposite, malnutrition, tobacco or stress. Such frailty caused by aging is an ideal breeding ground for disease. For now, what matters most is the functional consequence of disease. Is the disease acute or chronic? Two out of three deaths result from a chronic disease, which caused loss of function by organs (impairment), loss of function by the subject himself (disability) or loss of function by the individual in society (social handicap or disadvantage). Raising the question ""Dependency: a hazard or an inevitability?"" boils down to asking oneself about the place of disease in our society and its determinants, and about all aspects of medicine and especially of prevention. When detected, a susceptibility brings into play primary prevention, aimed at averting the onset of the disease. After a disease has set in, measures to prevent recurrence, or secondary prevention, are required. Lastly, prevention of dependency and of loss of autonomy is part of tertiary prevention. Except for violent traumatic accidents, the formulation of the above concepts proves that dependency is essentially ""a hazard"". Therefore, let us anticipate!"
8374223,1,a,"The aim of the study was to examine the effect of birth weight, infant nutrition, body mass and social status from early childhood and adulthood on plasma lipid levels in 192 adult subjects examined in the first three years of life (mean age 1.4 years in males and 1.3 years in females) and again as adults (mean age 19.9 years in males and 19.6 in females). According to the results obtained, total cholesterol was significantly higher in adult male subjects breast fed for the shortest period of time (p < 0.05). Those males who were leanest in the first three years of life and fattest as adults had the highest levels of total cholesterol (p = 0.03) and LDL cholesterol (p = 0.02). Birth weight had no significant influence on plasma lipid levels in adults subjects. When data on nutrition, anthropometry and social status from both age periods were included in multivariate regression analyses, the most significant predictors of higher levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in males were lower adult height and poor social status in early childhood, while in females they were a shorter duration of breast feeding and earlier introduction of solids."
10724473,1,a,"While it is established that socioeconomic status and social integration influence the distribution of health and illness among men and women, little attention has been paid to the different ways in which women and men experience socioeconomic opportunities and social attachments to others. Drawing on evidence from the literature, the position developed in this article is that gender mediates the influence of both socioeconomic status and social integration on health, and for women, these are intricately linked. Women's relationship to the labour market establishes and perpetuates their socioeconomic inequality relative to men, and may produce contradictory influences on women's health. Furthermore, for women, the marital relationship is paradoxical: marriage may at once improve economic and social support opportunities, while diminishing control over paid and unpaid work--potentially increasing as well as compromising the health status of women. The article is intended to contribute to the growing body of literature on gender and the determinants of health."
19171472,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The traditional approach to understanding the economic dimensions of risk environments is to examine the forces that determine the activities of social actors. Drug dealing poses a particular problem for risk environments as dealing and drug dealers are often thought to be out of the scope of harm reduction interventions. However, local level drug dealing can be an important feature of local economies in marginalized communities, and the sharp distinctions between users and dealers may not always hold. METHODS: Ethnographic evidence is used to describe how two drug dealers experience risk. Two domestic spaces, the house of a heroin and amphetamine dealer respectively, are used to illustrate the relationships between structural forces, experience and physical space. RESULTS: One key mechanism through which risk environments mediate the relations between structural forces and individuals is through the modification of every day space. Rather than simply being a container for action, space is made through experience. This case study illustrates how two drug dealers orient themselves in space in relation to a complex amalgam of sensations, memories, inscriptions and intentions. Rather than simply being effects of structural oppression, these drug dealers are active participants in the local drug economy. The risk environment and associated economic processes become embodied into the dealers' and their physical environments. CONCLUSION: Drug dealers shape, and are shaped by, their risk environments. A 'determinants' approach to understanding the economic dimension to drug use risk environments needs to be refined. Community resilience policies such ""neighbourhood renewal"" need to take into account the embodied aspects of economic structures in the experience of drug use and drug dealing. The economic relations, the processes that disable the transformation of different forms of capital, the memories and the practices that make drug users, are embodied. Community resilience policies need to bring into focus the embodiment of the economic dimensions of risk environments if they are to successfully reduce harm."

7949803,1,a,"Using the prospective Hungarian childhood diabetes register, a nationwide case-control study was carried out to investigate the possible role of various non-genetic factors as risk determinants for type 1 diabetes in childhood. A questionnaire (covering family characteristics, social status, fetal and perinatal events, breast-feeding habits, infectious diseases and stressful life events) was sent by mail to all incident diabetic children in 1990 (n = 163) and to two referent children (for each diabetic child), matched for age, sex and county. Diabetic children had a tendency to have mothers > 35 years of age (odds ratio (OR) = 3.52; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.74-16.79), a lower proportion of their mothers had higher education (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 0.95-3.0) and these children tended to move home more frequently (OR = 1.99; 95% CI 0.97-4.1). Although the duration of exclusive breast feeding was similar in both groups, the proportion of diabetic children who received no breast milk tended to be higher (OR = 1.76; 95% CI 0.91-3.4). A higher proportion of diabetic children reported non-specific infections (OR = 2.94; 95% CI 1.19-7.21) and the number of stressful life events was higher in diabetic children aged 10-14 years (OR = 3.9; 95% CI 1.14-13.27). As the risk determinants for childhood insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus identified in our low-risk population appear to be similar to those detected in the genetically different, high-risk Swedish population, our study strongly supports an etiological role for these non-genetic risk factors in IDDM."
17473623,0,a,"This study aimed to establish the determinants of health-related quality of life in a rural and an urban sample of Xhosa-speaking people with disability. The sample was a convenience sample and was identified through a 'snowballing' process initiated by enumerators who were all members of Disabled People South Africa. The Xhosa version of the EQ-5D was utilized and the visual analogue scale which ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) was used as the dependent measure. The sample consisted of 244 rural and 61 urban respondents, demonstrating a preponderance of physical disabilities. The urban sample reported more problems in each of the descriptor domains. The visual analogue scale score showed a bimodal distribution. The results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that the presence of pain detracted most from health-related quality of life (-20%), followed by anxiety and depression (-10%), and difficulty with performance of usual activities (-10%). Rural participants, with the same impairment level, reported 8% poorer health-related quality of life. The mean visual analogue scale scores were low (in the 60s), and would indicate that the majority of people living with disability do not necessarily adapt to their functional limitations and continue to experience diminished health-related quality of life. The bimodal distribution, however, did indicate that some respondents enjoyed good health-related quality of life. There is a need to manage symptoms, particularly pain and depression, as these have a severe negative impact on health-related quality of life. The rural setting seemed to contribute to a worse perceived health-related quality of life. This effect needs to be factored in when evaluating programmes."

9270960,1,a,"Asthma and allergic disorders have been on the increase in recent decades, especially among children living in affluent countries; some aspects of the ""Western"" way of life may explain this trend. We evaluated the relation of aeroallergen skin test reactivity with socioeconomic status, number of siblings, and respiratory infections in early life. We examined a total of 2,226 schoolchildren, ages 7-11 years, in three areas of Lazio, Italy. Skin prick tests were performed to assess atopic status, and self-administered questionnaires were completed by the parents. The prevalence of prick test positivity was greater among children whose fathers were in the highest educational level than among those in the lowest [prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-2.06]. There was also a lower prevalence of atopy among larger sibships (PR = 0.38 for subjects with four or more siblings vs those without siblings; 95% CI = 0.14-0.99). A history of bronchitis or bronchiolitis before age 2 years was weakly associated with an increased risk of atopy, whereas a history of pertussis or pneumonia was not. Both the effect of father's education and the influence of larger sibship size remained when we adjusted for several potential confounding factors, including respiratory infections in early life. We infer that higher socioeconomic status and lower sibling number are determinants of atopy in this Italian population. Protection arising from early severe respiratory infections does not explain this association, although we cannot exclude a role for other viral infections."
8909112,1,a,"A comprehensive model of family influences on educational resemblance of siblings expands the traditional sibling pair model to a full sibship model in order to investigate how gender, gender composition of sibships, and a measure of ordinal position moderate the effect of social origins on educational attainments of siblings. One common family factor is sufficient to explain the variation of educational attainment among brothers and sisters. Although effects of social origins variables on brothers are larger than on sisters, the relative effects of measured social origins are virtually the same among sisters and brothers. The disparity between educational attainments of brothers and sisters persists across sex composition and family size. Ordinal position does not alter the effects of social origins on educational attainment nor does it directly affect educational attainment. Father's and mother's education are equally important for all siblings regardless of birth order, gender composition, and family size."

17132545,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study assesses neuropsychological and psychosocial determinants of judgements of personality change (PC) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from 87 participants with TBI analysed using hierarchical binary regression. METHODS: Interview of participants assessed, injury severity (post-traumatic amnesia), degree of cognitive impairment (IQ and memory), presence of orbitofrontal and/or medial temporal damage (olfaction) and emotional reactions (anger, depression and anxiety questionnaires). Separate interview of relatives assessed their own response to the injury (emotional reactions and critical comments from the Expressed Emotion index) and their judgements of participants' behavioural change. RESULTS: As expected, memory loss and impaired olfaction predicted relatives' PC judgements. However, the most striking and novel result was that social-emotional factors (participants' and relatives' reactions) predicted PC judgements best. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the need (a) for future studies measuring social behaviours (e.g. impulsivity and emotional perception) (b) to explore the differing determinants of relatives' and participants' PC judgements and (c) to develop and to tailor clinical responses to the various psychosocial determinants of PC."
8140450,1,a,"Much of the research on determinants of health service utilization has focused on economic and cognitive variables which influence preventative health behavior. Our ethnographic study of maternal perceptions of the barriers and incentives to immunization use in Haiti underscores the importance of 'hidden' social and psychological costs of utilization, such as embarrassment, fear, child care difficulties, and competing demands on maternal time. Findings from focus group interviews with mothers, individual interviews with health care providers, and observation at health posts identified five categories of maternal factors (competing priorities, low motivation, socioeconomic constraints, fears about health or social consequences, knowledge and folk beliefs) and five categories of system factors (accessibility, acceptability, availability, accommodation, affordability) which can deter immunization completion. The discussion focuses on how these factors influence maternal decision-making regarding use of preventive child health services. More attention is needed on the psychosocial costs of health behavior in developing country settings."
17580127,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to clarify the knowledge and attitudes of Chinese university students regarding living organ donation and analyze the determinants impacting their decisions. METHODS: A questionnaire was delivered to college students chosen by random assignment. The data was analyzed by Statistics Package for Social Science (SPSS) software. RESULTS: Of 434 participants, 49.8% indicated they would be willing to be living organ donors, 58.4% believed living organ donation could ease the organ shortage, 48.2% thought that the recovery rate of recipients of living organ donors transplants was equal to or even better than deceased donation, 62.4% designated relatives as their most probable recipients, 48.0% argued that partial compensation was an effective method to increase live organ donation, and 53.7% wished to donate through transplantation centers. According to univariate analysis, attitudes regarding the value of life, relationship between body integrity and health as well as body integrity and conventional culture were factors that impacted on an individual's decision. Students' knowledge of the value of living organ transplantation and their economic background were considered to be determinants of individual willingness. Furthermore, the operation's impact on quality of life and postoperative complications were additional concerns. Multivariate analysis indicated that other factors influencing students' willingness to donate included attitudes toward the relationship between body integrity and health, beliefs regarding body integrity and conventional culture, value of living donor organ transplantation, economic background of students, and anxiety about the impact on postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous students were willing to participate in living organ donation. At the same time, social education and advertisements for living organ donation were far from adequate, having little or no influence on the decision-making process."
9268254,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The authors explore the determinants of having a regular source of care in a community-based probability sample of homeless adults in Los Angeles. Results from this study should be more representative than those from previous studies of the homeless that are clinic- or shelter-based. In addition to those factors found to be barriers to regular sources of care in the general population, we hypothesized that psychosocial characteristics of the homeless and the homeless lifestyle would negatively impact their likelihood of having a regular source of care. METHODS: The authors conducted a multiple logistic regression to predict regular source of care among the homeless, using an adaptation of the Behavioral Model of health services utilization as an analytic framework. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of the sample reported that they had a regular source of care. Of those with a source of care, 30% reported a hospital outpatient department; 25% reported a community or homeless clinic; 23% reported a hospital emergency room; 14% reported a government clinic; and 9% reported a private physician's office as their source of care. Some factors found to be barriers to having a regular source of care in the general population (male, Hispanic, young age) also were barriers among homeless adults. Additional barriers in this sample included homelessness-related characteristics such as competing needs, long-term homelessness, and social isolation. Chronic mental illness and chronic substance dependence were not related to having a source of care among the homeless. Characteristics that increased the likelihood of having a regular source of care in the general population (poor health status, Medicaid) were not related to having a regular source of care among the homeless. CONCLUSIONS: In a context of limited resources, the distribution of regular source of care among the homeless appears to be highly inequitable. Although some of the characteristics identifying those with a regular source of care suggest differential patterns of behavior across subgroups, others suggest differential advantage in access to care and a lack of fit between the needs of the homeless and the organization of health services."
11988815,0,a,"AIMS: The objective of this study was to determine the extent that psychosocial and clinical variables influence parental compliance with occlusion therapy (eye patching) in children with amblyopia. METHODS: Children (n = 151) receiving occlusion therapy (eye patching) for the treatment of amblyopia were recruited from five orthoptic clinics in Bristol, UK. Parents completed a questionnaire based on Rogers' (1983) Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). The parents (n = 105) were also followed up 2 months later. Clinical data, including measures of visual acuity, were also recorded. Compliance with eye patching was assessed through self-report accounts of parents. Stepwise regression analyses were used to determine the factors predictive of compliance with eye patching. RESULTS: Self-reported compliance with eye patching at study entry revealed that only 54% of parents were achieving orthoptists' recommendations to patch their child. Perceived self-efficacy was positively associated with compliance and perceived prohibition of the child's activities were negatively associated with compliance. At follow-up, past behaviour accounted for the largest proportion of explained variance in patching behaviour followed by response efficacy, and prohibition of the child's activities. CONCLUSION: The present findings may serve to inform interventions aimed at enhancing current orthoptic practice to improve compliance in amblyopic children. The importance of 'self-efficacy' and past behaviour suggests that consultations with parents exhibiting higher levels of success with patching may elicit strategies that could be shared with parents experiencing difficulties with patching their children. In addition, it is possible that the perceived efficacy of the treatment could be enhanced if orthoptists emphasised evidence of improvements in visual acuity which may, in turn, foster the maintenance of eye patching."
8634561,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patients' initial perceptions of their myocardial infarction predict subsequent attendance at a cardiac rehabilitation course, return to work, disability, and sexual dysfunction. DESIGN: Patients' perceptions of their illness were measured at admission with their first myocardial infarction and at follow up three and six months later. SETTING: Two large teaching hospitals in Auckland, New Zealand. SUBJECTS: 143 consecutive patients aged under 65 with their first myocardial infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attendance at rehabilitation course; time before returning to work; measures of disability with sickness impact profile questionnaire for sleep and rest, social interaction, recreational activity, and home management; and sexual dysfunction. RESULTS: Attendance at the rehabilitation course was significantly related to a stronger belief during admission that the illness could be cured or controlled (t = 2.08, P = 0.04). Return to work within six weeks was significantly predicted by the perception that the illness would last a short time (t = 2.52, P = 0.01) and have less grave consequences for the patient (t = 2.87, P = 0.005). Patients' belief that their heart disease would have serious consequences was significantly related to later disability in work around the house, recreational activities, and social interaction. A strong illness identity was significantly related to greater sexual dysfunction at both three and six months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' initial perceptions of illness are important determinants of different aspects of recovery after myocardial infarction. Specific illness perceptions need to be identified at an early stage as a basis for optimising outcomes from rehabilitation programmes."
8500954,1,a,"The primary health care approach to public health stresses recognition of economic, political, and social determinants of health. In practice, briefly trained community health workers provide people with education and health care, but they require sound supervision. Such tasks of leadership require higher education. This demands more schools of public health of independent status, as well as stronger departments of community medicine within schools of medicine. Independent schools of public health throughout the world are much stronger than preventive medicine departments in medical schools, as measured by full-time faculty, scope of teaching and research, and candidates enrolled. To train properly for leadership, such independent schools in the developing world should be multiplied by 12 times to meet the needs. Leadership requires basic preparation in the full scope of public health knowledge, along with skills of effective management."
14959592,0,a,"UNLABELLED: A prospective cohort study was conducted to explore the extent of congruence and to identify the determinants of congruence between the preferred and actual place of death of terminally ill cancer patients. A total of 180 terminally ill cancer patients were enrolled (87% response rate) and 127 died during the one-year study period. Nearly 90% of the subjects preferred to die at home. One-third achieved their preference for place of death. The kappa value of congruence (kappa = 0.11, 95% confidence interval = 0.05-0.17) indicated poor to slight agreement between the preferred and actual place death. Important determinants of congruence between the preferred and actual place of death for terminally ill cancer patients included rehospitalisation and receiving hospice home care during the final days of life, perceived ability for family to help achieve preferred place of death, and residence in New Haven County. CONCLUSIONS: This study directly confirms that the degree of congruence between the preferred and actual place death is unsatisfactory. Clinical interventions and health policies need to be developed to assist terminally ill cancer patients who may not be able to achieve their preference for place of end-of-life care and death."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between social, psychosocial and biological conditions experienced in early life and through the life course and gingival bleeding on probing. METHODS: A two-phase study was carried out in Brazil. In Phase I, 652 13-year-olds were clinically examined and interviewed. In Phase II, 311 families were randomly selected for an interview to collect information on the teenager's state at birth and selected impacts in their early years of life. Clinical examination included assessment of dental caries, periodontal and dental trauma status. The data analysis used logistic regression and the models were determined using stepwise procedure. FINDINGS: Adolescents who were born in a non-brick house, who were living in an overcrowded house at 13 years of age, those whose mother had less than 8 years of education, who were at a lower school grade for their age, those who reported high levels of paternal punishment and those who were from reconstituted families were significantly more likely to experience high levels of bleeding gums after probing. CONCLUSION: Early life and life-course experiences were important determinants of the level of gingival bleeding after probing in adolescents."

15978130,0,a,"CONTEXT: The Kenya Partnership for Health (KPH) program began in 1999, and is currently one of the 12 field projects participating in the WHO's 'Towards Unity for Health initiative' implemented to develop partnership synergies in support of the Primary Health Care (PHC) approach 1. CONTENT: This paper illustrates how Program-linked Information Management by Integrative-participatory Research Approach (PIMIRA) as practised under KPH has been implemented within Trans-Nzoia District, Kenya to enhance community-based health initiatives. It shows how this model is strategically being scaled-up from one community to another in the management of political, social, cultural and economic determinants (barriers and enhancers) of health. OBJECTIVE: Target rural communities in the development of a community-based health information management and feedback initiatives that can provide insights on the social, cultural, political and economic determinants of health for utilization in informed health service management. KEY FINDINGS AND ACHIEVEMENTS: 1. Cues for health seeking and health service utilization are determined by the social, cultural, political and economic factors as seen by the individual and as defined by the community but not due to the pathological nature of the illness. 2. Establishment of community-based health surveillance and health action initiatives as the best practices in transferring health as a resource that can be 'owned and guarded' by the community. 3. Establishment of Healthy Villages Initiative (HVI) through which health service delivery and scale-up can be sustained at the community level. 4. Provision of actionable health information necessary for health planning and evaluation of preventive health programs thorough PIMIRA. CONCLUSION: It has been realized that for every one person who visits a health facility for medication, there are nine others who had the same condition but sought health care from other sources including self-medication and five others who never sought health care. Innovative means of involving the community in health information management and utilization such as PIMIRA are hence the best ways of guaranteeing equitable delivery of health services that are accessible and sustainable by the community."
8212935,1,a,"In a prospective longitudinal study on child development from birth to age eight 362 first-born infants and their families were investigated. The subjects were distributed across the nine cells of a two-factorial design, factor 1 representing the degree of organic, factor 2 the degree of psychosocial risk. At age 3 months mother-child interaction was videotaped and evaluated with microanalytic technique. The quality of MCI could be demonstrated to be as predictive for later cognitive development as early developmental tests. Social-emotional problems of the toddler and preschool child was predicted better by parameters of early MCI than by temperament. Disturbed interactions were associated with later cognitive retardation and enhanced behavior problems. MCI is significantly determined by neglect and rejection, which showed typical behavioral patterns. The early separation of mother and high risk newborn itself did not lead to alterations in maternal attachment. Compared with mother daughter dyads early interaction of mother and son was characterized by more reactivity and positive emotion."
19550161,0,a,"In sub-Saharan Africa, social factors such as religion have been linked with significant child morbidity and mortality. In religiously multi-denominational societies, one dominant religious group tends to subject the other groups to some form of economic, social or political discrimination, resulting in inequities in child survival. This study assessed the influence of individual- and community-level indicators underlying the association between religion and under-five mortality using multilevel logistic regression modelling. There is a significant association between religion and under-five mortality, which is considerably attenuated by sequentially adjusting for other risk factors. The effect of religion on under-five mortality is influenced by contextual-level characteristics of the community. Traditional religion is associated with under-five mortality, which is attributed to individual- and community-level indicators. Policy measures aimed at tackling child health inequities due to social factors such as religion need to consider the significance of the context in which mothers in different communities live, when healthcare interventions are being planned."
14518810,0,a,"Using longitudinal, community-based data from the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging, the authors examined determinants of changes in social support receipt among 439 married older adults. In general, social support increased over time, especially for those with many preexisting social ties, but those experiencing more psychological distress and cognitive dysfunction reported more negative encounters with others. Gender affected social support receipt: Men received emotional support primarily from their spouses, whereas women drew more heavily on their friends and relatives and children for emotional support. Discussion centers on the importance of social support provision to those with the greatest needs."
15073910,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study describes the use of psychotropic drugs in a sample of eight Italian psychiatric hospitals. METHODS: A cross-sectional approach was used to collect information about sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the inpatient population, and about medications prescribed. Prescribing behaviour in the hospitals was compared using three indicators: the number of patients taking psychotropic drugs, the use of high doses of neuroleptics and the use of multiple neuroleptics. RESULTS: More than a thousand patients were resident in the eight hospitals on the census day, 56% of them males. Half the population had an ICD-X diagnosis of schizophrenia, one third of mental retardation. Sixty-nine percent of the sample was on neuroleptic therapy, nearly 47% on benzodiazepines and 4% on antidepressants. Twenty percent of the sample did not take any psychotropic drug on the census day. After adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical variables, setting-related variables resulted as determinants of psychotropic drug use. CONCLUSIONS: These data call for continuing education in psychopharmacology towards a more rational use of drugs; longitudinal audits of clinical practice should be implemented to guide clinicians toward a more rational use of psychotropic drugs."
17992965,0,a,"A study was carried out with 501 persons to analyze the predictive capacity of various psychosocial variables-symptom perception, neuroticism, Personality Types 2 and 4 of Grossarth-Maticek and Eysenck, beliefs about health, social support, or certain coping styles-on two health-related behaviors: the frequency of visits to the doctor and self-medication. The results were analyzed by two structural equation models that revealed that some of the variables have direct effects on the behaviors, whereas other variables, such as attribution style, coping styles, or the impact of the stressors, have indirect effects via the reported symptoms or neuroticism. In addition, self-medication and the frequency of health service visits are independent of each other, which shows that their determinants are different. It is concluded that to address these factors in the two health indicators, it is also necessary to take in account the psychosocial variables considered herein."

This work was aimed at assessing the level and factors that determine the awareness of undergraduate Students of Usmanu Dandfodiyo University, Sokoto. METHODOLOGY: In a descriptive cross-sectional study, a total of 450 students were recruited by means of multistage and simple random sampling techniques. RESULTS: Overall, there is a knowledge gap on aetiology, mode of transmission and preventive measures with only 40.2% and 38.5% of the respondents having adequate knowledge and indicated their willingness to learn more about AIDs respectively. Age (P<0.05), Sex (P<0.005) and number of years spent in the University (P<0.025) are important determinants of level of AIDS knowledge. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: This finding could be as a result of strong interactions between the social environment and human sexuality. Hence, student bodies should be involved in reproductive health programmes. Key words: awareness, university students, AIDS."
15266192,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of child-, parent- and family-related factors on the use of and need for mental health services by 12 years of age. METHOD: A prospective population-based questionnaire study of 1,287 first-born children was launched in Finland in 1985. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was completed by 1,086 parents when the children were aged 3 years. At the age of 12, the CBCL, the Youth Self-Report, and other potential determinants of service need and use were obtained from 908 parents and 900 children (80% response rate). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 7.2% had used professional services, and 3.3% had needed services without obtaining them. Elevated scores on the age 3 CBCL Total Problems and Externalizing scale predicted independently later service use but not perceived need of services. In cross-sectional data at age 12, parental ratings of the child's problem behavior were associated with both the need for and use of services. Poor social competence and parental distress were independently associated with use of services. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing behavior problems in early childhood and evaluating family stress factors are important in social and health care systems designed for children."
10354230,1,a,"This study of 156 Dutch general hospital nurses tested a theoretically derived model of specific relationships between work stressors and stress reactions. The model proposes four central domains of the work situation, namely work content, working conditions, social and labour relations, and conditions of employment. In addition, the model proposes three important stress reactions, namely a diminished intrinsic work motivation, occupational burnout and an inclination to leave the job. More specifically, it was hypothesized that (i) intrinsic work motivation is primarily determined by work content variables, (ii) burnout is primarily determined by both work load and limited social support, and (iii) propensity to leave is primarily determined by conditions of employment. All these relationships were simultaneously tested using a structural equations modelling technique. The results of a series of LISREL analyses indicate that the postulated model fits well to the data. The present study used conceptually integrated measures that cover the area of work stress and stress reactions, and provides directions for interventions aimed at preventing or reducing specific negative outcomes of work-related stress in general hospitals."

8501991,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of multiuse of prescription drugs and its major determinants among Finnish adults. The data were based on three nationally representative and intercomparable health surveys in 1976, 1978-80, and 1987. The study populations were 16,413 in 1976, 13,138 in 1987, and 7,217 in 1978-80. The simultaneous use of at least five prescription drugs was the main outcome measure. In 1976, 4.7% of the study population, and 6.3% in 1987 were multiusers. Of all users of prescription drugs, the proportion of multiusers was 14% both in 1976 and 1987. In 1987, the elderly comprised 55% of all multiusers, whereas their share in 1976 was 44%. The strongest predictor of the multiuse was, as expected, chronic morbidity. Of the various diagnostic groups, the main determinants were cardiac insufficiency, hypertension, asthma, mental disorders, and coronary heart disease. Even allowing for chronic morbidity, age was significantly associated with multiuse, but sex was not. The number of visits to a primary care physician correlated also independently with the multiuse. These findings indicate that the elderly may in part get prescriptions indiscriminately."
19635735,0,a,"Few prospective studies of smoking initiation have investigated a wide range of time-varying and invariant predictor variables at the individual and contextual levels concurrently. In this study (1999-2005), 877 Canadian students (mean age = 12.7 years) who had never smoked at baseline completed self-report questionnaires on cigarette smoking and 32 predictor variables in 20 survey cycles during secondary school. Height and weight were measured in survey cycles 1, 12, and 19. School administrators completed questionnaires on school tobacco control policies/activities, and trained observers collected data on access to tobacco products in commercial establishments near schools. Younger age, single-parent family status, smoking by parents, siblings, friends, and school staff, stress, impulsivity, lower self-esteem, feeling a need to smoke, not doing well at school, susceptibility to tobacco advertising, alcohol use, use of other tobacco products, and attending a smoking-tolerant school were independent determinants of smoking initiation. Independent determinants of daily smoking onset among initiators of nondaily smoking included smoking by siblings and friends, feeling a need to smoke, susceptibility to tobacco advertising, use of other tobacco products, and self-perceived mental and physical addiction. Adolescent tobacco control programs should address multiple individual and contextual-level risk factors. Strategies that address nicotine dependence symptoms are also needed for adolescents who have already initiated smoking."

It appears that intrapsychic factors or life experiences, as well as certain social conditions, influence that choice. For example, the economic state of society historically has had significant impact on the role of women and the value placed on woman's unique biologic contributions. Likewise, personality and attitudinal factors also may act as potential mediators of observed differences between lactating and nonlactating mothers in their mother-infant interactions. Finally, once the decision to breastfeed or bottle-feed has been made and carried through, additional physiologic mechanisms may mediate conscious behavioral intentions. The phenomenon of human lactation, then, is sensitive to a variety of interrelated factors that can be grouped as follows: (1) individual personality, (2) social forces, and (3) psychophysiologic mechanisms. An in-depth understanding of the specific factors that affect a woman's decision to breastfeed will have far-reaching implications for future educational and interventional programs."
1294072,1,a,"According to 1982 and 1988 NSFG data, unmarried white women are far less likely than they were in the early 1970s to place their children for adoption. The levels of relinquishment among black women have remained low throughout this period, and relinquishment among Hispanic women may be virtually nonexistent. Multivariate analysis of the determinants of relinquishment among unmarried non-Hispanic white women suggests that having a well-educated mother, being in school at the time of conception, having no labor force experience, and being older are positively associated with placing a child for adoption. Sons were found to be less likely to be relinquished than daughters."
16188748,0,a,"AIM: This study examines socio-demographic determinants of initiation and duration of breastfeeding in a community-based cohort in northwest Russia. METHODS: All infants born to women who were registered at the antenatal clinics in Severodvinsk in 1999 comprised the cohort (n=1399) and were followed up at 1 y. Data on maternal and infant characteristics as well as the duration of breastfeeding were obtained from medical records. Proportional hazard analysis was applied to quantify the effect of the selected factors on the risk of breastfeeding discontinuation adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Only 1.3% of infants were never breastfed. Breastfeeding rates were 75.0% and 47.2% at 3 and 6 mo, respectively. Maternal age and early initiation of prenatal care were positively associated with breastfeeding initiation rates. Increased risks of breastfeeding discontinuation were found in teenage mothers (OR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.06-1.99), in mothers with basic education (OR=1.68, 95% CI: 1.06-2.66) and in unmarried mothers (OR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.38). Women with no previous deliveries were more likely to breastfeed longer (OR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.62-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous studies in Russia, almost universal initiation and considerably higher rates of breastfeeding at specific time points were found. Social variations in initiation and duration of breastfeeding should raise concern of inequalities in breastfeeding practices in transitional Russia."
12200506,0,a,"Most studies of psychopathology following disasters are concerned with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present analyses sought to assess the rate and determinants of depression in adult survivors of the 1988 earthquake in Armenia. Unlike previous studies of earthquakes, the present analyses derive from a well-defined cohort of survivors who underwent diagnostic interviewing to characterize psychiatric morbidity. As part of a cohort study of 32,743 survivors of the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, a stratified population sample of 1,785 persons was interviewed about 2 years following the disaster using a special questionnaire based on the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Disaster Interview Schedule/Disaster Supplement. 52% met the criteria for major depression. Of these, a total of 177 cases of depression with no other psychiatric diagnosis or comorbidity were compared with 583 controls from the same interviewed group who did not fulfill the criteria for any psychiatric disorder. Cases and controls were compared as to data obtained independently at the aftermath of the disaster on a number of exposures and characteristics related to the earthquake. More of the cases involved females (odds ratio [OR] for males 0.7 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-0.9]) and from the city of Gumri, which had some of the worst destruction (OR for residents of Gumri 5.9 [95% CI 4.0-8.8]). Being with someone in the same building at the moment of the earthquake was protective for depression (OR for presence of other people 0.5 [95% CI 0.3-0.6]), and the risk of depression increased with the amount of loss that the family sustained as a result of the earthquake (OR for highest level of loss 2.5 [95% CI 1.3-4.8]). The use of alcohol was protective for depression (OR for those who drink 0.5 [95% CI 0.3-0.8]). In various models of multivariate adjustment and analysis, the increased risk of depression with loss, geographic location, and female gender was maintained. Also, being with someone during the disaster, receiving assistance and support after the earthquake, and alcohol use were protective for depression in these multivariate analyses. Depression is a common sequel to an earthquake. As with our previous study of PTSD, we were able to relate intensity of the disaster and loss to the risk of depression in a general population sample. The role of social support during and after the disaster as a protective mechanism against adverse psychological outcome was highlighted again. Whereas alcohol use in our previous study was not related to PTSD outcome, it is noteworthy that in the present analyses it emerged as a protective factor for depression."
7761906,1,a,"Breastfeeding beyond the resumption of mother's menstruation plays a significant role in the proximate determinants of fertility. Breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhoea data collected from retrospective surveys usually exhibit digit preferences. Here, these heaping errors were smoothed by B-spline and used in multivariate models of risk of conception to investigate the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding. The data used come from a 1987 Indian survey. Results show that lactation, after mother's menses resume, reduces the risk of conception. Heaping in breastfeeding data attenuates this relationship. When adjustment is made, breastfeeding reduced the rate of conception by 47 per cent; the reduction, with adjusted data, was 63 per cent."
8827145,1,a,"A theoretical model was used to examine the influence of relationship factors, pregnancy intentions, contraceptive behavior and other psychosocial characteristics on stages of behavior change in condom use among heterosexual black women of reproductive age. Data from an inner-city street survey compared women who were not contemplating condom use, women who were attempting to use condoms or had used them consistently for short periods of time, and those who had achieved long-term consistent use. Women's relationship with their main partner appears to be an important factor in understanding their use of condoms both with main partners and with other partners. For condom use with the main partner, factors such as emotional closeness and partner support were significant predictors of the likelihood that women would be attempting to use condoms rather than not contemplating use. Cohabitation and the belief that condom use builds trust were significant predictors of long-term consistent condom use. Having a regular or main partner was strongly associated with intentions to use condoms with other partners. Women who wanted to become pregnant were much less likely to intend to use condoms with their main partner, and women using oral contraceptives were less likely to be long-term consistent condom users."
12095425,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Very low birthweight, i.e. a birthweight < 1500 g, is among the strongest determinants of infant mortality and childhood morbidity. To develop primary prevention approaches to VLBW birth and its sequelae, information is needed on the causes of preterm birth, their personal and social antecedents, and on conditions associated with very low birthweight. Despite the growing body of evidence linking sociodemographic variables with preterm delivery, little is known as to how this may be extrapolated to the risk of very low birthweight. METHODS: In 1992, two years after the German unification, we started to recruit two cohorts of very low birthweight infants and controls in East and West Berlin for a long-term neurodevelopmental study. The present analysis was undertaken to compare potential preconceptional risk factors for very low birthweight delivery in a case-control design including 166 mothers (82 East vs. 84 West Berlin) with very low birthweight delivery and 341 control mothers (166 East vs. 175 West). RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effects of various dichotomous parental covariates and their interaction with living in East or West Berlin. After backward variable selection, short maternal school education, maternal unemployment, single-room apartment, smoking, previous preterm delivery, and fetal loss emerged as significant main effect variables, together with living in West Berlin as positive effect modificator for single-mother status. CONCLUSION: Very low birthweight has been differentially associated with obstetrical history and indicators of maternal socioeconomic status in East and West Berlin. The ranking of these risk factors is under the influence of the political framework."
19497119,0,a,"BACKGROUND: European trans-national adolescent smoking prevention interventions based on social influences approaches have had limited success. The attitudes-social influences-efficacy (ASE) model is a social cognition model that states smoking behaviour is determined by smoking intention which, in turn, is predicted by seven ASE determinants; disadvantages, advantages, social acceptance, social norms, modelling, perceived pressure, self-efficacy. Distal factors such as country of residence, age and gender are external to the model. The ASE model is, thus, closely related to the Theory of Planned Behaviour. This study assessed the utility of the ASE model using cross-sectional data from Spanish and UK adolescents. METHODS: In 1997, questionnaires were simultaneously administered to Spanish (n = 3716) and UK adolescents (n = 3715) who were considered at high risk of smoking. Participants' age, gender, smoking intentions and ASE determinant scores were identified and linear regression analysis was used to examine the mediated, moderated and direct effects of country of residence, age and gender on participants' smoking intentions. RESULTS: All UK participants were aged 12 or 13 and most Spanish participants were aged between 12 and 14 (range 12-16 years). Amongst 12 and 13 year olds, regular smoking was more common in Spain. Almost half the participants were female (47.2% in Spain; 49.9% in the UK). Gender did not vary significantly according to age. The distribution of ASE determinant scores varied by country and predicted intention. The influence of each ASE determinant on intention was moderated by country. Country had a large direct influence on intention (1.72 points on a 7 point scale) but the effects of age and gender were mediated by the ASE determinants. The findings suggest resisting peer pressure interventions could potentially influence smoking amongst UK adolescents but not Spanish adolescents. Interventions that promote self-efficacy, on the other hand, would possibly have a greater influence on smoking amongst Spanish adolescents. CONCLUSION: The ASE model may not capture important cultural factors related to adolescent smoking and the relative contribution of particular ASE determinants to adolescent smoking intentions may differ between countries. Future European trans-national adolescent smoking prevention programmes may benefit from greater understanding of country-level cultural norms."
8888156,1,a,"This paper explores barriers to the use of standard screening and breast cancer treatment that result in systematic differences in health outcomes. We review available data on individual, socioeconomic, and health system determinants of access to standard breast cancer care, including screening, diagnostic, and treatment services. Based on this review, we discuss the combination of factors which result in underservice. We argue that a broad framework which considers health system and social class as well as individual factors is useful for analyzing how structures of health care delivery tend to provide less than standard care to women who are older, have less income, or are less educated, black, or Hispanic. Data collection efforts which do not include structural and socioeconomic variables may result in an incomplete or misleading understanding of the determinants of underservice. These factors also need to be considered in the design and evaluation of public health policies and interventions meant to ameliorate the effects of underservice."
16466523,0,a,"This paper reviews several studies that investigated the potential role of genetic factors in determining fertility outcomes. Our review demonstrates convincingly that fertility contains genetic variance; that is, differences between humans in their genetic make-up affects their fertility outcomes and fertility-related behaviours. This finding is robust using both heritabilities and coefficients of genetic variation, and using both direct measures of fertility outcomes and also fertility precursors like fecundity, marriage, fertility expectations and attempts to get pregnant (proception). Moreover, genetic variance can change over short periods of time or across educational levels, specifically for females, and the relevance of genetic variance seems to increase during times of increasing reproductive choice."
8793313,1,a,"German alcoholics were examined for a profile of drinking situations which was found recently in North American alcoholics. A mixed sample of alcoholics (N = 336) receiving in-patient rehabilitation treatment for alcoholism was administered a validated translation of the English version of Annis's Inventory of Drinking Situations (IDS). Analysis of the 100 items in the questionnaire, using principal component methods and varimax rotation, revealed the same three factorial scales seen in the previous study in North American alcoholics (Cannon et al. (1990) Addictive Behaviour 15, 265-269). Drinking was most likely to take place in situations (1) of negative states, (2) of positive states, and (3) where personal control was tested. Although there are large differences in the level and social acceptability of drinking between Central Europe and English-speaking countries, the present data confirm the cross-cultural validity of basic determinants of drinking."
10567490,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Stroke seems to be related to dementia more often than previously assumed and vascular factors are also related to Alzheimer's disease. The pathophysiology of poststroke dementia includes ischaemic changes in the brain, a combination of degenerative and vascular changes, and changes only related to Alzheimer's disease. Some cognitive decline recognised after a stroke may be due to pre-existing cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and radiological determinants of prestroke cognitive decline. METHODS: The study group comprised 337 of 486 consecutive patients aged 55 to 85 years who 3 months after ischaemic stroke completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery; structured medical, neurological, and mental status examination; interview of a knowledgeable informant containing structured questions on abnormality in the cognitive functions; assessment of social functions before the index stroke; and MRI. RESULTS: Frequency of prestroke cognitive decline including that of dementia was 9.2% (31/337). The patients with prestroke cognitive decline were older, more often had less than 6 years of education, and had history of previous stroke. Vascular risk factors did not differ significantly between these two groups. White matter changes (p=0.004), cortical entorhinal, hippocampal, and medial temporal atrophy (p<0.001), cortical frontal atrophy (p=0.008); and any central atrophy (p<0.01), but not the frequencies or volumes of old, silent, or all infarcts on MRI differentiated those with and without prestroke cognitive decline. The correlates of prestroke cognitive decline in logistic regression analysis were medial temporal cortical atrophy (odds ratio (OR) 7.5, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 3.2-18.2), history of previous ischaemic stroke (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.8-10.6), and education (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: History of previous stroke, but not volumes or frequencies was found to correlate with prestroke cognitive decline. Other associating factors were rather those usually associated with degenerative dementia: white matter changes and cerebral atrophy; and in multiple models medial temporal cortical atrophy and education. The possible overlap between two or more underlying diseases must be remembered in diagnosis and treatment of patients with vascular cognitive impairment."
17151800,0,a,Engagement is a core component of effective educational programs for children with autism. Analysis of 711 naturalistic goal-directed classroom behaviors of four school-age children with autism and four comparable children with Down syndrome (DS) was conducted. The definition of engagement was expanded to include child compliance and congruence. A main finding was both child and environmental factors influenced type of engagement. Children with DS produced 20% more goal-directed behaviors that were both congruent and compliant compared to children with autism. Large group instruction was associated with less congruent engagement but more compliant engagement for children with autism. These findings suggest specific types of engagement which may lead to advances in developing evidence-based practices for specific developmental disorders.
1954593,1,a,"Physicians are important gatekeepers of women's access to effective methods of contraception. An understanding of physician behaviour in this domain is therefore important. This cross-sectional survey examined physician beliefs, attitudes, intentions and behaviour with respect to contraceptive prescription. Physician gender was associated with attitudes to diaphragm prescription, while year of medical graduation was associated with attitude to IUCD prescription. Age and gender in turn were related to differing perceptions of methods pertaining to efficacy, adverse effects, women for whom the methods were suitable and possible impacts on the physician. Regional differences in prescribing of these methods may be due to variations in physician age and gender."
12284026,1,a,"""This paper develops a search-theoretic framework for analyzing migration decisions of workers who can only observe the quality of a location by migrating to the location after accepting a job there. After learning the location quality, the worker can stay at the current job, search locally at the same location, or search for a job at another location (leading to repeat migration). This paper develops the properties of optimal search, migration, and repeat migration decisions, and finds how revealed location quality influences the tradeoffs between local search and repeat migration. The effects of search costs and better job opportunities on the reservation levels of wages and revealed quality levels are also determined."""
18799005,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This article aims to provide an introduction to emerging evidence and debate about the relationship between climate change and mental health. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The authors argue that:i) the direct impacts of climate change such as extreme weather events will have significant mental health implications;ii) climate change is already impacting on the social, economic and environmental determinants of mental health with the most severe consequences being felt by disadvantaged communities and populations; iii) understanding the full extent of the long term social and environmental challenges posed by climate change has the potential to create emotional distress and anxiety; and iv) understanding the psycho-social implications of climate change is also an important starting point for informed action to prevent dangerous climate change at individual, community and societal levels."
2029940,1,a,"Experimental service protocols tailored to the needs of teenage family planning patients were developed that emphasized indepth counseling, education geared to an adolescent's level of development, and the provision of reassurance and social support. These protocols were tested against usual service delivery practices in a study involving 1,261 patients under 18 years of age at six nonmetropolitan family planning clinics. A comparison with teenagers obtaining services at control sites found that six months after their first clinic visit, patients at the experimental sites were more likely to be using a method, were less likely to experience difficulty in dealing with problems, were more likely to continue using their method despite problems and had learned more during the educational session. Teenage patients at the experimental clinics were also less likely to have become pregnant within one year than those who went to control clinics. Attrition during the year following the first study visit was similar among both groups; patient satisfaction was very high, and equivalent at experimental and control sites. The data show that the extra time and effort required to meet the special needs of teenagers is justified by their improved contraceptive use, greater knowledge and lower pregnancy rates."
17471524,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine health disparities as a function of ethnicity using data from LUpus in MInorities, NAture versus nurture (LUMINA), a longitudinal study of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); to build an explanatory model of how ethnic disparities occur in this setting; and to suggest appropriate interventions. METHODS: LUMINA patients (meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE) ages >/=16 years of African American, Hispanic (from Texas), Hispanic (from Puerto Rico), or Caucasian ethnicity were studied. In addition to examining the basic features of the cohort, we examined, by univariable and multivariable analyses, the factors associated with disease activity, damage accrual, lupus nephritis, and mortality. An empiric model based on the data presented (and the literature reviewed) was derived to explain the disparities observed. RESULTS: There were substantial differences in the socioeconomic/demographic, clinical, and genetic features among patients from the different ethnic groups, with Texan Hispanic and African American patients exhibiting overall a lower socioeconomic status, different genetic associations, more serious disease at a younger age, and worse intermediate and final outcomes than the Caucasian and Puerto Rican Hispanic patients. A model of disease outcome as a function of the disparities observed was created. CONCLUSION: Ethnic disparities occur in SLE. Environmental, socioeconomic/demographic, psychosocial, genetic, and clinical factors play an important role as determinants of the ethnic differences observed. Measures aimed at eliminating these disparities are suggested while further research is conducted to elucidate the basis of these disparities and their changes at the societal level and to eliminate the gap between the rich and the poor."
18592980,0,a,"OBJECTS: The aim of this paper was to identify factors affecting the urgency of nursing home placement after introduction of public long-term care insurance. METHODS: The subjects were families including at least one disabled elderly person and one another family member in two cities in Chugoku Prefecture. The measure of the urgency of placement was 0 if the family did not submit any application for placement, 1 if the care managers judged that the elderly person should enter in the future when she/he really needs placement, 2 if the care managers judged that she/he might be able to wait for a short while, and 3 if the care managers judged that she/he should enter as early as possible. Our estimation method was by ordered logit model. The dependent variable was the measure of the urgency and the independent variables were several attributes of the families. In the estimation, we considered the possibility that the coefficients depend on categories of dependent variable. RESULTS: We obtained data for 146 waiting families and 494 others (total 640). There were differences in the urgency of placement among waiting elderly as follows ""she/he should enter as early as possible"" (28.8%); ""she/he can wait for a while"" (32.2%), ""she/he should enter in the future when she/he really needs placement"" (39.0%). The results of multivariate analyses showed that the urgency of placement correlated significantly with the severity of the elderly persons disabilities, the number of primary caregivers' self-symptoms, the family members' negative attitude toward caregiving, residing in city A, not having one's own house and limited use of short-stay facilities due to the circumstances of the providers. CONCLUSION: When judging the urgency of placement, we should consider not only whether the applicant has submitted a request for a nursing home or not, but also differences among the waiting families. The urgency of placement correlates significantly with severity of disability of the elderly person, the number of primary caregivers' self-symptoms, the family members' negative attitude for caregiving, residing in city A, not having one's own house, and limited use of short-stay facilities due to the circumstances of the providers."
8166990,1,a,"The WHO Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) Project was initiated in the early 1980s with the main objective of assessing the extent to which trends in coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are related to changes in known risk factors, daily living habits, health care, or major socioeconomic features in defined communities in different countries. In 1994 the WHO/MONICA Project will have completed its 10-year course. To develop a strategy of integrating cardiovascular disease indicators in an overall health indicator system, the problems and opportunities of cardiovascular disease monitoring have to be assessed now. In the industrialized world, cardiovascular diseases are still the most important cause of death. According to WHO estimations, chronic diseases in general will soon, as in the developing areas of the world, be the major health problem. As has been the case for a long time now in the field of cancer, the international community should consider whether, based on the experience of the WHO/MONICA Project, there should be a permanent institution charged with the worldwide monitoring of the development of cardiovascular diseases."
9635219,1,a,"Accumulating evidence suggests that social contexts in early life have important and complex effects on childhood psychopathology. Spurred by the lack of an explicit operational definition that could guide the study of such effects, we define a social context operationally as ""a set of interpersonal conditions, relevant to a particular behavior or disorder and external to, but shaped and interpreted by, the individual child."" Building on this definition, we offer a series of recommendations for future research, based on five theoretically derived propositions: (a) Contexts are nested and multidimensional; (b) contexts broaden, differentiate, and deepen with age, becoming more specific in their effects; (c) contexts and children are mutually determining; (d) a context's meaning to the child determines its effects on the child and arises from the context's ability to provide for fundamental needs; and (e) contexts should be selected for assessment in light of specific questions or outcomes. As reflected in an increasingly rich legacy of literature on child development and psychopathology, social contexts appear to influence emerging mental disorders through dynamic, bidirectional interactions with individual children. Future research will benefit from examining not only statistical interactions between child- and context-specific factors, but also the actual transactions between children and contexts and the transduction of contextual influences into pathways of biological mediation. Because adverse contexts exert powerful effects on the mental health of children, it is important for the field to generate new, more theoretically grounded research addressing the contextual determinants of psychological well-being and disorder."

16679219,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: To determine the influence of the family risk factors (parental weight, socioeconomic status and cultural level) on the distribution of overweight or obesity in prepubertal children and the dynamics of their weight gain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred forty-one children (183 boys) attending the second grade of primary school (age 7.4+/-0.5 years) were enrolled in a longitudinal study in Southern Italy. Overweight and obesity status were defined by a body mass index (BMI) above the percentile having respectively the value of 25 and 30 kg/m(2) at 18 years, according to national reference data; overweight extent was expressed as BMI standard deviation score (BMI-SDS). Information about BMI and socioeconomic conditions (occupation and educational level) of parents were collected. Distribution of overweight and obese schoolchildren and variations of BMI-SDS were evaluated over a 3-year period; relationships with family risk factors were also sought. The distribution of overweight/obese children at baseline was high (40%). Tracking rates of overweight and obesity were 73% and 80%, respectively. The higher the BMI-SDS at 7 years, the higher the BMI-SDS at 10 years (r 0.86, P=0.0001). The highest BMI value and the highest distribution of overweight/obese children were observed in subjects with the highest amount of family risk factors. Children exhibiting accelerated weight gain (delta BM I>1/year) showed higher male/female ratio, higher baseline BMI values, higher maternal BMI values, lower maternal educational level and a dramatic increase in the percentage of overweight/obese children than children with normal weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Children who are overweight/obese at 7 years tend to maintain this condition during prepubertal age. Paediatricians should be alerted when dealing with a child showing a BMI increase above than 1U/year during primary school. Targeted intervention should be directed at young children with overweight parents and low socio-cultural level."
1607053,1,a,"This paper examines the demographic and social factors associated with differences in length of life by race. The results demonstrate that sociodemographic factors--age, sex, marital status, family size, and income--profoundly affect black and white mortality. Indeed, the racial gap in overall mortality could close completely with increased standards of living and improved lifestyles. Moreover, examining cause-specific mortality while adjusting for social factors shows that compared to whites, blacks have a lower mortality risk from respiratory diseases, accidents, and suicide; the same risk from circulatory diseases and cancer; and higher risks from infectious diseases, homicide, and diabetes. These results underscore the importance of examining social characteristics to understand more clearly the race differences in overall and cause-specific mortality."
9923956,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The aims of the study were to describe the pattern of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors) of the Paisley-Renfrew MIDSPAN cohort and assess the influence of biological, behavioural and social 'risk factors' (established at the time of screening) on subsequent hospital admissions. METHOD: A cohort analysis was carried out in Paisley and Renfrew, two post-industrial towns in West Central Scotland. This used a linked data set covering a 23 year follow-up period to combine original 'risk'-related data with subsequent routine hospital admissions data. The subjects were 8349 women and 7057 men, aged 45-64 in the early to mid-1970s, and representing approximately 80 per cent of the eligible population. The main outcome measures were patterns of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors), 'any acute hospital admission', 'a serious acute hospital admission' and 'death' (relative risks of each outcome were calculated for all risk factors). RESULTS: The following patterns of hospital utilization were found. Only 5 per cent experienced a mental health admission but mean stay was long (265 bed days per cohort member admitted). In contrast, 79 per cent experienced at least one acute hospital stay. The age-specific proportions of cohort members requiring admission increased over time but the growth in acute episodes was even higher (suggesting increasing rates of multiple admission). For non-survivors, 42 per cent of all acute episodes (55 per cent of bed days) took place during the 12 months before death. Analysis of risk factors (using Cox's proportional hazards model) of 'any admission' and 'a serious admission' showed forced expiratory volume (FEV1), age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index, cholesterol and deprivation category to be important predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the desirability of alternative settings of care for the chronically ill and dying, a high proportion of hospital bed days were required near the time of death. The absolute size of the demand for hospital services within the cohort was strikingly large and increasing over time. Strategies to address the tide of rising admissions will have to confront the increasing proportion of individuals requiring admission as well as the growth in multiple admissions. Those who were at higher risk of admission were the older members of the cohort (especially men), those with low FEV1, smokers, those who were underweight or obese, the small number with abnormal levels of blood sugar, those with high blood pressure and those who lived in the most deprived areas. Thus, programmes which affect these determinants of ill health may be useful in reducing age-specific admission rates."
12667891,0,a,"Borna Disease Virus (BDV) is a neurotropic RNA virus that is worldwide in distribution, causing movement and behavior disorders in a wide range of animal species. BDV has also been reported to be associated with neuropsychiatric diseases of humans by serologic study and by recovery of nucleic acid or virus from blood or brain. Natural infections of horses and sheep produce encephalitis with erratic excited behaviors, hyperkinetic movement or gait abnormalities; naturally infected cats have ataxic ""staggering disease."" Experimentally infected primates develop hyperactivity, aggression, disinhibition, then apathy; prosimians (lower primates) have hyperactivity, circadian disruption, abnormal social and dominance behaviors, and postural disorders. However, the neuropharmacological determinants of BD phenotypes in laboratory and natural hosts are incompletely understood. Here we review how experimentally infected rodents have provided models for examining behavioral, pharmacologic, and biochemical responses to viral challenge, and how rodents experimentally infected as neonates or as adolescents are providing models for examining age-specific neuropharmacological adaptations to viral injury."
12780990,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct an item analysis of the COMFORT scale within a sample of critically ill children. The COMFORT scale is a tool that measures eight clinical parameters at the bedside to determine a critically ill child's level of distress. However, documentation of the reliability and validity of specific components of this instrument has been limited to date. DESIGN: This was an observational study. SETTING: A tertiary care pediatric intensive care unit. PATIENTS: A sample of 18 intubated, mechanically ventilated patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An item analysis of the COMFORT scale was conducted. The scale was used for variable intervals with each child, providing a total of 514 individual completed ratings. These ratings were then submitted to descriptive, correlational, factor, and regression analyses using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The principal finding of this item analysis was that 97% of the total score variance was explained by six of the eight items. In particular, it was remarkable that heart rate and blood pressure demonstrated very limited reliability and validity as determinants of the total COMFORT score. As well, the clinical experience of the investigators with this scale has demonstrated that these two items can be cumbersome to use, given that these parameters are often affected by hemodynamic factors. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these findings, we propose a modified COMFORT scale based on a six-item scoring system. This modified scale would provide a more reliable and valid measure for research as well as clinical purposes, by eliminating two parameters that can be affected by factors other than the child's level of distress."
21974736,0,a,"Exercise plays a key role in the prevention and delay of the onset of Type 2 diabetes and in the management of this disorder. To determine if there are differences in key social-cognitive determinants of exercise and self-reported physical activity levels between adults with diabetes and those without the condition, a random selected sample of adults was surveyed. A telephone interview assessed physical activity behaviour and key social-cognitive constructs from major health behaviour change theories/models. The mean energy expenditure was not significantly different between the diabetes (n = 46) and the non-diabetes (n = 1556) groups. The diabetes group reported significantly lower scores for self-efficacy and perceived behavioural control, but higher for fear of, and vulnerability to, general health and cardiovascular disease threat. The data suggest that it may not be necessary to promote health threat messages, as threat is already high for this diabetes population and studies have shown that excess threat does not promote recommended exercise and health behaviours. Instead, the low levels of self-efficacy and perceived behavioural control among those with diabetes emphasize the importance of designing specific strategies (e.g., skills, incremental success) to increase their self-confidence in undertaking physical activity."
10924027,1,a,"To ask whether social medicine still matters may seem to be in poor taste at a symposium to honor Martin Cherkasky, but social medicine has always had the courage to take on difficult questions. There is all the more reason to do so when its legitimacy is challenged. The extraordinary findings emerging from the human genome project will revolutionize diagnostic and therapeutic methods in medicine. The power of medical interventions, for good and for harm, will increase enormously. However, in the next millennium, as in this one, social factors will continue to be decisive for health status. The distribution of health and disease in human populations reflects where people live, what they eat, the work they do, the air and the water they consume, their activity, their interconnectedness with others, and the status they occupy in the social order. Virchow's aphorism is as true today as it was in 1848: ""If disease is an expression of individual life under unfavorable conditions, then epidemics must be indicative of mass disturbances of mass life."" Increasing longevity resulting from major economic transformations has made ours the age of chronic disease. Changes in diet and behavior transform genes that once conferred selective biologic advantage into health hazards. Although disease risk varies with social status, medical care makes an important difference for health outcomes. Access to care and the quality of care received are functions of social organization, the way care is financed, and political beliefs about the ""deserving"" and the ""underserving"" poor. It is a moral indictment of the US that ours is the only industrialized society without universal health care coverage. In educating the American public about the social determinants of health, a goal Martin Cherkasky championed, the very power of the new molecular biology will help make our case. Social medicine is alive and well."
9104086,1,a,"The mission of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Fifty years ago, CDC's efforts were focused on epidemiologic and laboratory studies of malaria, typhus, and plague. Today, CDC's activities cover a broad range of diseases and conditions, and a broader range of disciplines are required to address these diverse public health problems. The behavioral and social sciences have a critical role to play in helping the public understand risk group characteristics and the frequency, context, and determinants of risky behaviors and in developing, implementing, and assessing prevention programs. CDC is taking steps to foster an environment in which behavioral and social sciences can flourish and to integrate these sciences into all of CDC's prevention activities.

10907657,0,a,"This study of 72 undergraduate men examined the effects of two determinants of cardiovascular response-active coping and vigilance-on blood pressure and heart rate responses to social stressors. Observation of a future debate partner (i.e., vigilance) evoked larger increases in blood pressure than did observation of a less relevant person, apparently through the combination of increases in cardiac output and vascular resistance. Preparation and enactment of efforts to exert social influence (i.e., active coping) evoked heightened blood pressure and heart rate responses through increased cardiac contractility and output. Thus, both vigilance and active coping in social contexts increased cardiovascular reactivity, but apparently through different psychophysiological processes."
18280480,0,a,"AIM: The aim of this study is to explore whether the work organisation of diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs) differs significantly from nurses working in hospital and nursing home and if so, does this difference result in positive or negative consequences regarding work and health. BACKGROUND: In traditional health care settings, nurses exhibit a high level of environmental uncertainty and low decision-making authority, which has a negative effect on psychological reactions towards work. In professional nursing, specialisation, e.g. diabetic nursing, is a current trend in many countries. Therefore, insight into the determinants of the work situation of nursing specialists is becoming increasingly relevant. METHODS: Comparisons were made between 3 different samples: 1204 nurses employed by 15 hospitals, 1058 nurses employed by 14 nursing homes, and 350 diabetes nurses working in other health care settings throughout the Netherlands. Data concerning organisation, work aspects, and psychological reactions were measured via questionnaires. Variances between the groups were analysed with ANCOVA, besides hierarchical multiple regression analysis was applied. FINDINGS: Environmental uncertainty scored lower amongst diabetes nurses when compared to nurses working in the other two types of health care settings. Social support and role conflict scored low for diabetes nursing specialists who simultaneously perceived autonomy and role ambiguity highest. Diabetes nursing specialists also scored highest on intrinsic work motivation and job satisfaction and lowest for psychosomatic health. CONCLUSION: Except for social support and role ambiguity, diabetic nurses rate their [work] organisation, [work] aspects and psychological [work] reactions more positively than nurses employed in other health care settings."
8501482,1,a,"The relationship between disability and various musculoskeletal disorders was investigated in 7217 men and women representative of the Finnish population aged 30 years or more. They participated in the Mini-Finland Health Survey and were first screened by interview and questionnaire about limitations in daily activities. The outcome variables were reduced working capacity, an occasional need for assistance in daily activities, and a regular need for assistance in daily activities. In a two-phase medical examination, all cases fulfilling predetermined diagnostic criteria of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory and mental disorders and diabetes were recorded independently. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, inflammatory arthritis was the strongest determinant of all forms of disability. Osteoarthritis, especially in the hip, was a strong determinant of both occasional and regular need for assistance, and chronic low back pain was a strong determinant of reduced working capacity and occasional need for assistance among those aged 30-64 years. Other musculoskeletal disorders also determined the prevalence disability, but these relationships were reduced by taking comorbidity into account. A low level of education and a low (less than 20 kg/m2) or very high (at least 35 kg/m2) body mass index represented independent determinants of all forms of disability, and a history of physically strenuous work an independent determinant of reduced working capacity, when disabling illness was adjusted for. The proportion of all forms of disability attributable to musculoskeletal disorders, in models including, age, sex, other disabling illness and significant non-medical determinants of disability, was close to 20%. The disorders with the highest community impact were chronic low back pain among those aged 30-64, osteoarthritis of the hips and knees and inflammatory arthritis."
15603114,0,a,"Occupational violence is a worldwide, multifaceted problem affecting all industries, including healthcare. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the experiences of 158 allied health professionals, 135 doctors, and 1229 nurses working in a rural area in eastern Australia. Response rates were 72 percent for allied health professionals and 62 percent for general practitioners (GPs) and nurses. Proportionately more nurses experienced occupational violence than did allied health providers and GPs. During the past 12 months (August 2001 to July 2002), 68 percent of nurses, compared with 47 percent of allied health providers and 48 percent of GPs, reported violence. All three professional groups indicated that the most distressing occupational violence was perpetrated by patients, followed by patients' relatives. The most frequent form of occupational violence was verbal abuse, followed by threatening behavior, physical violence, and obscene behavior. No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of violence was found among the different allied health professional disciplines or fields of nursing. Health services management strategies addressing occupational violence need to be comprehensive and multidisciplinary in scope. Strategies to minimize violence need to focus on resource allocation, cultural change, and perseverance. Systems to monitor violence are a priority. Further research into the determinants of this pattern of violence is required."
19157764,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To explore challenges to health promotion strategies against obesity, with special attention to the Scandinavian context. METHODS: Analytic induction, a procedure for verifying theories and propositions, based on purposefully selected literature references, with subsequent critical reflection. RESULTS: Health promotion efforts against obesity face challenges related to the unequal distribution of vulnerability to weight gain within the population, and to the complex neuroregulatory determinants that explain why obesity is not just a simple matter of lifestyle. Cultural understandings of identity and morality may create victim blaming and disempowerment, thus obstructing clinical health promotion strategies for weight control. Finally, the conceptual validity of obesity measurements and their predictive power deserves attention. CONCLUSION: Preventing obesity is difficult. Awareness of individual vulnerability and neurobiological mechanisms that lead to weight gain must be taken into account when strategies for health promotion are developed. These strategies must transcend a simplistic energy balance view. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinical health promotion needs to be highly individualized and tailored. Preventing weight gain requires attention to the person's sociodemographic, cultural and genetic characteristics. Cultural trends such as sedentary lifestyles and the nutrition transition should be counteracted without turning body weight control into a question of morality and inferior identity."

18385622,0,a,"AIM: The prediction of stroke outcome in the elderly can be rather difficult, due to the potential interference into disability and handicap development of several clinical modifiers, such as comorbidity, medical complications, neuropsychological impairment proper to the aging brain and social issues. These factors can strongly affect old patient response to rehabilitation and need to be taken into account, along with ageing per se, to optimize health resource efficiency for the care of disability due to stroke. In this study, we tried to identify outcome determinants of stroke rehabilitation specific for the elderly. METHODS: A total of 359 first-stroke patients aged 75 years, admitted for active rehabilitation treatment to hospital rehabilitation wards, were enrolled into a multicenter cohort (prospective) study. They all underwent a comprehensive medical rehabilitation program. We considered as primary outcomes the frequency of home discharge and the extent of functional recovery, assessed by Functional Independence Scale (FIM) and expressed as the Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score (MRFS) efficacy. Each measure of outcome was related to age, as well as other potential clinical and functional confounders, according to a multivariate model. For each dependent variable, two models were developed, using either FIM total score or FIM domains scores at admission among predictors. RESULTS: FIM total score increased from 55.8+/-24 to 75.3+/-30 (P<0.0001), with a mean MRFS efficacy of 0.33+/-0.25. Most patients (79.9%) were discharged home. Age turned out as independently and inversely related to MRFS, explaining at the most 3.6% of its variance, although FIM at admission was its most powerful predictor. Home discharge was not related to age, but to social issues, such as living in family before admission, and cognition. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that rehabilitation can be effective in elderly stroke patients, in improving function as well as in favorably affecting discharge destination. In fact, age per se predicts the outcome at a lesser extent than other clinical covariates, such as functional and cognitive status at admission and social situation."
17461334,0,a,"Understanding the determinants of individuals' perceptions of their risk of becoming infected with HIV and their perceptions of acceptable strategies of prevention is an essential step toward curtailing the spread of this disease. We focus in this article on learning and decision-making about AIDS in the context of high uncertainty about the disease and appropriate behavioral responses. We argue that social interactions are important for both. Using longitudinal survey data from rural Kenya and Malawi, we test this hypothesis. We investigate whether social interactions--and especially the extent to which social network partners perceive themselves to be at risk--exert causal influences on respondents' risk perceptions and on one approach to prevention, spousal communication about the threat of AIDS to the couple and their children. The study explicitly allows for the possibility that important characteristics, such as unobserved preferences or community characteristics, determine not only the outcomes of interest but also the size and composition of networks. The most important empirical result is that social networks have significant and substantial effects on risk perceptions and the adoption of new behaviors even after we control for unobserved factors."

11419836,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study cross-cultural variations in the impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on health-related quality of life by an international comparison of disease-related concerns. METHODS: Item and factor scores on the Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient Concerns and overall mean concern levels were compared by analysis of variance among 2002 IBD patients in eight countries. RESULTS: The overall level of concern varied from 51 out of 100 in Portugal to 19 in Sweden, with intermediate scores for Italy (43), Canada (40), United States (39), France (39), Austria (33), and Israel (25). Having surgery, an ostomy, the uncertain nature of the disease, and medication side effects were each rated among the first five in importance in six countries. Other items varied considerably. For example, concern regarding pain and suffering was high in Israel and low in Portugal, whereas concern over developing cancer was low in Italy. Concern over financial issues and access to high-quality health care were inversely associated with measures of national economic prosperity. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Cross-cultural comparisons of patient concerns related to IBD are feasible using translated scales. 2) Reporting tendencies vary greatly; within Europe, patients from southern countries report greater overall concern. 3) The complications and the variable evolution of disease elicit general concern, but the importance of specific issues varies among countries. 4) The reasons for national differences may have social, cultural, and/or economic determinants with relevance to the patient-physician relationship, patient education, and therapeutic decision making."
17999706,0,a,"AIMS: The health hazards and prevalence of ecstasy use have been documented in two decades of research, but no review reporting on potentially modifiable antecedents of use is available. The aim of this study was to integrate systematically research identifying cognitive correlates of ecstasy use. Such research has the potential to identify targets for evidence-based interventions designed to discourage use. METHODS: The databases PsycINFO and MedLine were searched, inclusion criteria applied to resulting hits, and descendency and ancestry approaches applied to the selected publications. Reported associations between cognitive determinants, including intention to use and ecstasy use measures, were synthesized by calculating a weighted mean effect size, r. RESULTS: The pattern of associations lent support both to the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the expectancy approach as descriptions of potentially useful determinants. Attitudes were associated most strongly with intention and use, followed by subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of the strength of associations and the potential modifiability of identified cognitions suggests that evidence-based interventions to discourage ecstasy use should target negative expectancies, perceived behavioural control and anticipated regret, and consider tailoring perceived behavioural control elements."
9438877,1,a,"UNLABELLED: Centenarians born 1887-91, who lived in southern Sweden were asked to participate in this multidisciplinary study (N = 164). Of the survivors (N = 143), 70 percent agreed (N = 100). The purpose was to describe the population from physical, social, and psychological points of view; to characterize centenarians with various health conditions and diverse degrees of autonomy and life satisfaction; and to identify factors at 100 years that predict future survival. RESULTS: Eighty-two percent were women, 25 percent lived in their own home, 37 percent in old age homes, and 38 percent in nursing homes. Socioeconomic status showed a similar distribution compared to nationally representative data. Fifty-two percent managed activities of daily living with or without minor assistance. The incidence of severe diseases was low. In 39 percent a disorder of the circulatory system was found. Thirty-nine percent (women) and 11 percent (men) had had at least one hip fracture. Twenty percent had good hearing and good vision. Twenty-seven percent were demented according to DSM III-R criteria. Means on cognitive tests (word-list, digit-span, learning, and memory) were lower compared to seventy to eighty year old groups. The variation in performance was extremely widespread. Personality profiles (MMPI) indicated that the centenarians were more responsible, capable, easygoing and less prone to anxiety than the population in general. Extensive neuropathological investigation revealed no major diseases or large lesions but mild through multiple changes. RESULTS suggest that centenarians are a special group genetically. A causal structure model emphasized body constitution, marital status, cognition and blood pressure as particularly important determinants for survival after 100 years."
2063828,1,a,"Commonly used measures of effect, such as risk ratios and odds ratios, may be quite biased when used to assess the effect of factors that alter transmission risks given exposure to infected individuals. This is demonstrated in a simulation model involving a higher-risk behavior and a lower-risk behavior affecting the sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. The bias arises because population contact patterns between higher-risk and lower-risk persons change their relative probabilities of exposure to an infected individual as an epidemic progresses. The assessment of contact patterns is thus central to risk assessment for contagious diseases. A new formulation of selective mixing presented here, together with a structured mixing specification of the social settings of contact, provides a theoretic framework for the investigation of contact pattern determinants."
7610436,1,a,"Socioeconomic health differences (SEHD) are relatively small in childhood. In adolescence they almost seem to disappear and among young adults they re-emerge. This article deals with mechanisms that contribute to the emergence of health differences by studying a group of 10-11 year old children in The Netherlands (n = 908). The role of determinants of health in the relation between socioeconomic status and health (causation) is studied, as well as the influence of health on school performance (selection). Both causation and selection mechanisms prove to exist. Life style and life circumstances are unequally distributed among the socioeconomic groups and can (partly) explain the relation between socioeconomic status and health. The health of the children is related with school performance, which can be seen as health selection. This relation however was only found in the lowest socioeconomic groups. In the lowest socioeconomic groups less healthy children perform worse at school than healthy children. The unequal distribution of determinants of health and health selection in the educational career among children probably contribute to SEHD in adult life."
20028669,0,a,"In parallel with the neo-liberal retrenchment of the welfarist state, an increasing emphasis on the responsibility of individuals in managing their own affairs and their well-being has been evident. In the health arena for instance, this was a major theme permeating the UK government's White Paper Choosing Health: Making Healthy Choices Easier (2004), which appealed to an ethos of autonomy and self-actualization through activity and consumption which merited esteem. As a counterpoint to this growing trend of informed responsibilization, constrained choices (constrained agency) provides a useful framework for a judicious balance and sense of proportion between an individual behavioural focus and a focus on societal, systemic, and structural determinants of health and well-being. Constrained choices is also a conceptual bridge between responsibilization and population health which could be further developed within an integrative biosocial perspective one might refer to as the social ecology of health and disease."
10962782,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle advice from general practitioners (GPs) has been shown to have a positive effect on population health. In practice, GPs provide lifestyle advice to a minority of their patients only, those who are high risk or already have symptoms. AIM: To look in depth at GPs' attitudes towards adopting a population approach to lifestyle advice and to use these results to identify ways of maximising the potential of GPs to affect population health. METHOD: Thirty-six GPs, purposively sampled by identifying characteristics likely to affect their health promotion activity, participated in a focus group study. Data from the focus groups were transcribed verbatim and analysed using standard methods. RESULTS: The main themes that emerged suggested that GPs do not take a population approach to lifestyle advice because they prefer a high risk approach and doubt their ability to be effective in a population approach. GPs believed that social, cultural, and environmental factors were the most important determinants of population health. Furthermore, they were concerned about the detrimental effects on the doctor-patient relationship of providing lifestyle advice to all patients. GPs believed that a multi-agency, centrally co-ordinated approach was the preferred way to improve population health and that their role should be limited to secondary prevention. CONCLUSION: Large amounts of resources would be necessary to convince GPs to adopt a population approach to lifestyle advice. Measures to tackle the social and environmental determinants of health may be a more effective and efficient means of improving the nation's health."
12830862,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors (eg, familiarity, sex, neutering status, and time of year) associated with aggression between domestic ferrets and test a method for reducing aggression when introducing ferrets. DESIGN: Prospective trial. ANIMALS: 56 healthy domestic ferrets. PROCEDURE: To identify variables associated with aggression, pairs were placed in an enclosed area and observed. To test whether increasing familiarity would decrease aggression when introducing ferrets, pairs of ferrets were housed in separate cages next to each other or in separate rooms for 2 weeks prior to introduction. RESULTS: 49 of 82 pairs of strangers fought, but 31 cage mate pairs did not. Time of year had no apparent effect. Pairs consisting of 2 neutered females or 2 sexually intact males were significantly more likely to fight than were pairs consisting of a neutered female and a sexually intact male. Pairs caged next to each other for 2 weeks prior to introduction were no less likely to fight than were control pairs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that familiarity, sex, and neutering status are important determinants of aggression between ferrets. If unfamiliar neutered ferrets are introduced, then pairing 2 males or a male and female would likely result in the lowest levels of aggression. However, neutered females and sexually intact males are not indiscriminately aggressive, as a neutered female can be paired with a sexually intact male without resulting in aggression. Caging ferrets next to each other for 2 weeks does not decrease aggression when the ferrets are introduced."

7794544,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: To study trends in prevalence and to ascertain risk factors for HIV-1 among sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attenders in Trinidad. DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial cross-sectional studies were conducted in 1987-1988 and 1990-1991 at a centralized STD clinic in Port of Spain. A case-control study was carried out to examine in greater detail the demographic and behavioral risk factors for HIV-1 among self-declared heterosexuals in this population. RESULTS: HIV-1 prevalence increased from 3.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3-3.9] in 1987-1988 to 13.6% (95% CI, 11.8-15.6) in 1990-1991. Age > or = 40 years [odds ratio (OR), 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8], urban residence (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.0), and human T-lymphotropic virus-I seropositivity (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.6-6.0) were significant risk factors for HIV-1 in 1990-1991. In the case-control analysis, significant independent risk factors for men included current genital ulcer disease (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.2-12.5), current genital warts (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.0), having ever had syphilis (OR, 3.2; 95% CI 1.6-6.1), and use of crack cocaine in the preceding 6 months (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.7-14.2). Corresponding risk factors for women were commercial sex work (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.3-25.7), initiation of sexual activity before age 14 years (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.5-16.0), and past non-gonococcal cervicitis (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.3-13.1). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 in this setting is primarily heterosexually transmitted in a milieu of unprotected sexual activity fuelled by a crack cocaine epidemic. Targeted interventions to prevent, detect and treat STD and crack cocaine addiction, as well as disrupt their adverse synergism, may substantially reduce HIV-1 transmission in this population."
1419131,1,a,"We examine the relationship between ethnicity and income as determinants of mammography use over a span of four years as a means of assessing community intervention impacts. The sample consisted of 1,447 women older than 34 years, living in Hawaii, who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The percentage of women in the sample reporting a screening mammogram within the past two years was 31.4% in 1987, 54.1% in 1989, and 51.6% in 1990. Women of Hawaiian ancestry had the lowest percentage of mammogram use in the past two years (38.7%), while Japanese women had the highest percentage (49.8%). Results of logistic regression analysis indicate a significant increase in mammography use from 1987 to 1989 and no difference from 1989 to 1990. Findings also showed an association between age, income, and ethnicity with use in the past two years. Greater age, higher income, and Japanese origin, compared to Hawaiian, were all independently associated with increased odds of having had a mammogram in the past two years. We discuss results in terms of program evaluation and future research implications for community health surveys."
9378866,1,a,"Levels of affective distress, sources of stress and coping strategies reported by first-year student nurses in Tayside, Scotland, were measured using the General Health Questionnaire (30-item version), the Beck & Srivastava Stress Inventory (BSSI) and a modified 'Ways of Coping Questionnaire'. Screening showed that, around the time of an initial series of hospital placements, 50.5% of students in cohort 1 (n = 109, week 40) and 67.9% of students in cohort 2 (n = 111, week 24) suffered significant affective distress. This exceeds levels reported in published studies of degree nursing students, fourth-year medical students, and the general female population. Distressed students reported the same sources of stress as the non-distressed students, but suffered them more intensely. Many BSSI items were seen as common sources of stress; however, the frequency with which an item was reported to be stressful was not related to whether scores on that item predicted overall distress. In both cohorts, the use of direct coping was associated with lower levels of distress, and with lower total stress scores on the BSSI. The use of fantasy and hostility was associated with high levels of distress and stress, in both groups. This screens of 220 first-year student nurses suggests that there is a problem with student distress around an initial series of general/surgical and psycho-social ward placements. The possible determinants of this distress and complex, and it is unlikely that presenting information alone will be sufficient to reduce this distress."
17661604,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months postpartum is promoted internationally as the preferred method of feeding infants. Infants of parents with a history of asthma in particular could benefit from a longer period (6 months) of breastfeeding, because this may reduce the chance of developing an allergic disease. The aim of this study was to identify psychosocial behavioral determinants of the intended duration and actual initiation of breastfeeding in families with a predisposition to asthma. METHODS: This prospective study was part of a randomized trial in which breastfeeding for 6 months was promoted. The 89 women participating completed a breastfeeding questionnaire based on the Attitude-Social Influence-Self-Efficacy model in the second trimester of their pregnancy. This served as the baseline measurement. RESULTS: Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses showed that attitudinal beliefs were significantly associated with the intended duration to breastfeed (p = 0.01) and the intention was the strongest predictor for the actual initiation of breastfeeding (OR: 8.2; 95% CI: 1.5 to 44.3). CONCLUSION: Breastfeeding promotion needs to focus on the health advantages and other advantages of breastfeeding for 6 months, especially in high-risk groups, in order to increase the intention to breastfeed, which appeared to be a strong predictor for actual behavior."
9731156,1,a,"The health of women involves their emotional, social, cultural, spiritual and physical well-being and is influenced by social, political and economic factors, as well as by a woman's biology. This definition of women's health provides the conceptual framework for a relevant and effective approach to patient education, health promotion and disease prevention activities in women. Such activities must focus not only on diseases that are more common, more prevalent or more serious in women, but also on priority health issues identified by women themselves, the diversity of women, the determinants of health and above all, the impact of gender on health. These programs must also be based on knowledge resulting from gender sensitive, bias-free health research. The traditional oppression and disempowerment of women must also be addressed at both personal and societal levels, thus broadening our approach so that we become social as well as health activists."
15595508,0,a,"Research on the social determinants of health has increasingly sought to understand the relative importance of different features of socioeconomic status. Much of the ensuing debate has wavered between education and income, with recent research leaning increasingly toward income. This research has not, however, consistently explored interactions between different features of socioeconomic status and, in trying to understand the independent effects of different components of socioeconomic status, may have missed important features of socioeconomic position. With an eye toward examining how features of socioeconomic status combine and coalesce, this paper examines variation in the income-health association by level of education. Theories derived both from medical sociology and health economics suggest synergistic interactions between income and education, but they are unclear as to the direction and magnitude of these interactions. Results from two large and nationally representative data sets (the 1996-1997 Community Tracking Study and the 1972-2000 General Social Survey) indicate that the positive relationship between income and health varies substantially in both its strength and shape by level of education. Education improves health, and its effects are larger at lower levels of income. Moreover, education reduces the strength and curvature of the income-health relationship. Consequently, those with more education have better health for all levels of income, and fewer income-based disparities exist among the well educated than among the less well educated. The linear ""gradient"" relationship between income and health is, thus, more characteristic of groups with higher levels of education. Additional analyses indicate that these interactions existed in the United States in each of the last three decades. The results are discussed in light of theory regarding the perpetuation of health disparities, as well as current debates regarding the apparent incompatibility of distributive versus aggregative goals in health policy."
16135394,0,a,"Racial differences in infant mortality in South Africa are studied using household-level data from 1987 to 1989 and 1998. Logistic regression models are estimated to explore the determinants of the overall trend in infant mortality and racial disparities in infants' survival chances. We do not find evidence for reduced overall risk of infant death among births that occurred from 1993 to 1998 when compared to those that occurred from 1982 to 1989, despite policy and action directed toward this goal by the new government that was elected in early 1994. We also find that persistent inequalities in the personal and household resources of South Africa's four main racial groups substantially account for racial differences in infant survival rates in both periods. These findings are discussed in light of contemporary social and health issues in South Africa."
16155281,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer, much is unknown about lung cancer etiology, including risk determinants for nonsmokers and modifying factors for smokers. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that alcohol consumption contributes to lung cancer risk. DESIGN: We conducted a pooled analysis using standardized exposure and covariate data from 7 prospective studies with 399,767 participants and 3137 lung cancer cases. Study-specific relative risks (RRs) and CIs were estimated and then combined to calculate pooled multivariate RRs by using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We found a slightly greater risk for the consumption of > or = 30 g alcohol/d than for that of 0 g alcohol/d in men (RR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.61; P for trend = 0.03) and in women (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.43; P for trend = 0.03). In male never smokers, the RR for consumption of > or = 15 g alcohol/d rather than 0 g alcohol/d was 6.38 (95% CI: 2.74, 14.9; P for trend < 0.001). In women, there were few never-smoking cases and no evidence of greater risk (RR: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.64, 2.87). Because of possible residual confounding by smoking, we performed sensitivity analyses by reclassifying the never smokers in the highest drinking category as former smokers. Resulting associations for alcohol consumption were somewhat attenuated, but P for trend = 0.05 for men, which was near the original P = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: A slightly greater risk of lung cancer was associated with the consumption of > or = 30 g alcohol/d than with no alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption was strongly associated with greater risk in male never smokers. Residual confounding by smoking may explain part of the observed relation."
10896759,0,a,"The aim of this research was to compare the effects of tailored or general nutrition messages on individuals' food knowledge, food consumption, and fiber intake. Past research in the area of food choice has applied the Theory of Reasoned Action or the Theory of Planned Behavior to identify the determinants of choice. Neither theory, however, is structured to allow the researcher to examine a person's attitudes toward a wide range of foods and then to specify which food(s) from among the set of foods to include in a nutrition message. In contrast, the Behavioral Alternatives Model (BAM) allows the researcher to examine attitudes toward behavioral alternatives (i.e. foods) and to identify which foods are most likely to be selected from among a set of foods. We used the BAM to specify the foods to include in a tailored nutrition message. The results indicated that respondents who received a tailored message derived from the BAM had more food-related knowledge and dietary changes in the recommended direction than the respondents who received a general message."
12862185,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Outcome in patients hospitalized for acute stroke varies considerably between populations. Within the framework of the GAIN International trial, a large multicenter trial of a neuroprotective agent (gavestinel, glycine antagonist), stroke outcome in relation to health care resource use has been compared in a large number of countries, allowing for differences in case mix. METHODS: This substudy includes 1,422 patients in 19 countries grouped into 10 regions. Data on prognostic variables on admission to hospital, resource use, and outcome were analyzed by regression models. RESULTS: All results were adjusted for differences in prognostic factors on admission (NIH Stroke Scale, age, comorbidity). There were threefold variations in the average number of days in hospital/institutional care (from 20 to 60 days). The proportion of patients who met with professional rehabilitation staff also varied greatly. Three-month case fatality ranged from 11% to 28%, and mean Barthel ADL score at three months varied between 64 and 73. There was no relationship between health care resource use and outcome in terms of survival and ADL function at three months. The proportion of patients living at home at three months did not show any relationship to ADL function across countries. CONCLUSIONS: There are wide variations in health care resource use between countries, unexplained by differences in case mix. Across countries, there is no obvious relationship between resource use and clinical outcome after stroke. Differences in health care traditions (treatment pathways) and social context seem to be major determinants of resource use. In making comparisons between countries, great care should be exercised in using outcome variables as indicators of quality of stroke care."

19067262,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the use of psychotropic drugs and alcohol among non-institutionalised elderly adults in Germany. METHODS: Using data from the 1998 German National Health Interview and Examination Survey, we analysed patterns of current psychotropic drug and alcohol use among 726 male and 879 female survey participants between the ages of 60 and 79. Multivariable regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with alcohol consumption and psychotropic drug use. RESULTS: The overall weighted last-week prevalence was 20.1% for the use of psychotropic drugs, 47.3% for the use of alcohol, 15.1% for risky drinking, and 7.6% for combined psychotropic drug and alcohol use. Factors significantly related to psychotropic drug use included female sex, older age, poor health status and polypharmacy. Male sex, smoking, higher social status, better health status and living alone were determinants of alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other European countries, overall psychotropic drug use among the elderly in Germany is slightly lower, whereas alcohol use as risky drinking and concurrent use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs are highly prevalent. It should be of particular concern to health professionals that people at high risk for psychotropic drug use include the most vulnerable subgroups among the elderly."
9080569,1,a,"This is an analysis of system integration, social stratification and work for health status and health care in East and West Germany. It is based on aggregate data and representative survey data of random samples of 2554 adults in both subsystems. Findings show that there were marked differences in life-expectancy prior to unification. The integration of the two systems, which occurred almost totally with regard to terms of West German health care organization, shows adjustment problems in the East for the public Health-Care-Funds and few if any for ambulatory care. The work situation has an impact on health, but there are no significant differences for East versus West. Social stratification variables show an influence on subjective health status for education (East) and for income, social status (West), while physician utilization (despite a preference of specialists by those with higher status) is not significantly determined by stratification variables in either East or West Germany. Beyond the central focus on work and stratification determinants a major finding pertains to a comparatively worse health situation for the aged and for women in what was the former East Germany. System models of Capitalism versus Socialism fit the results and recent history of the two systems to only a limited degree, as the West German corporate health system shows clear limits in following free market principles. The East German system, regardless of its centralized organization and move towards a socialist system, never fully abandoned the traditional model of German health care. Unlike the East German health system, that of West Germany, with its general expansion to 92% of the population, shows an increasing effect for social redistribution. The latter may be a reason why standard indicators of social stratification show less of an impact on health and health care than expected, while conditions at work clearly determine the health of people-the latter being the case in both the former East and West Germany."
18372875,0,a,"Health promotion first entered the South African health system in 1990. Today, Health Promotion is a Directorate located within the Social Sector Cluster (SSC) within Primary Health Care (PHC), District and Development operations which falls under the Deputy Director General for Health Service Delivery in the National Department of Health (DoH). The first significant piece of new policy for health promotion in South Africa appeared in the African National Congress (ANC) health policy document, health care services including reproductive health care. At the moment, health promotion service delivery is the responsibility of the national, provincial and local governments with provincial and local governments mainly implementing and the National Health Promotion Directorate offering support. Funding for health promotion activities comes from the Department of Health budget allocation by the National Treasury. One major problem for Health Promotion development is infrastructure. There is significant community participation in South Africa including health promotion policy and strategy document development. Health Promotion research and evaluation is limited. The National Department of Health considers the settings approach to be crucial in driving the progress of health promotion. There are very few trained health promotion specialists either capable or in the position to inform politicians and opinion leaders about the relationship between health and social determinants, and the evidence of effectiveness of health promotion action. Mechanisms for demonstrating evidence of health promotion effectiveness in terms of health, social, economic and political impact are lacking and occupational standards for health promotion education and training are needed."
10369442,1,a,"We examined the influence of demographic, social and economic background of people with HIV/AIDS in London on total community and hospital services costs. This was a retrospective study of community and hospital service use, needs and costs based on structured questionnaires administered by trained interviewers and costing information obtained from the service purchasers and providers, based on two Genito-urinary Medicine clinics in London: the Jefferiss Wing at St. Mary's Hospital and Patric Clements at the Central Middlesex Hospital, London, England. The subjects were 225 HIV infected patients (105 asymptomatic, 59 symptomatic non-AIDS and 61 AIDS). We found that over and above well established determinants of health care costs for HIV infected people such as disease stage and transmission category, social and economic factors such as employment and support of a living-in partner significantly reduced community services costs. Private health insurance had a similar effect, though only a small proportion of HIV people had such cover. The cost of community services for HIV infected non-European Union nationals, mainly of African origin, was one quarter that for the European Union nationals. Community services costs were highest for heterosexually infected women and lowest for heterosexually infected men after adjusting for other factors. Hospital services costs were significantly higher for HIV infected people lacking educational qualifications and employment. We conclude that access to community care for HIV infected non-EU nationals appears to be very poor as the cost of their community services was one quarter that for the EU nationals after adjusting for the effects of transmission category, disease stage, living with a partner, employment and having a private health insurance. Additional incentives for informal care for HIV infected people could be a cost-effective way to improve their community health service provisions."
7577560,1,a,"While most studies on the determinants of learning deal with either cognition or motivation, there is a growing awareness that both should be considered. Our purpose was to examine the relative roles of cognitive and motivational factors for the scholastic achievement and behaviour of disadvantaged children. Cognition was conceptualised in terms of the psychosemantic theory that assesses cognitive processes by characteristics of the individual's meaning assignment (Kreitler & Kreitler, 1987a). Motivation was conceptualised in terms of the cognitive orientation (CO) theory which assumes that cognitive contents guide behaviour (Kreitler & Kreitler, 1982). Participants were 57 third and fourth graders of both genders, recommended for a remedial summer programme. They were administered the Meaning Test assessing cognitive abilities; the CO Questionnaire of Motivation for Learning assessing the disposition to learn; and the Metropolitan Achievement Test and the IOWA tests assessing verbal, mathematical and working skills. Teachers completed the Teacher-Child Rating Scale assessing six scholastic behaviours. Regression analyses showed that all dependent variables were predicted by the cognitive and motivational variables, better by specific than global predictors. Cognitive variables contributed more to the predictions, especially of academic achievements, and more in the case of verbal than mathematical abilities. In girls, motivational factors played a larger role than cognitive factors, absolutely and relative to boys. Implications for promoting scholastic achievements are discussed."
15822090,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: We examined the potential for ethnicity to moderate the relationships between awareness and internalization of sociocultural ideals of appearance and between internalization and body dissatisfaction. METHOD: Spanish (n = 100), Mexican American (n = 100), and European American (n = 100) female participants completed measures of sociocultural attitudes and body dissatisfaction. Path analysis using maximum likelihood with robust standard errors tested the relationships across and within ethnic groups. RESULTS: There was evidence for the mediational effect of internalization on the relationship between awareness and body dissatisfaction. Furthermore, both relationships were significantly stronger for European American women than for Mexican American or Spanish women (the predicted moderator effect). DISCUSSION: Results demonstrate how ethnicity may protect against the development of eating disorder symptoms and suggest that eating disorder prevention should involve denouncing the thin ideal, minimizing appearance as an indicator of value, and emphasizing traits other than appearance as determinants of worth."
17806340,1,a,"Social insects live in societies that include both reproductive and nonreproductive adults. Understanding the factors that determine which individuals become successful reproductives is necessary to explain the evolution of these societies. The phenotypic effects of the gene Pgm-3 (or a closely linked gene) that may cause workers of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta to selectively execute all queens of a specific genotype were investigated. These effects, which involve differences in queen reproductive development, are expressed only in colonies exhibiting a particular type of social organization (multiple-queen colonies), and it is only in such colonies that selective execution on the basis of genotype occurs. This is an unusual example of genotype-environment interaction in gene expression in which the environmental component is the social environment. The queens executed are, surprisingly, those with the greatest reproductive development. Thus, there is a counterintuitive relation between the potential and realized reproductive success of queens in multiple-queen societies of this ant."
15456977,0,a,"Reform of the Lithuanian health system is a challenging process. The aim of this article is to assess the role of health managers in the process of health reform, evaluating the perception of health management and their training needs, as the possible determinants for the success of the reform. The results of several questionnaire surveys of Lithuanian health managers, particularly the one carried out in 2002 are used. The studies demonstrate great diversity in the conceptual understanding of health management, with prevailing rational and technical understanding. This might be associated with the rapid structural and organizational changes in the early stages of health reform and insufficient involvement of health managers in the planning and management of changes. General management, health policy, economic and law are considered as the most important study areas for health managers. The major lacking knowledge is in the subjects of law, economics and health financing. Health managers should act as mediators between politicians and health professionals. Enlargement of the area of competences, increasing autonomy in solving problems and meeting of the training needs of health managers is essential."
7932483,1,a,"Knowledge of dangers of sexual promiscuity was assessed in 2 institutions of higher learning. The objectives were to find out the knowledge of medical and social consequences as well as the factors responsible for sexual promiscuity among Nigerian youths. The study also assessed the discrepancies in societal concept of sex norms for males and females. The result was used as an index to determine the need for sex education for Nigerian youths. A total of 200 students (100 from each school) was assessed by random selection and use of a questionnaire. The result showed that students had a fair knowledge of sexual promiscuity, although in terms of medical consequences the knowledge was low for both groups. On social consequences, the knowledge was fair for both groups. Students agreed that lack of financial support and of supervision from parents and teachers were among the causes of sexual promiscuity. Recommendations were made for Health Education in these areas in institutions of higher learning. Also, recommendations were made for parental education on how to bring up, and care for, their adolescents to reduce the problems of sexual promiscuity. It was also recommended that a compulsory course on sexual promiscuity should be included in the syllabus in institutions of higher learning."
15081204,0,a,"This new study goes beyond the well-established correlation between mortality differentials and occupational status, to focus on the impact of professional careers on mortality risk. It shows heterogeneity in the mortality risks within occupational classes, strongly related to the type of occupational moves experienced. The occupational data are taken from the French longitudinal census sample-using 1968 and 1975 census records-and mortality risks are estimated over the 1975-1980 period, for both occupational classes and pathways between classes. Results show a close relationship between occupational mobility and mortality. For men, favorable occupational moves-e.g. from clerks to upper class-put them less at risk of mortality than their counterparts who remained in their class. An inverse relationship is found for unfavorable moves. In most cases, the mortality risks of the movers are in between the risks in the class left and in the class joined. Similar patterns apply to specific groups of women only (upper classes, manual workers, clerks) for which occupational moves are probably driven, as for most men, by mortality related determinants (level of education, qualifications, health, etc.). The findings strongly support the use of a dynamic approach, based on individuals' experiences, to improve our understanding of mortality differentials."
9136289,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in physical functioning, pain, and depressive symptoms among newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with severe disease. METHODS: Data are from 118 non-Hispanic patients of European origin at baseline of a longitudinal study of early, severe RA. Outcome measures with the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) functional disability index, the HAQ visual analog pain scale, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using a health status block (disease activity and comorbidities), a non-SES related social structure block (age, sex and Lubben Social Network Scale), and indicators of SES (income and education). RESULTS: Non-SES related social structure and SES were important independent determinants of functional disability and depressive symptoms, but both they and the health status variables were unrelated to pain. Further, neither income nor education was related to disease activity or comorbidities. CONCLUSION: It cannot be argued from these data that poorer health status explains the link between SES and disability and depressive symptoms. Although, at baseline, the psychosocial effects of early RA are more severe for those with SES, the disease does not appear to be more severe. It may be that the biologic impact of status differentials will become clearer as the effects of treatment and the course of the disease unfold over time."

Clinical judges were found to make reasonably accurate predictions about the short term outcome of schizophrenia and their statements were better than chance agreements."
10360019,1,a,"Racial/ethnic minority adolescents are reported to have lower general health status, including higher prevalence of many infectious diseases, than white, non-Hispanic youth. Factors such as lower socioeconomic position, neighborhoods they live in, different cultural views on health, and different role of the family in health care providing are all thought to contribute to this situation. This chapter comprehensively reviews the existing data on the health status of minority adolescents, social, demographic, educational and cultural determinants of racial/ethnic minority populations and how they might interfere with health care delivery to the adolescents, and discusses the need for initiatives to improve the existing conditions."
2363060,1,a,"As malaria grows more prevalent in the Amazon frontier despite increased expenditures by disease control authorities, national and regional tropical disease control strategies are being called into question. The current crisis involving traditional control/eradication methods has broadened the search for feasible and effective malaria control strategies--a search that necessarily includes an investigation of the roles of a series of individual and community-level socioeconomic characteristics in determining malaria prevalence rates, and the proper methods of estimating these links. In addition, social scientists and policy makers alike know very little about the economic costs associated with malarial infections. In this paper, I use survey data from several Brazilian gold mining areas to (a) test the general reliability of malaria-related questionnaire response data, and suggest categorization methods to minimize the statistical influence of exaggerated responses, (b) estimate three statistical models aimed at detecting the socioeconomic determinants of individual malaria prevalence rates, and (c) calculate estimates of the average cost of a single bout of malaria. The results support the general reliability of survey response data gathered in conjunction with malaria research. Once the effects of vector exposure were controlled for, individual socioeconomic characteristics were only weakly linked to malaria prevalence rates in these very special miners' communities. Moreover, the socioeconomic and exposure links that were significant did not depend on the measure of malaria adopted. Finally, individual costs associated with malarial infections were found to be a significant portion of miners' incomes."

8634561,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patients' initial perceptions of their myocardial infarction predict subsequent attendance at a cardiac rehabilitation course, return to work, disability, and sexual dysfunction. DESIGN: Patients' perceptions of their illness were measured at admission with their first myocardial infarction and at follow up three and six months later. SETTING: Two large teaching hospitals in Auckland, New Zealand. SUBJECTS: 143 consecutive patients aged under 65 with their first myocardial infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attendance at rehabilitation course; time before returning to work; measures of disability with sickness impact profile questionnaire for sleep and rest, social interaction, recreational activity, and home management; and sexual dysfunction. RESULTS: Attendance at the rehabilitation course was significantly related to a stronger belief during admission that the illness could be cured or controlled (t = 2.08, P = 0.04). Return to work within six weeks was significantly predicted by the perception that the illness would last a short time (t = 2.52, P = 0.01) and have less grave consequences for the patient (t = 2.87, P = 0.005). Patients' belief that their heart disease would have serious consequences was significantly related to later disability in work around the house, recreational activities, and social interaction. A strong illness identity was significantly related to greater sexual dysfunction at both three and six months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' initial perceptions of illness are important determinants of different aspects of recovery after myocardial infarction. Specific illness perceptions need to be identified at an early stage as a basis for optimising outcomes from rehabilitation programmes."

The variables adopted were Type A behavior, self-esteem, achievement striving, hyperactivity and social maladjustment. The results indicate a tendency for boys with parental CHD to be characterized by higher scores on Type A behavior, lower self-esteem and more intense striving for achievement compared to their matched controls. Girls with parental CHD differed from their matched controls in the predicted direction only in one respect: a higher level of hyperactivity was characteristic for cases."
18022299,0,a,"This research explored the relationships between race/ethnicity and area factors affecting access to health care in the United States. The study represents an advance on previous research in this field because, in addition to including data on rurality, it incorporates additional contextual covariates describing aspects of health care accessibility. Individual-level data were obtained from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The county of residence reported by BRFSS respondents was used to link BRFSS data with county-level measures of health care access from the 2004 Area Resource File (ARF). Analyses of mammography were limited to women aged 40 years with known county of residence (n=91,492). Analyses of Pap testing were limited to women aged 18 years with no history of hysterectomy and known county of residence (n=97,820). In addition to individual-level covariates such as race, Hispanic ethnicity, health insurance coverage and routine physical exam in the previous year. We examined county-level covariates (residence in health professional shortage area, urban/rural continuum, racial/ethnic composition, and number of health centers/clinics, mammography screening centers, primary care physicians, and obstetrician-gynecologists per 100,000 female population or per 1000 square miles) as predictors of cancer screening. Both individual-level and contextual covariates are associated with the use of breast and cervical cancer screening. In the current study, covariates associated with health care access, such as health insurance coverage, household income, Black race, and percentage of county female population who were non-Hispanic Black, were important determinants of screening use. In multivariate analysis, we found significant interactions between individual-level covariates and contextual covariates. Among women who reside in areas with lower primary care physician supply, rural women are less likely than urban women to have had a recent Pap test. Black women were more likely than White women to have had a recent Pap test. Women with a non-rural county of residence were more likely to have had a recent mammogram than rural women. A significant interaction was also found between individual-level race and number of health centers or clinics per 100,000 population (p-value=0.0187). In counties with 2 or more health centers or clinics per 100,000 female population, Black women were more likely than White women to have had a recent mammogram. A significant interaction was also observed between the percentage of county female population who were Hispanic and the percentage who were non-Hispanic Black."

On June 14 and 15, 2004, the NIH held a meeting of experts to discuss the issue of modifiable determinants of obesity in children and adolescents. Included were presentations on interventions among children that have been proven effective, dietary and physical activity behavioral determinants, physical, social, and family environmental determinants, and the quality of measures of determinants and correlates of overweight."

Asymmetric procreation behaviour of this kind is modelled by assuming that a female's procreation ceases only after at least one son or n daughters are born. It is shown that such asymmetric procreation behaviour has no effect on the sex ratio of the society, but influences rather the growth rate of the population. Finally, problems concerning the interrelationship between the sex ratio, the pattern of procreation, and the marriage regime in stationary populations are investigated."""
9244971,1,a,"Communication between asylum seekers/refugees and general practitioners/physicians of the three main outpatient sectors for the Swiss national Health System (general practice, medical outpatient and accident & emergency departments) are being described and analysed. The data have been collected during three cross-sectional studies investigating the health status of asylum seekers and refugees and the health services provided to them. These studies addressed the problem exclusively from the point of view of the health care providers. Data on language capabilities, sociocultural aspects of communication and the necessity and availability of interpreters have been collected with questionnaires. The main results of the questionnaires have been followed up in group discussions with general practitioners. The majority of general practitioners/physicians felt that most of the communication problems were related to speaking a common language. Only about one out of two adult asylum seekers/refugees knew German, French, Italian or English. Particularly during the group discussions it was brought forward that cultural and social factors additionally complicate communication during patient-doctor interactions. When the data of the outpatient consultations of the main studies were analysed, it became obvious that interpreters were significantly more often present in consultations with patients with psychological/psychosocial diagnoses than those with somatic diagnoses (72% vs. 55%). This can be interpreted in two ways: (1) if a patient suffers from a psychological/psychosocial problem, it is more likely that an interpreter will be asked to assist during the consultation or (2) if an interpreter is present during a consultation, it is more likely that a psychological/psychosocial problem will be detected. With the exception of children, most of the general practitioners/physicians felt that non-professional interpreters (relatives, friends) were adequate for coping with most of the tasks. The following areas for improvements were identified: (1) availability of professional interpreters and quality as well as organisational issues related to interpretation, (2) language training for asylum seekers and refugees and (3) creation of awareness among general practitioners/physicians towards cultural and socioeconomic determinants of patient-doctor interactions and training."
1927676,1,a,"The relationship of familial, demographic, and individual characteristics to the probability of pregnancy was examined among 124 sexually active adolescent females. Logistic regression analyses revealed that adolescent pregnancy status was a function of a combination of demographic and familial variables. Adolescents who were pregnant at the time of the study perceived their families as having low levels of family strength, perceived communication with parents as closed, came from homes characterized by family fragmentation (i.e., only one parent or no parent living in the home), came from low-income households, were unlikely to use any method of birth control, and were more likely to be married than their nonpregnant counterparts."
16351702,0,a,"PURPOSE: To review the current literature about potential determinants of fruit and vegetable intakes and effective intervention strategies to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables among 6-12-year-old children. METHODS: A structured review of literature located in PubMed and Psychinfo electronic literature databases. RESULTS: Of all determinants, the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables and taste preferences were most consistently and most positively related to consumption. There was some evidence that parental fruit and vegetable intakes, knowledge of intake recommendations and skills had a positive association with children's intakes, whereas television viewing, exposure to television advertisement, and having a snack bar at school were associated with lower intakes of fruit and vegetables. Multi-component school-based interventions that combined classroom curriculum, parent and food service components showed the greatest promise for fruit and vegetable promotion among children. School fruit and vegetable subscription programmes, scout-based interventions, and fruit and vegetables education via computer multi-media channels also appear promising. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions should improve the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables to children, and should aim to improve their taste preferences for them. Such interventions should be of a multi-component nature, school-based or use other social channels and may include multi-media channels."
12317659,1,a,"Using data from the Population, Labor Force, and Migration (PLM) Survey of 1979-80, this paper examines the component of potential motivation for fertility limitation among Pakistani married women and then determines what factor are important in explaining the contraceptive use differentials among the potentially motivated subgroup of women. The analysis is conducted using logit regression models. The findings show that, among women wanting no additional children, a substantial proportion is reluctant to adopt fertility control behavior, confirming the existence of latent demand for contraception in all strata. A majority of those women report no exposure to the program or no contact with a family planning worker, and a large majority of those who have had exposure or have been contacted do not report contraceptive use, indicating a considerable shortfall of the program. Among the urban women wanting no more children, the important factors affecting contracepting use positively are education (both primary and secondary), household income, living in a nuclear family, exposure to the program, and contact with a family planning worker, for rural women, only nuclear family living and the program factors are significant in promoting contraceptive use. The suggestions likely to increase contraceptive prevalence are, first, to reach those women who have the potential motivation for contraception, and, second, to increase the quality and sources of the motivation efforts of the program to crystallize the latent demand among those who need it."

Her rating of the health of the members of her household is related to her age, her socioeconomic status, and her rating of her own health. Satisfaction with the physical health of the members of the household is a function her health, her rating of the health of her household, her age, her socioeconomic status and the number of children she has borne. The overall conclusion is that, in this study, it is socioeconomic and demographic factors that are important in determining the woman's health status, rather than the receipt of job-related benefits. That she reports good health is an important factor in her view of her family's health and her satisfaction with her own health and that of her family."
12822687,0,a,"Four pigeons were exposed to a token-based self-control procedure with stimulus lights serving as token reinforcers. Smaller-reinforcer choices produced one token immediately; larger-reinforcer choices produced three tokens following a delay. Each token could be exchanged for 2-s access to food during a signaled exchange period each trial. The main variables of interest were the exchange delays (delays from the choice to the exchange stimulus) and the food delays (also timed from the choice), which were varied separately and together across blocks of sessions. When exchange delays and food delays were shorter following smaller-reinforcer choices, strong preference for the smaller reinforcer was observed. When exchange delays and food delays were equal for both options, strong preference for the larger reinforcer was observed. When food delays were equal for both options but exchange delays were shorter for smaller-reinforcer choices, preference for the larger reinforcer generally was less extreme than under conditions in which both exchange and food delays were equal. When exchange delays were equal for both options but food delays were shorter for smaller-reinforcer choices, preference for the smaller reinforcer generally was less extreme than under conditions in which both exchange and food delays favored smaller-reinforcer choices. On the whole, the results were consistent with prior research on token-based self-control procedures in showing that choices are governed by reinforcer immediacy when exchange and food delays are unequal and by reinforcer amount when exchange and food delays are equal. Further, by decoupling the exchange delays from food delays, the results tentatively support a role for the exchange stimulus as a conditioned reinforcer."
15046963,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the personality dimensions, neuroticism and alexithymia, and the affective state dimensions measuring negative and positive affect significantly contributed to changes over time in the number of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) reported. METHODS: A total of 318 patients, presenting to their primary care physician with MUS, participated in the study. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess to what extent neuroticism, alexithymia, negative affect and positive affect independently contributed to (1) increase vs. decrease in the number of symptoms reported, and (2) the presence of a consistently high number of MUS over a 6-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Negative affect was the strongest determinant of changes in the number of symptoms reported. In addition, low positive affect significantly contributed to changes in the number of symptoms over time. Next to negative affect, the dimension of alexithymia measuring difficulty in identifying feelings (DIF) was found to be an independent predictor of a consistently high number of MUS. Neither neuroticism nor general alexithymia independently contributed to changes in the number of symptoms over time or to symptom persistence. CONCLUSIONS: Negative affect is an important determinant of MUS, because it contributes both to symptom evolution and symptom persistence. Positive affect has a beneficial effect on somatic symptom evolution, whereas the alexithymia dimension measuring DIF clearly contributes to the prediction of symptom persistence."
11522137,0,a,"This ecological study investigated the associations between social deprivation, income inequality and social cohesion and dental caries levels in school children of the Distrito Federal, Brazil. Three sources of data were used: (1) area-based data from a 1997 social survey carried out on 13,000 families, (2) 1995 census data collected for the Government of the Distrito Federal (GDF), and (3) dental caries data from a 1997 oral health survey on 7296 6-12-year-old school children. Results of simple linear regression showed that percent with less than eight years of education (P = 0.03) and percent who did not have a maid (P = 0.009), were negatively statistically significantly associated with the percent of children free of caries. None of the deprivation measures were statistically significantly associated with mean DMF-T scores (P > 0.05). GINI coefficient, an indicator of social inequalities, was negatively statistically significantly associated with both measures of dental caries experience, percent of caries free (P = 0.003) and mean DMF-T scores (P = 0.01). Per thousand number of homicides or attempted homicides, an indicator of social cohesion was of marginal statistical significance associated with caries experience. Results of multiple linear regression analyses showed that only the Gini coefficient remained statistically significantly associated with both dental clinical measures used, after adjusting for potential confounding. In conclusion, relative rather than absolute levels of income were stronger determinants of the onset of caries in this study."
17761378,0,a,"Obesity in the United States has been linked to individual income and education. Less is known about its geographic distribution. The goal of this study was to determine whether obesity rates in King County, Washington State, at the ZIP code scale were associated with area-based measures of socioeconomic status and wealth. Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analyzed. At the ZIP code scale, crude obesity rates varied six-fold. In a model adjusting for covariates and spatial dependence, property values were the strongest predictor of the area-based smoothed obesity prevalence. Geocoding of health data provides new insights into the nature of social determinants of health. Disparities in obesity rates by ZIP code area were greater than disparities associated with individual income or race/ethnicity."
15210092,0,a,"Social capital is an increasingly popular construct in research examining social and behavioral determinants of health and well-being. Yet, comparing the results of social capital research is inhibited by inconsistencies in labeling, different definitions and subsequent disagreement on level of analysis, and limited evaluation of the psychometric properties of measures of social capital. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Social Capital Questionnaire (Journal of Applied Behavioral Science 36(1) (2000) 23). In the current study, the original Australian-based instrument was modified for telephone administration with a US sample. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a similar factor structure to that found during initial survey development. These findings lend support to the notion of social capital as a meaningful construct and suggest the Onyx and Bullen instrument deserves further attention as a practical tool for health researchers and community agencies interested in social capital."
11470388,0,a,"A population-based study of 1810 persons, aged 75+, was investigated to evaluate the role of dementia and other chronic diseases as determinants of institutionalization in the elderly. The study population was examined at baseline and after a 3-year interval. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, functional dependence, dementia, cerebrovascular disease and hip fracture were associated with living in an institution at baseline. Additionally, functional dependence, hip fracture and dementia were also associated with moving to an institution during the 3-year follow-up. In a similar analysis, including only nondemented subjects, the Mini-Mental State Examination emerged as one of the strongest determinants. The population attributable risk percentage of institutionalization during the 3-year follow-up due to dementia was 61%. This study confirms that dementia and cognitive impairment are the main contributors to institutionalization in the elderly, independently of their sociodemographic status, social network, or functional status."
9224179,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether purchase of a handgun from a licensed dealer is associated with the risk of homicide or suicide and whether any association varies in relation to time since purchase. METHODS: A case-control study was done among the members of a large health maintenance organization. Case subjects were the 353 suicide victims and 117 homicide victims among the members from 1980 through 1992. Five control subjects were matched to each case subject on age, sex, and zip code of residence. Handgun purchase information was obtained from the Department of Licensing. RESULTS: The adjusted relative risk of suicide was 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 2.5) for persons with a history of family handgun purchase from a registered dealer. The adjusted relative risk for homicide, given a history of family handgun purchase, was 2.2 (95% CI = 1.3, 3.7). For both suicide and homicide, the elevated relative risks persisted for more than 5 years after the purchase. CONCLUSIONS: Legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death."
18833350,0,a,"As we have seen a global increase in asthma in the past three decades it has also become clear that it is a socially patterned disease, based on demographic and socioeconomic indicators clustered by areas of residence. This trend is not readily explained by traditional genetic paradigms or physical environmental exposures when considered alone. This has led to consideration of the interplay among physical and psychosocial environmental hazards and the molecular and genetic determinants of risk (i.e., biomedical framing) within the broader socioenvironmental context including socioeconomic position as an upstream ""cause of the causes"" (i.e., ecological framing). Transdisciplinary research strategies or programs that embrace this complexity through a shared conceptual framework that integrates diverse discipline-specific theories, models, measures, and analytical methods into ongoing asthma research may contribute most significantly toward furthering our understanding of socially patterned disease. This paper provides an overview of a multilevel, multimethod longitudinal study, the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment and Social Stress (ACCESS), as a case study to exemplify both the opportunities and challenges of transdisciplinary research on urban asthma expression in the United States."
8847107,1,a,"In the coming decades, demographic, economic and social changes will result in an increased proportion of elderly persons in the workforce in most industrialized countries. This trend is causing growing interest in the problems of the aging worker in current employment. The objective of this particular paper is to provide more insight into the impact of aging on the balance between physical work capacity and physical workload. To this end, the scientific literature in the field is reviewed and ordered by means of a specific conceptual model of ""aging and physical workload"". A progressive decline in physical work capacity, characterized by diminished aerobic capacity and muscular capacity, has consistently been reported. However, inter-individual differences appear to be considerable. The question of whether there are systematic differences in physical work demands between younger and older workers within occupations has been answered vaguely. Conflicting results in this matter bring into discussion the role of the actual working method as one of the determinants of the physical workload. An age-related imbalance between physical workload and physical work capacity is suggested to result in a chronic overload, increasing the risk of long-term health effects such as musculoskeletal complaints and disorders. For many aging workers in physically demanding occupations, extreme physical workloads, increasing the risk of disease or disablement, are still reported. The multiconceptual study of aging and physical workload in the present paper reveals several possibilities for preventive measures. However, as information is still lacking, additional research is needed, in particular on the onset and development of long-term effects on health in relation to age and work demands."
10163955,1,a,"The phenomenon of maintenance of health-related physical activity is explored through an analysis of the underlying concepts and of the existing empirical evidence. The following targets were used for the analysis: (1) the concept of health-related physical activity, (2) the concept of maintenance, (3) common manifestations of maintenance in everyday living, (4) the promotional and behavioral characteristics of health-related physical activity, (5) the known determinants of free-living physical activity, and (6) intervention trials on physical activity in free-living groups. The analyses revealed the inherent resistance to adoption and maintenance of physical activity, particularly that of high-intensity and program-centered activities, the persistence, however, of many simple everyday routines and habits, the multiple determinants discovered for free-living physical activity and a few empirical demonstrations of the successful promotion of the maintenance of physical activity over a year or two. The promotion of the maintenance of health-related physical activity seems thus a distinct possibility provided that (1) the promotional situation is analyzed thoroughly, (2) the activity is chosen carefully with an emphasis on moderation in intensity and integration into the participant's life-style, (3) multiple promotional contacts are used, and (4) support from the participant's social and physical environment is provided. There is a need for more research on the maintenance of health-related physical activity using the stages of change models, behavior modification principles, self-control concepts, the concept of intrinsic motivation and the Relapse model. The method of analysis used here could apply to other health-related behaviors as well."
12292532,1,a,"""Immigrants' attachments to home and their assimilation into the host society have been identified as major factors influencing international return migration. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the determinants of attachment and assimilation, with a special focus on the impact of duration of stay. Using survey data on guestworkers in West Germany in 1984 and 1989, the study finds that assimilation increases at a decreasing rate as the duration of stay is extended. The relationship between attachment and length of stay is less strong, but shows a general trend of decreasing attachment levels as guestworkers prolong their stay in Germany. The resulting trends for return migration are characterized by an overall decline in the propensity to return as the duration of stay is extended. However, the rate of decline varies by gender, marital status, and nationality. Overall, the results allude to the importance of distinguishing between short term and long term immigrants."""
12471853,0,a,"I examine racial differences in child stunting in mid-1990s South Africa and Brazil, two multiracial societies with different histories of legal support for racial discrimination. Using data from nationally representative household samples linked to community-level measures, the analysis shows that racial inequality in the distribution of socioeconomic resources across households and communities explains much of the racial difference in stunting in both countries. Even after these factors are controlled, however, the results indicate that in South Africa, nonwhite children are still at greater risk of growth faltering than are white children. The nature of socioeconomic and racial differences in children's growth is examined, and major determinants are discussed. These findings suggest that although state-sanctioned racism may help to explain the greater racial inequality in stunting in South Africa than in Brazil, the eradication of a disadvantage for nonwhites will depend on changes in the same fundamental socioeconomic inequalities that characterize both nations."
8563660,1,a,"The CAMCOG, which forms part of the CAMDEX interview (Roth et al., 1986, 1988), is a brief neuropsychological battery designed to assess the range of cognitive functions required for a diagnosis of dementia, and to detect mild degrees of cognitive impairment. It was administered to a population sample of 418 elderly people (aged 77 and above) in their place of residence. The data show that in contrast to the Mini-Mental State Examination, total CAMCOG scores are well distributed and there is no ceiling effect. Examination of the association between CAMCOG scores and socio-demographic variables (age, sex, education and social class) shows that each exerts a significant, and independent, effect upon performance. CAMCOG also includes a number of subscale which assess individual areas of cognitive function. Of the eight major subscales (orientation, language, memory, attention, praxis, calculation, abstract thinking, perception), age was significantly related to all but attention; sex with attention, praxis, calculation and perception; education with language and abstract thinking; and social class with language and perception. In all these analyses, the results were adjusted for the effects of the other socio-demographic variables using analysis of variance. However, education and social class are highly correlated variables and when the association with education is examined without adjusting for social class, attention and praxis are also found to be significantly related to education. Caution must therefore be taken when using the CAMCOG (or any other cognitive test) as a screening test for dementia, using a single, predetermined cutpoint. In general, the combination of brevity and breadth of the CAMCOG, along with its distributional properties, makes it an attractive neuropsychological test for use in the community or the clinic."
8793313,1,a,"German alcoholics were examined for a profile of drinking situations which was found recently in North American alcoholics. A mixed sample of alcoholics (N = 336) receiving in-patient rehabilitation treatment for alcoholism was administered a validated translation of the English version of Annis's Inventory of Drinking Situations (IDS). Analysis of the 100 items in the questionnaire, using principal component methods and varimax rotation, revealed the same three factorial scales seen in the previous study in North American alcoholics (Cannon et al. (1990) Addictive Behaviour 15, 265-269). Drinking was most likely to take place in situations (1) of negative states, (2) of positive states, and (3) where personal control was tested. Although there are large differences in the level and social acceptability of drinking between Central Europe and English-speaking countries, the present data confirm the cross-cultural validity of basic determinants of drinking."
10606101,1,a,"Extending past work testing goal perspective theory in sport, one purpose of this study was to examine, via a longitudinal design, the relationship of goal orientations to the beliefs about the causes of success in the case of elite male Dutch soccer players. A second purpose was to determine the relationship of goals and beliefs to ratings of performance. Seventy-five male pupils representing five teams from an internationally renowned soccer school in The Netherlands completed the TEOSQ and a measure of their perceptions of the determinants of success in soccer at the onset and conclusion of one season. Assessments of the coaches' appraisal and athletes' self-reported performance in soccer were carried out at the same time. In line with other studies, a positive association between ego orientation and the belief that ability or innate talent are determinants of success was revealed. Task orientation was linked to the beliefs that effort, team play, and parental support contribute to achievement in soccer. An increase in skilled performance over the season (as appraised by the coach) corresponded to a stronger task orientation and the beliefs that soccer success stems from hard work and having supportive parents."
9427096,1,a,"AIM: The objective of this study was to examine service utilization figures among a representative sample of demented patients and to determine whether sociodemographic and health-related variables are associated with care utilization. METHOD: The study population was derived from a population-based, two-stage cross-sectional study in The Netherlands and consisted of 102 demented subjects. Four levels of care intensity were used: level 1, no use of professional care; level 2, use of one or more types of professional care by community-dwelling subjects; level 3, residential living in homes for the aged; level 4, long-term care in specialized nursing homes. Sociodemographic variables and variables related to mental and physical health, functional dependency and severity of dementia were studied as determinants of levels of care. RESULTS: Eighty-two per cent of the study subjects used one or more types of formal care and 55% were institutionalized. Multivariate analysis yielded age, severity of dementia, somatic disorders, dependency in terms of ADL and martial status as predictors of higher levels of care. Sets of predictors differed across different care levels. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the importance of the social network and the relevance of general medical treatment and an active approach towards decreasing the impact of ADL dependency in demented subjects."
10519460,1,a,"This investigation predicted adolescents' delay of intercourse onset from attitudes, social norms, and self-efficacy about refraining from sexual intercourse. Age, gender, ethnicity, and parental education were also examined as predictors and moderators of the relationships among the 3 psychosocial determinants and onset. The participants (N = 827), part of a cohort initially surveyed in the 9th grade, reported at baseline that they had never engaged in intercourse. The multivariable proportional hazards regression model suggested that adolescents with more positive attitudinal and normative beliefs, as well as those with a parent who graduated from college, were less likely to engage in intercourse in the follow-up period (up to approximately 2 years). Interventions that include an objective to delay onset may benefit from addressing psychosocial determinants, especially attitudes and norms about sexual intercourse."
12144151,0,a,"This paper explores the content, prevalence, and determinants of husbands' involvement in two aspects of their wives' maternal health: (1) providing advice and care during pregnancy and (2) attending birth. Using primarily women's reports of their spouses' involvement taken from qualitative and survey data from a sample of rural Guatemalan households, I find that husband participation is relatively high compared to some expectations and that the dynamics of male involvement differ between the two aspects. The analysis of receiving advice or care from husbands during pregnancy, an analysis done only among women who experienced a complication during pregnancy, suggests that the type of prenatal care sought and the quality of the familial and marital relationships are important factors. On the other hand, husbands' attendance at birth seems driven more by men's availability and access to birth. Together, the data show that ""male involvement"" is not a singular behavior and point to ways to conceptualize its complexity."
11818587,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinants of mental health among severe hearing-impaired adults in the Netherlands, separately by prelingual and postlingual age of onset. METHODS: Five hundred twenty-three face-to-face interviews were carried out by persons with practical skills in communication with hearing-impaired people. RESULTS: Of prelingually and postlingually deaf men, 27.1% and 27.7%, respectively, reported mental distress (scores on the General Health Questionnaire > or = 2), and among women these figures were 32.4% and 43.2%. These rates are higher than in the general population (men: 22.0%; women: 26.6%). Among the prelingual category, none of the demographic or hearing loss-related characteristics was associated with mental health status as measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Of these variables, only additional impairment or serious illness was associated with the brief Symptom Checklist (SCL-8D). Among the postlingual category, female gender and equilibrium disturbance was associated with both the GHQ and SCL-8D, and additional impairment or serious illness with the SCL-8D. For both categories, the risk of mental distress also was higher in those with more communication problems, lower levels of self-esteem, and poorer acceptance of the hearing loss. Opportunities for identification in youth and social support were not associated with mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health status differs between the hearing-impaired and the general population, but not as much as is sometimes suggested. Mental distress is greater in those in certain categories of the hearing-impaired."
9759686,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies suggest underuse of beta-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease, but these studies have been based on selected populations of recently hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe national patterns and determinants of beta-blocker use in the ambulatory setting. METHODS: We analyzed 11745 visits by patients with coronary artery disease to randomly selected, office-based physicians in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys for 1980, 1981, 1985, and 1989 through 1996. We used multiple logistic regression to determine the independent effect of sociodemographic and clinical factors on beta-blocker use. OUTCOME MEASURE: Beta-blocker use at patient visits. RESULTS: Beta-blocker use was reported in only 20.9% of office visits by patients with coronary artery disease and no strong contraindications between 1993 and 1996. In multivariate analyses, age younger than 75 years, residence in the Northeast, and visits to cardiologists and internists compared with family and general practitioners predicted greater use of beta-blocker therapy. White race and private insurance also were significant predictors of beta-blocker use between 1980 and 1996. Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant decline in beta-blocker use from 1980 to 1990, followed by a gradual increase in recent years. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-blockers appear to be underused in ambulatory patients with coronary artery disease. Our data suggest that nonclinical factors may influence rates of use, indicating the need for closer scrutiny of variations in physician prescribing practices."
10067904,1,a,"Analysis of vital statistics for the Czech Republic between 1986 and 1993, including 3,254 infant deaths from 350,978 first births to married and single women who conceived at ages 18-29 years, revealed a neonatal survival advantage for low-weight infants born to disadvantaged (single, less educated) women, particularly for deaths from congenital anomalies. This advantage largely disappeared after the neonatal period. The same patterns have been observed for low-weight infants born to black women in the United States. Since the Czech Republic had an ethnically homogenous population, virtually universal prenatal care, and uniform institutional conditions for delivery, Czech results must be attributed to social rather than to biologic or medical circumstances. This strengthens the contention that in the United States, the black neonatal survival paradox may be due as much to race-related social stigmatization and consequent disadvantage as to any hypothesized hereditary influences on birth-weight-specific survival."
9299888,1,a,"To determine the association of birthplace (US-born vs. foreign-born) with mortality among blacks and whites in New York City, we examined death records for 5 years from 1988 to 1992 and the 1990 census data. Mortality rates by race and birthplace were compared for all causes of death and for specific causes. Although overall death rates for blacks generally exceeded those for whites (1224.8 per 100,000 inhabitants vs. 721.4 for males and 593.7 vs. 393.1 for females), foreign-born blacks had death rates (664.6 for males and 350.2 for females) slightly lower than those for whites. The most striking variation among blacks was among those aged 25 to 64 years. US-born black males were three times as likely (1588.9 vs. 525.2) and US-born black females were more than 2.5 times as likely (673.5 vs. 263.4) to die as were foreign-born blacks. Among US-born blacks AIDS, homicide, and cancer for males and AIDS, heart disease, and cancer for females were the most important determinants of excess deaths, defined as the difference between observed deaths and expected deaths; these causes of death account for about half of the excess deaths for each sex. Among whites natives generally had higher death rates than migrants, but less prominently and consistently so than for blacks. Excess mortality of blacks is largely explained by higher death rates of US-born compared with foreign-born Americans."
18434246,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the personal, social and cultural factors likely to explain recourse to the Internet as a preferred source of personal health information. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a population of 2923 Internet users visiting a firmly established website that offers information on personal health. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the determinants of site use. MEASUREMENT: The analysis template comprised four classes of determinants likely to explain Internet use: beliefs, intentions, user satisfaction and socio-demographic characteristics. Seven-point Likert scales were used. An analysis of the psychometric qualities of the variables provided compelling evidence of the construct's validity and reliability. A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the correspondence with the factors predicted by the theoretical model. FINDINGS: The regression analysis explained 35% of the variance in Internet use. Use was directly associated with five factors: perceived usefulness, importance given to written media in searches for health information, concern for personal health, importance given to the opinions of physicians and other health professionals, and the trust placed in the information available on the site itself. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the importance of the credibility of information on the frequency of Internet use as a preferred source of information on personal health. It also shows the potentially influential role of the Internet in the development of personal knowledge of health issues."
17315529,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There are conflicting findings regarding the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and bone mineral density. We aimed to investigate bone status and its possible determinants by comparing students from two schools, located in a high and a low SES district. METHODS: Data were gathered by using anthropometric measurements and a questionnaire for both families and the students from the two schools chosen by the Ministry of Education. Quantitative ultrasound measurements were done with Omnisense 700P. For normally distributed variables t-test and for others Mann-Whitney U test was utilized. We used the chi-squared test for nominal variables. RESULTS: Forty-two girls and 35 boys from a low SES school, and 41 girls and 38 boys from a high SES school were included in the study. Students in the high SES school had significantly higher calcium scores and more physical activity compared to those in the low SES school. Boys in the high SES school had higher z-scores for quantitative ultrasound; however, they had higher Tanner stages when compared to boys from the low SES school. Speed of sound (SOS) and z-scores of the girls were similar between the two schools. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the notion that certain environmental factors, such as calcium intake and physical activity, might reflect socioeconomic trends in adolescents, similar to adults; however, genetic influences may dominate in terms of bone status."
15571115,0,a,"The authors used a standardized questionnaire to survey 201 international and 193 German students at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, to determine differences in health practices between the 2 groups and to identify targets for health-promoting interventions. Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that long-term female international students (those whose duration of residency in Germany was more than 2 years) had lower levels of physical activity and alcohol consumption than their German counterparts and higher rates of smoking independently associated with international citizenship. Short-term international female students were less likely than German students to receive social support. Among men, long-term international student status was associated with daily smoking and inconsistent seat belt use, whereas short-term student status was associated with a lower rate of seat belt use, a higher level of perceived stress, and a healthier diet, compared with domestic students. Findings from the study could give rise to health-promotion activities for international students at German universities; additional studies at other European universities are necessary before making further recommendations."
7761046,1,a,"This article presents determinants of eating sweet and fat snacks between meals by adolescents (12-15 years). A preliminary qualitative study focused on eliciting students' interpretation of the self-rated terminology 'low nutrient sweet and fat snacks' and the development of a written questionnaire following the principles of the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1980). In a quantitative study a questionnaire was administered to 560 students in the first and second grade of Dutch secondary education. In the data-analysis frequent and moderate users were compared. Frequent users had a more positive attitude towards the intake of sweet and fat snacks than moderate users. The intention to consume sweet snacks was more positive for frequent users. As opposed to frequent users, moderate users had a negative intention towards consuming fat snacks between meals. Moreover, moderate users experienced more social influence against the intake of both snacks than the frequent users. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the theory of reasoned action in relation to the self-rated consumption of sweet and fat snacks eaten between meals. In predicting intention to consume such snacks, attitude turned out to be more important than subjective norm. Finally, the correlation between actual eating behavior as reported by the students, and the behavioral intentions was relatively moderate which was probably caused by inconsistency between intention and behavior."
18186918,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This study examines associations between female participation in a microcredit program in India, known as self help groups (SHGs), and women's health in the south Indian state of Kerala. Because SHGs do not have a formal health program, this provides a unique opportunity to assess whether SHG participation influences women's health via the social determinants of health. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used special survey data collected in 2003 from one Panchayat (territorial decentralized unit). Information was collected on women's characteristics, health determinants (exclusion to health care, exposure to health risks, decision-making agency), and health achievements (self assessed health, markers of mental health). The study sample included 928 non elderly poor women. RESULTS: The primary finding is that compared to non-participants living in a household without a SHG member, the odds of facing exclusion is significantly lower among early joiners, women who were members for more than 2 years (OR = 0.58, CI = 0.41-0.80), late joiners, members for 2 years and less (OR = 0.60, CI = 0.39-0.94), and non-participants who live in a household with a SHG member (OR = 0.53, CI = 0.32-0.90). We also found that after controlling for key women's characteristics, early joiners of a SHG are less likely to report emotional stress and poor life satisfaction compared to non-members (OR = 0.52, CI = 0.30-0.93; OR = 0.32, CI = 0.14-0.71). No associations were found between SHG participation and self assessed health or exposure to health risks. The relationship between SHG participation and decision-making agency is unclear. CONCLUSION: Microcredit is not a panacea, but could help to improve the health of poor women by addressing certain issues relevant to the context. In Kerala, SHG participation can help protect poor women against exclusion to health care and possibly aid in promoting their mental health."
7475433,1,a,"Health-related quality of life is a multidimensional concept with five broad domains: opportunity/resilience, health perception, functional states, impairments/diseases, and duration of life. It addresses the tradeoff between how long and how well people live. The health-related quality of life approach has provided greater opportunity for investigation of the interrelations among oral health, health, and related outcomes. The inclusion of patient-driven measures, such as perceptions and functional status, is critical. Oral health-related quality of life measures are being developed and used in research on aging populations. Clinical measures of oral health, perceptions of general and oral well-being, and reported physical, social, and psychological functioning are independent, but correlated, components of overall oral health-related quality of life. An oral health-related quality of life approach benefits 1) clinical practitioners in selecting treatments and monitoring patient outcomes; 2) researchers in identifying determinants of health, tracking levels of health risk factors, and determining use of services in populations; and 3) policy-makers establishing program and institutional priorities, policies, and funding decisions. This overview indicates substantial value in pursuing several recommendations. A theoretical framework from which concepts, measures, and models can be derived must be developed to address oral health, oral health-related quality of life, health, and health-related quality of life. Oral health outcomes or states must be identified and classified along some continuum of impairment, function, disability, and opportunity. Indicators of appropriate concepts and domains must be adapted or established. Extended analyses on the relations among oral health, oral health-related quality of life, health, and health-related quality of life should be conducted with use of the Boston VA Normative Aging Study and other appropriate data sets."
19553025,0,a,"Socioeconomic determinants of injury have been associated with risk of burn in the UK and USA, but the relative significance of this impact is largely unknown across Canadian populations. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to risk of burn in the province of British Columbia (BC) and identify the extent to which these findings are generalizable across both urban and rural population groups. Measures of SES were based on province-wide comparisons using data obtained from the Canada Census using the Vancouver Area Neighbourhood Deprivation Index (VANDIX). Results illustrate that the effects of SES and increased injury risk are substantial, though the most pronounced variations were exhibited across each SES stratum for urban areas and with less demonstrable effect when itemized by injury type within rural areas. Although conservative, the results from this study illustrate that burns disproportionately affect populations of greater relative socioeconomic disadvantage and continued efforts to also address social inequities and their link to injury incidence is likely to be more effective than targeting individual behavior alone when trying to reduce and eliminate their occurrence."
12348273,1,a,"""This paper reopens the debate between Weekley (1988) and Rowsell (1989) over why pockets of depopulation have persisted within parts of rural Britain which have experienced net growth through counterurbanisation. It argues that Weekley has not fully appreciated the context for local population losses, namely the emergence of a new structural relationship between people, households, and dwellings, and the growing tension between production and consumption interests in rural locales. Moreover, the paper disputes claims that depopulation is triggered by the actions of either the landowner or the planner. Drawing on case study material informed by critical realism, it argues that planners and landowners have been drawn into an asymmetrical power relationship. This has tended to buttress landed interests and, in so doing, reproduce mechanisms which protect the less populous communities from growth and change."""
15331814,0,a,"Each year, up to three million deaths due to malaria and close to five billion episodes of clinical illness possibly meriting antimalarial therapy occur throughout the world, with Africa having more than 90% of this burden. Almost 3% of disability adjusted life years are due to malaria mortality globally, 10% in Africa. New information is presented in this supplement on malaria-related perinatal mortality, occurrence of human immunodeficiency virus in pregnancy, undernutrition, and neurologic, cognitive, and developmental sequelae. The entomologic determinants of transmission and uses of modeling for program planning and disease prediction and prevention are discussed. New data are presented from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe on the increasing urban malaria problem and on epidemic malaria. Between 6% and 28% of the malaria burden may occur in cities, which comprise less than 2% of the African surface. Macroeconomic projections show that the costs are far greater than the costs of individual cases, with a substantial deleterious impact of malaria on schooling of patients, external investments into endemic countries, and tourism. Poor populations are at greatest risk; 58% of the cases occur in the poorest 20% of the world's population and these patients receive the worst care and have catastrophic economic consequences from their illness. This social vulnerability requires better understanding for improving deployment, access, quality, and use of effective interventions. Studies from Ghana and elsewhere indicate that for every patient with febrile illness assumed to be malaria seen in health facilities, 4-5 episodes occur in the community. Effective actions for malaria control mandate rational public policies; market forces, which often drive sales and use of drugs and other interventions, are unlikely to guarantee their use. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria is rapidly gaining acceptance as an effective approach for countering the spread and intensity of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, and other antimalarial drugs. Although costly, ACT ($1.20-2.50 per adult treatment) becomes more cost-effective as resistance to alternative drugs increases; early use of ACT may delay development of resistance to these drugs and prevent the medical toll associated with use of ineffective drugs. The burden of malaria in one district in Tanzania has not decreased since the primary health care approach replaced the vertical malaria control efforts of the 1960s. Despite decentralization, this situation resulted, in part, from weak district management capacity, poor coordination, inadequate monitoring, and lack of training of key staff. Experience in the Solomon Islands showed that spraying with DDT, use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), and health education were all associated with disease reduction. The use of nets permitted a reduction in DDT spraying, but could not replace it without an increased malaria incidence. Baseline data and reliable monitoring of key outcome indicators are needed to measure whether the ambitious goals for the control of malaria and other diseases has occurred. Such systems are being used for evidence-based decision making in Tanzania and several other countries. Baseline cluster sampling surveys in several countries across Africa indicate that only 53% of the children with febrile illness in malarious areas are being treated; chloroquine (CQ) is used 84% of the time, even where the drug may be ineffective. Insecticide-treated bed nets were used only 2% of the time by children less than five years of age. Progress in malaria vaccine research has been substantial over the past five years; 35 candidate malaria vaccines are in development, many of which are in clinical trials. Development of new vaccines and drugs has been the result of increased investments and formation of public-private partnerships. Before malaria vaccine becomes deployed, consideration must be given to disease burden, cost-effectiveness, financing, delivery systems, and approval by regulatory agencies. Key to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness will be collection and prompt analysis of epidemiologic information. Training of persons in every aspect of malaria research and control is essential for programs to succeed. The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) is actively promoting research capacity strengthening and has established networks of institutions and scientists throughout the African continent, most of whom are now linked by modern information-sharing networks. Evidence over the past century is that successful control malaria programs have been linked to strong research activities. To ensure effective coordination and cooperation between the growing number of research and control coalitions forming in support of malaria activities, an umbrella group is needed. With continued support for scientists and control workers globally, particularly in low-income malarious countries, the long-deferred dream of malaria elimination can become a reality."
19514604,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Several studies show that nursing is, by its very nature, an occupation exposed to a high degree of stress. The main aims of the present research were to analyze the presence and to identify occupational stress factors and assess stress levels among nurses in clinical/hospital settings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research was conducted as a cross-sectional study. The sample included nurses (n=205) employed in different settings, who were also control groups to each other. Expanded Nursing Stress Scale and an additional questionnaire created for the purpose of this investigation were used as research instruments. RESULTS: The results show that stressful situations, in the psychological occupational environment are the greatest stress factors regardless of the workplace: in regard to sociodemographic determinants, married nurses have significantly higher average values as compared to unmarried ones (p<0.05), and the values statistically significantly lower in nurses under 30 years of age, with less than 10 years of work experience (p<0.01). Workload is a potential stress factor from the physical environment, whereas average values of this stress factor highly statistically differ in regard to the workplace (p<0.01). Nurses working in settings without support from their superiors and engaged in inter-professional conflicts, especially between nurses and physicians, face a great problem. CONCLUSION: It is important to promote conditions of work (work space, providing new equipment), organization of work, as well as social relationships, which is in accordance with the recommendations of ICN."
26047094,0,a,"The question posed in this research is: in what ways is care of older persons practiced in a transnational setting. It is answered by looking at certain transnational activities where a migrant is helping an older person living in another country. This is done by using the description of care developed by Berenice Fisher and Joan Tronto [Fisher, Berenice & Tronto, Joan. 1990. ""Toward a feminist theory of caring."" Pp. 35-62 in Circles of care edited by Able, E. K. & Nelson, M. Albany: State University of New York Press], where caring is seen to consist of four elements: 'caring about', 'taking care', 'caregiving' and care-receiving'. Additionally the article is built around three basic elements of transnational care: distance, resources and circumstances. Distance refers to geographical distance between the migrant and the elderly person in need of care. Resources encompass a variety of resources that the migrant has or would need for the transnational caring activities. Circumstances are various determinants linked to the elderly person in need of care. Also attention is paid to the social policies involved in care-related activities. Two fundamental issues are distinctive to caring transnationally: the differing cultures of care and the two sets of social policies that have a role in this activity."
15254475,0,a,"Maternal smoking has been repeatedly found to be the most important determinant of children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Here, we further investigated predictors for the urinary cotinine/creatinine ratio (CCR, ng/mg) in 1220 preschool children for the year 1996. Children from smoking homes (35.1%) had significantly higher CCR than children from nonsmoking homes (mean: 55.5 vs. 14.9 ng/mg). The level of education of the parents was a strong predictor for CCRs even after adjusting for number of cigarettes smoked, maternal smoking and dwelling space. Additionally, dwelling space was inversely related to children's urinary cotinine level. The CCR- levels in children investigated in 1996 and 1998 were significantly correlated (Pearson's r=0.67). The parents of 806 children agreed for a visit to their homes. In 79 of the 536 (14.7%) of the self-reported, nonsmoking households, smoking was admitted during the visit. The mean urinary CCR of these children was 25.2 ng/mg. We conclude that in addition to parental smoking behaviour, other variables such as dwelling space and social and educational status predict the children's exposure to ETS. Our data also revealed that a considerable percentage of parents denied the ETS exposure of their children at home."
18091003,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder is a prevalent and disabling psychologic pathology. Longitudinal research on the predictors of posttraumatic stress symptomatology is limited. METHODS: We recruited 2752 participants to a prospective, population-based cohort study by conducting a telephone survey of adult residents of the New York City metropolitan area in 2002; participants completed 3 follow-up interviews over a 30-month period. Censoring weights were estimated to account for potential bias. We used generalized estimating equation logistic regression models with bootstrapped confidence intervals to assess the predictors of posttraumatic stress over time in multivariable models. RESULTS: Predictors of posttraumatic stress over time included ongoing stressors (odds ratio [OR] = 1.91 per 1 unit increase in number of stressors, [95% confidence interval = 1.55-2.36]) and traumatic events (OR = 1.92 per 1 unit increase in number of traumatic events [CI = 1.71-2.22]), social support (compared with high levels, OR = 1.71 for medium [1.09-2.52]; OR = 1.57 for low [1.08-2.35]), low income (OR = 0.87 per $10,000 increase [0.81-0.92]), female sex (1.60 [1.11-2.23]), and Latino ethnicity (compared with white, OR = 1.74 [1.05-2.97]). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ongoing stressors play a central role in explaining the trajectory of posttraumatic stress over time, and that factors beyond the experience of stressors and traumas may account for sex and ethnic differences in posttraumatic stress risk. Interventions that focus on reducing ongoing adversity may help mitigate the consequences of traumatic events."
18590548,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most relevant human opportunistic bacterial pathogens. Two strains (PAO1 and PA14) have been mainly used as models for studying virulence of P. aeruginosa. The strain PA14 is more virulent than PAO1 in a wide range of hosts including insects, nematodes and plants. Whereas some of the differences might be attributable to concerted action of determinants encoded in pathogenicity islands present in the genome of PA14, a global analysis of the differential host responses to these P. aeruginosa strains has not been addressed. Little is known about the host response to infection with P. aeruginosa and whether or not the global host transcription is being affected as a defense mechanism or altered in the benefit of the pathogen. Since the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a suitable host to study virulence of P. aeruginosa and other pathogens, we used available genomic tools in this model system to study the transcriptional host response to P. aeruginosa infection. RESULTS: We have compared the virulence of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14 using D. discoideum and studied the transcriptional response of the amoeba upon infection. Our results showed that PA14 is more virulent in Dictyostelium than PA01using different plating assays. For studying the differential response of the host to infection by these model strains, D. discoideum cells were exposed to either P. aeruginosa PAO1 or P. aeruginosa PA14 (mixed with an excess of the non-pathogenic bacterium Klebsiella aerogenes as food supply) and after 4 hours, cellular RNA extracted. A three-way comparison was made using whole-genome D. discoideum microarrays between RNA samples from cells treated with the two different strains and control cells exposed only to K. aerogenes. The transcriptomic analyses have shown the existence of common and specific responses to infection. The expression of 364 genes changed in a similar way upon infection with one or another strain, whereas 169 genes were differentially regulated depending on whether the infecting strain was either P. aeruginosa PAO1 or PA14. Effects on metabolism, signalling, stress response and cell cycle can be inferred from the genes affected. CONCLUSION: Our results show that pathogenic Pseudomonas strains invoke both a common transcriptional response from Dictyostelium and a strain specific one, indicating that the infective process of bacterial pathogens can be strain-specific and is more complex than previously thought."
16172560,0,a,"Community health centers in the United States, first launched as a federal initiative in 1965, were rooted in models from South Africa, the American civil rights struggle, and a national commitment to address poverty. The first 2 centers, one serving a rural population in the Mississippi Delta and another a public housing project in Boston, incorporated such core principles as provision of primary care to a defined area or population; public health interventions addressing social determinants of health; emphasis on community participation; community empowerment leading to control of the new institutions; epidemiologic methods to identify problems and guide decisions; new combinations of clinical and public health personnel; and reduction of disparities in health and healthcare of the poor and minorities. The continuing relevance of these principles in today's greatly expanded health center network is reviewed."

12624605,0,a,"Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) measured by electrocardiography (ECG LVH) in hypertensive patients has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular sequelae. Analysis of the determinants predisposing to ECG LVH may be helpful in the prevention of LVH. The Department of Health and Social Security Hypertension Care Computer Project studied 2994 hypertensive patients in whom an electrocardiogram was recorded while not on treatment. LVH was determined as the voltage sum SV1+RV5 or RV6>or=35 mm using Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria. The relations were determined between the presence of LVH or voltage sum and different variables. Untreated systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and pulse pressure were positively related to the increasing ECG voltage, while body mass index (BMI) and serum cholesterol were inversely related. Blood glucose and age did not correlate significantly. Patients with the presence of ECG LVH were more often men, black people, smokers and users of alcohol. In multiple logistic regression analyses, SBP, DBP, male gender and black race were positively, whereas BMI was negatively related to the presence of LVH. The positive relation of smoking and negative relation of serum cholesterol concentration to the presence of ECG LVH were apparent in men but not in women. This study confirms the adverse association between ECG LVH and SBP and DBP, male gender, black race and decreased BMI. It also addresses the less well-known associations of blood glucose, cholesterol, smoking and alcohol consumption."
12511058,0,a,"The current highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), i.e., triple combination treatment including a protease inhibitor, allows for long-term suppression of HIV-replication. The intake guidelines, however, are very strict and, like many other HIV positive patients, drug users have problems in achieving good therapy compliance. As a result, the effectiveness of the medication therapy is seriously jeopardized. This qualitative study, involving in-depth interviews with 27 ""hard drug"" users in Amsterdam, seeks to provide better insights into the extent of adherence to HAART. In addition, factors that impede or facilitate adherence have been listed in order to develop and improve strategies. The study shows that almost half of the ""hard drug"" users interviewed do not adhere to the therapy. A large number of determinants for adherence were identified at the level of medication, the individual, and the environment. Many of these determinants can be influenced, which means that they can provide clues for the effective implementation of measures that may enhance effectiveness of treatment."
16731678,0,a,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Reproductive tract infections (RTI) present major health, social, and economic problems in developing countries. Our objective was to describe the prevalence and risk factors of RTIs in a population based sample of women aged 18-45 years. METHOD: 2494 women of 3000 randomly selected from the population defined by a primary health centre catchment area consented to participate. Participants were interviewed regarding complaints and risk factors. Laboratory specimens were collected for the diagnosis of RTIs. Analyses of risk factors were carried out separately for the outcomes of sexually transmitted infections: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis; and endogenous infections: bacterial vaginosis (BV) and candida. RESULTS: Endogenous infections were relatively common (BV 17.8%; candida 8.5%), and sexually transmitted infections (STI) were infrequent (4.2%). Factors indicative of poverty and marginalisation were associated with STIs and BV. Gender disadvantage, particularly spousal violence, was associated with BV, while concern about a husband's extramarital relationships, an indicator of sexual risk, was associated with STI. Husband's discharge was strongly associated with STI, and a non-white vaginal discharge was associated with both STI and BV. Condom use and oral contraceptive use were associated with a reduced risk of BV. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the population burden of RTIs is attributed to endogenous infections. Socioeconomic deprivation and gender disadvantage are associated with raised risk for BV, while the risk factors for STIs indicated that disadvantaged women were likely to be infected by their husbands."
7876299,1,a,The 1988 Malawi Traditional and Modern Methods of Child Spacing Survey data are used to identify determinants of infant mortality in Malawi. The logistic binomial analysis shows that socioeconomic factors are significant even during the neonatal period while the length of the preceding birth interval is significant in the post-neonatal period only. There is a strong familial correlation of mortality risks during both the neonatal and post-neonatal periods but the effect of geographical area of residence is stronger in the post-neonatal period.
16808139,0,a,"Currently, women comprise 17% of the 1.4 million U.S. active military and 20% of the 1.2 million reserve force. Well over three-quarters of these women are enlisted (82%). Enlisted women are young, between the ages of 17 and 29, and one-half are ethnic minorities. Enlisted women are a growing minority within the predominantly male hierarchical military organization. The most junior of these women, in addition to being vastly outnumbered by men, fall along with junior enlisted men at the bottom of the military organizational structure. This unique position may have health consequences. The purpose of this article is to propose research questions within the context of the Marmot and Wilkinson's social determinants of health model.

10433412,1,a,"The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioural screening questionnaire that asks about children's and teenagers' symptoms and positive attributes; the extended version also includes an impact supplement that asks if the respondent thinks the young person has a problem, and if so, enquires further about chronicity, distress, social impairment, and burden for others. Closely similar versions are completed by parents, teachers, and young people aged 11 or more. The validation study involved two groups of 5-15-year-olds: a community sample (N = 467) and a psychiatric clinic sample (N = 232). The two groups had markedly different distributions on the measures of perceived difficulties, impact (distress plus social impairment), and burden. Impact scores were better than symptom scores at discriminating between the community and clinic samples; discrimination based on the single ""Is there a problem?"" item was almost as good. The SDQ burden rating correlated well (r = .74) with a standardised interview rating of burden. For clinicians and researchers with an interest in psychiatric caseness and the determinants of service use, the impact supplement of the extended SDQ appears to provide useful additional information without taking up much more of respondents' time."
9212534,1,a,"This paper examines the social origins of the rise in adult mortality in Russia and selected Eastern European countries. Three explanations for this trend are considered: (1) Soviet health policy, (2) social stress, and (3) health lifestyles. The socialist states were generally characterized by a persistently poor mortality performance as part of a long-term process of deterioration, with particularly negative outcomes for the life expectancy of middle-aged, male manual workers. Soviet-style health policy was ineffective in dealing with the crisis, and stress per se does not seem to be the primary cause of the rise in mortality. Although more research is needed, the suggestion is made that poor health lifestyles--reflected especially in heavy alcohol consumption, and also in smoking, lack of exercise, and high-fat diets--are the major social determinant of the upturn in deaths."

8921465,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Mothers, but not fathers, are the usual focus of strategies to maximize immunization coverage in low income countries. METHODS: A study of the immunization determinants of children aged 12-18 months was conducted in 1991 in the Eastern Region of Ghana using structured interviews of a population sample of 294 mothers and 170 (67%) of the children's fathers. RESULTS: Fathers were more likely than mothers to perceive that the fathers had participated in the decision to send children for immunizations. Where both parents reported that the father had participated in the decision, and he could speak English, the child was more likely to have completed the immunization schedule by 12 months (OR = 5.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-21.7), independently of other factors. Neither the father's participation, nor his ability to speak English, was independently associated with the child's immunization status. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study suggest that, where fathers have a higher level of education, programmes which are designed to involve them in decisions about their children's use of preventive health services have the potential to increase timely immunization coverage levels."
1871990,1,a,"This study analyzes the patterns and correlates of gender differences in cigarette smoking in a national sample of white high school seniors in 1985. More females than males were smokers, because females had higher rates for the early stages of smoking adoption. Specifically, females were more likely to have tried smoking at least once and, among those who had tried smoking, females were more likely to have smoked more than once or twice. Gender differences in smoking varied, depending on the students' characteristics. For example, the female excess in the early stages of smoking adoption was small or absent among rural students or very religious students, apparently because traditional values inhibit smoking adoption more among females than among males. We estimated the contributions of gender differences in students' characteristics to gender differences in smoking adoption. For example, males were more involved in sports, and this appears to be one reason why males had lower rates of smoking adoption than females. On the other hand, males had more deviant behavior and attitudes, and this would be expected to contribute to greater smoking adoption by males. The findings of this study indicate important gender differences in the determinants of smoking adoption."
8857378,1,a,"Converging with psycho-social research findings, animal and human laboratory studies indicate that behavioral alternatives are important determinants of drug-taking. To investigate associations between how early adolescents spend their time, i.e. their behavioral repertoire and drug use (use of marijuana, crack/cocaine or inhalants), we analyzed data from an epidemiological sample of 1516 urban middle-school students who had completed private interviews in spring 1993. The interview included a 36-item questionnaire to assess how frequently the youth engaged in different activities; history of drug-taking was assessed separately. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate associations between drug use and each of seven behavioral domains as well as sex, age and racial-ethnic status. Youths spending a great deal of time working for pay and assuming other adult-like roles were more likely to have initiated drug use (estimated odds ratio, OR = 3.49; p = 0.002). Those who spent much time in religious activities were less likely (OR = 0.2, p <0.001). An exploratory search for interactions disclosed other associations that merit attention in future research. These results corroborate evidence on the potential etiological significance of behavioral repertoire in relation to risk of drug use."
12481209,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The Russian mortality crisis of the early 1990s attracted considerable attention, but information on possible covariates of mortality is lacking, and concerns have been raised about the validity of official mortality data. To help elucidate the determinants of mortality, we examined whether indirect demographic techniques could be used to study mortality in countries such as the Russian Federation, where mortality data are inadequate, using input data independent from official vital statistics. METHODS: A national sample of the population was interviewed (n = 1600, response rate = 67%). Participants who had ever been married (82% of the sample) were asked about the date of birth and vital status of their first spouse. Spousal mortality was then estimated indirectly for the 531 men and 710 women for whom valid data were available. FINDINGS: The estimated risk of death between the ages of 35-69 years was 57% for male spouses and 17% for female spouses. Corresponding figures derived from national data for 1990 were 52% and 25% for the Russian Federation, and 31% and 20% for the United Kingdom. According to spouses' reports, 38% of their husbands died from cardiovascular disease, 22% from cancer, and 14% from injuries and accidents. Mortality of male spouses was inversely related to the education level of their wives, and the age-adjusted hazard ratios for death from all causes, compared to primary education, were 0.77 for secondary education and 0.57 for university education (trend P = 0.03). Mortality was also inversely related to ownership of household items, but not to size of settlement, pride in Russia, membership in the Soviet Communist Party, nationality or self-assessed social status. CONCLUSIONS: Although the indirect estimates were imprecise (partly owing to the small population size of the study), and mortality in women was probably underestimated (owing to many factors, including poorer reporting by males and high male mortality), our results are nevertheless consistent with the mortality pattern observed in official mortality data. The indirect technique thus appears to be a useful tool to study the determinants of mortality in the Russian Federation and other populations, where reliable or sufficiently extensive data are not available."

17929613,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The term Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) has been used since the 1980s. NORCs are defined as communities where people remain or move to when they retire. NORCs develop 'naturally', meaning that seniors tend to remain or move there when they retire, although the residences and physical environment were not constructed for a senior population. The term, Healthy-NORC, has been introduced and is associated with healthy aging. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: We describe how demographic trends will facilitate a dramatic growth in NORCs. Acknowledging the 'Determinants of Health' model, we suggest that some determinants impact people differently at different ages. We also suggest that more attention be focused on the impact of physical/social environments on health, and that some determinants of health are particularly relevant for seniors. We argue that NORCs exist on a spectrum, from NORC to H-NORC, and that health benefits for seniors increase as NORCs adopt additional characteristics associated with improved senior health. We also illustrate H-NORC research methods and policy options for local governments. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Compared to the provision of additional medical and social services, H-NORCs represent a low-cost approach to facilitating healthy aging. Municipal governments can promote healthy aging and should pursue policies that will stimulate H-NORC development."

While injury prevention entails the implementation of specific interventions in terms of structural or educational measures, sports safety promotion includes also the antecedent and wider campaigns that are required to succeed with these measures. Comprehensive sports safety promotion programmes thus require that the perspective on the sports injury problem is made broader than consideration of the individual athlete. The results display that involvement in sports safety issues from the sports federations that formulate policies and allocate resources is necessary for coordinated implementation of programme actions. The authorities responsible for sports facilities and legislations in the civil society also need to be included, because of the fact that they control many of the central safety determinants in the sporting environment. It is concluded that the sports injury problem needs to be addressed in liaison with the leaders of socially defined sports communities and the governments representing geographically defined civic communities, and that the safety-supporting environment in professional sports is underdeveloped compared with other areas of working life."
2065114,1,a,"The role of genotype as a determinant of biologically based inter-individual differences in vulnerability to substance abuse has received little systematic investigation except in the case of alcohol. This report describes the use of an animal model, the inbred mouse, to identify and to characterize variants with inherently altered susceptibilities to the rewarding and other behavioral actions of cocaine. Among a battery of nine inbred strains chosen solely for their genetic diversity, genetic polymorphisms commonly occurred which altered the potency and/or efficacy of cocaine to induce conditioned place preference, oral self-administration, motor activity activation, seizures and lethality. These changes in cocaine sensitivity generally were of a behavior-specific and pharmacodynamic nature. One strain, DBA/2J, found to be markedly hyporesponsive to the rewarding action of cocaine, also was hyporesponsive to the rewarding effects of amphetamine, etonitazene, phencyclidine, caffeine and procaine. We speculate that this strain has an inherent generalized appetitive defect. The frequent occurrence and large magnitude of inherent phenotypic changes in cocaine responsiveness which we have identified among inbred mouse strains now permits an analytical genetic study of processes underlying cocaine-mediated reinforcement."
11580075,0,a,"Although measures to enhance bone mineralization during childhood and adolescence are widely incorporated into preventive programmes against osteoporotic fracture, there are no published data directly linking growth rates in childhood with the risk of later hip fracture. We addressed this issue in a unique Finnish cohort in whom birth and childhood growth data were linked to later hospital discharge records. This permitted follow-up of 3639 men and 3447 women who were born in Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1924 and 1933, who went to school in Helsinki and still lived in Finland in 1971. Body size at birth was recorded and an average of 10 measurements were obtained of height and weight throughout childhood. We identified 112 subjects (55 men and 57 women) who sustained a hip fracture during 165 404 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex in a proportional hazards model, we identified two major determinants of hip fracture risk: tall maternal height (p < 0.001) and a low rate of childhood growth (height, p = 0.006; weight, p = 0.01). The hazard ratio for hip fracture was 2.1 (95% CI 1.2-3.5) among men and women born to mothers taller than 1.61 m, when compared with those whose mothers were shorter than 1.54 m. The ratio was 1.9 (95% CI 1.1-3.2) among those whose rate of childhood height gain was below the lowest quartile for the cohort, compared with those whose growth rate was above the highest quartile. The effects of maternal height and childhood growth rate were statistically independent of each other, and remained after adjusting for socioeconomic status. The patterns of childhood growth that predicted future hip fracture differed between boys and girls. In boys, there was a constant deficit in height and weight between ages 7 and 15 years among those later sustaining fractures; in girls, there was a progressively increasing deficit in weight but a delayed height gain among those later sustaining fractures. This epidemiologic study provides the first direct evidence that a low rate of childhood growth is a risk factor for later hip fracture. Whether reduced growth rate is a consequence of childhood lifestyle, genetic background or intrauterine hormonal programming, the data support measures to optimize childhood growth as part of preventive strategies against osteoporotic fracture in future generations."
9257397,1,a,"Quality of life (QofL) has emerged as a new outcome paradigm. It is now the endpoint in various taxonomies of patient outcomes, in which relationships are modeled amongst biological abnormalities, symptom status, functional status, disability, health perceptions and quality of life. Although current models and taxonomies point at important determinants of QofL, they do not provide a heuristic that guides the conceptualization of QofL and the systematic development of an explanatory theory of how ill health affects QofL. General mechanisms linking ill health, behavior, and QofL are lacking. In this paper we propose social production function (SPF) theory as providing such a heuristic, relating the effects of ill health, the activities that patients engage in to maintain QofL, and QofL itself. This theory basically asserts that people produce their own well-being by trying to optimize achievement of universal human goals via six instrumental goals within the environmental and functional limitations they are facing. Three important notions of SPF theory are: (1) the linkages between goals, needs, and well-being; (2) the distinction between universal needs and instrumental goals; and (3) substitution among instrumental goals, activities and endowments according to cost-benefit considerations, whereby costs refer to scarce resources such as functional capacity, time, effort and money. We will argue that SPF theory meaningfully relates the ""biomedical model""-with its focus on pathological processes and biological, physiological and clinical outcomes-to the ""quality of life"" model, with its focus on functioning and well-being. We describe SPF theory and how SPF theory can be used to: (1) operationally define and measure QofL; (2) clarify persistent measurement problems; and (3) develop an explanatory framework of the effects of disease on QofL. In the discussion section, we address the limitations of the SPF approach of QofL and its relationship with personality."
15727964,0,a,"Clinical medicine and health policy planning find common cause as they seek to define the determinants of health. There is substantial recent interest in the social ecology in which health is embedded. However, biology is where these contributing environmental factors are translated. I provide a new conceptual framework for the biological determinants of health. The old public health rubric of host, agent, and environment as the features that define the root elements of health is an impoverished scheme, because it does not represent our new appreciation of genetic and aging contributions to phenotypic health. I propose genes, external agency, internal agency, and aging as more operationally helpful determinants that effectively describe the biological experience of the organism. This scheme has the advantage of differentiating those agencies that are practically approachable, and therefore deserving of increased attention and investment, and those that are currently intractable."
11556777,0,a,"The contamination of blood products by HIV in the early 1980s resulted in thousands of deaths among people with hemophilia in the United States and elsewhere. In the US, industry, government, physicians, and advocacy groups were implicated in this tragedy. In response to pleas from members of the US hemophilia community, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Science convened a public hearing to identify the institutional determinants of the HIV/AIDS epidemic among US hemophilia patients. The resulting IOM Report (1995) established a narrative of the crisis and indicated necessary improvements to the management of the US blood supply. The Report, however, failed to address the hemophilia community's demands for accountability and retribution. In this paper we explore the moral and social dimensions of this tragedy through narrative analysis of the original testimonies of hemophilia sufferers, interviews with some patients and their families, and a re-examination of the text of the IOM Report itself. We examine the process by which this crisis was addressed--through the discourses of science and law--and how it was ultimately framed as a failure of management and oversight rather than a moral failure of the for-profit health-care system. Thus, while the Report and its aftermath demonstrate powerfully how testimonials of suffering can influence public policy, by not addressing what is at stake for the victims--failure to protect patients in an era of increasingly commodified health care--it led to an exculpatory solution that obfuscated the moral dimensions of suffering."

1921101,1,a,"Correlations among body weight and sociodemographic factors, including life-style were tested as social determinants of health in a sample of 5,201 adults in Korea. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which sociodemographic variables and life-style associated health behaviors explain body weight distribution. A second aim was to explain the relation of body weight and health status to stress the importance of body weight as an early risk indicator of health status. The canonical correlation between the weight distribution (underweight and overweight) and the independent variables was 0.29, 17% of the total variance was explained. Perceived health level represented the highest contribution (canonical coefficient 0.82) to body weight. Sociodemographic factors such as sex, economic status, and life-style factors such as smoking, exercise, regular meals and sleep showed comparatively high contributions to body weight. The relevance of body weight for health status including the rate of chronic disease and the rate of medical utilization was significant. Especially, underweight was clarified as being more important than overweight to morbidity level and medical utilization. These findings suggest that perceived body weight is an important indicator of health status and is thus a valuable variable to be considered for nursing intervention and health education related to the promotion of health."
14520621,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that patients' perceptions may be more important than objective clinical assessments in determining quality of life (QOL) for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). METHODS: We interviewed 165 hemodialysis patients from 3 sites using a QOL questionnaire that included the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and the McGill QOL (MQOL) scale, which includes a single-item global measure of QOL (Single-Item QOL Scale [SIS]). The MQOL scale asks patients to report their most troublesome symptoms. We also initiated the use of a Support Network Scale and a Spiritual Beliefs Scale. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 60.9 years, 52% were men, 63% were white, and 33% were African American. Patients had a mean treatment time for ESRD of 44 months, mean hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL (118 g/L), mean albumin level of 3.7 g/dL (37 g/L), and mean Kt/V of 1.6. Forty-five percent of patients reported symptoms. Pain was the most common symptom (21% of patients). There was an inverse relationship between reported number of symptoms and SWLS (P < 0.01), MQOL scale score (P < 0.001), and SIS (P < 0.001). The Spiritual Beliefs Scale correlated with the MQOL scale score, SWLS (both P < 0.01), and SIS (P < 0.05). The Support Network Scale score correlated with the MQOL Existential (P = 0.01) and MQOL Support (P < 0.01) subscales. No clinical parameter correlated with any measure of QOL, spiritual beliefs, or social support. CONCLUSION: Symptoms, especially pain, along with psychosocial and spiritual factors, are important determinants of QOL of patients with ESRD. Additional studies, particularly a longitudinal trial, are needed to determine the reproducibility and utility of these QOL measures in assessing patient long-term outcome and their association with other QOL indices in larger and more diverse patient populations."
19164431,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The determinants of teenage sexual health, including pregnancies, can be addressed from social, familial and individual level perspectives. The main objective of this study was to examine whether pregnancy among 18 years old and younger girls were associated with selected individual (age at coitarche, score of sexual health knowledge, dislike of school) and family (mother's education) and family functioning (alcohol abuse in the family, parents' acceptance of sexual relationship) characteristics. METHODS: An interview survey in two medical institutions in Estonia among 279 18 year old and younger girls, who: (i) used contraception, had been sexually active for at least 6 months and had not pregnancies--(148 girls); (ii) came for termination of pregnancy--abortion group; (iii) planned to deliver and came for prenatal care--delivery group. The last two groups were analysed together as the 'pregnancy group'--131 girls. Multivariate analysis, by means of logistic regression models, was used to explore whether the associations were sustained after adjusting for other variables. Crude odds ratios (ORs), adjusted ORs and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated, with girls having no pregnancies as the reference group. RESULTS: Risk factors associated with teenage pregnancy were low score of sexual health knowledge (adjusted ORs 3.07; 95% CIs 1.73-5.46), dislike of school (adjusted ORs 1.96; 95% CIs 1.08-3.54), alcohol abuse by family members (adjusted ORs 2.03; 95% CIs 1.16-3.54). CONCLUSION: Sexual knowledge of teenagers, their attitude towards school, alcohol abuse in the family are factors associated with teenage pregnancies."
15681628,0,a,"This study attempted to evaluate the psychosocial, clinical, and radiological predictors of poststroke depression (PSD) in Chinese patients. One hundred eighty-nine patients participated in the study. Three months after the index stroke, a psychiatrist administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV to all of the patients and made a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression. In addition, a host of demographic, clinical, and radiological variables were examined. Thirty-one (16.4%) of the patients had a diagnosis of PSD that included major depression (n=11, 5.8%,), minor depression (n=16, 8.5%), or dysthymia (n=4, 2.1%). Univariate analysis revealed that PSD was associated with female gender, a lower level of education, a lower Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS) score, subcortical infarcts, and lesions in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory, and the Modified Life Event Scale (MLES) score was borderline for statistical significance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that female gender, a high MLES score, and subcortical and ACA lesions were independent risk factors for PSD and that a high LSNS score was a protective factor."
8909120,1,a,"This study employed semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to describe the help-seeking processes and examine the determinants of help-seeking behaviours in 100 consecutive referrals to a child psychiatric clinic in Hong Kong. The help-seeking processes were characterized by (1) a sequential pattern of lay consultations starting from the families, relatives, friends and, rarely, neighbours; (2) detour via multiple professionals; (3) delay in reaching specialist services. A total of seven psychosocial variables were used to predict the help-seeking behaviours. The younger the child was, the more likely members outside the families were sought for advice. A large number of professional consultations was predicted by a high symptom score and relative old age in the referred child, less social disadvantages in the family and parental beliefs that family influences were not the cause of the child's problems. A long delay in reaching specialist services was predicted by a high symptom score in the child. Parental beliefs of outside influences being the cause of the child's problems predicted a short delay in reaching the clinic. Low awareness of services was the predominant difficulty parents encountered when they sought psychiatric care for their children. Public health education to demystify the cause of mental disturbances, close networking with teachers and general practitioners, and establishment of community child mental health clinics for easy access are recommended."
19556325,0,a,"BACKGROUND: previous studies examining the relationship between socioeconomic status and telomere length showed conflicting results, one study finding shorter telomere length in subjects with lower socioeconomic status and one showing no relationship. DESIGN: cross-sectional study. SETTING: community-living elderly Chinese in Hong Kong. OBJECTIVE: this study examines the relationship between self-rated social economic status and telomere length in Hong Kong Chinese men and women aged 65 years and over living in the community. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: information was collected from 958 men and 978 women regarding possible confounding factors such as the presence of chronic diseases, smoking, physical activity level, dietary intake and body mass index. Telomere length was measured by quantitative PCR. RESULT: in men only, after adjustment for age and other confounding factors, a higher ranking in community standing was associated with shorter telomere length. CONCLUSION: men with higher self-rated socioeconomic status have shorter telomeres, possibly mediated through psychosocial rather than lifestyle factors or the presence of chronic disease. There may be cultural ethnic and age-related differences in social determinants of health."
17151800,0,a,Engagement is a core component of effective educational programs for children with autism. Analysis of 711 naturalistic goal-directed classroom behaviors of four school-age children with autism and four comparable children with Down syndrome (DS) was conducted. The definition of engagement was expanded to include child compliance and congruence. A main finding was both child and environmental factors influenced type of engagement. Children with DS produced 20% more goal-directed behaviors that were both congruent and compliant compared to children with autism. Large group instruction was associated with less congruent engagement but more compliant engagement for children with autism. These findings suggest specific types of engagement which may lead to advances in developing evidence-based practices for specific developmental disorders.
9498898,1,a,"Epidemiological evidence on the relation between aromatic amines and cancer risk is reviewed. In particular, cancer risk in humans resulting from exposure to aromatic amines from occupational sources and tobacco smoking is assessed with reference to ecologic, cohort, and case-control studies. Seven arylamines have been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer: benzidine-based dyes and MOCA (4,4'-methylene bis 2-choloroaniline) were considered 'probably' carcinogenic, Group 2A, because of a high level of evidence in experimental animals; two occupational chemicals (2-naphthylamine and benzidine), one drug (Chlornaphazine), and two manufacturing processes (manufacture of auramine and magenta) were included in Group 1 on the basis of 'sufficient' evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. Occupational exposures to aromatic amines explain up to 25 percent of bladder cancers in some areas of Western countries; these estimates might be higher in limited areas of developing countries. Aromatic amines contaminate the ambient air as a component of environmental tobacco smoke. There is increasing evidence that the excess of bladder cancer in smokers is attributable to aromatic amines rather than to other contaminants of tobacco smoke such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). A modulating role in the risk of bladder cancer associated with exposure to aromatic amines is played by metabolic polymorphisms, such as the N-acetyltransferase genotype, raising important social and ethical issues. The consistent observation of a difference between men and women in bladder cancer risk, after allowing for known risk factors, suggests consideration of gender-related biological determinants for future investigation."
8014834,1,a,"A longitudinal study of 243 students was conducted to examine the stable and situational influences on coping. At Time 1, measures of coping in response to a recent event (initial coping) and coping resources were obtained. At Time 2 (4 weeks later), Ss described an event (coded for event type) they were currently experiencing. Situational appraisals were also assessed. At Time 3 (2 weeks later), Ss' coping responses to the event were assessed. There was evidence that stable factors did influence coping behavior. Coping resources accounted for a significant proportion of variance in each of the measures of coping (except cautiousness), as did initial coping. There was evidence that the latter effects were dependent on cross-situational consistency in event type and levels of stress. After controlling for the stable influences, situational factors (situation type and situational appraisals) influenced the type of coping used."
18561037,0,a,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the incidence and outcome of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Switzerland and to test the feasibility of a large cohort study with case identification in the first 24 hours and 6-month follow-up. METHODS: From January to June 2005, we consecutively enrolled and followed up all persons with severe TBI (Abbreviated Injury Score of the head region >3 and Glasgow Coma Scale <9) in the catchment areas of 3 Swiss medical centres with neurosurgical facilities. The primary outcome was the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) after 6 months. Secondary outcomes included survival, Functional Independence Mea - sure (FIM), and health-related quality of life (SF-12) at defined time-points up to 6 months after injury. RESULTS: We recruited 101 participants from a source population of about 2.47 million (ie, about 33% of Swiss population). The incidence of severe TBI was 8.2 per 100,000 person-years. The overall case fatality was 70%: 41 of 101 persons (41%) died at the scene of the accident. 23 of 60 hospitalised participants (38%) died within 48 hours, and 31 (53%) within 6 months. In all hospitalised patients, the median GOSE was 1 (range 1-8) after 6 months, and was 6 (2-8) in 6-month survivors. The median total FIM score was 125 (range 18-126); median-SF-12 component mea - sures were 44 (25-55) for the physical scale and 52 (32-65) for the mental scale. CONCLUSIONS: Severe TBI was associated with high case fatality and considerable morbidity in survivors. We demonstrated the feasibility of a multicentre cohort study in Switzerland with the aim of identifying modifiable determinants of outcome and improving current trauma care."
12007554,0,a,"The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which respondents provided the same answers to a health-related lifestyle questionnaire in self- and interviewer-administered forms. A total of 234 subjects completed a 110-item questionnaire in both interviewer and self-administered forms. Modes of administration were separated by a 2-week interval. The order was determined by random allocation. The presence and the extent of the tendency to give socially acceptable responses were evaluated using percentage of bias calculated as the ratio of the difference in proportion of positive responses or the mean between interviews and questionnaires and those in questionnaires. All percentages of bias were in the positive direction, ranging from 1.4% (physical exercise) to 26.1% (general life stress). The average percentage of bias was higher in women than in men and were stronger for younger respondents. The age differences between interviewer and respondent were inversely and most strongly related to percentage of bias. Self- and interviewer-administered questionnaires yield very similar results in discriminating between subjects, but the interviewer-administered questionnaire showed systematically more desirable responses to questions related to lifestyle factors. The differences in characteristics between interviewer and respondent may be important determinants of the socially desirability bias in the interview."
12101586,0,a,"This study examined the determinants of attitudes toward intergroup support. The data was collected from the participants of a simulated society game (SIMINSOC; Hirose, 1997). The global society in the game includes rich and poor regions, and the poor regions need to obtain support from rich regions for survival. One hundred and thirty-two participants were randomly assigned to either rich or poor regions and were engaged in various activities in the game. The level of ingroup identity was manipulated by facilitating group activities in some groups but no in others. Then they answered questions regarding the identification, attributions of responsibility, and attitude toward support provision. The results indicated that the identification toward the ingroup increased attribution bias. Furthermore, the identification toward the global society increased the intent to provide support among those from the rich regions. The discussion considered the importance of including intergroup variables in the attributional approach to support provision."
9639205,1,a,"A survey of 658 Aboriginal men and women living in 11 reserve communities in Ontario, Canada, was utilized to collect data on patterns of condom use. Individuals who had sexual intercourse in the previous 12 months were included in the analysis (n=400). Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression were used to analyse condom use in the previous 12 months. Eight per cent always, 31% sometimes, and 61% never used condoms. Rates of condom use differed with the number of sex partners in the last year, age, gender, having a steady sex partner, and marital status. Multiple logistic regression revealed that people most likely to use condoms were under the age of 30, male, did not have a long-term steady sex partner, had more than one sex partner, worried about pregnancy, were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS, and were not embarrassed to obtain condoms. Condom users who were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS and who knew someone with HIV/AIDS were more likely to always use condoms. The most common reason for not using a condom was 'I was with my steady sex partner'. These results have implications for STD prevention efforts and for future research of sexual and STD preventive behaviour among Aboriginal people."

11885033,0,a,"The modern concept of public health, the New Public Health, carries a great potential for healthy and therefore less aggressive societies. Its core disciplines are health promotion, environmental health, and health care management based on advanced epidemiological methodologies. The main principles of living together in healthy societies can be summarized as four ethical concepts of the New Public Health essential to violence reduction equity, participation, subsidiarity, and sustainability. The following issues are discussed as violence determinants: the process of urbanization; type of neighborhood and accommodation, and consequent stigmatization; level of education; employment status; socialization of the family; women's status; alcohol and drug consumption; availability of the firearms; religious, ethnic, and racial prejudices; and poverty. Development of the health systems has to contribute to peace, since aggression, violence, and warfare are among the greatest risks for health and the economic welfare. This contribution can be described as follows: 1) full and indiscriminate access to all necessary services, 2) monitoring of their quality, 3) providing special support to vulnerable groups, and 4) constant scientific and public accountability of the evaluation of the epidemiological outcome. Violence can also destroy solidarity and social cohesion of groups, such as family, team, neighborhood, or any other social organization. Durkheim coined the term anomie for a state in which social disruption of the community results in health risks for individuals. Health professionals can make a threefold contribution to peace by 1) analyzing the causal interrelationships of violence phenomena, 2) curbing the determinants of violence according to the professional standards, and 3) training professionals for this increasingly important task. Because tolerance is an essential part of an amended definition of health, monitoring of the early signs of public intolerance is important. The vital interplay between the informed public and efficient administration, however, can only exist in an open society. The link between democracy and health of the people, and between public health and economic welfare is real. The Public Health Collaboration in South Eastern Europe (PH-SEE) evolved just in time to reconnect and strengthen disrupted professional networks in the region as a prerequisite of effective public health action."
12774653,0,a,"Epidemiology is a core science of public health, focusing on research related to the distribution and determinants of both positive and adverse health states and events and on application of knowledge gained to improve public health. The American College of Epidemiology (ACE) is a professional organization devoted to the professional practice of epidemiology. As part of that commitment, and in response to concerns for more explicit attention to core values and duties of epidemiologists in light of emerging issues and increased scrutiny of epidemiology, the College developed, adopted, and published a set of Ethics Guidelines. The structure of the ACE ethics guidelines is in four parts: (1) a brief statement of core values and duties of epidemiologists, coupled with the virtues important to professional practice; (2) concise statements of key duties and obligations; (3) exposition of the duties and obligations with more applications; and (4) a brief summary and conclusion. The Guidelines have been published on the ACE website and in the official College journal Annals of Epidemiology. The guidelines contain (and maintain) core elements that define the discipline of epidemiology and its fundamental duties, but they are also intended to be dynamic and evolving, responsive to a changing professional and social environment."
19041187,0,a,"Stress and stress-related health impairments are major problems in human life and elucidating the biological pathways linking stress and disease is of substantial importance. However, the identification of mechanisms underlying a dysregulation of major components of the stress response system is, particularly in humans, a very challenging task. Salivary cortisol responses to diverse acute challenge paradigms show large intra- and interindividual variability. In order to uncover mechanisms mediating stress-related disorders and to potentially develop new therapeutic strategies, an extensive phenotyping of HPA axis stress responses is essential. Such a research agenda depends on substantial knowledge of moderating and intervening variables that affect cortisol responses to different stressors and stimuli. The aim of this report is, therefore, to provide a comprehensive summary of important determinants of, in particular, human salivary cortisol responses to different kinds of laboratory stimuli including acute psychosocial stress as well as pharmacological provocation procedures. This overview demonstrates the role of age and gender, endogenous and exogenous sex steroid levels, pregnancy, lactation and breast-feeding, smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption as well as dietary energy supply in salivary cortisol responses to acute stress. Furthermore, it briefly summarizes current knowledge of the role of genetic factors and methodological issues in terms of habituation to repeated psychosocial stress exposures and time of testing as well as psychological factors, that have been shown to be associated with salivary cortisol responses like early life experiences, social factors, psychological interventions, personality as well as acute subjective-psychological stress responses and finally states of chronic stress and psychopathology."
10548444,1,a,"In this study, we sought to determine what factors, in addition to alcohol consumption, were the best predictors of social and physical alcohol-related problems. Variables examined as possible predictors of problems included circumstances under which people drink, feelings of alienation, and religious affiliation. Data for this study were collected continually from 1984 to 1989 using a random telephone survey of 2094 New York State residents aged 18 or older; the study sample was comprised of the 1076 who had consumed alcohol in the previous 30 days. Stepwise regression analyses examined the main effects of all possible predictors of problems while controlling for alcohol consumption. Forced-entry regressions examined interaction effects of problem predictors while controlling for basic demographics. Drinking with breakfast, smoking marijuana, and drinking in bars alone were all significant predictors of more problems. This suggests that problems are associated with an aberrant lifestyle (i.e., different from a typical lifestyle), although it makes no assumption about motivations. Further investigation of this subject area is warranted to ascertain which population subgroups are the most vulnerable to alcohol-related problems and to guide the design of prevention programs."

Memory problems and the likelihood of developing the disease emerged as significant predictors of concern about AD. The need to expand the use of theoretically-based models, including social-cognitive determinants, for the study of specific concerns about AD as a basis for the development of educational programs is discussed."
10396889,1,a,"Hispanics will constitute a growing part of the older population well into the 21st century. Accompanying this growth, we can expect that challenges associated with a large bilingual and non-English speaking older population may become more pronounced. The purpose of this research was to examine the level and determinants of English proficiency among older Hispanics in the United States. Data from the 1990 Census indicate that a third of the older Hispanic population in the United States speaks English poorly or not at all. This group includes a sizable number who are ""linguistically isolated"" in that they either live alone or with other nonproficient speakers of English. Using multivariate logistic regression techniques, it is shown that immigrant status and timing, socioeconomic status, geographic concentration, and national origin are key determinants of English proficiency."
2342984,1,a,"This investigation aimed to develop and validate an instrument, ""Attitudes, Subjective Norms, and Behavioral Intentions of Nurses Toward the Care of Dying Patients and Their Families"" (ASBID), and to examine the relationship among selected demographic variables, death anxiety, and social desirability response tendency on the behavioral intentions of nurses toward the dying. The Ajzen-Fishbein theory of reasoned action was used as the conceptual framework. Nursing behaviors toward the dying included in the ASBID were developed from interviews with bereaved family members. Three hundred seventy-two registered nurses caring for dying patients were used as the sample population for testing the ASBID. Internal consistency reliability coefficients for the ASBID achieved satisfactory standards. Factor analysis suggested three factors were being measured: general acute care measures for the dying, open communication with the dying, and continuing care for bereaved family members. Results supported the Ajzen-Fishbein theory that attitudes and subjective norms were major determinants of intentions. Findings indicate that educational programs planned to influence nursing care of the dying should focus on the consequences of specific behaviors of nurses rather than on death anxiety in nurses, and they should include nursing supervisors as well as nurses providing direct care for the dying."

Population Studies, 33 (2), 343-351], Flegg [(1982). Inequality of income, illiteracy and medical care as determinants of infant mortality in underdeveloped countries. Population Studies, 36 (3), 441-458] and Waldmann [(1992). Income distribution and infant mortality. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107 (4), 1283-1302] showing a negative cross-country association between income inequality and population health, cannot be replicated from recent data. In view of the importance of this matter, the present study further examines the issue from the most recent, and probably more accurate, data for the largest cross-country sample used in this line of research. The main conclusion is that the negative cross-country association between income inequality and good health, reported by Rodgers, Flegg, and Waldmann, is replicated very well. The different findings indicated by some scholars may have been due to their samples or the models being unusual. Therefore, the recent skepticism about the existence of such a negative association needs to be reconsidered. Several additional points are also noted. First, income inequality shows significance even after an index of ethnic heterogeneity is included. Second, ethnic heterogeneity itself has a negative association with population health. Third, income inequality retains significance in the presence of a measure of social capital. Fourth, however, the association between the measure of social capital and population health appears weak. Fifth, a simple analysis does not support the view that the positive association between income inequality and infant mortality in less developed countries (LDCs) may just be a reflection of the role of poverty. Finally, there is some support for the proposition that while income may be relatively more important for health in LDCs, the role of income inequality may be stronger in developed economies."

10048726,1,a,"BACKGROUND: In the Copenhagen Male Study men with the Lewis blood group phenotype Le(a+b-), non-secretors of ABH antigen, and men with the O or the A phenotype in the ABO blood group have been found to have a significantly higher lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer than others. We investigated the importance of the association of these genetic markers, life-style factors, and social class with lifetime risk of peptic ulcer, testing specifically the hypothesis that the strength of the association of risk factors with peptic ulcer depends on genetic susceptibility. METHODS: Three thousand three hundred and forty-six white men 55-74 years old were included for study. From a questionnaire validated during an interview information was obtained about life-style factors and peptic ulcer history (gastric or duodenal). Potential non-genetic risk factors examined were smoking history, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, consumption of tea and coffee, and use of sugar in tea or coffee. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-four men (11.5%) had a history of peptic ulcer; 120 (3.6%) had had an operation due to peptic ulcer. Non-genetic peptic ulcer risk factors identified were ever having been a smoker, use of sugar in tea or coffee, abstention from tea consumption, and low social class. On the basis of these and the genetic factors, it was possible to identify a low-risk group (n = 142) with a lifetime prevalence of 4.2%, several intermediate-risk groups, and a high-risk group (n = 55) with a prevalence of 29%; the odds ratio with 95% confidence limits (OR) was 9.3 (3.4-25.3). Corresponding values with regard to operation were 1.4% and 20.0%; OR = 17.5 (3.7-82.0). Several significant interactions were found; for example, the use of sugar was associated with peptic ulcer risk only when interacting with genetic risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the role of Helicobacter pylori, it is interesting that the factors identified in this study were able to identify groups with extremely different lifetime risks. This finding and also the finding of strong interactions between genetic and life-style factors and between genetic factors and social class for the risk of peptic ulcer may have both public-health and clinical implications."
12772438,0,a,"AIM: To present currently available evidence on the role that adverse psychosocial factors play in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The specific objectives of the review were to (1) provide a picture of what is known about the relationship between psychosocial factors and hypertension, (2) summarize the major methodological and conceptual pitfalls, and (3) identify gaps in the literature and suggest areas for future research. DATA SYNTHESIS: The scope of the literature review was adults and the literature published since 1990 (acknowledging that some articles published earlier would need to be taken into account). A number of journal searches were carried out. They included Medline, PsychInfo, and SocioFile, with keywords, such as hypertension, blood pressure, psychosocial, psychological, social, acculturation, occupation, socio-economic status, social class, education, depression, anger, and anxiety. The search included articles related to hypertension in developed countries and was limited to studies in the English language. CONCLUSION: A growing body of evidence supports the thesis that psychosocial factors play a role in the pathogenesis for hypertension."

Their efforts to evaluate health services comes off enriched with new scenarios of integration and convergence. Objectives of global interest in the world cannot be faced by individual countries alone: on the contrary, the whole scientific community of public health operators must be involved. The cultural, social and economic development is the unavoidable condition to increase the health level of the populations. No health organization with the characteristics of excellence can exist without a comparable, balanced development regarding the society and its economy. With such considerations in mind, the European Commission in 1997 has began to develop the Health Monitoring Programme, with the aim to build a system for monitoring health in the UE. Within this Programme, the Study ECHI 1 (European Community Health Indicators 1) has been published, which includes 4 large groups of indicators (demographic and socioeconomic indicators, health indicators, determinants of health/disease indicators, health services indicators); such a study was performed with the cooperation of OCSE and WHO/Euro researchers. The following ECHI 2 research did not change the supporting philosophy of ECHI 1. We are trying to evaluate whether the intervention of health operators and health structures could influence - increasing or decreasing - the phenomena described and measured by the indicators, inviting the readers to start a debate with us."

1740227,1,a,"This study examined the ability of bobwhite quail embryos and hatchlings to learn an individual bobwhite maternal call. Results revealed that embryos could learn an individual maternal call and remember that call for at least 24 hr following exposure. In contrast, hatchlings reared socially in groups of same-age chicks during postnatal exposure to a maternal call did not demonstrate a preference for that familiar call at 24 hr following exposure. However, individual auditory recognition was exhibited by hatchlings reared in social isolation, suggesting that the perceptual and social complexity of the postnatal situation can disrupt or interfere with early auditory learning. Additional support for this view was the finding that embryos exposed to unusually early visual stimulation during prenatal exposure to a maternal call also failed to prefer that familiar maternal call in subsequent choice tests. The idea that early auditory learning capacity is determined more by context and experience rather than the organism's specific age or stage of development is discussed."
17176233,0,a,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: If they are to respond effectively to health inequities, organisations involved in health promotion need to refocus on the social determinants of health (SDH) and the distribution of resources for health. METHODS: This paper examines the potential of health promotion foundations (HPFs), a semi-autonomous arm of the state, to act at several policy and program intervention points to address the SDH and reduce health inequities. CONCLUSION: The public purpose, enterprise and innovation potential of health promotion foundations provides them with unique capacity to respond to SDH. In the complex and contested policy environment surrounding action on the determinants of health, the role that foundations can most usefully play is that of a change agent in a broader social movement seeking health equity."
16464928,0,a,"This article outlines reasons why psychologists should concern themselves with media processes, noting how media are central to contemporary life and heavily implicated in the construction of shared understandings of health. We contend that the present research focus is substantially medicalized, privileging the investigation and framing of certain topics, such as the portrayal of health professionals, medical practices, specific diseases and lifestyle-orientated interventions, and restricting attention to social determinants of health as appropriate topics for investigation. We propose an extended agenda for media health research to include structural health concerns, such as crime, poverty, homelessness and housing and social capital."
9279040,1,a,"This study compared respite users with stoppers and nonusers in the Health Resources and Services Administration-funded Alzheimer's disease demonstration grant in the State of Maryland. Of those accepted into the program, only 54% participated for at least 6 months. The primary reasons for stopping were the death or institutionalization of the relative, while those not using respite services felt they didn't really need them. Determinants of program use included the poorer cognitive status of the relative and less anxiety and greater burden among the caregivers. After 6 months, users reported fewer hours of informal assistance, less burden, and that the relative had fewer behavioral problems although cognitive status and activities of daily living (ADLs) had deteriorated."
8372490,1,a,"This study examined the influence of educational achievement and occupational position on changes in risk behavior. Study population were 3753 men and women aged 25-64 years who were sampled by the first MONICA Augsburg Survey (Monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease). The subjects were sampled in 1984-85, were followed up for three years, and were reexamined in 1987-88. The baseline findings showed for both men and women a statistically significant inverse association between current cigarette smoking and educational level. During the follow-up period the differences between highest and lowest educational levels increased significantly among men. In 1987-88 only 21% of the best educated men were smokers compared to 38% of those with the lowest educational level. Men with low educational levels also drank more alcohol than better educated men, whereas among women those with lowest educational level drank less alcohol than the better educated. Statistically independent of education and age it was found that male civil servants and farmers had the lowest proportion of smokers in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal analyses. Among women, smoking was and remained most prevalent in simple white-collar occupations. In general, the findings indicate that the type of occupation and the actual working conditions have effects on life-style related risk factors which are in part independent of a social gradient. The results also suggest that the tendency to change unhealthy behavior is less pronounced in ""high risk"" groups."
16810371,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze sociodemographic inequalities in prenatal and childbirth care and their consequences on birth weight. METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 10,072 postpartum women treated at public (those outsourced by the National Health System) and private maternity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1999 to 2001. To test the association between birth weight and maternal sociodemographic and biological characteristics and prenatal care (modified Kotelchuck index), postpartum women were stratified by level of schooling and two multiple linear regressions were performed. The bootstrap technique was used in addition to accurate confidence intervals for the estimated effects. RESULTS: For nearly all of the variables analyzed in the bivariate analysis, birth weight was lower among children of mothers with low schooling. In the multivariate analysis, among women with low schooling, there was a direct association between birth weight and the modified Kotelchuck index and gestational age. The variables black skin color, smoking, and history of premature birth were negatively associated with birth weight, while maternal age and parity showed distinct behaviors from the central range of data at the extremes. In the group with high schooling, only parity, gestational age, and modified Kotelchuck index were significant and directly associated with birth weight. The protective effect of prenatal care was observed, as well as the negative effect of smoking, regardless of the mother's level of schooling. CONCLUSIONS: The variables associated with neonates' birth weight of mothers with high schooling in Rio de Janeiro were biological, in contrast to the social determinants in the group with low schooling."
18372874,0,a,"Scotland has recently embarked on a new phase of policy and infrastructure development for improving population health and reducing health inequalities that broadly conforms to the Ottawa Charter and WHO's strategic framework for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. The new phase is characterised by an integrated, cross-government approach to improving health with strengthened political and Scottish Executive leadership and investment since devolution. A comprehensive policy framework for improving young people's health and reducing inequalities has been developed across education, health, environment and social justice. It builds on an earlier phase of relative stability and continuity in the health promotion infrastructure with policy focused on CVD and cancer prevention and tackling the behavioural risk factors (smoking, alcohol, diet, physical activity) as well as sexual health and mental health and wellbeing. These national strategies are currently being implemented across Scotland. They combine promotion, prevention, treatment and protection goals and target both population-level and high-risk groups. Crosscutting government objectives and headline targets for addressing poverty, disadvantage and health inequalities now supplement the NHS health improvement targets on smoking, alcohol, physical activity, teenage pregnancy and child immunization. Within the health service, prevention efforts are largely concerned with primary care development (anticipatory care) and health system reform to maximize their impact on reducing health inequalities. Efforts to tackle the social determinants of health and reduce inequalities in health outcomes are beginning to be connected and mainstreamed across local government with Community Planning Partnerships as the main vehicle. National level mechanisms for integrated funding, planning and performance reporting to deliver shared priority outcomes have yet to be developed. The development of health improvement strategies has been founded upon a rich source of population health data to monitor changes and improvements, epidemiological studies and evaluation work. The key issues have been to find ways of intervening to accelerate the rate of improvement and to stem the growing health inequalities. A further challenge is to ensure that the lessons from reviews and evaluations of past programmes and strategies are not lost, but help to guide improvements in the complex delivery system and to inform future policy direction. Within the health service, prevention efforts are largely concerned with primary care development and health system reform. Efforts to reduce inequalities in health outcomes are beginning to be connected and mainstreamed across local government."
8900703,1,a,"This paper describes the development and evaluation of a computer-aided learning (CAL) program. The program was tested in a trial that involved 36 people with diabetes; 20 received CAL lessons in diabetes management and 16 attended conventional diabetes classes conducted by diabetes educators. When measurements taken before and three months after the education were compared, both groups showed significant improvement in their knowledge; the blood glucose levels of the CAL group were significantly lower but those of the conventional education group were higher. This means that the CAL program was as effective as conventional education in imparting knowledge but it was more likely to motivate people to control their glucose levels. The CAL program allows diabetes educators to spend less time on education in basic knowledge and to concentrate more on motivational and social factors that are important determinants of patient compliance. It can also benefit people with diabetes whose access to health professionals and/or conventional diabetes education is restricted."
9697250,1,a,"A telephone survey was carried out with the objective of measuring the prevalence, duration and determinants of breast-feeding in the canton of Geneva, between August and December 1993. The participants were 278 out of 320 families with a telephone number in Geneva, from a random sample of families in which a child had been born in Geneva in the preceding 15 months. Prevalence of breast-feeding at 1 day of life was 93.3%, at 3 months 62.5%, at 4 months 51.1%, at 6 months 28.1%; median duration was 4.2 months. For complete (exclusive or predominant) breast-feeding, results were: 1 day 87.3%, 3 months 37.5%, 4 months 19.4%, 6 months 3.8%; median duration 2.4 months. Initial prevalence of breast-feeding was significantly higher in girls (97.2%) than in boys (89.4%, p < 0.01). Duration of breast-feeding was shorter in children of women who smoked (p < 0.001). Relative risks for no breast-feeding at 4 months were 1.53 (95% confidence limits 1.20-1.96) for less than 15 cigarettes per day during pregnancy, and 3.65 (2.19-6.09) for 15 cigarettes or more. Duration of breast-feeding was shorter if the mother worked as an employee. Prevalence and duration were higher if the mother was originally from Africa, Asia, Middle-East or Latin American countries. Although the initial prevalence of breast-feeding was relatively high, only half of children were breast-fed at 4 months. Promotive efforts are needed to increase the duration of breast-feeding, in particular by legislation on maternal protection. Further studies are required to clarify gender differences in breast-feeding."
18067465,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between puberty, sedentary behaviors, and psychosocial influences with intention for physical activity (PA) and PA. METHODS: Low-income, overweight African American girls (n=72) completed 5 questionnaires that assessed PA, sedentary behaviors, and psychosocial influences. Puberty was assessed using Tanner stages. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the relationships between these measures and intention for PA. RESULTS: Puberty was significantly associated with lower intention for PA, whereas health beliefs such as ""staying in shape"" and social support were significantly associated with greater intention for PA. CONCLUSIONS: Puberty, health beliefs for PA, and social support from parents and peers were significant predictors of intention for PA in low-income, overweight African American girls."
12062922,0,a,"PURPOSE: Studies worldwide show that self-rated health (SRH) is a robust predictor of mortality among the elderly. Only few studies have focussed on a middle-aged population and no such study has been reported from Germany. This study examined the association between SRH and mortality in a middle-aged, population based cohort from Germany, using data from the MONICA (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases) Augsburg project. METHODS: The cohort comprises 1521 men and 1498 women aged 35-64; they were followed over 11 years from 1984-1995. Participants provided extensive data on medical conditions and cardiovascular risk factors through interviews and examinations. SRH was assessed globally and in comparison to those of the same age. We estimated relative hazards for mortality from all-causes and cardiovascular disease according to self-ratings of health. RESULTS: Among males the adjusted hazards rate ratio (HRR) of mortality from all-causes was 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.2) for combined fair/poor perceived health compared with good/excellent health. Women with fair/poor ratings had no increased risk of dying (HRR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.7-1.9). Men who perceived worse health than persons of the same age showed an adjusted HRR of 1.7 (95% CI 1.0-2.9) as compared to those perceiving better health; in women the adjusted HRR was 1.9 (95% CI 1.0-3.7). The adjusted hazards for dying from cardiovascular diseases in men were 1.3 (95% CI 0.8-2.1) for those perceiving fair/poor and 1.7 (95% CI 0.7-3.7) for those perceiving worse health. CONCLUSIONS: Self-rated health was a predictor of mortality in a middle-aged German population and contains information that is not entirely reflected in underlying medical conditions and risk factors. Self-assessments of health in comparison to individuals of the same age were stronger and more consistently associated with mortality. Global self-ratings of health and self-ratings in comparison to those of the same age may measure slightly different dimensions and the effect of self-rated health may differ among men and women."
1558711,1,a,"The present article reviews research concerned with gender effects on cognitions and evaluations of people varying in age. Sontag's (1979) article on the double standard of aging--the purportedly more negative consequences of aging in women in contrast to men--serves as a point of departure for the review. Research using attitude-scale, semantic differential, and person-perception methodology points to sex-of-target, sex-of-subject, and target-subject interaction effects in response to a diversity of age-relevant stimuli. Though the reported studies are not completely consistent, there is much suggestive evidence that age is a more salient dimension for men than for women when judging others. Furthermore, men exhibit a stronger youth bias. The overall evidence is consistent with an evolutionary hypothesis, but further research that focuses on the proximal determinants of the observed effects is urged."
15627221,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Social context (demographic, socioeconomic, macroeconomic, and sociopolitical features of the environment) influences the epidemiology and consequences of individual behaviors that affect health outcomes. This article examines the role of social context in heterosexual networks that facilitate the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), particularly in relation to persistent racial disparities in rates of STIs in the United States. METHODS: Review of the medical, public health, and social science literature. RESULTS: Contextual factors, such as poverty, discrimination, epidemiology of illicit drug use in the community, ratio of men to women, incarceration rates, and racial segregation, influence sexual behavior and sexual networks directly and indirectly through a variety of mechanisms. Disparities in these contextual features likely contribute substantially to the persistence of marked racial disparities in rates of STIs. CONCLUSIONS: Given the importance of contextual factors and the sharply contrasting social contexts for blacks and whites, exclusive emphasis on individual risk factors and determinants is unlikely to produce solutions that will significantly decrease HIV rates among blacks. Effective HIV prevention in this population will require multidisciplinary research to address the contextual factors that promote patterns of sexual networks that facilitate transmission of STIs."
15073910,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study describes the use of psychotropic drugs in a sample of eight Italian psychiatric hospitals. METHODS: A cross-sectional approach was used to collect information about sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the inpatient population, and about medications prescribed. Prescribing behaviour in the hospitals was compared using three indicators: the number of patients taking psychotropic drugs, the use of high doses of neuroleptics and the use of multiple neuroleptics. RESULTS: More than a thousand patients were resident in the eight hospitals on the census day, 56% of them males. Half the population had an ICD-X diagnosis of schizophrenia, one third of mental retardation. Sixty-nine percent of the sample was on neuroleptic therapy, nearly 47% on benzodiazepines and 4% on antidepressants. Twenty percent of the sample did not take any psychotropic drug on the census day. After adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical variables, setting-related variables resulted as determinants of psychotropic drug use. CONCLUSIONS: These data call for continuing education in psychopharmacology towards a more rational use of drugs; longitudinal audits of clinical practice should be implemented to guide clinicians toward a more rational use of psychotropic drugs."
9752284,1,a,"The tendency today is to make the population more aware of health in order to encourage their use of prevention activities. The aim of our telephone survey which was performed on a representative sample of the population (1,010) in the Bas-Rhin department in France, was to study the relationship between the level of knowledge of cancer and the use of screening techniques to prevent it. Eighty-two percent of the males and 78% of the females surveyed, show a profound understanding of cancer in general, the associated risk factors and its prevention. The level of awareness of males did not influence a specific behaviour (p = 0.68) towards cancer prevention. It was shown that in smokers, the more they smoke, the more they underestimate the chances of cure from all categories of cancer (p = 0.01). They both overestimate the number of cigarettes needed daily before smoking becomes toxic (p < 0.01) and are less active physically than nonsmokers (p < 0.007). Heavy smokers live in larger communities (p < 0.02) and smokers are younger than non-smokers (p < 0.0001). In the female population, the level of awareness did indeed influence their behaviour towards cancer prevention (p < 0.04). The level of knowledge was higher in both those who consciously attend cancer screening clinics (cervical Papanicolaou smears and faecal tests) and those who are opposed to faecal tests. Younger females are significantly less aware than those who are older (p = 0.0001) and more than two-thirds of these would not consider a cervical Papanicolaou smear as a preventative diagnostic tool. Females who conscientiously attend cancer screening clinics and who are very much aware of cancer, are generally older in age (p < 0.05). The occurrence of mammography as a preventative measure is both high and dependent on age. In conclusion, the level of knowledge of cancer cannot explain alone human behaviour towards the prevention of this disease. Other determinants responsible for influencing human behaviour towards cancer prevention will be better understood once the social sciences, epidemiology and anthropology units work together and combine resources to achieve a common goal."
8556442,1,a,"Adolescents who report prior sexual abuse are at increased risk for adolescent pregnancy. This may result from earlier, more frequent, less well-protected sexual activity or from a greater desire to conceive. To determine the relative contribution of these two possible explanations to the reported association between sexual abuse and adolescent pregnancy, we studied the reproductive and sexual histories of 200 sexually active 13-18 year old females in relation to self-reported sexual abuse. Anonymous questionnaires revealed that 40 (20%) of the 200 subjects reported sexual abuse. Analyses revealed no group differences in the median age of first voluntary intercourse, the frequency of sexual intercourse, or the consistency of birth control use. Compared to their nonabused peers, however, teenagers reporting abuse were more likely to be trying to conceive (35% vs. 14% p < .01), to have boyfriends pressuring them to conceive (76% vs. 44% p < .01), and to have fears about infertility (38% vs. 16% p < .01). Our findings suggest that childhood sexual abuse may increase the risk of adolescent pregnancy by fostering the desire to conceive. Further study is needed to determine why a disproportionate number of sexually abused adolescents desire pregnancy. The efficacy of adolescent pregnancy prevention programs may be improved by identifying previously abused adolescents and by designing educational interventions that specifically address their desire to conceive."
1634431,1,a,"Many individuals who exhibit self-injurious behavior (SIB) also exhibit self-restraint. Three hypotheses about the determinants of self-restraint have been suggested: (a) Self-restraint is maintained by escape from or avoidance of aversive aspects of SIB, (b) self-restraint and SIB are members of the same functional class, and (c) self-restraint and SIB are functionally independent. This study examined a method by which the relationship between self-restraint and SIB may be investigated using functional analysis. Data were collected on the self-restraint and SIB exhibited by 5 mentally retarded males, while conditions suspected to maintain SIB were manipulated. Results suggested that self-restraint, like SIB, may be maintained by idiosyncratic contingencies. Implications of an understanding of self-restraint for the analysis and treatment of SIB are discussed, as are some general possibilities for future research."
2263988,1,a,"The need of increasing the amount and quality of applied research in the health field es emphasized. The social and economical determinants of health and health care services require a multidisciplinary approach. The most important issue is the utilization of research results in the definition of policies and in the decision making process. Some of the barriers and obstacles to implement research results are discussed as well as the strategies that can be put forward to overcome the former. It is suggested tah participatory research could be an innovative methodology to improve the application of research results. Participative research is a collaborative effort that involves different actors of the health arena including administrators, health personnel, community members, and the researchers themselves. This type of research carries out diagnostic and intervention activities from the very beginning of the studies; its main strength is that decision made and the community members are active participants, impinging a scientific approach to their daily work and so the application of results is facilitated through out the process."
9329480,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the physical ability and psychocognitive status of a population more than 90 years of age with regard to sociodemographic, behavioral, and biomedical variables known to affect functional status in old age. DESIGN: A survey design was used. SETTING: Emilia Romagna, Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four healthy community-dwelling subjects aged 90 to 106 years. MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic variables, health behavior, anthropometric indices, and serum DHEAS levels were recorded. Functional assessment was performed by instruments currently used in geriatric practice: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: GDS scores correlated directly with MMSE scores and inversely with ADL severity scores. Poor education, institutionalization, sensory impairment, muscular mass loss, and lower DHEAS levels were the variables with the highest correlation to functional impairment. Smoking, alcohol consumption, and marital status were relatively unimportant. An inverse association was found between DHEAS levels and dependency scores of single ADLs (continence, mobility). CONCLUSION: Impaired cognitive and physical ability with no increase in depression prevalence was found in a sample of subjects more than 90 years of age free of major age-related disease. Muscular mass and DHEAS levels seem to play a role in maintaining physical independence. In turn, physical independence, as well as social and cultural factors, strongly affect the compliance of long-lived subjects with psychocognitive tests currently used in the clinical evaluation of younger old people, suggesting that these instruments are not reliable for screening for cognitive impairment and depression in the oldest old subjects."
18569628,0,a,"The health burden of environmental exposures, including ambient air pollution and climate-change-related health impacts, is not equally distributed between or within regions and countries. These inequalities are currently receiving increased attention in environmental research as well as enhanced appreciation in environmental policy, where calls for environmental equity are more frequently heard. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 Global Update of the Air Quality Guidelines attempted to address the global-scale inequalities in exposures to air pollution and the burden of diseases due to air pollution. The guidelines stop short, however, of addressing explicitly the inequalities in exposure and adverse health effects within countries and urban areas due to differential distribution of sources of air pollution such as motor vehicles and local industry, and differences in susceptibility to the adverse health effects attributed to air pollution. These inequalities, may, however, be addressed in local air quality and land use management decisions. Locally, community-based participatory research can play an important role in documenting potential inequities and fostering corrective action. Research on environmental inequities will also benefit from current efforts to (1) better understand social determinants of health and (2) apply research evidence to reduce health disparities. Similarly, future research and policy action will benefit from stronger linkages between equity concerns related to health consequences of both air pollution exposure and climate change, since combustion products are important contributors to both of these environmental problems."
18576207,0,a,"A multivariate model was developed incorporating various socio-demographic, social-environmental, and social-psychological factors in an attempt to predict suicidal ideation among Canadian youth. The main research objective sought to determine what socially based factors elevate or reduce suicidal ideation within this population. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth-Cycle 5 (2003), a cross-sectional sample of 1,032 was used to empirically identify various social determinants of suicidal ideation among youth between the ages of 12 and 15. Results reveal statistically significant correlations between suicide ideation and some lesser examined socially based measures. In particular, ability to communicate feelings, negative attachment to parents/guardians, taunting/bullying or abuse, and presence of deviant peers were significant predictors of suicidal ideation. As expected, depression/anxiety, gender, and age were also correlated with thoughts of suicide. Research findings should help foster a better understanding toward the social elements of suicide and provide insight into how suicide prevention strategies may be improved through an increased emphasis on substance use education, direct targeting of dysfunctional families and deviant peer groups, and exploring more avenues of self-expression for youth."
19324728,0,a,"Mammalian societies in which females dominate males are rare, and the factors favouring the evolution of female dominance have yet to be clearly identified. We propose a new hypothesis for the evolution of female dominance and test its predictions with empirical data from the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a well-studied species characterized by female dominance. We suggest that constraints imposed by the development of a feeding apparatus specialized for bone cracking, in combination with the intensive feeding competition characteristic of spotted hyenas, led to the evolution of female dominance. Specifically, we propose that protracted development of the feeding apparatus in young hyenas led to selection for increased aggressiveness in females as a compensatory mechanism for mothers to secure food access for their young after weaning. Our analyses yielded results consistent with this hypothesis. Morphological and behavioural measurements indicate that skull development is indeed protracted in this species; spotted hyenas do not achieve adult skull size or feeding performance capabilities until after sexual maturity. The period between weaning and completed skull development is particularly challenging, as indicated by high mortality. Finally, maternal presence between weaning and full skull maturity, as well as the relative ability of females to aggressively displace conspecifics from food, are important determinants of offspring survival."
11472446,0,a,"AIMS: Many psycho-social factors can affect the glycaemic control of children with Type 1 diabetes, but the influence of the intelligence of the child and their parents has not been reported. METHODS: Seventy-eight children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes and their mothers performed standardized tests to assess psychometric intelligence. The children were aged (median (range)) 12.0 (5-17) years with duration of diabetes 5.0 (1.0-13.0) years and required an insulin dose of (mean +/- SD) 1.0 +/- 0.3 U/kg per day. The children completed the Wide Range Achievement Test 3 reading test (WRAT3) and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM). A mean annual HbA1c was calculated for each subject (8.6 +/- 1.4%). The mothers performed the National Adult Reading Test (NART) and provided details of the occupation of the main wage-earner in the family from which social class (SC) was derived. RESULTS: The HbA1c of the child correlated with their age (r = 0.26, P = 0.02), SC (Kendall's rank correlation, tau = 0.17, P = 0.03) and with the NART error score of their mother (r = 0.28, P = 0.01), but no correlation was observed with the child's WRAT3 or RSPM score. Stepwise regression revealed that age and NART error score were the strongest independent determinants of glycaemic control (total adjusted r2 = 0.117). CONCLUSIONS: Parental intelligence appears to have a significant influence on the glycaemic control of a child with Type 1 diabetes, accounting for 7.6% of the reliable variance in HbA1c."
8621244,1,a,"To explore risk factors for testicular cancer and cryptorchidism, 2 parallel case-control studies were conducted in Denmark. The testicular-cancer study was population-based and included 514 cases and 720 controls. The cryptorchidism study included 387 cases and 416 controls and was based on 2 hospital series of men treated for cryptorchidism and a control group sampled among residents in the Copenhagen area. The 2037 men were interviewed by telephone, and self-administered questionnaires were sent to their mothers. A strong association was seen between low social class and cryptorchidism, with sons of unskilled workers having a 3-fold higher risk of cryptorchidism than sons of self-employed men. Testicular cancer was only moderately associated with high-social-class indicators, and only with such indicators pertaining to the mother. Both testicular cancer and cryptorchidism tended to occur more frequently in first-born men and in sons of older women but these associations were not statistically significant. Late puberty was associated with reduced risk of testicular cancer. The effect of age at puberty may be due both to advanced age at diagnosis and to the existence of common determinants of age at puberty and testicular cancer. Men who had been treated for cryptorchidism entered puberty later than other men, possibly because of impaired hormonal function of the testes. There was no indication of increased risk of testicular cancer or cryptorchidism in sons of mothers who smoked around the time of conception or during the pregnancy."
8057633,1,a,"Social identity theory was used to investigate the determinants of the current attitudes of 356 Australian (Melbournian) subjects toward the Gulf War. The dependent variables included a scale measuring belligerence, a scale measuring perceived justification for the Gulf War, and a short scale measuring how extensively the outcome of the war was perceived as an environmental issue. Independent variables included the concept ""Australia,"" measured by a semantic differential scale; conservatism and liberalism, measured by Kerlinger's (1984) Social Attitudes Scale; and gender. Multiple regression analysis provided some support for social identity theory. Conservatism and liberalism, however, were the strongest predictors of attitudes toward the war. Men expressed more support for the war than women did. Participants' conservatism and liberalism were predictive of how extensively they perceived the outcome of the war as an environmental issue."
12023313,0,a,"Tuberous sclerosis is one of the few established medical causes of autism spectrum disorder and is a unique neurogenetic model for testing theories about the brain basis of the syndrome. We conducted a retrospective case study of the neuro-epileptic risk factors predisposing to autism spectrum disorder in individuals with tuberous sclerosis to test current neurobiological theories of autism spectrum disorder. We found that an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis was associated with the presence of cortical tubers in the temporal but not other lobes of the brain. Indeed, the presence of tubers in the temporal lobes appeared to be a necessary but not sufficient risk factor for the development of an autism spectrum disorder. However, contrary to the predictions of some theories, the location of tubers in specific regions of the temporal lobe, such as the superior temporal gyrus or the right temporal lobe, did not determine which individuals with temporal lobe tubers developed an autism spectrum disorder. Instead, outcome was associated with various indices of epileptic activity including evidence of temporal lobe epileptiform discharges on EEG, the age to onset of seizures in the first 3 years of life and a history of infantile spasms. The results indicated that individuals with tuberous sclerosis are at very high risk of developing an autism spectrum disorder when temporal lobe tubers are present and associated with temporal lobe epileptiform discharges and early-onset, persistent spasm-like seizures. These risk markers constitute useful clinical indicators of prognosis, but further research is required to identify the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for their association with outcome. Most especially, it will be important to test whether, as the findings suggest, there is a critical early stage of brain maturation during which temporal lobe epilepsy perturbs the development of brain systems that underpin 'social intelligence' and possibly other cognitive skills, thereby inducing an autism spectrum disorder."
10453105,1,a,"Studies of migrants and comparisons of rural versus urban communities are potentially informative study designs because they allow examination of genetically similar population subgroups exposed to diverse environmental conditions. These designs have been underused in Africa, where recent urbanization has created many situations in which nearby communities of common ethnicity and culture live under different social and economic circumstances. The International Study of Hypertension in Blacks (ICSHIB) conducted several overlapping surveys in Nigeria starting in 1993. These surveys were based primarily in the rural village of Idere and the urban community of Idikan, both inhabited by people defined ethnically as Oyo Yoruba and sharing a common language and culture. Survey teams collected standardized blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, and some study participants provided 24-hr urine samples and questionnaire data on psychosocial stress and social integration. Rural and urban groups differed substantially in blood pressure and related characteristics. Age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension (blood pressure > or = 140/90 mm Hg) for participants aged 25 years and older was 7-8% in Idere and 24-27% in Idikan. The distributions of overweight, sodium/potassium ratio, perceived stress, and social integration scores all contributed to lower hypertension risk in Idere. The effects and interactions of these identified risk factors remain poorly understood, even among people who share a common genetic background, similar diet, and many other lifestyle features. Nonetheless, the rural-urban distinction is sufficiently salient to engender a nearly threefold difference in hypertension prevalence. This disparity in disease prevalence demonstrates the sensitivity of human beings to the environmental determinants of disease and provides a sobering example of the difficulty in identifying subtle genetic effects, which can be easily overwhelmed by small differences in environmental exposures."
8506166,1,a,"To determine whether gender differences existed in the relationships among potential predictors of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), a heuristic model of nine explanatory variables was tested with the responses of 146 men and 158 women randomly selected from middle- and upper-income census tracts of a midwestern city. The models for men and women did not differ significantly. The findings suggest interventions to increase LTPA participation that enhance health self-determinism and social influences on exercise and influence the negative attitudes toward exercise held by those who have poorer perceived health status, smoke, or are overweight."
2036210,1,a,"This study examined the predictive validity of preadolescent Type A determinants for Type A dimensions in young adulthood (n = 375). Predictive variables, i.e. hyperactivity, aggression, social maladjustment and self-esteem were measured when the subjects were aged 12. Type A dimensions, i.e. hard-driving, competitiveness plus aggression and impatience were measured in the same subjects when they were aged 18. ""Impatience"" was predicted by means of preadolescent hyperactivity, and ""competitiveness-aggression"" by social maladjustment. ""Hard-driving"", which was most strongly related to CHD risk factor levels in young adulthood, was anteceded by the subject's feeling that he or she could not cope with life. This supports the hypothesis that Type A behaviour is a coping mechanism: a person tries to cope with stress by increasing his or her level of achievement."
8847107,1,a,"In the coming decades, demographic, economic and social changes will result in an increased proportion of elderly persons in the workforce in most industrialized countries. This trend is causing growing interest in the problems of the aging worker in current employment. The objective of this particular paper is to provide more insight into the impact of aging on the balance between physical work capacity and physical workload. To this end, the scientific literature in the field is reviewed and ordered by means of a specific conceptual model of ""aging and physical workload"". A progressive decline in physical work capacity, characterized by diminished aerobic capacity and muscular capacity, has consistently been reported. However, inter-individual differences appear to be considerable. The question of whether there are systematic differences in physical work demands between younger and older workers within occupations has been answered vaguely. Conflicting results in this matter bring into discussion the role of the actual working method as one of the determinants of the physical workload. An age-related imbalance between physical workload and physical work capacity is suggested to result in a chronic overload, increasing the risk of long-term health effects such as musculoskeletal complaints and disorders. For many aging workers in physically demanding occupations, extreme physical workloads, increasing the risk of disease or disablement, are still reported. The multiconceptual study of aging and physical workload in the present paper reveals several possibilities for preventive measures. However, as information is still lacking, additional research is needed, in particular on the onset and development of long-term effects on health in relation to age and work demands."
24394711,1,a,"Nutrition rehabilitation of malnourished children remains a challenge for health services. This paper reports the results of an evaluation of the nutrition component of a mother and child health program in Nepal. The treatment of severely malnourished children was very satisfactory: case fatality rate varied from 4 to 9 % between projects. Follow-up, however, was found to be very poor: only one percent of the discharged children came for a follow-up visit after the first two weeks. The perception of malnutrition within the communities was identified as one of the possible determinants for a successful follow-up and small scale qualitative investigations were organized to gain insight in the topic. Results are quite revealing regarding the perception of nutrition problems. If for severe cases (kwashiorkor and marasmus) awareness of malnutrition did exist in the community, chronic malnutrition seems to be considered as a normal state of being. When a problem is perceived (in severe cases) people will seldom think of it as a nutrition related disease. Results show that the aetiology used by the people differs significantly from the western paradigm, and that traditional convictions put the causes at natural, supra-natural or social levels. The striking point is that no relation is established in the traditional framework between malnutrition (either severe or mild) and food intake of the children. Perception of malnutrition and of its causes influences health seeking behaviour in terms of prevention and treatment. Traditional healers play an important curative role and will often be the first to be contacted. The absence of perception of the links between the shape of the body and nutrients is put forward as one of the possible explaining mechanisms for low follow-up rates observed. An implication of this study would be to revise the health messages delivered to the communities in order to make them culturally more appropriate and relevant."

10187592,1,a,"While the importance of the private sector in providing health services in developing countries is now widely acknowledged, the paucity of data on numbers and types of providers has prevented systematic cross-country comparisons. Using available published and unpublished sources, we have assembled data on the number of public and private health care providers for approximately 40 countries. This paper presents some results of the analysis of this database, looking particularly at the determinants of the size and structure of the private health sector. We consider two different types of dependent variable: the absolute number of private providers (measured here as physicians and hospital beds), and the public-private composition of provision. We examine the relationship between these variables and income and other socioeconomic characteristics, at the national level. We find that while income level is related to the absolute size of the private sector, the public-private mix does not seem to be related to income. After controlling for income, certain socioeconomic characteristics, such as education, population density, and health status are associated with the size of the private sector, though no causal relationship is posited. Further analysis will require more complete data about the size of the private sector, including the extent of dual practice by government-employed physicians. A richer story of the determinants of private sector growth would incorporate more information about the institutional structure of health systems, including provider payment mechanisms, the level and quality of public services, the regulatory structure, and labour and capital market characteristics. Finally, a normative analysis of the size and growth of the private sector will require a better understanding of its impact on key social welfare outcomes."
8428863,1,a,"There has been limited systematic study of determinants of acute psychiatric hospitalization of children and adolescents. This study reviewed the records of children and adolescents who received emergency mental health services in one New Jersey county during 6 months of 1990 (N = 226). Using a structured form to abstract data, information was obtained on demographics, precipitating problems, past mental health services, substance use, family problems, and disposition. While suicidal behavior was not a predictor of acute hospitalization, the interaction of assaultive and suicidal behavior was predictive. Other contributory factors identified in the multivariate analysis included: child's substance use, family member's substance use, and initial emergency screening site. Recognition of present utilization patterns will facilitate the development of intensive community-based options for those with acute mental health problems."
11029135,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to predict and explain nurses' adherence to Universal Precautions (UPs) when performing venipunctures. METHODS: Data were gathered from 156 registered nurses working at a regional hospital. A self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial variables (intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived control, etc) was completed at baseline, and behavior was self-reported 3 months later. RESULTS: The regression of intention on the variables yielded an adjusted R(2) of 0.68, with perceived barriers (beta =.62, P <.001), social norm (beta =.17, P <.01), and personal normative belief (beta =.19, P <.01) being the significant variables. With respect to the 3-month follow-up, 28% of the variance associated with UPs adherence was explained by intention (beta =.37, P <.001) and perceived behavioral control (beta =.23, P <.05). Moreover, high (n = 116) and low intenders (n = 40) differed on several normative beliefs (P =.0003) and perceived barriers (P =.0001). CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that perception of control, assessed either globally or by means of a belief-based measure, is a key factor in adherence. Specifically, the perceived difficulties associated with adherence to UPs appear to be related to a nurse's training on UPs and to the existence of suboptimal working conditions."
16014658,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the social determinants of smoking among adolescents attending school and/or work. METHODS: A survey was carried out on 6012 adolescents aged between 13 and 17 years in 15 cities, recruited from schools, vocational training centres and work places. A self-completed questionnaire was used for data collection. Single- and multi-level regression analyses were run to estimate models. RESULTS: Ever smoking and current smoking rates were 41.1% and 10.5% among girls, and 57.5% and 25.2% among boys. These rates were 47.0% and 13.3% among those who only attended school, 62.2% and 31.7% among those who attended school and worked simultaneously, and 67.5% and 43.0% among those who worked and did not attend school. In multi-level analysis, the major predictors of current smoking were close friends smoking [odds ratio (OR) 3.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-6.27], no knowledge of harmful effects of short-term smoking (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.74-2.67), vulnerability to peer pressure (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.48-2.46), negative self-perception (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.31-2.18) and male sex (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.30-2.16). Mothers higher education was a predictor for girls' smoking, while mother's lower education was a predictor for boys' smoking. At the school level, smoking prevalence was a predictor of current smoking (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.05-1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking patterns were similar to Western countries in several aspects, while male prevalence rates were higher and the impact of gender-related predictors was significant. Our findings suggest that youth smoking prevention policies should address personal, familial and educational environmental level requirements, taking into consideration the gender differences in addition to international guidelines."
16202178,0,a,"Data from the 1998-99 National Family Health Survey (NFHS2) of India are used to examine the net effects of social and demographic characteristics of women on the likelihood of abortion while emphasizing important differences between women from northern and southern states. A north-south comparison illustrates that southern women have relatively higher levels of literacy and labour force participation, lower levels of son preference, and smaller family size. Results from logistic regression analyses show that literacy, type of work, belonging to a scheduled caste or tribe, urban residence, standard of living, parity, religion, age, age at union and contraceptive behaviour all have significant effects on the likelihood of abortion. However, most of these effects significantly differ for southern and northern women. Moreover, the effects of agricultural work, son preference and age at union on the likelihood of abortion are significant for northern but not southern women."
8982541,1,a,"With the recent advances in burns treatment, many more survive the burn to experience pain, scarring, physical deformity, loss of function and psychological trauma. Pressure therapy prescribed by occupational therapists for more than 20 years in Hong Kong has proved its effectiveness in treating the visible scars. However, the inconvenience and impaired appearance that is brought about by these garments during the long phase of therapy bears some weight in worsening patients' social acceptance and happiness in life, also their families especially in children. The objects of the studies were to measure the subjective rating of the effectiveness of pressure therapy through patients' satisfaction towards treatment effectiveness and its effect on daily life. Seventy cases with burn injuries over 1 year previously were selected randomly among the centres for the survey. The scale used was ordinal from 1 to 6. Eleven items concerning treatment effectiveness, life at home, work and leisure aspects were questioned. Results were analysed into two streams-satisfaction towards pressure therapy and change of life satisfaction pre- and post-injury. Non-parametric tests were used for data analysis. Through the Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test and Cluster analysis, major determinants were identified. These factors also showed significant correlation with this demographic data. The conclusions helped to evaluate and improve the existing service in both the garment properties and our scope of therapy for these patients, especially in work rehabilitation and finally (sexual) counselling which should be addressed by a team with interdepartmental support."

14608444,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess determinants of a high Caesarean delivery rate in a remote population in China. METHODS: A prospective cohort study including 20,891 women who gave birth between January 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998, in one of the 18 hospitals participating in a hospital-based regional perinatal surveillance system in Qingyuan, a remote rural region in Guangdong province, China. RESULTS: Of the 20,891 pregnant women registered by the Qingyuan Perinatal Surveillance System, 7.5% were delivered by elective Caesarean section, and 18.4% were delivered by non-elective Caesarean section. The most common indications for elective Caesarean delivery were socio-cultural, non-medical reasons, such as the woman's fear of pain, her wish to give birth on a date or at a time believed to be particularly auspicious, or her belief that delivery by Caesarean section would protect the baby's brain. Factors strongly related to elective Caesarean delivery included insurance status, maternal age, plurality, preeclampsia and eclampsia, gestational age, and birth weight. The most common indication for non-elective Caesarean delivery was cephalopelvic disproportion. Factors strongly related to non-elective Caesarean delivery included maternal age, preeclampsia and eclampsia, placenta previa, gestational age, and birth weight. CONCLUSION: Non-medical causes, including a woman's insurance status and her personal and social demands, accounted for a large proportion of elective Caesarean deliveries in this remote population in China."
18269370,0,a,"Aim To examine the association of socio-economic position (education, income and employment status) with cigarette consumption, intention to quit and self-efficacy to quit among male smokers in Thailand and Malaysia. Design and setting The data were based on a survey of adult smokers conducted in early 2005 in Thailand and Malaysia as part of the International Tobacco Control-South-East Asia (ITC-SEA) project. Participants A total of 1846 men in Thailand and 1906 men in Malaysia. Measurement Participants were asked questions on daily cigarette consumption, intention to quit and self-efficacy to quit in face-to-face interviews. Findings Analyses were based on multivariate regression models that adjusted for all three socio-economic indicators. In Thailand, higher level of education was associated strongly with not having self-efficacy, associated weakly with having an intention to quit and was not associated with cigarette consumption. Higher income was associated strongly with having self-efficacy, associated weakly with high cigarette consumption and was not associated with having an intention to quit. Being employed was associated strongly with having an intention to quit and was not associated with cigarette consumption or self-efficacy. In Malaysia, higher level of education was not associated with any of the outcomes. Higher income was associated strongly with having self-efficacy, and was not associated with the other outcomes. Being employed was associated moderately with higher cigarette consumption and was not associated with the other outcomes. Conclusion Socio-economic and cultural conditions, as well as tobacco control policies and tobacco industry activities, shape the determinants of smoking behaviour and beliefs. Existing knowledge from high-income countries about disparities in smoking should not be generalized readily to other countries."
12200101,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This study examined factors that discriminate between parents who regularly inspect their children for ticks and those who do not do so. METHODS: Knowledge, cognitive and emotional attitudes, social influences, and self-efficacy expectations were assessed in 230 parents living in high endemic regions. RESULTS: Regression analysis showed that moral norms, emotional attitude, anticipated regret, role models, and stress self-efficacy were positively associated with inspection behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Health education programs not only need to stimulate parental knowledge and discuss the health effects of tick bite prevention, they also need to stress the emotional benefits of tick bite prevention for children and parents and induce positive norms toward inspecting others. Furthermore, they need to stimulate openness about inspection behaviors, since the modeling examples of partners, relatives, and grandparents and the behavior of friends discriminate between inspecting and noninspecting parents. Finally, education programs should clearly indicate how tick inspection works, how the need for it should be communicated to the children, and how to take enough time to do it."
9819707,1,a,"The present study was undertaken to characterize the variables that influence parental perception of metabolic disorders and their genetic origin before and after genetic counselling, the effect of counselling on parental attitudes towards prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination, and the factors affecting parental coping with burden. Parents of children with metabolic diseases from 32 Arab-Muslim families were interviewed, answering a pre-structured questionnaire. These interviews indicate the following. (1) Traditional belief and religious commitment are more important determinants than education in parental perception of inherited metabolic diseases. (2) The number of affected children has a greater impact on parental evaluation of the burden than the number of healthy children. The social component, i.e. the way families are viewed by society, is the most significant factor of the burden. (3) Parents use different techniques to divide responsibility regarding reproduction. Having a healthy child and the availability of prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination were the two most important factors in parental reproductive decision making. In the absence of a healthy child and when the burden was perceived as too heavy, parents tended 'not to decide'. (4) Parental attitude to pregnancy termination was dependent on two factors: religious commitment (leading to objection) and severity of disease (leading to flexibility and approval). (5) In almost all families, genetic counselling altered parental perception of the disease and its hereditary origin. We conclude that genetic counselling and population education may be helpful in the prevention of consanguineous marriages and in family planning, even in a society that values traditional beliefs very highly."
17462680,0,a,"This paper examines the complex interconnections between the development of health promotion and multidisciplinary public health, respectively. Health promotion takes a distinctive interdisciplinary and multiprofessional perspective on health. Historically, it has brought together practitioners from varied disciplinary backgrounds, education and training. It therefore brings real advantages to the public health enterprise, where the goal is to bridge organisations, professions and partners to collectively address key determinants of health in the most effective manner. This paper debates the contribution health promotion has made to the development of multidisciplinary public health over the past 30 years and explores the principles, values, professional bases and practices of both. It is argued that health promotion's contribution to the development of 'the new public health' was critical, while its status and role within multidisciplinary public health remain problematic and unresolved. The nature of these dilemmas is discussed, reflecting on missed opportunities and possible resolutions."
12664962,0,a,"Final body height is achieved as the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The aim of this article is to review past studies on body height that have followed different scientific traditions. In modern Western societies, about 20% of variation in body height is due to environmental variation. In poorer environments, this proportion is probably larger, with lower heritability of body height as well as larger socioeconomic body height differences. The role of childhood environment is seen in the increase in body height during the 20th century simultaneously with the increase in the standard of living. The most important non-genetic factors affecting growth and adult body height are nutrition and diseases. Short stature is associated with poorer education and lower social position in adulthood. This is mainly due to family background, but other environmental factors in childhood also contribute to this association. Body height is a good indicator of childhood living conditions, not only in developing countries but also in modern Western societies. Future studies combining different scientific traditions in auxology are needed to create a more holistic view of body height."
19482785,0,a,"Two fundamental determinants of men's health are confronted-racism and sexism-that the authors believe underlie many of the health disparities documented between women and men and place men of color at particular disadvantage in U.S. society. In doing so, the authors contend that race and gender, as well as racism and sexism, are social constructs and, therefore, amenable to change. They hope to allay concerns that gains in the health of men will come at the expense of continued advances in the health of women. Instead, by better understanding how the harsh intersections of racism and sexism have contorted roles for men of color and damaged their social ties, a healing process in intimate relationships, extended families, and entire communities may be fostered. Only by reforming historical injustices and reuniting men with their partners, families, and communities will sustained improvements in their health and well-being be realized."
18201163,0,a,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: The high rates of mental health issues confronting Indigenous populations make it imperative that action to promote mental health and prevent the development of mental health problems is effective. An accumulating evidence base for mental health promotion now exists; however, it remains significantly underdeveloped for Indigenous groups. METHODS: This paper outlines the key findings of a systematic review of the literature undertaken to identify attributes of effective Indigenous mental health promotion interventions. RESULTS: Conclusive evidence of the efficacy of Indigenous mental health promotion interventions could not be determined because the evidence base is limited. However, this review did highlight several important findings. First, there were few well-conducted intervention evaluations; in many, the design was weak and insufficient information was supplied to assess effectiveness. Second, Indigenous mental health promotion initiatives commonly focused on individual behaviour change, rather than the broader social, ecological or policy determinants. Third, many interventions involved extensive Indigenous participation, thus supporting cultural relevance and community involvement, essential for the future of Indigenous mental health promotion. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence about effective mental health promotion and prevention interventions for Indigenous populations."
7985550,1,a,"The paper summarizes the evolution of a biomedical field research station in Tanzania, established by a European institute, into a national health research and resource centre. The Swiss Tropical Institute Field Laboratory was founded in Ifakara in the Kilombero District in southeastern Tanzania in 1957. It has evolved into the Ifakara Centre, a national but peripherally located research centre involved in applied, operational and health systems research, training, and direct health sector support activities. Since 1991, the centre has been an affiliate of the National Institute for Medical Research in Tanzania. It has achieved an autonomous status and attracts frontline priority research and high quality research teams; the ongoing phase 3 malaria vaccine trial is a recent major activity. Starting from biomedical priorities in research and training, the centre has broadened its spectrum to include social science disciplines including economics. The major determinants for this development were (i) the long-term partnership between the executing agency in the north and the partners in the south at the national level, (ii) the support of this partnership by a long-term commitment of the major funding partners, (iii) the concept that local priorities form the basis of all activities, and (iv) the linking of research and training to public health action. The last two elements are considered to be crucial for the centre's multidisciplinary approach to health research and the support of public health in Tanzania and in eastern and southern Africa."
17549509,0,a,"BACKGROUND: We recently developed the Amblyopia & Strabismus Questionnaire (A&SQ) to assess the quality of life in amblyopia and/or strabismus patients, and evaluated its content and criterion validity. The A&SQ was now validated clinically by correlating its outcome with past and current orthoptic parameters in a historic cohort of amblyopia and/or strabismus patients. METHODS: The cohort was derived from all 471 patients who were treated by occlusion therapy in the Waterland Hospital in Purmerend between 1968 and 1974 and born between 1962 and 1972. All children with insufficient visual acuity from the Waterland area had been referred to a single ophthalmologist and orthoptist. Of these, 203 were traced, and 174 filled out the A&SQ. In 137 of these, binocular vision, visual acuity, and angle of strabismus were reassessed 30-35 years after occlusion therapy. These clinical parameters were correlated with the five A&SQ domains: ""distance estimation"", ""visual disorientation"", ""fear of losing the better eye"", ""diplopia"", and ""social contact and cosmetic problems"". RESULTS: The current acuity at distance of the amblyopic eye and reading acuity of the amblyopic eye correlated significantly with all five A&SQ domains (significance level P = 0.01-P = 0.05). Weaker correlations were found for binocularity. In spite of the expectation that stereopsis should strongly correlate with the domain ""distance estimation"", and angle of strabismus with the domain ""social contact and cosmetic problems"", the acuity of the amblyopic eye was the overall dominant parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The adult acuity of the amblyopic eye seems the most important clinical determinant for quality of life in amblyopia and/or strabismus patients, even in domains of distance estimation, visual disorientation, and social contact and cosmetic problems, although intermediate determinants cannot be excluded."
9257620,1,a,"The prevalence of type II diabetes and the metabolic characteristics in high-risk African Americans were examined to determine whether certain socioeconomic and demographic characteristics (SED) increase the risk for type II diabetes in this population. Study participants were high-risk African Americans between the ages of 25 and 64 years. Glucose tolerance status was assessed and questionnaires were completed to obtain information regarding SED, hypertension, and physical activity. The majority of patients had normal glucose tolerance; undiagnosed type II diabetes was identified in 36 of 164 patients. Questionnaire data revealed that, in highly selected African Americans at risk for type II diabetes, there was a higher rate of obesity, prior gestational diabetes, and undiagnosed type II diabetes despite higher educational and income levels and greater access to health care and recreational facilities. Findings indicate that African Americans may be at higher risk for type II diabetes, regardless of socioeconomic status, due to genetic inheritance and other unknown environmental determinants. Further studies are needed to characterize SED and metabolic profiles that confer a high risk for type II diabetes in this population."
16783115,0,a,"The purpose of this study was to examine the demographic, medical, and social cognitive determinants of exercise intentions in a population-based sample of multiple myeloma cancer survivors. Using a cross-sectional survey, 70 multiple myeloma cancer survivors completed a questionnaire that assessed their medical and demographic characteristics, past exercise behavior, and social cognitive exercise beliefs using the theory of planned behavior. Seventy participants provided valuable data. Descriptive statistics indicated that participants had quite positive instrumental attitude, intentions, and subjective norms and moderate levels of perceived behavioral control and affective attitudes for exercise. Forced entry multiple regression showed that the theory of planned behavior explained 43% of the variance in exercise intentions. Instrumental attitude and perceived behavioral control were both independent predictors of exercise intentions. No demographic or medical variable moderated the association between the theory of planned behavior constructs and exercise intentions. The results of the present investigation support the growing body of evidence confirming the utility of the theory of planned behavior to understand the salient determinants of exercise in cancer survivors. Knowledge gained from this study provides important information to oncology practitioners who are responsible for delivering supportive care interventions, including exercise, to patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma."
12224661,1,a,"Physical activity is a key component of energy balance and is promoted in children and adolescents as a lifelong positive health behavior. Understanding the potential behavioral determinants necessitates understanding influences from three fundamental areas: 1) physiologic and developmental factors, 2) environmental factors, and 3) psychological, social, and demographic factors. The literature to date has generally investigated potential predictors of physical activity in children and adolescents in each of these three general areas, although existing data rely largely on cross-sectional studies in which it is difficult to distinguish a determinant from a correlate. In all likelihood, aspects of each of these three areas interact in a multidimensional way to influence physical activity in youth. This article reviews evidence of potential determinants of physical activity in children and adolescents and provides recommendations for future work."
9244971,1,a,"Communication between asylum seekers/refugees and general practitioners/physicians of the three main outpatient sectors for the Swiss national Health System (general practice, medical outpatient and accident & emergency departments) are being described and analysed. The data have been collected during three cross-sectional studies investigating the health status of asylum seekers and refugees and the health services provided to them. These studies addressed the problem exclusively from the point of view of the health care providers. Data on language capabilities, sociocultural aspects of communication and the necessity and availability of interpreters have been collected with questionnaires. The main results of the questionnaires have been followed up in group discussions with general practitioners. The majority of general practitioners/physicians felt that most of the communication problems were related to speaking a common language. Only about one out of two adult asylum seekers/refugees knew German, French, Italian or English. Particularly during the group discussions it was brought forward that cultural and social factors additionally complicate communication during patient-doctor interactions. When the data of the outpatient consultations of the main studies were analysed, it became obvious that interpreters were significantly more often present in consultations with patients with psychological/psychosocial diagnoses than those with somatic diagnoses (72% vs. 55%). This can be interpreted in two ways: (1) if a patient suffers from a psychological/psychosocial problem, it is more likely that an interpreter will be asked to assist during the consultation or (2) if an interpreter is present during a consultation, it is more likely that a psychological/psychosocial problem will be detected. With the exception of children, most of the general practitioners/physicians felt that non-professional interpreters (relatives, friends) were adequate for coping with most of the tasks. The following areas for improvements were identified: (1) availability of professional interpreters and quality as well as organisational issues related to interpretation, (2) language training for asylum seekers and refugees and (3) creation of awareness among general practitioners/physicians towards cultural and socioeconomic determinants of patient-doctor interactions and training."
10951443,0,a,"We have examined fatigue in myasthenia gravis (MG) by administering a measure of cognitive and physical fatigue to patients and control subjects before and after administration of a lengthy cognitive battery. Subjects also completed a scale that assessed the impact of fatigue on physical, social, and cognitive function. Results of the study revealed that MG patients experience significantly more cognitive and physical fatigue than do control subjects, and the patients' perceptions of both cognitive and physical fatigue increased significantly following completion of demanding cognitive work. Control subjects reported no significant change in fatigue. Furthermore, MG patients reported that fatigue produced mild to moderate effects on cognitive and social function and moderate effects on physical function. Results from this study indicate that cognitive fatigue is an important symptom of MG and that fatigue produces pervasive impairments in important aspects of patients' lives. Additional studies are needed to understand the neurobehavioral determinants of cognitive fatigue in this population."
2036210,1,a,"This study examined the predictive validity of preadolescent Type A determinants for Type A dimensions in young adulthood (n = 375). Predictive variables, i.e. hyperactivity, aggression, social maladjustment and self-esteem were measured when the subjects were aged 12. Type A dimensions, i.e. hard-driving, competitiveness plus aggression and impatience were measured in the same subjects when they were aged 18. ""Impatience"" was predicted by means of preadolescent hyperactivity, and ""competitiveness-aggression"" by social maladjustment. ""Hard-driving"", which was most strongly related to CHD risk factor levels in young adulthood, was anteceded by the subject's feeling that he or she could not cope with life. This supports the hypothesis that Type A behaviour is a coping mechanism: a person tries to cope with stress by increasing his or her level of achievement."
15087153,0,a,"This paper is a follow-up of earlier findings by the Kagera AIDS Research Project (KARP), which documented declining trends in the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection in the Kagera region of Tanzania. The paper examines socio-cultural and sexual behavioral changes as possible determinants of the observed declining trends in Bukoba, the largest urban area of the region. The study used in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, field observations and ethnographic assessments to collect the required data. The findings suggest that since the initial years of the epidemic there have been significant changes in sexual behaviors, norms, values, and customs that are considered high-risk for HIV transmission. The findings show an increase in condom use, abstinence, zero grazing (sticking to one sexual partner) and uptake of voluntary HIV testing while traditional practices such as polygamy, widow inheritance, excessive alcohol consumption, and sexual networking are declining. We suggest that these changes are partly a result of the severity of the epidemic itself in the study area, and interventions that have been carried out in this area since 1987. The major interventions have included health education, the distribution of condoms, AIDS education in schools, voluntary HIV counseling and testing. These are encouraging findings that give hope and we believe that other places within Tanzania and other countries experiencing a severe AIDS crisis have much to learn from this experience. However, changes in norms and behavior are vulnerable; people in Kagera are still at risk and there is a need for continued intervention together with monitoring of the direction of the epidemic."
12811671,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess age- and nationality-specific trends in abortion rates over the last decade, and to describe women's characteristics, identifying risk factors for repeated abortion. METHODS: From 1990-1999, the Health Department of Canton Vaud (Switzerland) received 13'857 abortion requests from residents aged 14-49. Population data were obtained to compute rates. RESULTS: Both the number of abortions (1400 annually) as well as their rate (8.9 per thousand women [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.3-10.5]) were stable over the decade in question. The rate of abortion for foreign women, especially from ex-Yugoslavia and Africa, was twice that for Swiss women. Half of the requests came from single women, 43% had a low education level, and half were childless. The main reason for requesting termination of pregnancy was psychosocial (93%). The mean gestational age was 7.7 weeks (SD +/- 2.3), but 96% of requests were submitted before 12 weeks. Sixty-three percent of women reported that they had used no contraception, 36% the condom and 17% the pill. Among requests, the adjusted risk of repeated abortion (22% of abortion candidates) was greater among divorced/separated/widowed women (odds ratio [OR] 1.9 [95% CI 1.5-2.4]), unemployed women (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.5-2.1]), and those who had not attended university (OR 1.6 [95% CI 1.1-2.2]). CONCLUSIONS: Although Swiss law only permitted abortion under strict conditions, this procedure was widely available in Vaud, which nevertheless has one of the lowest rates worldwide. Efforts must be intensified to ensure universal access to family planning services, especially for foreign women and adolescents. Professionals should also target ""repeaters"" to provide personalised counselling."
7945681,1,a,"The authors raise questions regarding the wide-spread calls emanating from lay and medical audiences alike to intensify the formal teaching of ethics within the medical school curriculum. In particular, they challenge a prevailing belief within the culture of medicine that while it may be possible to teach information about ethics (e.g., skills in recognizing the presence of common ethical problems, skills in ethical reasoning, or improved understanding of the language and concepts of ethics), course material or even an entire curriculum can in no way decisively influence a student's personality or ensure ethical conduct. To this end, several issues are explored, including whether medical ethics is best framed as a body of knowledge and skills or as part of one's professional identity. The authors argue that most of the critical determinants of physician identity operate not within the formal curriculum but in a more subtle, less officially recognized ""hidden curriculum."" The overall process of medical education is presented as a form of moral training of which formal instruction in ethics constitutes only one small piece. Finally, the authors maintain that any attempt to develop a comprehensive ethics curriculum must acknowledge the broader cultural milieu within which that curriculum must function. In conclusion, they offer recommendations on how an ethics curriculum might be more fruitfully structured to become a seamless part of the training process."
2246428,1,a,"While a variety of cognitive deficits and biases have been found to characterize aggressive and delinquent children and youth, very little attention has focused on determining whether aggressive youth also display deviant attributional beliefs in response to social failure. Research in the more impersonal cognitive domains such as achievement has shown attributions for failure to be potent determinants of both affective reactions and subsequent responding. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate whether specific attributional patterns following social failure may also relate to aggressive behavior. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between the level of self-reported physical aggression and specific attributional patterns following hypothetical social failure in a sample of incarcerated delinquent males. While the general hypotheses were that increased aggressiveness would be related to a greater tendency to endorse attributions for social failure that are external, stable, and controllable, only the hypothesis with regard to controllability was supported. The findings are discussed in terms of the relation between cognition and aggression in delinquent youth."
9104086,1,a,"The mission of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Fifty years ago, CDC's efforts were focused on epidemiologic and laboratory studies of malaria, typhus, and plague. Today, CDC's activities cover a broad range of diseases and conditions, and a broader range of disciplines are required to address these diverse public health problems. The behavioral and social sciences have a critical role to play in helping the public understand risk group characteristics and the frequency, context, and determinants of risky behaviors and in developing, implementing, and assessing prevention programs. CDC is taking steps to foster an environment in which behavioral and social sciences can flourish and to integrate these sciences into all of CDC's prevention activities.

8602490,1,a,"The first nation-wide Quit and Win Contest in Sweden was held in 1988 with 12,840 participants. This corresponds to a participant rate of 6.4 per 1,000 daily tobacco users in Sweden. In order to follow up the long-term effects of cessation and to analyse the determinants for successful cessation, a panel (n = 946) of randomized participants were followed-up at 6 and 12 months with a mailed questionnaire. This gave a complete set of data for 557 (panel) respondents. Available baseline data from the participants' entry forms included sex, age, occupation, specific tobacco habits, quitting attempts during the previous year, and place of residence. At the 12-month follow-up 21% had been tobacco-free for the whole year. In addition 9% of the participants relapsed into tobacco-use, then quit again and were tobacco-free at the 12-month follow-up. The success rate for those participants (14%) who used smokeless tobacco (oral snuff) was similar to that of smokers. The logistic regression showed a significantly better prognosis for success among those without any earlier quitting attempts during the previous year (OR 2.35), if the subjects participated of their own volition rather than having been recruited by a non-tobacco user (OR 1.74), and if they were married/co-habiting (OR 1.92), the results were also significantly improved. The results also show that as a population-based method, Quit and Win produced many successful tobacco quitters, and one year after the contest one-fifth of the participants were still abstinent."
8698013,1,a,"In a study involving 1077 women who were admitted and treated for incomplete abortion and its related problems at eight hospitals (seven district and one mission hospitals) in six of the eight provinces of Kenya, between October 1988 and March 1989, 169 (15.7%) had illegally induced unsafe abortion, based on their own history and clinical findings. The illegally induced unsafe abortions were common among both rural and urban dwellers, and women from almost all social and economic strata were involved. However, they were more common among the youth (< 25 year olds), school girls, those with high formal education, in formal employment, and not currently married. Majority (90.4%), of the induced group said their pregnancies were unwanted, as compared to only 29.1% of the non-induced (p < 0.05). The main determining factor for termination of pregnancy amongst these women appeared to be the fact that it was unwanted and/or unplanned, either because of inappropriate timing, the type of man responsible, the relationship itself and the social and economic implications thereof. This is contributed to by poor contraceptive use inspite of very good awareness, and/or desire to use. There is urgent need to integrate abortion care and related services into the overall reproductive health care and as a part of the broader safe motherhood initiative in Kenya. In addition it is necessary to revise the legal provisions on abortion so as to make them more relevant. Appropriate management of adolescent fertility, should be undertaken with the aim of reducing the extent of illegally induced unsafe abortion with attendant sequealae."
18243207,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although mission statements are one of the most popular management instruments, little is known about the nature and direction of the presumed relationship between mission statements and organizational performance. In particular, empirical insights into the degree of mission statement use by individual organizational members are insufficient. OBJECTIVES: We address the observed knowledge gap by (a) measuring the level of mission statement use (e.g., explaining the mission statement, making linkages to extant programs or practices, communicating enthusiasm, and adapting the mission statement to the personal work situation) by individual organizational members, and (b) identifying the antecedents that influence mission statement use. DESIGN: Questionnaires were used to collect data from a sample of 510 nurses from three Flemish hospitals. Mission statement use was measured by means of Fairhurst's Management of Meaning Scale. Antecedents of mission statement use were derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior and the mission statement literature. RESULTS: The findings indicate that mission statement use is low on average. Attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and formal involvement in mission statement communication proved to be significant determinants of mission statement use and accounted for 43% of the variance. The results of the conducted regression analyses indicate that nurses (a) who have a positive attitude towards the mission statement, (b) who perceive pressure from superiors and colleagues to use the mission statement, (c) who feel they are in control of performing such behavior, and (d) who are formally involved in the mission statement communication processes are more likely to use the mission statement. Furthermore, the results indicated that demographic characteristics are not associated with mission statement use. CONCLUSIONS: To effectively increase mission statement use, investments should focus on redesigning a work environment that stresses the importance of the organizational mission statement and provides detailed information on the ways that individual organizational members can contribute in realizing the mission statement."
11410405,0,a,"The major skeletal determinants of fracture risk are bone mass and postmenopausal bone loss with gradual destruction of trabecular bone architecture. Therefore, the management of osteoporosis is to prevent bone loss after menopause in women below 60 years of age. We need a screening test of bone mineral density (BMD) with the ability to identify correctly individuals with accelerated bone loss; unnecessary treatment has to be avoided. But without measurable extraskeletal factors, no technique assessing BMD as single test has the reasonable high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of fast bone losers. It is on principle the repeated volumetric bone measurement--within 12 months--in the pure trabecular bone, especially at distal radius of the non-dominant arm with the peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), being able to detect accurately the individuals as fast bone losers with trabecular bone loss > 8 mg/cm3 or > 3.5% per year (prevalence about 35%). Only women with very high trabecular BMD (in highest quintile) have no risk for osteoporosis."
10180676,1,a,"Drawing on experiences from China and Russia (the world's two largest transitional economies), this paper empirically examines the impact of economic reforms on health status. While China's overall health status continued to improve after the economic reform, Russia experienced a serious deterioration in its population health. The observed differences in health performance between China and Russia can be explained by the different impacts of economic reforms on three major socioeconomic determinants of health. Depending on whether or not the reform improves physical environment (as reflected in income level and nutritional status), social environment (including social stability and security system), and health care, we would observe either a positive or a negative net effect on health. Despite remarkable differences in overall health development, China and Russia share some common problems. Mental and social health problems such as suicides and alcohol poisoning have been on the rise in both countries. These problems were much more serious in Russia, where political and social instability was more pronounced, associated with Russia's relatively radical reform process. With their economies moving toward a free market system, health sectors in China and Russia are undergoing marketization, which has had serious detrimental effect on the public health services."

8909112,1,a,"A comprehensive model of family influences on educational resemblance of siblings expands the traditional sibling pair model to a full sibship model in order to investigate how gender, gender composition of sibships, and a measure of ordinal position moderate the effect of social origins on educational attainments of siblings. One common family factor is sufficient to explain the variation of educational attainment among brothers and sisters. Although effects of social origins variables on brothers are larger than on sisters, the relative effects of measured social origins are virtually the same among sisters and brothers. The disparity between educational attainments of brothers and sisters persists across sex composition and family size. Ordinal position does not alter the effects of social origins on educational attainment nor does it directly affect educational attainment. Father's and mother's education are equally important for all siblings regardless of birth order, gender composition, and family size."
7664962,1,a,"This paper attempts to explain the differences in birthweight observed between blacks, white Anglos, Chicanos, and other racial and ethnic groups. The analysis focuses on the role of income and financial assistance from relatives and public programs. Using data from the NLS Youth Panel, I construct a casual model of birthweight containing exogenous social and demographic risk factors and intervening proximate determinants of birthweight. A substantial part of the gap in birthweight between white Anglos and other ethnic groups (especially blacks) can be explained by the unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the latter. On the other hand, blacks and other minorities smoke less and have other favorable proximate characteristics that depress differences in birthweight. When these proximate determinants are controlled, large ethic differences in birthweight remain unexplained by income and other sociodemographic factors."
9522857,1,a,"In a survey of 300 consecutive new attenders at the Porgera Health Centre Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic information was obtained regarding knowledge about AIDS from male and female attenders. The differences between the sexes regarding a variety of socioeconomic variables, knowledge about AIDS and their compliance to follow-up appointments were studied as well as possible relationships between these social variables and the degrees of AIDS knowledge and compliance. Males tended to originate from further afield, be more educated, be either in salaried employment or not working at all, and be single as compared to females. They also admitted to more extramarital sexual contacts and received more adequate treatment. Knowledge about AIDS was also significantly higher amongst male attenders and in this group was correlated strongly with overall educational attainment and employment status but did not show any relationship with the number of extramarital contacts admitted to. Only 9% of the patients knew about condoms and their role in prevention. Follow-up compliance was generally poor, and not significantly higher in those with higher scores of knowledge about AIDS, but showed a relationship with the type of disease being treated and with the ultimate adequacy of treatment received."
18562877,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine determinants of quality of care provided by pediatric emergency departments (PEDs) in tertiary European centers. METHODS: Analysis of questionnaires was sent to directors of PEDs. Questionnaires were sent through the pediatric research group of the European Society for Emergency Medicine. Three major descriptive categories were included in a 28-point questionnaire: institution's pediatric inpatient capabilities, scope of services, and medical staff education and structure. RESULTS: Sixty-five questionnaires were completed in full. Fifty-three tertiary medical centers from 14 countries were included in the study. In 86.8% of these institutions, the PED is separated from the adult emergency department; 91% have a pediatric intensive care unit, and 72% have an in-patient pediatric trauma service. Eighty-eight percent of the PEDs have incorporated triage protocols. Social service was not available in 17% of the departments. Sedation for painful procedures is provided by the staff in 77% of the PEDs. Only 24% of the PED medical directors have been formally trained in pediatric emergency medicine. In 17% of the departments, there is a 24-hour 7-day residents' coverage with no attending pediatrician or pediatric emergency medicine-trained physician. CONCLUSIONS: According to this pilot study, the basic services provided by tertiary PEDs in Europe appear to be appropriate. Physicians training level and staffing may not be adequate to achieve optimal patient outcome."
8858547,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: This report evaluates the relative contribution of predictors of change in the frequency of alcohol consumption among drinkers, based on the quantitative synthesis of data from 27 longitudinal studies of the general population. The analysis has two objectives: (1) to evaluate the impact of selected demographic characteristics on the magnitude and trajectory of change in drinking across multiple samples, and (2) to assess the influence of methodological characteristics on the consistency of results across studies. METHOD: Raw data from studies including two serial measures of the frequency of alcohol consumption are analyzed. Fixed, random and mixed effects models for meta-analysis are used to pool measures across observations and model the influence of predictors on variability between results. RESULTS: Gender-based variation in the patterning of change is present across all observations, but concentrated in early periods of the life course. Age displays significant predictive effects across all observations, but statistically uniform results are obtained for subjects aged 30 and over. The national origin of study predicts larger amounts of variation than do other demographic predictors in the models. Significant effects are observed for several methodological characteristics of studies. Variation among effect estimates is associated with differences between samples in the interval between first and final measurements, the date of first measurement (a proxy for the historical context of the sample), the percentage retention of subjects between measurements and the time frame of the original alcohol measure. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the synthesis of data from multiple longitudinal samples, this study (1) characterizes normative developmental patterning in the frequency of alcohol consumption and demonstrates the varying effects of demographic factors across the life-course: (2) indicates the key influence of cultural and historical context on the establishment of drinking patterns; and (3) confirms the impact of methodological differences on variation in the results of studies."
9926155,1,a,"Birth order, maternal age, gestational age, birth weight, maternal smoking, and social class have all been associated with allergic rhinitis, eczema and asthma in childhood, but the consistency of independent effects of these exposures in relation to all of these allergic conditions has not been investigated. We have compared and contrasted the independent effects of these putative risk factors on parent-reported hayfever, eczema and wheeze by age 16 years and in the past 12 months at age 16 using data from the 1970 British birth cohort. The 1970 British birth cohort comprised all children born in England, Scotland and Wales in one week of April 1970, and follow-up surveys at birth, 5, 10 and 16 years of age involved a cumulative total of 17,427 children. We have used data on over 6000 children with complete data at every stage. Social advantage was a risk factor common to each of wheeze at, and hayfever and eczema at and by age 16. Low birth order was an independent risk factor for eczema and hayfever at age 16, but not for wheeze. However, wheeze at age 16 was significantly increased in relation to maternal smoking, with a significant interaction such that the effect of smoking was greatest in those of high birth order and, in the absence of maternal smoking, low birth order was a risk factor for wheeze at age 16. Social advantage and low birth order appear to be the independently consistent determinants of atopic disease. Maternal smoking is an additional risk factor for wheeze, which applies primarily in low socioeconomic groups."
16510888,0,a,"Affective factors are likely to play a major role in determining the extent to which offenders are able to engage with, and benefit from, treatment. In this article, it is argued that the relationship between affect and treatment engagement may be understood in three ways: the access the client has to emotional states, the ability to express such states, and the willingness of the client to do this in the therapeutic session. It is suggested that affective determinants of treatment readiness can be understood with reference to models of emotional regulation and that attention to these affective factors in the early stages of treatment is likely to promote engagement, reduce attrition, and consequently improve treatment outcomes for violent offenders."

The ultimate goal of Mother and Child Health (MCH) teaching in schools of public health is to improve the health of women and children. This can be achieved by preparing professionals in the foundations of MCH either as practitioners, policy makers, or researchers. The content of MCH teaching should answer the local needs and include international and global aspects, considering the multifactorial determinants of health. Courses can be integrated into the MPH program or constitute a track within the MPH. Teaching methods should be interactive, including classroom activity and fieldwork. Faculty should be multidisciplinary."
11020935,0,a,"In Bangladesh, the total fertility rate declined from more than six children per woman of reproductive age in 1980 to 3.3 children per woman in 1996. Much discussion has ensued about the circumstances responsible for this decline and, in particular, about the contribution made by the national family planning program. For this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with 67 women concerning the factors influencing their reproductive behavior. The participants, residents of a rural area in southwestern Bangladesh, consisted of two groups: women who were currently practicing family planning and women who had never practiced or had not done so for at least four years. The findings suggest that the family planning program has played an important role in reducing family size, but also indicate that economic and social changes, and especially growing aspirations (particularly for a life outside agriculture) have combined with changes in the nature of family decision making to make couples more receptive to the idea of family planning."
18274042,0,a,"Disasters have been and will continue to be relatively common events in the human experience, and they make important contributions to variations in population health. There is a need, therefore, for conceptual models that identify the social and ecological factors influencing post-disaster consequences on population health. This article presents one such conceptual model which links the health consequences of natural, technological, and human-made disasters to a set of nested socioecological factors. Specifically, we attempt to link post-disaster consequences to aspects of the global and local environment and to highlight the roles played by social and ecological factors, including the social infrastructure, cultural beliefs, demography, and underlying historical and geographical circumstances. Examples from existing population-based health and disaster research are used to illustrate and amplify connections drawn from the model. From an applied standpoint, the model suggests that the role of multiple contextual determinants in shaping population health is likely to be complex. Practitioners interested in mitigating the consequences of disasters should pursue strategies that improve the underlying determinants of health, as well as practicable population-based interventions that could be implemented rapidly."
18808396,0,a,"This article reports a study on consumer attitudes to 21 food and nonfood technologies in Canada. The study involves repertory grid interviews with 36 food consumers, the data from which are analyzed using generalized Procrustes analysis. Results highlight the role of perceived risk and perceived benefit in determining the acceptability of the technologies, with individual technologies lying along a continuum between the two. For technology as a whole and the 21 specific technologies, the perceived risk and perceived benefit constructs were the dominant determinants of consumer acceptability. While perceptions of perceived risk and perceived benefit differed between individual respondents, there were very limited consistent relations with a range of sociodemographic variables."
11602474,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate withdrawal from the labour force because of inability to work owing to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to determine the characteristics of patients with no job because of work disability attributable to AS. METHODS: A postal questionnaire was sent to 709 patients with AS aged 16-60 years followed up by a rheumatologist. Kaplan-Meier survival statistics were used to assess the time lapse between diagnosis and withdrawal from work. Standardised incidence ratios were calculated to compare withdrawal from the labour force in patients with AS and the general population. Determinants of withdrawal were assessed by Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis using variables assumed to be time independent. Cross sectional characteristics of patients without a job owing to disability were further analysed by simple and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 658 patients returned the questionnaire. Of 529 patients with a paid job before diagnosis of AS, 5% had left the labour force within the first year after the diagnosis, 13% after 5 years, 21% after 10 years, 23% after 15 years, and 31% after 20 years. Age and sex adjusted risk for withdrawal was 3.1 (95% CI 2.5 to 3.7) times higher than in the general population. In patients with AS, determinants of withdrawal from work were older age at diagnosis, manual work, and coping strategies characterised by limiting or adapting activities. Patients with work disability at the time of the study were older, came from a lower social class, and were more likely to have total hip replacement, peripheral arthritis, or comorbidity. Moreover, they reported worse physical function (BAS-FI), experienced lower quality of life, and more often had extraspinal disease than those with a job. CONCLUSION: Withdrawal from work is 3.1 times higher in patients with AS than expected in the general population. Within patients, higher age at diagnosis, manual work, and unfavourable coping strategies are important determinants of withdrawal. Patients without a job experience a lower quality of life."
20108607,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The social gradient in body weight (for example, obesity) departs from the social gradient in other health outcomes. Innovative approaches are needed to understand the observed patterns. This study examines time-use patterns by indicators of socio-economic position, and considers the implications of variations in time use for the social gradient in weight reported in other studies. DATA AND METHODS: The data are from respondents aged 25 to 64 to Canada's 1986 and 2005 General Social Surveys, which focused on time use. Participation in various activities was examined by sex, and by personal income and education, stratified by sex, in both years. RESULTS: Higher-income men and women were more likely than those of lower income to spend time in paid work, commuting and eating out, and less likely to spend time sleeping. Men and women with higher education were more likely than those with lower education to spend time in physical activity (2005 only) and reading. These time-use patterns plausibly contribute to the social gradient in obesity reported in other Canadian studies. INTERPRETATION: The findings suggest that there is value in looking beyond a narrow range of health behaviours toward broader measures of daily routines to gain insight into the social determinants of weight and health."
1895021,1,a,"An infectious disease may reduce or even stop the exponential growth of a population. We consider two very simple models for microparasitic and macroparasitic diseases, respectively, and study how the effect depends on a contact parameter kappa. The results are presented as bifurcation diagrams involving several threshold values of kappa. The precise form of the bifurcation diagram depends critically on a second parameter xi, measuring the influence of the disease on the fertility of the hosts. A striking outcome of the analysis is that for certain ranges of parameter values bistable behaviour occurs: either the population grows exponentially or it oscillates periodically with large amplitude."
12293088,1,a,"""In this paper, the impact of the West German pension system on the retirement decisions of elderly citizens is analyzed within the framework of a discrete-time hazard rate model deduced from a micro-economic decision rule. The model is estimated using a panel dataset of elderly West German citizens. In order to improve the precision of the estimates obtained, the data from the sample are combined with aggregate-level information on the labour force participation behaviour of the elderly. Policy simulations based on the estimates reveal that the probability of early retirement can be reduced significantly by appropriate changes in the pension system."""
18397458,0,a,"CONTEXT: The influences of gender and geography are increasingly being acknowledged as central to a comprehensive understanding of health. Since little research on rural women's health has been conducted, an in-depth qualitative approach is necessary to gain a better initial understanding of this population. PURPOSE: To explore the determinants of health and their influence on rural women's health. METHODS: From November 2004 to September 2005, 9 focus groups and 3 individual interviews were conducted in 7 rural southwestern Ontario communities. Sixty-five rural residents aged 26 years and older participated in the study. Semi-structured interview questions were used to elicit participants' perceptions regarding determinants of rural women's health. FINDINGS: Four Health Canada determinants (employment, gender, health services, and social environments) and 3 new determinants (rural change, rural culture, and rural pride) emerged as key to rural women's health. CONCLUSIONS: Although health determinants affect both urban and rural people, this qualitative study revealed that rural women experience health determinants in unique ways and that rural residents may indeed have determinants of their health that are particular to them. More research is needed to explore the nature and effects of determinants of health for rural residents in general, and rural women in particular."
19628202,0,a,"This study provided controlled observations of a potential mechanism for the determination of the repetitive, aberrant perceptions or interpretations of everyday events that figure prominently in a range of psychological disorders: the adventitious reinforcement of acts of cognition by the actual consequences of concurrent motor acts. Adults made a series of two-choice brightness discriminations; on 60% of trials, choosing the brighter stimulus produced a ""correct"" signal while errors produced an aversive sound. On 40% of trials, the choice stimuli did not in fact differ in brightness; the consequences of responding on these ""identical stimuli"" trials differed across blocks of trials. Thus, on these trials perceptual judgments were directly followed by events that they did not produce. When all choices on identical stimuli trials were punished with the ""error"" sound, subjects showed little preference for the left-side or right-side identical stimuli, but when all choices of identical stimuli were reinforced with the ""correct"" light, individual preferences for the left-side or the right-side stimuli substantially increased. As the consequences of responding on identical stimuli trials were independent of the stimuli chosen, these findings provide evidence for superstitious perception, the reinforcement of perceptual acts by events that do not depend upon their occurrence."
11584147,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This investigation sought to determine how different parenting styles are related to general self-regulatory processes that are linked to alcohol use and abuse. Self-regulation and, more specifically, thoughts of control over drinking are forms of positive self-control mechanisms. Parenting styles are known determinants of both negative and positive self-control mechanisms in offspring. According to social learning theory, stronger relationships between parenting style and self-regulatory processes would be expected from the parent who is the same sex as the respondent. METHODS: A total of 144 female and 107 male college students currently using alcohol were administered a questionnaire on their alcohol use and problems, perceived style of parenting (authoritarian, permissive, or authoritative) of their parents, self-regulation, and perceived control of drinking. A model linking parenting styles, self-regulatory processes, and control over drinking with alcohol use and alcohol problems was tested across sex groups by using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: In general, the parenting style of the parent of the same sex as the respondent's was found to be significantly related to self-regulation, which is known to be protective against alcohol use and abuse. A permissive parent of the same sex as the respondent was negatively associated with good self-regulatory processes for both men and women. Having an authoritative mother was also shown to be related to higher levels of self-regulation for women. CONCLUSIONS: Self-regulation mediated the pathway from a permissive parenting style to perceived drinking control, which, in turn, mediated the pathway from self-regulation to alcohol use and problems. Finally, self-regulation mediated the positive pathway from an authoritative mother to perceived control over drinking for women."
19342853,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a recognized and important outcome after stroke. An increased survival and the presence of moderate impairment in long-term stroke survivors impact their HRQoL. METHODS: HRQoL measures and HRQoL determinants in stroke survivors are reviewed. RESULTS: Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in western countries. Specific HRQoL scales have been developed in the last years, such as the Stroke Impact Scale, the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale, the Stroke and Aphasia HRQoL Scale, and the Burden of Stroke Scale. Disability and poststroke depression are consistent determinants of HRQoL. Other determinants include female sex, coping strategies, and social support. Poststroke depression affects HRQoL, functional recovery, cognitive function and healthcare use in stroke survivors. Stroke caregivers have lower HRQoL, greater prevalence of stress and depression, economical burden, and changes in social relationships. Advancing age and anxiety in patients and caregivers, high dependency and poor family support identify caregivers at risk of adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Physical and psychosocial well-being is greatly affected in stroke survivors and their caregivers."
19488490,0,a,"This evaluative study focused on expansion of the Family Health Strategy in large cities in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The study analyzed the functionality of health care modalities, performance, and supply of comprehensive care itself and its link to services at other levels. The thrust of the analysis was comprehensiveness of care in the daily routine of health services, with a focus on childbearing-age women, and with pregnancy as the tracer condition. The results emerged from an analysis of focus groups with health care users and health professionals, based on: characterization of key actors; their perceptions concerning health, healthcare model, and organization of primary care services and practices. The groups suggested that the actors perceive health as identified with social determinants. Access to services and actions was differentiated in the family health unit by enrollment of the clientele and active search, and the study showed the lack of a structured network. The study indicates that work processes contemplating the social determination of health and its intersectorality can lead to expanded access to comprehensive care for childbearing-age women."
1444596,1,a,"The body burden of cadmium, as estimated from 24-h urine cadmium levels, was determined in 1,523 subjects who were not occupationally exposed and who lived in five areas of Belgium. Urinary cadmium levels differed significantly with place of residence. These differences persisted after standardization for the other significant determinants (i.e., age, body mass index, smoking habits, social class, alcohol consumption, and menopause). The highest 24-h urine cadmium levels were found in subjects who lived in areas that contained cadmium-polluted soils. The body burden overload has been attributed mainly to the consumption of locally grown vegetables and the use of contaminated well water for cooking and drinking. Blood cadmium levels were also dependent on place of residence. However, the geographical differences in blood cadmium did not parallel those of urine cadmium. Blood cadmium is more influenced by recent exposure; therefore, this latter observation might reflect the recent implementation of preventive measures in some areas."
12319653,1,a,"This paper analyzes the impact of internal migration on earnings within the human capital model framework. Since migrants constitute a non-random sample of population, the endogenous nature of migration decision warrants necessary correction for the selectivity bias in their earnings function. The Mincer-type earnings model is thus augmented to determine the extent of this bias. Besides estimating the standard Mincerian earnings model, the paper also attempts to verify the learn-as-you-go proposition by introducing migration duration variables in the earnings model. Based on the household level Population, Labor Force, and Migration (1979-80) survey data, the analysis yields the following important conclusions: (i) the data allowed a meaningful estimation of Mincerian earnings function for migrants and non-migrants; (ii) the level of schooling was one of the important determinants of the distribution of income both for migrants and nonmigrants--the four categorical variables of education were in general statistically significant with expected signs, implying that the hypothesis of a positive relationship between income and education was accepted; (iii) the rates of return to education improved systematically with higher levels of education, thus confirming the notion that education serves as a signalling device; (iv) the age-income profile was almost linear for migrants but showed concavity for nonmigrants; (v) the presence of sample-selection was observed for migrants; and (vi) even after controlling for the influence of personal characteristics, i.e., education and experience, the long-standing migrants earned relatively more at the destination than the more recent migrants."
16138493,0,a,"The collapse of the Soviet Union was a massive natural experiment that has provided many insights that help our understanding of the determinants of population health. This paper identifies a series of lessons learnt from this experience: (1) Rapid transition can damage health. (2) When undertaking comparative research, it is essential to have a common understanding of what different terms mean in different places. (3) When looking at exposures and outcomes, it is important to appreciate that the delay between exposure to a risk factor and the appearance of disease can range from almost none to several decades. (4) Contrary to the views of some commentators, modern healthcare has made a substantial contribution to the health of populations in industrialised countries. (5) Science can flourish only where it is free from ideology. (6) Public health and basic science achieve most when they work together. (7) Without functioning democracy, the outlook for better health is poor."
17273563,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the health-related quality of life of patients submitted to resection of the pulmonary parenchyma due to neoplasia. METHODS: The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey was used to evaluate patients in the preoperative period and on postoperative days 30, 90 and 180. We used the GEE statistical model, in which the dependent variable (quality of life) changes for each patient over the course of the evaluation. Independent variables were gender, age, educational level, type of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, forced vital capacity and 6-minute walk test. The level of significance adopted was 5%. RESULTS: The final study sample comprised 36 patients, 20 of whom were men. Of those 36 patients, 17 were submitted to lobectomy, 10 to pneumonectomy, 6 to segmentectomy, and 3 to bilobectomy. Chemotherapy was used in 15 patients, radiotherapy in 2, and a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in 2. Improved quality of life was seen in the following domains: social (on postoperative day 90); physical/functional (some patients presenting better forced vital capacity and 6-minute walk test performance); and physical (in patients undergoing smaller resections). Lowered quality of life was seen in the following domains: social (for female patients); physical/social (resulting from radiotherapy, chemotherapy or both); and physical/functional (by postoperative day 30). CONCLUSIONS: It is important that studies evaluating the various determinants of quality of life, as well as the impact that cancer treatment modalities have on such variables, be conducted. The knowledge provided by such studies can contribute to improving the quality of life of patients undergoing pulmonary resection due to neoplasia."
8853736,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the risk factors for intravenous drug use and sharing of equipment in Longchuan County in south-west China. METHODS: Demographic information and sexual and drug-use-related behavior between 1 January 1991 and 1 August 1994 were collected retrospectively from a cohort of young male drug users aged 18-29 years in 82 villages. RESULTS: A total of 433 drug users were identified. The cumulative incidence of intravenous drug use was 40.0% during the 3.7-year study period. The annual incidence increased from 10% in 1991 to over 30% in 1994. Risk factors for intravenous drug use among drug users, according to the multivariate model, included having had premarital/extramarital sex [odds ratio (OR), 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-2.3], having a family member who used drugs in 1991 (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.9), and currently not married (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.98-2.7). Being Buddhist protected against intravenous drug use (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9). The population attributable fraction was 30% for not being currently married, 17% for having had premarital/extramarital sex and 14% for having a family member who used drugs. The risk factor for sharing of equipment was being of Jingpo ethnicity (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 2.5-13.8). The average incidence of sharing equipment was 19.6% per year. The population attributable fraction for sharing equipment was 58.5% for being Jingpo. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of intravenous drug use and sharing equipment is increasing. Therefore, it is urgent that vigorous, effective intervention programs be initiated in southern Yunnan. Unmarried, sexually promiscuous Jingpo drug users with a family history of drug use should be especially targeted. Given the problems of transport and communication in this remote area of China, intervention programs which use existing social, governmental and community networks should be implemented."
10901120,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study was to demonstrate the relevance of testing indices concerning the psychosocial work environment by item bias or differential item functioning (DIF) analysis. Especially when the work environment for different groups is compared, this kind of construct validation is important. As exogenous variables gender, age, and occupational group were selected. METHODS: Data were taken from a cross-sectional study of Danish employees aged 19-59 years (N=5940). The study was carried out in 1990 and followed-up in 1995. RESULTS: Item bias was demonstrated in all indices when analyzed in relation to gender, age, and occupational groups of the total population. Item bias was much weaker or disappeared as the population was divided into main occupational groups and analyzed in relation to the same exogenous variables. CONCLUSIONS: For a heterogeneous group of employees, gender, age, and occupational status are significant determinants of the response pattern in relation to indices of the psychosocial work environment. It was concluded that, if the psychosocial work environment for different groups is to be compared, indices should always be tested for item bias in relation to the exogenous variables included in the final analyses. Indices should only be used if there is no item bias. If such indices cannot be constructed, it is suggested that researchers either concentrate on constructing indices that are valid in subgroups or report results based on single-item analyses."
16008634,0,a,"Diseases probably have their roots in a complex chain of environmental and behavioural events which are shaped by broader socioeconomic determinants. Most studies of sociobehavioural risk factors in dental caries have been carried out in industrialized countries, but such reports from low- and middle-income countries have been published in recent years. World Health Organization international collaborative studies and other international studies of social factors in dental caries using the same methodology provide empirical evidence of social inequality in oral health across countries and across oral health care systems. The paper highlights the challenges to dental public health practice, particularly the importance of risk assessment in estimating the potential for prevention. In future public health programmes, systematic risk factor assessment may therefore be instrumental in the planning and surveillance of oral health promotion and oral disease intervention programmes."
2292740,1,a,"Direct payments to physicians account for about 20% of the medical care dollar, but physician decisions cause over 80% of the costs of medical care. Decision making can be viewed in a number of ways: as pure information processing, as an interaction with various stimuli, including financial penalties and incentives, and as social behavior, interacting with and reacting to peer and leadership influence. The model that accounts for the greatest amount of the available data is a multifactorial one that takes all of these views into account. The most successful behavior change efforts use a variety of mutually reinforcing approaches, and must be present constantly or behaviors revert to highly variable (lower quality) actions and decisions. This appears to be a behavioral version of the second law of thermodynamics (entropy increases spontaneously). The best practice model to manage costs and quality appears to be one in which physicians and administrators have adequate up to date information available, make group decisions, develop and continuously improve agreed upon methods of practice, interact and think before acting, and have rewards for such behavior."
19742279,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Psychosocial symptoms are common in patients with heart failure. Little research, however, has been done to determine which psychosocial factors influence primary care patients' consultation frequency in the case of heart failure. METHODS: We recruited 310 primary care patients with heart failure by analysing electronic patient records. At baseline, psychological distress (anxiety and depression; HADS), disease coping (FKV), negative affectivity and social inhibition (DS-14), disease-specific quality of life (MLHFQ) and social support (F-SozU) were measured by validated questionnaires. Severity of heart failure (according to NYHA-classification and Goldman's Specific Activity Scale) and sociodemographic characteristics were documented by self-report instruments. Nine month later, patients were contacted by telephone in order to assess GP consultation frequency. Logistic regression was done to determine whether these psychological, medical and sociodemographic factors were associated with primary care utilisation. RESULTS: On average, patients consulted their general practitioner (GP) 8.2 times during nine months. Female subjects and patients with higher levels of perceived heart failure severity, physical problems and anxiety or depression as well as those living alone visited their GP significantly more often. In multivariate analysis, frequent attendance in general practices was predicted by physical problems and living alone. These factors explained 11.6% of the variance of frequent attendance in general practices. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial factors of help-seeking behaviour in heart failure patients focus on mental and physical discomfort and a lonely home situation. These factors might need to be compensated by GP consultation. GPs should address the rearrangement of physical, mental, and social resources to strengthen self-reliance of patients with heart failure."
9107004,1,a,"Marital separation can be a time of extreme stress and can significantly disrupt support networks and support processes when they are needed most. The purpose of this investigation was to test mechanisms of support erosion in a multimethod study of 138 divorced mothers and their confidants. Previous work was extended by using observational measures of confidant support in a process model including (a) maternal characteristics over time, (b) support person characteristics, and (c) relationship characteristics (intimacy and confidant relationship type). A hypothesized mechanism of erosion was supported in which ongoing maternal distress was positively associated with levels of confidant negativity, which in turn was related to lower levels of observed support. Having a partner was related to more intimacy than was having family and friends. Contrary to expectation, however, having a partner was related to lower levels of support, and intimacy was not related to observed support."
8211289,1,a,"This paper is based upon the results of two research projects that took place in very dissimilar places and contexts, at different situations in the epidemiological transition process, but lead to some important common conclusions. In both studies, a geo-systemic or socio-spatial classificatory model was first constructed, comprising a series of environmental (independent) variables. Second, this model was used to reveal, measure, and try to explain the health disparities existing in the area under study, as measured by certain health indicators (dependent variables). Two socio-spatial models were constructed. The first used 26 environmental variables, measured in the 78 municipios of Puerto Rico. The dependent variables were mortality rates. The second employed 28 environmental variables, measured in the 32 community health department territories (DSCs) of Quebec. The dependent variables were physical and mental health indices. The most significant common conclusion of these studies is that the socio-economic level per se, or its classical principal defining elements (income, education level) are not the main determinants of the observed health disparities. A certain stability in the physical and social environment, the person's sense of understanding of his environment and of control over the course and setting of his own life (what is called ambiocontrol) that is induced by this stability appear to be the most important determinants of health. On the other hand, centrality, complexity and instability of the environment are the most pathogenic characteristics of the milieu."
1434562,1,a,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a serious health problem for adolescents, occurring in an estimated one-quarter of sexually active teen-agers. Many of the health problems--including STDs--result from specific risk-taking behaviors. Determinants of STD risks among adolescents include behavioral, psychological, social, biological, institutional factors. Education is an important component in STD control in adolescents. The goal of education is to increase adolescent self-efficiency in practicing STD prevention and risk-reduction. A comprehensive approach including quality, theory-based education, accessible and effective health clinics, and improved social and economic conditions has the most promise of controlling STDs in adolescents."

15808930,0,a,"Psychosocial stress is a potent activator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. While the physiological mechanisms of HPA axis responses to stress as well as its short and long-term consequences have been extensively examined, less is known why someone elicits an acute neuroendocrine stress response, i.e. what are the psychological processes involved and how are they related to the acute neuroendocrine stress response. To examine this question, a questionnaire to assess anticipatory cognitive appraisal processes was developed and administered to 81 male healthy subjects in a standardized psychosocial stress situation (Trier social stress test). Cortisol stress responses were assessed with repeated measurement of salivary free cortisol. Hierarchical regression analyses show that anticipatory cognitive appraisal, in contrast to general personality factors and retrospective stress appraisal is an important determinant of the cortisol stress response, explaining up to 35% of the variance of the salivary cortisol response. The reported results emphasize the importance of psychological stress processing for the understanding of psychobiological stress responses. Since stress and its biological consequences have been shown to be associated with the onset and the maintenance of somatic illnesses and psychiatric disorders, psychological processes are prime targets for prevention and intervention."
2065114,1,a,"The role of genotype as a determinant of biologically based inter-individual differences in vulnerability to substance abuse has received little systematic investigation except in the case of alcohol. This report describes the use of an animal model, the inbred mouse, to identify and to characterize variants with inherently altered susceptibilities to the rewarding and other behavioral actions of cocaine. Among a battery of nine inbred strains chosen solely for their genetic diversity, genetic polymorphisms commonly occurred which altered the potency and/or efficacy of cocaine to induce conditioned place preference, oral self-administration, motor activity activation, seizures and lethality. These changes in cocaine sensitivity generally were of a behavior-specific and pharmacodynamic nature. One strain, DBA/2J, found to be markedly hyporesponsive to the rewarding action of cocaine, also was hyporesponsive to the rewarding effects of amphetamine, etonitazene, phencyclidine, caffeine and procaine. We speculate that this strain has an inherent generalized appetitive defect. The frequent occurrence and large magnitude of inherent phenotypic changes in cocaine responsiveness which we have identified among inbred mouse strains now permits an analytical genetic study of processes underlying cocaine-mediated reinforcement."
10542467,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify medical and non-medical factors associated to the performance of a trial of labor during the second delivery of women with one previous cesarean section. METHODS: This was a nested case control study, with a secondary data analysis from a retrospective population based cohort study. It was primarily performed on a population of women who had had their first children in Campinas, SP, Brazil, during 1985. The study population was constituted of the 1,352 women of the cohort study who had had their first deliveries by cesarean section and also had their second deliveries no matter when. The group of cases (333 women, almost 25%) was constituted of those women who had a trial of labor during their second deliveries and the control group (1,019 women) of those who had not had it. For each possible associated factor evaluated, the Odds Ratio and its respective 95% Confidence Interval were calculated. For the ordered categorical variables, the chi2 for trend was also calculated. Finally, a non conditional multivariate regression analysis was performed, identifying the significant factors and then estimating their adjusted Odds Ratio. RESULTS: The main factors associated with the trial of labor in this situation were a low monthly family income, having public medical insurance by the national health system, a low maternal age, the occurrence of rupture of membranes during the second delivery, and having been in childbirth during the first delivery. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the main determinants for a trial of labor among primipara women with one previous cesarean section were basically social and economic factors, rather than medical ones."
19655628,0,a,"Global warming, the depletion of the world'snatural resources, and excessive consumer consumption in developed countries are determinants reshaping the way we live our everyday lives. These factors are rapidly giving rise to new ecological paradigms of environmental stewardship and in healthcare environments that express sustainable theories and practices. This has given rise to a systematic system for promoting and assessing the energy performance and efficiency of healthcare facilities known as Leadership in Energy Efficient Environmental Design (LEED), and a parallel certification program, the Green Guide for Heath Care. These developments are examined in direct relation to the functions of managerial ethics. A series of ten sustainability-based ethical dilemmas are presented. Each is examined in relation to the need to inculcate in future healthcare administrators a critical understanding and appreciation of the need to reposition contemporary healthcare organizations at the center--as leading civic participants and role models in relation to the emerging movement towards carbon neutrality in the healthcare industry."
18703376,0,a,"The population health perspective recognizes a broad range of characteristics that are thought to be important determinants of health. In Canada, 12 such determinants of health are recognized, which range from lifestyle practices and the use of health care services to social and physical environments. While the list of social determinants is quite exhaustive, few studies have examined the relative importance of these determinants. The intent of this paper is to examine the relative importance of a range of social determinants of health in predicting four health outcomes of interest using data from a neighbourhood-level cross-sectional health survey conducted in Hamilton, Ontario. The results show that key social determinants of health vary by health outcome. The significance of the findings is discussed in terms of policy relevance and future research."
11520404,0,a,"Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in industrialised societies. Its incidence is greatly increased among the socially disadvantaged, but the reasons for this excess are unclear and have been relatively unexplored. We hypothesise two distinct sets of causal pathways and mechanisms that may explain social disparities in preterm birth. The first set involves chronic and acute psychosocial stressors, psychological distress caused by those stressors, increased secretion of placental corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), changes in sexual behaviours or enhanced susceptibility to bacterial vaginosis and chorioamnionitis, cigarette smoking or cocaine use, and decidual vasculopathy. The second hypothesised pathway is a gene-environment interaction based on a highly prevalent mutation in the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), combined with low folate intake from the diet and from prenatal vitamin supplements, consequent hyperhomocysteinemia, and decidual vasculopathy. We propose to test these hypothesised pathways and mechanisms in a nested case-control study within a prospectively recruited and followed cohort of pregnant women with singleton pregnancies who deliver at one of four Montreal hospitals that serve an ethnically and socio-economically diverse population. Following recruitment during the late first or early second trimester, participating women are seen at 24-26 weeks, when a research nurse obtains a detailed medical and obstetric history; administers several scales to assess chronic and acute stressors and psychological function; obtains blood samples for CRH, red blood cell and plasma folate, homocysteine, and DNA for the MTHFR mutation; and performs a digital and speculum examination to measure cervical length and vaginal pH and to obtain swabs for bacterial vaginosis and fetal fibronectin. After delivery, each case (delivery at < 37 completed weeks following spontaneous onset of labour or prelabour rupture of membranes) and two controls are selected for placental pathological examination, hair analysis of cotinine, cocaine, and benzoylecgonine, and analysis of stored blood and vaginal specimens. Statistical analysis will be based on multiple logistic regression and structural equation modelling, with sequential construction of models of potential aetiological determinants and covariates to test the hypothesised causal pathways and mechanisms. The research we propose should improve understanding of the factors and processes that mediate social disparities in preterm birth. This improved understanding should help not only in developing strategies to reduce the disparities but also in suggesting preventive interventions applicable across the entire socio-economic spectrum."

9459470,1,a,"CONTEXT: Health values (utilities or preferences for health states) are often incorporated into clinical decisions and health care policy when issues of quality vs length of life arise, but little is known about health values of the very old. OBJECTIVE: To assess health values of older hospitalized patients, compare their values with those of their surrogate decision makers, investigate possible determinants of health values, and determine whether health values change over time. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal, multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Four academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred fourteen hospitalized patients aged 80 years or older and their surrogate decision makers who were interviewed and understood the task. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time-trade-off utilities, reflecting preferences for current health relative to a shorter but healthy life. RESULTS: On average, patients equated living 1 year in their current state of health with living 9.7 months in excellent health (mean [SD] utility, 0.81 [0.28]). Although only 126 patients (30.7%) rated their current quality of life as excellent or very good, 284 (68.6%) were willing to give up at most 1 month of 12 in exchange for excellent health (utility > or =0.92). At the other extreme, 25 (6.0%) were willing to live 2 weeks or less in excellent health rather than 1 year in their current state of health (utility < or =0.04). Patients were willing to trade significantly less time for a healthy life than their surrogates assumed they would (mean difference, 0.05; P=.007); 61 surrogates (20.3%) underestimated the patient's time-trade-off score by 0.25 (3 months of 12) or more. Patients willing to trade less time for better health were more likely to want resuscitation and other measures to extend life. Time-trade-off score correlated only modestly with quality-of-life rating (r=0.28) and inversely with depression score (r=-0.27), but there were few other clinical or demographic predictors of health values. When patients who survived were asked the time-trade-off question again at 1 year, they were willing to trade less time for better health than at baseline (mean difference, 0.04; P=.04). CONCLUSION: Very old hospitalized patients who could be interviewed were able, in most cases, to have their health values assessed using the time-trade-off technique. Most patients were unwilling to trade much time for excellent health, but preferences varied greatly. Because proxies and multivariable analyses cannot gauge health values of elderly hospitalized patients accurately, health values of the very old should be elicited directly from the patient."
8475428,1,a,"The shortage of empirical studies on socio-economic factors influencing demand for health care and inequalities across social groups is dramatic in the case of Italy. The present study aims at discussing these issues, although its results are to be considered mainly methodological, given the small dimension of the sample (n = 807). A survey was carried out in a 'qualitative' sample of 9 Local Health Units of different Italian regions. Attention was paid to report every 'illness episode', considered as a cause of demand for health services, within the reference period (4 weeks) in order to properly link health needs with utilization of health services and relative expenditure. The assessment of health status across social groups, using 4 different indicators, shows the weakest social groups as the most vulnerable. The same groups report higher per capita health services uses and expenditures than their morbidity conditions would require. Assuming equity to be defined as 'equal use for equal need' a particular use-need ratio is developed (i.e. health services used per illness episode) able to capture the 'intensity' of health services use and expenditure per need. The 'over-equity' towards the less favoured groups is interpreted as a possible accomplishment of the N.H.S. fundative goals. A structural model of determinants of health services utilization, carried out through the LISREL technique (R2 = 0.36), confirms the irrelevance of the social variables with respect to need variables."
14686137,0,a,"Although relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient."
8372490,1,a,"This study examined the influence of educational achievement and occupational position on changes in risk behavior. Study population were 3753 men and women aged 25-64 years who were sampled by the first MONICA Augsburg Survey (Monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease). The subjects were sampled in 1984-85, were followed up for three years, and were reexamined in 1987-88. The baseline findings showed for both men and women a statistically significant inverse association between current cigarette smoking and educational level. During the follow-up period the differences between highest and lowest educational levels increased significantly among men. In 1987-88 only 21% of the best educated men were smokers compared to 38% of those with the lowest educational level. Men with low educational levels also drank more alcohol than better educated men, whereas among women those with lowest educational level drank less alcohol than the better educated. Statistically independent of education and age it was found that male civil servants and farmers had the lowest proportion of smokers in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal analyses. Among women, smoking was and remained most prevalent in simple white-collar occupations. In general, the findings indicate that the type of occupation and the actual working conditions have effects on life-style related risk factors which are in part independent of a social gradient. The results also suggest that the tendency to change unhealthy behavior is less pronounced in ""high risk"" groups."
9752284,1,a,"The tendency today is to make the population more aware of health in order to encourage their use of prevention activities. The aim of our telephone survey which was performed on a representative sample of the population (1,010) in the Bas-Rhin department in France, was to study the relationship between the level of knowledge of cancer and the use of screening techniques to prevent it. Eighty-two percent of the males and 78% of the females surveyed, show a profound understanding of cancer in general, the associated risk factors and its prevention. The level of awareness of males did not influence a specific behaviour (p = 0.68) towards cancer prevention. It was shown that in smokers, the more they smoke, the more they underestimate the chances of cure from all categories of cancer (p = 0.01). They both overestimate the number of cigarettes needed daily before smoking becomes toxic (p < 0.01) and are less active physically than nonsmokers (p < 0.007). Heavy smokers live in larger communities (p < 0.02) and smokers are younger than non-smokers (p < 0.0001). In the female population, the level of awareness did indeed influence their behaviour towards cancer prevention (p < 0.04). The level of knowledge was higher in both those who consciously attend cancer screening clinics (cervical Papanicolaou smears and faecal tests) and those who are opposed to faecal tests. Younger females are significantly less aware than those who are older (p = 0.0001) and more than two-thirds of these would not consider a cervical Papanicolaou smear as a preventative diagnostic tool. Females who conscientiously attend cancer screening clinics and who are very much aware of cancer, are generally older in age (p < 0.05). The occurrence of mammography as a preventative measure is both high and dependent on age. In conclusion, the level of knowledge of cancer cannot explain alone human behaviour towards the prevention of this disease. Other determinants responsible for influencing human behaviour towards cancer prevention will be better understood once the social sciences, epidemiology and anthropology units work together and combine resources to achieve a common goal."
11759165,0,a,"This paper considers actual German trends of impact factors contributing to hygienic risks in domestic settings: Have there been or are there still alterations which may be relevant and which should have consequences for hygiene behavior? How is hygiene consciousness organized in the German society? Each of the alterations of hygiene determinants described below may appear to be marginal when looked at separately, thus disregarding any relationship to hygiene. However, as a whole to anticipate the conclusion they have clearly altered the hygiene risks in the household; some risks have decreased but others have grown worse. The author intends to initiate an objective discussion on home hygiene in Germany. The intention is not creating a sterile environment in the home but to realize the ""hot spots"" of hygiene in modern domestic settings in order to develop a targeted hygiene."
8922237,1,a,"Much of the epidemiological heterogeneity of HD incidence reflects the behaviour of the NS subtype, at least in the USA. Incidence variation across races (except Asians) and time periods is most marked in this subtype. In young adults with HD, there is compelling evidence for social class modification of risk consistent with an infectious aetiology; limited data suggest that this effect occurs within the NS subtype, but considerable evidence indicates that it does not primarily involve EBV infection. Findings from familial aggregation studies and HLA associations point to inherited susceptibility to this subtype. Despite little sex difference for NS in young adulthood in the latest incidence data, parity nevertheless appears to be protective against this subtype for women. Therefore, the greater increase for females than males in the incidence of young-adult NS in recent years may reflect the impact of population trends towards later childbearing and lower parity. This change, as well as the concomitant smaller family sizes and growing affluence, could explain part of the burgeoning incidence of NS in young adults in the USA. These observations suggest that NS in young adults constitutes a separate disease, probably of infectious origin. The incongruous occurrence of this subtype in older adults, and the presence of EBV in some NS cases, could reflect heterogeneity within NS, for example, representing features of the cellular phase of NS (Cozen et al, 1992; Medeiros and Greiner, 1995). For the non-NS subtypes, many of the factors that predict risk of NS may also be relevant. Patterns of social class determinants in children and older adults, the age groups at risk for MC, support involvement of an infectious precursor given intense exposure, and EBV is a likely candidate, based on its high prevalence in these groups. However, little aetiological research has been directed explicitly at the non-NS subtypes. Considerable effort has gone into exploring an infectious aetiology of HD. Recently, this line of investigation has moved beyond social class determinants to molecular epidemiological studies of EBV and, to a lesser degree, other potentially involved viruses. The roles of genetic susceptibility and sex hormones also represent promising areas for exploration, particularly in their possible interaction with infectious agents and other environmental factors. Ultimately, clearer epidemiological understanding of HD will be aided by more precise classification of this disease at the molecular level."
9933553,1,a,"American lobsters, Homarus americanus, form stable dominance relationships in captivity. Size, sex and stage in the moult cycle are important determinants for dominance. Other factors, such as recent agonistic experience play a role. This paper investigates how lobsters maintain their stable dominance relationships: they may recognize individuals or alternatively, recognize overall dominance status. We paired lobsters in two consecutive 'boxing matches'. Results indicate that lobsters remember familiar opponents when kept either in isolation or in communal tanks for 24 h between their first and second fights. Subordinates immediately backed away from familiar dominants, avoiding a second fight. In some animals, this memory lasted between 1-2 weeks if pairs were kept separate between the first and second fights. When paired for the second fight against unfamiliar dominant lobsters, subordinate lobsters from first fights actively fought and won the encounter. These results suggest that lobsters are capable of 'individual recognition'. In nature, the observed social organization of lobsters may be maintained by individual recognition of a small number of residents inhabiting separate, nearby shelters.

12215241,0,a,"The psychosocial and behavioral determinants of smoking cessation from late adolescence to early adulthood were investigated in a sample of 711 individuals followed from 1990 (grade 12) to 1995. Analyses stratified by sex indicated that female smokers were more likely to quit 5 years later if they had fewer friends who smoked, less parental approval of their smoking, weaker intentions to continue smoking, higher smoking resistance self-efficacy and better grades at grade 12. Several of these associations could be accounted for by smoking quantity. Similar analyses for male smokers indicated that those who eventually quit were more likely to have fewer cigarette offers, weaker intentions to smoke, better grades and an intact nuclear family at grade 12. The associations for males could not be explained by smoking quantity. Interaction analyses showed few significant sex differences in the predictors of smoking cessation. Results suggest that cessation programs should continue to target parental and peer influences, as well as skills at resisting social influences to smoke, through late adolescence, but do not indicate that such programs need to be adapted to the special needs of male and female smokers."
8355899,1,a,"Research suggests that the rate of HIV infection is increasing dramatically in African-American and Hispanic youths who live in low-income, urban areas. Nurses need information about these youths' negative experiences with condoms to intervene effectively in the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. This article discusses negative experiences with using condoms that were reported by a subsample of condom users (n = 975) from a household probability sample of low-income, urban, African-American and Hispanic youths. Condom users were asked about 12 different negative experiences with condoms. Results from this household survey highlight a need for nurses to provide clients with specific directions about how to use condoms correctly and to encourage clients to practice putting on condoms."
12689499,1,a,"This paper starts with the fact that noise annoyance is partly due to acoustic factors, partly due to so-called moderating variables, i.e. personal and social aspects of the residents. Noise annoyance is considered to be the (long-term) negative evaluation of living conditions with respect to noise. This evaluation is not simply dependent on past disturbances, but on attitudes and expectations, too. The personal factors influencing the evaluation and described here are: Sensitivity to noise, fear of harm connected with the source, personal evaluation of the source, and coping capacity with respect to noise. The social factors described here are: General (social) evaluation of the source, trust or misfeasance with source authorities, history of noise exposure, and expectations of residents. For most of these variables, data from different community studies are used in order to illustrate the respective moderating effect on annoyance. In addition, some of the moderators are presented as possible tools in order to reduce noise annoyance. It is expected that a significant decrease in a negatively moderating variable is as effective in reducing noise annoyance, as is a significant decrease in noise level."
17259636,0,a,"BACKGROUND: fall-related injuries in older people are a major public health concern. This study examined the relationship between psychosocial determinants of healthy ageing and risk of fall-related hip fracture in community-dwelling older people. The purpose was to contribute evidence for promotion of healthy ageing strategies in population-based interventions for fall injury prevention. METHODS: a case-control study was conducted with 387 participants, with at least two controls recruited per case. Cases of fall-related hip fracture in community-dwelling people aged 65 and older were recruited from hospital admissions in Brisbane, Australia, in 2003-2004. Community-based controls, matched by age, sex and postcode, were recruited via electoral roll sampling. A questionnaire assessing psychosocial factors, identified as determinants of healthy ageing, was administered at face-to-face interviews. RESULTS: psychosocial factors having a significant independent protective effect on hip fracture risk included being currently married [OR: 0.44 (0.22 to 0.88)], living in present residence for 5 years or more [OR: 0.43 (0.22 to 0.84)], having private health insurance [OR: 0.49 (0.27 to 0.90)], using proactive coping strategies [OR: 0.52 (0.29 to 0.92)], having a higher level of life satisfaction [OR: 0.47 (0.27 to 0.81)], and engagement in social activities in older age [OR: 0.30 (0.17 to 0.54)]. CONCLUSION: this study suggests that psychosocial determinants of healthy ageing are protective in fall-related hip fracture injury in older people. Reduction in the public health burden caused by this injury may then be achieved by implementing healthy ageing strategies involving community-based approaches to enhance the psychosocial environments of older people."
19079707,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Arbovirus diseases have emerged as a global public health concern. However, the impact of climatic, social, and environmental variability on the transmission of arbovirus diseases remains to be determined. OBJECTIVE: Our goal for this study was to provide an overview of research development and future research directions about the interrelationship between climate variability, social and environmental factors, and the transmission of Ross River virus (RRV), the most common and widespread arbovirus disease in Australia. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search on climatic, social, and environmental factors and RRV disease. Potentially relevant studies were identified from a series of electronic searches. RESULTS: The body of evidence revealed that the transmission cycles of RRV disease appear to be sensitive to climate and tidal variability. Rainfall, temperature, and high tides were among major determinants of the transmission of RRV disease at the macro level. However, the nature and magnitude of the interrelationship between climate variability, mosquito density, and the transmission of RRV disease varied with geographic area and socioenvironmental condition. Projected anthropogenic global climatic change may result in an increase in RRV infections, and the key determinants of RRV transmission we have identified here may be useful in the development of an early warning system. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis indicates that there is a complex relationship between climate variability, social and environmental factors, and RRV transmission. Different strategies may be needed for the control and prevention of RRV disease at different levels. These research findings could be used as an additional tool to support decision making in disease control/surveillance and risk management."
18537814,0,a,"This paper investigates the determinants of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture utilization for cancer patients who are simultaneously having conventional Western medical treatments. This study used five leading cancers in Taiwan, namely cervical, breast, lung, liver and colorectal cancers. A total of 2499 cancer patients were interviewed, of which 2034 had full information and were analysed. Logistic regressions were used for both TCM and acupuncture. The results showed that type of cancer and cancer duration determine the utilization for alternative treatments. While socio-economic factors also affect choice of alternative medicine, the magnitude differs by types of alternative treatment and cancer. Compared with men and older patients, women and younger patients tend to prefer alternative medicine, and patients from south have higher preference for alternative medicine, which could be a reflection of local culture. Our results are useful for the government to determine higher users of TCM and acupuncture among cancer patients, and make policies to suit these patients' needs."
16740677,0,a,"Adoption of potentially effective preventive interventions often fails. This study aimed to identify factors that determine why midwifery practices decide to use a smoking cessation protocol, using a comprehensive model of both organizational and psychosocial factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among representatives of all 446 Dutch midwifery practices, of whom 251 (56%) responded. The results show that adoption of the protocol was facilitated by the presence of practice assistants and impeded by a large proportion of clients of foreign ethnic origin. The most successful information channel was the midwives' professional association. A consistent positive attitude (perceiving a lot of advantages, few disadvantages and a low level of ambivalence) and positive social norms toward using the protocol, a perceived large proportion of midwives who use the protocol and knowledge about the protocol significantly increased the likelihood of adoption. The decision to use the protocol was better explained by personal awareness and motivation factors than by organizational factors."
10224513,1,a,"This paper reviews experimental contributions published in the last two decades and exploring the effect of emotional stress on neuroendocrine function in healthy humans. Laboratory studies allow standardization of the stressor and better control for known confounding factors. Commonly used stressors are mental arithmetics, speech tasks, the Stroop test, videogame playing, films or videotapes and interviews. Little is known about the generalizability of laboratory results, with some studies suggesting great caution in extrapolating data to real-life stress conditions. Another strategy is studying the psychoendocrine reaction to real-life stressors, such as bereavement or anticipated loss, academic examinations, everyday work and parachute jumping. The effects of different stressors on neuroendocrine axes are reviewed, as well as the influence of gender, age, personality, coping style, social support, biological and nonbiological interventions. The subjective perception of the situation is probably a main determinant of the psychoendocrine response pattern. In fact, marked variability in individual responses to a variety of stressors has frequently been observed. Evidently, the 'objective' characteristics of a given event are not the only determinants of reaction to the event itself. According to a constructivistic perspective, every given stressor has a strictly personal and idiosyncratic meaning and loses its 'objective' characteristics. Of course, biological factors may also play a part. In any case, it is mandatory to overcome a rigid dichotomy between psychological and biological processes. Dualistic conceptions which imply a determination of the physical by the psychological or vice versa should give place to a systemic conception, which implies mutual, circular interactions."

19827286,0,a,"A short review of main results obtained in occupational stress research is presented. Stress activates the sympato-adrenal system with possible dangerous consequences on the cardiovascular apparatus. In field studies the relation between stress and coronary diseases is controversial. However, from a clinical and experimental perspective the relation between breakdown in adaptation and cardiovascular disorder is a fact. More consistent results on the psychosocial determinants of an increased cardiovascular risk are obtained when stress is studied in relation to the socio-economic condition of groups and individuals. To better embrace and describe such factors, a new theoretical contribution has been introduced: social capital. This is a more sophisticated version of social cohesion, social integration and social support. For the future, an interdisciplinary approach is recommended in health surveillance of life and work environment."
9220127,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To provide a current review and synthesis of the present state of knowledge of anxiety disorders and symptoms in the elderly. METHODS: Current research derived from a MEDLINE search and references in key textbook articles and other papers were reviewed. These data were combined with the clinical empirical knowledge and experience of the authors. RESULTS: Anxiety disorders and symptoms are a common presenting problem in the elderly. Current knowledge and research findings are limited. Extrapolation from adult studies are of use, but important limitations are evident because of the nature, uniqueness, and complexity of the geriatric psychiatry patient. Comorbidity, especially with depression, medical conditions, drugs, and dementia, remains an important concept in assessment and approach to management of anxiety in the older person. Comprehensive assessment of anxiety symptoms requires consideration of physical, intellectual, environmental, and social determinants. Major anxiety disorders, as defined by DSM-IV, and anxiety symptoms are significant problems in the older adult population and are responsible for significant morbidity and cost to the health care network. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety disorders and symptoms in old age, although common, have received little research focus to date. A comprehensive, careful approach by the clinician to assessment and management is required because anxiety is often a comorbid condition in the elderly. Effective treatments are available and should be applied in a flexible, integrated, and specific manner."

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The authors argue that:i) the direct impacts of climate change such as extreme weather events will have significant mental health implications;ii) climate change is already impacting on the social, economic and environmental determinants of mental health with the most severe consequences being felt by disadvantaged communities and populations; iii) understanding the full extent of the long term social and environmental challenges posed by climate change has the potential to create emotional distress and anxiety; and iv) understanding the psycho-social implications of climate change is also an important starting point for informed action to prevent dangerous climate change at individual, community and societal levels."
12600275,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal complaints are frequent and have large consequences for public health. Information about the prognosis after presentation in general practice is far from complete. Knowledge about determinants of the clinical course of musculoskeletal complaints is essential for management decisions and to inform patients about their prognosis. The purpose of this study is to provide information about the prognosis of musculoskeletal complaints other than low back pain by studying the course of these complaints in general practice and to identify determinants of this course. METHODS: Patients of 18 years and older, who present in general practice with a new episode of a musculoskeletal complaint of the neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, arm, hip, knee, ankle or foot, are recruited by their general practitioner (GP). Participants will receive complaint-specific questionnaires by mail at baseline and after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. The following putative determinants of the course of the complaints will be investigated: sociodemographic characteristics, characteristics of the complaint, psychosocial job characteristics, physical workload, physical activity during leisure time, pain coping, mood, kinesiophobia, social support, optimism. The primary outcomes are perceived recovery, pain, functional status, sick leave and overall quality of life."
16414146,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of contextual (social capital and administrative/neo-materialist) and individual factors on lack of access to a regular doctor. METHODS: The 2000 public health survey in Scania is a cross-sectional study. A total of 13,715 persons answered a postal questionnaire, which is 59% of the random sample. A multilevel logistic regression model, with individuals at the first level and municipalities at the second, was performed. The effect (intra-class correlations, cross-level modification and odds ratios) of individual and municipality (social capital and health care district) factors on lack of access to a regular doctor was analysed using simulation method. The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) was used as information criterion for the models. RESULTS: The second level municipality variance in lack of access to a regular doctor is substantial even in the final models with all individual and contextual variables included. The model that results in the largest reduction in DIC is the model including age, sex and individual social participation (which is a network aspect of social capital), but the models which include administrative and social capital second level factors also reduced the DIC values. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that both administrative health care district and social capital may partly explain the individual's self reported lack of access to a regular doctor."
10220021,1,a,"This paper explores aspects of the social production of health by focussing on the ways in which levels of health are shaped by structures of social inequality and behaviors or 'lifestyles'. We address two questions: What is the relative importance of the social, structural and behavioral determinants of health? And, are there gender differences in the determinants of health? These questions are explored using multiple regression analyses of data from the 1994 Canadian National Population Health Survey. Two measures of health are used: subjective health status and the Health Utilities Index (a measure of functional health status). By structural determinants we refer to age, family structure, main activity, education, occupation, income and social support. Behavioral determinants include lifestyle factors related to smoking, drinking, weight and physical activity. Findings indicate that the structures of social inequality are the most important determinants of health acting both independently and through their influence on the behavioral determinants of health. There are very real differences in the factors that predict women's and men's health. For women, social structural factors appear to play a more important role in determining health. Being in the highest income category, working full-time and caring for a family and having social support are more important predictors of good health for women than men. Smoking and alcohol consumption are more important determinants of health status for men than women, while body weight and being physically inactive are more important for women than men. Our findings suggest the value of models which include a wide range of structural and behavioral variables and affirm the importance of looking more closely at gender differences in the determinants of health."
19944934,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Kalihi Valley is a densely populated, low-income community (28,958 residents in approximately 6 square miles) with insufficient sidewalks, bike lanes, and public green space to support regular physical activity for its residents. Kokua Kalihi Valley (KKV), a community health center formed in 1972, sought to improve Kalihi Valley's built environment based on its history of community- and partnership-based preventive health initiatives that have focused on the social determinants of health. INTERVENTION: Kokua Kalihi Valley used a flexible partnership model and a focus on direct community action to develop an unused 100-acre state park (the Kalihi Valley Nature Park) and establish a bicycle repair and recycling program that mobilized thousands of community volunteers, attracted widespread media coverage, and established a number of innovative programs for active living. Kokua Kalihi Valley and its partners also contributed to the successful passage of a city charter amendment to prioritize Honolulu as a bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly city. RESULTS: This initiative was successful in reclaiming a substantial amount of land for active living and in stimulating both public governmental support and widespread private community involvement in programs and activities. LESSONS LEARNED: Projects that engaged community members in activities with tangible accomplishment were shown to be most successful. CONCLUSIONS: This initiative showed that community health centers may be uniquely positioned to provide leadership and assume responsibility for cross-sectoral active-living health projects."
10750165,0,a,"Aggression and stereotyped behaviors are not uncommon among people with intellectual disabilities and they are often treated separately as operant behaviors. In this single case study, it is argued that the function of a young woman's aggressive behavior appeared to be that of avoiding or escaping the termination of a chain of complex stereotyped behavior (or ""ritual""). She became aggressive only when this chain of stereotyped behavior was terminated and the aggression appeared to extinguish when it no longer led to escape from the termination of the ""ritual"". It is suggested that this is an example of a complex interaction between two behaviors and that it illustrates the need for very careful analysis of the functions of challenging behavior. Furthermore, it is proposed that the lengthening list of variables already documented as determinants of challenging behavior (provision of attention (verbal and physical), mechanical restraint, sensory or tangible events, escape from demands or from social attention, denials, escape from intrusive medical procedures, escape from task difficulty) be lengthened to include the possibility of escape from (or avoidance of) the interruption of a chain of complex stereotyped behavior or ""ritual""."

Variations in the labour market assimilation of immigrants according to their gender and country of origin are also analysed. The results suggest that recent immigrant cohorts have had more difficulty being assimilated into the Canadian labour market than earlier ones, an apparent consequence of recent changes in Canadian immigration policy, labour market discrimination against visible minorities, and the prolonged recession of the early 1980s.""

20024760,0,a,"A life course approach was used to assess household level impacts and inform interventions around HIV risk and AIDS vulnerability across seven major age-related stages of life. Our focus was sub-Saharan Africa. We provided a qualitative review of evidence from published literature, particularly multicountry reviews on impacts of AIDS, on determinants of risk and vulnerability, and reports of large surveys. Areas of potential stress from birth to old age in households affected by AIDS, and interventions for dealing with these specific stresses were identified. While specific interventions for HIV are important at different stages, achieving survival and development outcomes demands a wider set of health, social security and development interventions. One way to determine the priorities amongst these actions is to give weighting to interventions that address factors that have latent impacts later in life, which interrupt accumulating risk, or that change pathways to reduce the risk of both immediate and later stress. This qualitative review suggested that interventions, important for life cycle transitions in generalised epidemics where HIV risk and AIDS vulnerability is high, lie within and outside the health sector, and suggested examples of such interventions."
11814157,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to assess: (1) child health nurses' identification of abuse/neglect of children of preschool age in their districts; (2) overall prevalence of abuse/neglect according to the nurses; (3) determinants of nurse identification; (4) determinants of nurse-reported district prevalences; and (5) determinants of reporting to the child protection services (CPS). METHOD: Questionnaires were mailed to about 3,000 child health centers. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent responded. Of these, 22% identified no case and 33% at least one (mostly five or fewer). The overall prevalence was 1.4%. Identification correlated with general participation rate in the county. Other determinants of identification were acquaintance with the district, large district populations, and three variables assumed to reflect a personal interest. Determinants of prevalences were small district populations, regular contacts with the social services, and two personal interest variables. With large district populations, identification increased, whereas prevalences decreased. Only 30.3% had made a report to the CPS. Regular contacts with the social services correlated with reporting. Personal interest was a determinant of the decision to report, and acquaintance with the district a determinant of reporting rate. CONCLUSIONS: Abuse and neglect did not appear as priorities for the Child Health Services. The method probably led to an underestimation of the true prevalence. Personal interest and social services contacts emerged as important determinants. However, the assumed criteria of ""interest"" were not validated. For effective identification, no nurse should be responsible for more than 400 to 500 children. Implications for practice and research are discussed."
10899475,0,a,"PURPOSE: To identify risk and protective factors for initiation of sexual intercourse before age 16 years at the level of the individual, family, and school. METHODS: A longitudinal study based on a cohort of 1020 people born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972/73 and followed up to age 21 years. Demographic characteristics of the sample were similar to the New Zealand population of that age, except that a smaller proportion (3%) were Maori or Pacific Island Polynesian. Information on individual, family and school factors was collected by interview with parents at ages 3, 5, 7 and 9 years and then by postal questionnaire two-yearly up to 15 years. Subjects were assessed two-yearly from age 3 years and interviewed about their behaviours and ambitions at ages 11, 13, and 15 years. Questions about age at first intercourse were asked by computer at age 21 years. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model associations with age of first intercourse less than 16 years. RESULTS: Data on age at first intercourse were available for 926/1020 (91%) of surviving members of the cohort assembled at age 3 years. Overall 27.5% of males and 31.7% of females reported sexual intercourse before age 16 years. In multivariate analyses the independent predictors for early sexual initiation for males were: not having outside home interests at age 13 years, no religious activity at age 11 years, not being attached to school at age 15 years, a low reading score, and a diagnosis of conduct disorder in early adolescence. For females, independent predictors were: socioeconomic status in the middle range, mother having her first child before age 20 years, IQ in the middle range, not being attached to school, being in trouble at school, planning to leave school early, cigarette smoking and higher self-esteem score. CONCLUSIONS: Individual and school factors appear to be more important than family composition or socioeconomic status in the decision to have sexual intercourse before age 16 years. The lowering of age at first intercourse may be partly a cohort effect related to high rates of teenage childbearing in the mothers' generation, and to changes in social acceptability of early sexual behaviour."
8463204,1,a,"Operant and biological theories of the cause of self-injurious behavior (SIB) in people with a mental handicap are often viewed as mutually exclusive. In this single case study, interactions between features of Rett syndrome and operant conditioning as determinants of SIB are examined. Functional analysis by analog methodology indicated different functions for two forms of SIB shown by the subject: automatic reinforcement by sensory stimulation and escape from social interactions. It is suggested that features of Rett syndrome established conditions under which operant conditioning of self-injurious responding was maximized. The implications of this interaction between features of syndromes and operant conditioning for the conceptualization of the cause of SIB are discussed and it is proposed that the notion of a unitary cause of SIB is inappropriate. It is more productive to consider operant conditioning as the process that maintains responding against a background of predisposing and mediating factors which may be biologically determined."
19142700,0,a,"Primate socioecological studies have attempted to derive general frameworks using the average behavioural traits of species or genera to place them into categories. However, with the accumulation of primate studies, it is timely to place more emphasis on understanding within-species variation in social structure. In this review we have four objectives. First, we examine within-species variation in the potential determinants of social structure, including diet, demography, predation and infanticide, and document considerable variation. Second, we present case studies of within-species variation in social structure to illustrate the potential magnitude of this variation. For example, there are cases within a single interbreeding population where multi-male, uni-male, fission-fusion and monogamous groups are found. Third, by examining widespread primate lineages that occur in a variety of habitats, we note that there are differences in the magnitude of variation in social structures across different lineages and as a result we consider phylogenetic constraints on phenotypic variation in social structure. Finally, we reflect on the implications of extensive variation in social structure. We suggest that primate social structure will represent a combination of adaptation to present-day environment and phylogenetic inertia. To advance our understanding of the relative contribution of phylogeny versus ecology we propose two approaches. One approach is to compare groups in the same interbreeding population that inhabit different ecological conditions. Any differences that are found can be attributed to ecological differences, since phylogeny should not play a role within a single population. The second approach is to study distantly related species that have similar social structures to illustrate how similar ecological pressures might be operating to select for parallel social structures."
18410815,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to (1) determine whether level of social support and living situation predicted emergency department (ED) use among older adults and (2) identify correlates of ED visits according to whether the patient was admitted to the hospital. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a longitudinal, prospective study was conducted. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, subjects who lived alone were 60% more likely to visit the ED than those who lived solely with their spouse. Neither type nor level of social support as measured by the Duke Social Support Index predicted ED use. Indicators of poor physical health (prior hospitalization, poorer self-rated health, and functional disability) were predictors of ED visits that resulted in hospitalization; however, these were not significantly associated with outpatient ED visits. DISCUSSION: Older adults who live alone are more likely to visit the ED. Additional study is needed to understand the determinants of outpatient ED visits."
18325417,0,a,"PROBLEM: Preventive interventions to reduce occupational injuries and health problems in farmers require the identification of factors that contribute to unsafe and health damaging behavior. This paper describes the development and validation of a self-report questionnaire, which measures the determinants of occupational health-related behaviors in farmers. METHOD: A representative sample of 283 Flemish farmers completed a provisional 135 item questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, measuring four behaviors related to occupational health (machinery use, animal handling, preventing falls, and pesticide use), as well as the intentions, attitudes, perceived social norms, and self-efficacy for each of these behaviors. RESULTS: The fit indices of the Confirmatory Factor Analysis turned out not to be sufficient to reproduce the dimensions of the TPB. Therefore exploratory factor analysis was use to determine the underlying dimensions. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) on the behavioral items yielded single component solutions explaining a considerable proportion of the variance for each behavior and for behavioral intentions. Principal component analyses toward an a priori three-component structure reflecting the TPB dimensions did not produce sufficient congruence for the determinants of the four behaviors. Subsequent Varimax rotations and discarding of redundant items resulted in three component solutions explaining 50% to 69% of the variance in the determinants of each behavior, corresponding with the dimensions of the TPB. Internal consistencies ranged from .25 to .89. Scale scores accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in intention and self-reported behavior. IMPACT: The study demonstrates the validity of the TPB in predicting behavior related to occupational safety and health in farmers, and provides a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure the cognitive concepts featured in this model. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Both authors share the same view on this study's impact on industry. In recent years, efforts have been made to create awareness among farmers about occupational hazards, and to encourage farmers to perform safer and healthier behavior. However, only a limited number of these interventions have proven to be successful. A possible reason for this relative lack of success is that interventions typically focus on risk analysis and raising awareness, whereas the literature on preventive health behavior change indicates that knowledge and awareness with regard to possible health risks are neither necessary nor sufficient to change behavior. To raise the effectiveness of prevention programs, other relevant determinants of behavior need to be addressed as well, such as: attitudes, perceived social norms, self efficacy, and elements of the physical environment that elicit or reinforce behavior. These determinants play a key role in psychological models of health related behavior, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior. Thus far, the use of these models within agricultural settings is fairly limited. This study demonstrates the validity of the Theory of Planned Behavior in predicting behavior related to occupational safety and health in farmers, and provides a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure the cognitive concepts featured in this model."
1879391,1,a,"Employed data from two longitudinal surveys of gay men in San Francisco (a) to examine for cohort (Study 1) and attrition (Studies 1 and 2) bias effects on reported changes in condom use by gay men and (b) to investigate predictors of condom use (Study 2). Substantial increases in condom use were observed, and these changes were unrelated to attrition and cohort bias. In terms of predictors of condom use, men who always used condoms had higher levels of social support from informal sources of help, had more positive expectations that condoms would have positive interpersonal and personal consequences, and were more likely to be HIV positive than men who used condoms occasionally or never. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for HIV-prevention research."
1628712,1,a,"Data from three fertility surveys are used to examined the probabilities and determinants of adolescent births among Dominican and Puerto Rican women. Young women in the Dominican Republic are the most likely to have had a child by each year of age from 14 through 24, followed by young women on the Island of Puerto Rico; the probability of an early birth is lowest for Puerto Rican women on the U.S. mainland. Eighteen percent of Dominican women have had a child before their 18th birthday, compared with 13% of women living in Puerto Rico, and 10% of Puerto Rican women in metropolitan New York. The cumulative probabilities that Puerto Rican women will have borne a child before their 20th birthday are almost identical, whether the women live on the island or the U.S. mainland, but the difference between Puerto Rican and Dominican women widens. The order is reversed, however, in the analysis of premarital births: The probability of a premarital birth during adolescence is highest for Puerto Rican women in New York, and lowest for Dominican women. In a separate logistic regression analysis, education and age at first sexual intercourse are shown to be important determinants of adolescent fertility in all three populations."
1627376,1,a,"In a prospective interview study, designed to compare the psycho-social outcome after a breast-conserving vs. a mastectomy operation, we analysed possible predictors of the psycho-social adjustment. 99 women with breast cancer histopathological TNM stages I and II were consecutively admitted to the study. Half-structured interviews, based on the Social Adjustment Scale and a scale by P. Maguire, were performed 4 and 13 months after the operation. Living together with the spouse seems to protect women from developing psycho-social problems postoperatively. Women who were gainfully employed or who were given radiotherapy had a higher risk of poor adjustment after 4 months. At 13 months, the scorings indicate that radiotherapy has a reassuring effect. Type of surgery was controlled for in the analysis and showed that, of the risk factors studied, the most consistent trend for an overall better outcome was in the breast-conserved group except for sexual disturbances."
12604477,0,a,"The author traces the development of the concept of health promotion from 1980s policies of the World Health Organization. Two approaches that signify the modernization of public health are outlined in detail: the European Health for All targets and the settings approach. Both aim to reorient health policy priorities from a risk factor approach to strategies that address the determinants of health and empower people to participate in improving the health of their communities. These approaches combine classic public health dictums with ""new"" strategies, some setting explicit goals to integrate public health with general welfare policy. Health for All, health promotion, and population health have contributed to this reorientation in thinking and strategy, but the focus of health policy remains expenditure rather than investment."
17135105,0,a,"Using data from the Community Tracking Study Household Survey (1998-99), we estimate the relationship between Medigap premiums and senior Medicare beneficiaries' supplemental coverage decisions. All seniors are more likely to be enrolled in an HMO in markets with higher Medigap prices. Lower income seniors are particularly sensitive to Medigap premiums and are more likely to have no supplemental coverage when faced with higher Medigap premiums. As Medicare supplemental options evolve in response to the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, it is important to consider that lower income beneficiaries may respond to price changes and other factors differently than their higher income counterparts."
11851959,0,a,"Despite growing public resistance to the practice of female genital cutting (FGC), documentation of its prevalence, social correlates or trends in practice are extremely limited, and most available data are based on self-reporting. In three antenatal and three family planning clinics in South-west Nigeria we studied the prevalence, social determinants, and validity of self-reporting for FGC among 1709 women. Women were interviewed on social and demographic history, and whether or not they had undergone FGC. Interviews were followed by clinical examination to affirm the occurrence and extent of circumcision. In total, 45.9% had undergone some form of cutting. Based on WHO classifications by type, 32.6% had Type I cuts, 11.5% Type II, and 1.9% Type III or IV. Self-reported FGC status was valid in 79% of women; 14% were unsure of their status, and 7% reported their status incorrectly. Women are more likely to be unsure of their status if they were not cut, or come from social groups with a lower prevalence of cutting. Ethnicity was the most significant social predictor of FGC, followed by age, religious affiliation and education. Prevalence of FGC was highest among the Bini and Urhobo, among those with the least education, and particularly high among adherents to Pentecostal churches; this was independent of related social factors. There is evidence of a steady and steep secular decline in the prevalence of FGC in this region over the past 25 years, with age-specific prevalence rates of 75.4% among women aged 45-49 years, 48.6% among 30-34-year olds, and 14.5% among girls aged 15-19. Despite wide disparities in FGC prevalence across ethnic, religious and educational groups, the secular decline is evident among all social subgroups."
19476670,0,a,"A recent study to measure social disability used the results of a questionnaire administered to 696 patients between March 14th and April 7th 2007 which showed that three-quarters of the population surveyed have a social disability. Major determinants of social disadvantage are found using three specific indicators: income, assets and home-interior comfort. A greater deterioration of poor health status was not particularly noted within the most socially disadvantage group of patients, and social disability did not lead to actual over-consumption of medical products or services. People with social disabilities remained hospitalised more than 1.5 days over the average length of hospital stay which accounts for an inferred additional costs to hospital budgets equivalent to 10.3 million ?. The article proposes a model for measuring social disability that can be used routinely upon patient admission to identify socially disadvantaged cases in order to offer those patients specific and tailored assistance and reduce the length of their stay. This model may also support public health policy monitoring."
19997790,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about psychosocial mechanisms that may underlie differences in lifestyle change between socioeconomic groups. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine how educational level influences middle-aged participants' (N = 385) psychosocial responses to the GOAL Lifestyle Implementation Trial. METHODS: The measurements of self-efficacy and planning for healthy lifestyle were conducted pre-intervention (T1) and post-intervention (T2, 3 months), and measurements of exercise and healthy eating as outcomes at T1 and at 12 months (T3). RESULTS: Psychosocial determinants at T1 and their T1-T2 changes were mostly similar, irrespective of educational levels. Exercise barriers self-efficacy was enhanced slightly less (p = 0.08) among the low-SES. T2 levels as well as pre-post-intervention changes in exercise self-efficacy predicted 12-month changes in exercise, and T2 diet coping planning predicted changes in dietary fat intake. The associations were similar across all SES groups. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing self-efficacy and planning is similarly effective among intervention participants regardless of education level."
18294782,0,a,"Jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) flexibly change their social forms depending on their age, time of the day, and the season. In the daytime, paired adults behave territorially and unpaired subadults form small flocks of ten birds, whereas at night hundreds of birds roost together. In the breeding season, pairings remain in their nest all day. This fission-fusion raises questions about the underlying social structure and the cognitive capability of jungle crows. In this study, dyadic encounters were used to investigate dominance relationships (linear or non-linear) and the underlying mechanisms in captive jungle crows. Fourteen crows were tested in 455 encounters (i.e., 5 encounters per dyad), and a stable linear dominance relationship emerged. Sex and aggressiveness were determinants as individual characteristics for dominance formation. Males dominated females, and more aggressive individuals dominated less aggressive ones. Aggressive interactions in dyads occurred primarily during the first encounter and drastically declined during subsequent encounters without any signs of a confidence effect. These results suggest that, in captive jungle crow, a linear form of dominance is intrinsically determined by sex and aggressiveness and maintained extrinsically by memories of past outcomes associated with specific individuals, implying individual recognition."
17582668,0,a,"Household surveys from the developing world consistently record a generally low level of illness reporting, but the evidence that substantial differences exist in illness reporting between income groups is scanty. In contrast, a huge gap in illness reporting exists between rich and poor countries. Medical anthropologists have highlighted the differential illness perception across income groups but little is known as to what extent economic variables do determine one's illness decision. In this paper, discrete choice theory is used to explain why some parents choose to report their children's illnesses more often than others in Nepal. An empirical model is developed that depicts illness-reporting decisions as a function of inter alia, price and income. Data are drawn from Phase I of the Nepal Living Standards Survey. The results suggest that income as well as the price that parents expect to pay on treatment of their children's non-chronic ailments determine their decision to report an illness, when controlling for other variables (price responsiveness =-1.16; income responsiveness=0.23; p-value=0.00). This behaviour is theoretically consistent as parents weigh the opportunity costs of their decision (here, choosing to report an illness). Its implications are broader and raise other questions, e.g., Can we explain the difference in illness-perception rates between rich and poor countries that have different mechanisms to finance health care?"
17712693,0,a,"Various studies indicate that school- or university-based HIV prevention curricula can reduce the prevalence of sexual risk behaviour among adolescent youth in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, effective HIV/AIDS prevention education may be problematic, if the needs of youth are not served adequately. To date, little attention has been given to the motivation of youth to learn about HIV/AIDS and about their preferences for HIV/AIDS curriculum design options. The aim of this study was to get insight into the determinants of the motivation of youth to learn about HIV/AIDS prevention and to assess their curriculum design preferences. Students from a university in Tigray, Ethiopia, filled out a structured questionnaire, which assessed demographics, variables that according to the Theory of Planned Behaviour are related to the motivation to learn, and their preferences for independent, carrier and integrated HIV/AIDS curriculum designs. On average, participants were highly motivated to learn about HIV/AIDS. Motivation to learn was primarily related to social norms and was not related to self-efficacy to discuss HIV/AIDS in class. The often discussed reluctance to discuss sexuality and condom use in curricula in Sub-Saharan Africa, seems to be more related to existing negative social norms, than to lack of self-efficacy. Participants revealed a high preference for the independent, carrier and integrated curriculum design options. However, students with a higher motivation to learn about HIV/AIDS were more attracted to the independent course design."
8221498,1,a,"In response to concern about social health problems in Northern Saskatchewan, a Working Group on Social Health was established in 1989 in the Research and Development Committee of Northern Medical Services. The Group formulated a concept of mental health in social terms; found and interpreted indicators of the extent of social health problems; identified major determinants of social health problems, barriers to effective coping and problems in providing adequate support and services; and identified strategies and program models that could be more effective in promoting social health in this region. Indicators of problems and underlying determinants are discussed, along with strategies for change. These strategies are based on a community development model, and incorporate innovation and reaffirmation of values and ways that have traditionally given people strength."
17903047,0,a,"BACKGROUND: To assess the inequity in seeking needed outpatient services in Iran and to investigate its influential factors. METHOD: The data were taken from a nation-wide Iranian health survey conducted in 2003. This study is based on individuals aged 15 years and over who had mentioned their need to seek outpatient care within two weeks prior to the day of the interview. The outcome was seeking needed outpatient care. The independent variables included respondents' age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, index of household economic status, health insurance status and residential place (urban vs. rural). RESULTS: Sixty-nine point five percent of those in need sought outpatient care. The rich (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.64 - 3.43) and the health insured (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.25 - 2.08), the pensioners and the retired (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.22 - 4.20), the housewives (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.07 - 2.95) were more likely to seek outpatient care than other occupations. On the other hand, people living in remote rural areas (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28 - 0.57) were less likely to seek their needed outpatient care than those living in main rural areas and urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: As in different parts of the world, differences in seeking needed healthcare still exist across different groups in Iran. Indeed, seeking outpatient care in Iran is related not only to health system functions--like health insurance and health facilities--but also on factors beyond the scope of health authorities such as economic status and occupation. This study can be instrumental for the recent five-year Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan of Iran which identified the reduction of inequalities in social determinants of health [corrected]"

18390066,0,a,"Breast cancer, the commonest malignancy in women, is now the most common cancer in Nigeria, but little is known about the quality of life (QOL) of Nigerian women breast cancer survivors and the predictive factors that may influence their QOL. Health-related QOL (HRQOL) was evaluated in 35 Nigerian women receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer at the University College Hospital, Ibadan by using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ - C30 version 3). Linear regression procedures were used to evaluate the association of HRQOL outcomes with medical and socio-demographic factors. Physical functioning (PF), Emotional functioning (EF) and Cognitive functioning (CF) scores were above average (76.9 +/- 20.6, 61.9 +/- 30.3 and 60.0 +/- 32.1 respectively) while Role functioning (RF) and Social functioning (SF) scores were below average (46.2 +/- 36.6 and 40.9 +/- 42.8 respectively). High symptom scale scores were recorded for fatigue, pain and financial difficulties (52.7 +/- 32.8, 59.1 +/- 34.4 and 71.4 +/- 38.8 respectively). Age had no significant influence on any of the functional and symptom scale scores as well as the overall QOL. The overall QOL was significantly related to PF, CF and SF. It was also significantly and inversely related to the scores of fatigue, nausea and vomitng, pain, insomnia and financial difficulty. The findings of this study provide important information on QOL and their correlates among Nigerian women undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer and are helpful in developing treatment strategies accordingly."
17371603,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Subjective risk factor perception is an important component of the motivation to change unhealthy life styles. While prior studies assessed cardiovascular risk factor knowledge, little is known about determinants of the individual perception of stroke risk. METHODS: Survey by mailed questionnaire among 1483 participants of a prior public stroke campaign in Germany. Participants had been informed about their individual stroke risk based on the Framingham stroke risk score. Stroke risk factor knowledge, perception of lifetime stroke risk and risk factor status were included in the questionnaire, and the determinants of good risk factor knowledge and high stroke risk perception were identified using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Overall stroke risk factor knowledge was good with 67-96% of the participants recognizing established risk factors. The two exceptions were diabetes (recognized by 49%) and myocardial infarction (57%). Knowledge of a specific factor was superior among those affected by it. 13% of all participants considered themselves of having a high stroke risk, 55% indicated a moderate risk. All major risk factors contributed significantly to the perception of being at high stroke risk, but the effects of age, sex and education were non-significant. Poor self-rated health was additionally associated with high individual stroke risk perception. CONCLUSION: Stroke risk factor knowledge was high in this study. The self perception of an increased stroke risk was associated with established risk factors as well as low perception of general health."
12481209,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The Russian mortality crisis of the early 1990s attracted considerable attention, but information on possible covariates of mortality is lacking, and concerns have been raised about the validity of official mortality data. To help elucidate the determinants of mortality, we examined whether indirect demographic techniques could be used to study mortality in countries such as the Russian Federation, where mortality data are inadequate, using input data independent from official vital statistics. METHODS: A national sample of the population was interviewed (n = 1600, response rate = 67%). Participants who had ever been married (82% of the sample) were asked about the date of birth and vital status of their first spouse. Spousal mortality was then estimated indirectly for the 531 men and 710 women for whom valid data were available. FINDINGS: The estimated risk of death between the ages of 35-69 years was 57% for male spouses and 17% for female spouses. Corresponding figures derived from national data for 1990 were 52% and 25% for the Russian Federation, and 31% and 20% for the United Kingdom. According to spouses' reports, 38% of their husbands died from cardiovascular disease, 22% from cancer, and 14% from injuries and accidents. Mortality of male spouses was inversely related to the education level of their wives, and the age-adjusted hazard ratios for death from all causes, compared to primary education, were 0.77 for secondary education and 0.57 for university education (trend P = 0.03). Mortality was also inversely related to ownership of household items, but not to size of settlement, pride in Russia, membership in the Soviet Communist Party, nationality or self-assessed social status. CONCLUSIONS: Although the indirect estimates were imprecise (partly owing to the small population size of the study), and mortality in women was probably underestimated (owing to many factors, including poorer reporting by males and high male mortality), our results are nevertheless consistent with the mortality pattern observed in official mortality data. The indirect technique thus appears to be a useful tool to study the determinants of mortality in the Russian Federation and other populations, where reliable or sufficiently extensive data are not available."
1558810,1,a,"In attempting to identify the determinants of teen pregnancy, researchers have focused on risk factors for young women, largely ignoring teen fathers. This study examines the educational antecedents of teen fatherhood using the 1958 National Child Development Study. Results suggest that those less than 20 years old at onset of fatherhood are much more likely than those who had not fathered a child by age 23 to have experienced academic difficulties and that such difficulties antedate teen fatherhood by as much as a decade. Variables measuring parents' lack of interest in their sons' education were strongly associated with the risk of teen fatherhood as were teachers' negative assessment of boys' academic ability, and the boys' own desire to terminate education as early as possible. Social class was modestly important in explaining differences in educational experiences for teen fathers and non-fathers."
12179049,1,a,"""The effect of agro-climatic factors on female age at marriage [in India] is studied by carrying out areal analysis of the 1981 Census data. The study found a close association between agricultural and climatic conditions in an area and corresponding female age at marriage. In general, women in Himalayan regions and coastal areas have higher age at marriage than most hinterland regions. Rainfall, altitude, forest area, land availability and productivity are observed to be associated with female age at marriage. In addition, female age at marriage in rural areas is found to be more sensitive to the agro-climatic conditions. It is hypothesized that with socio-economic and technological development, the agricultural and climatic factors are losing their grip on female age at marriage in India."""
8432376,1,a,"An analysis combining individual-level data from the National Survey of Family Growth with aggregate-level information provides evidence that the characteristics of communities influence the contraceptive decisions of currently married white women in the United States. The analysis examined the relationship between the average effectiveness level of the contraceptive methods that a woman used over a three-and-a-half-year period and community characteristics such as employment opportunities, the availability of contraceptive and abortion information and services, and the level of religious adherence in communities. Community characteristics associated with higher levels of contraceptive effectiveness were rapid population growth, high rates of unemployment, elevated levels of religious affiliation, high socioeconomic status, and ready access to family planning information and services. Community liberality was negatively associated with effective contraceptive use. The results support arguments that various community characteristics affect a woman's contraceptive choices by increasing or decreasing the costs of an unintended pregnancy."
15058797,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Mental health is a central determinant of quality of life. While psychiatric morbidity of populations has been studied extensively, the role of perceived stress, social support, and internal resources as determinant of health is still poorly understood. METHODS: We surveyed 2000 randomly selected university students. Perceived stress was measured by the Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument, social support by the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, internal resources (mastery and self-esteem) by a brief version of the Pearlin coping questionnaire. Linear regression models were used to explore the relationships between these variables and mental health, based on the SF-12 health survey. RESULTS: After two reminders, 1257 students answered the questionnaire. In bivariate analysis, mental health was negatively associated with stress and positively associated with internal resources and social support (all p-values < 0.001). In multiple regression analysis, internal resources were positively associated with mental health, and buffered the negative impact of stress on mental health. Internal resources and stress mediated the positive impact of social support on mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that perceived stress is an important risk factor for low mental health and suggest that mastery and self-esteem are important protective factors of mental health among young adults."

Although considering religious factors as a cause of population change, the research compares the BUA with other urban areas and relates developments in Belfast to some literature on sociospatial polarisation and the inverted question markunderclass'.... The results suggest that population change is not driven by explicitly religious factors, the relationship between religion and socio-economic well-being has changed, and that changes in religious mixing and segregation occur in many contexts.

19850895,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Riks-Stroke, the Swedish Stroke Register, was used to explore patient characteristics and stroke services as determinants of patient dissatisfaction with acute in-hospital care. METHODS: All 79 hospitals in Sweden admitting acute stroke patients participate in Riks-Stroke. During 2001 to 2007, 104,876 patients (87% of survivors) responded to a follow-up questionnaire 3 months after acute stroke; this included questions on satisfaction with various aspects of stroke care. RESULTS: The majority (>90%) were satisfied with acute in-hospital stroke care. Dissatisfaction was closely associated with outcome at 3 months. Patient who were dependent regarding activities of daily living, felt depressed, or had poor self-perceived general health were more likely to be dissatisfied. Dissatisfaction with global acute stroke care was linked to dissatisfaction with other aspects of care, including rehabilitation and support by community services. Patients treated in stroke units were less often dissatisfied than patients in general wards, as were patients who had been treated in a small hospital (vs medium or large hospitals) and patient who had participated in discharge planning. In multivariate analyses, the strongest predictor of dissatisfaction with acute care was poor outcome (dependency regarding activities of daily living, depressed mood, poor self-perceived health). CONCLUSIONS: Dissatisfaction with in-hospital acute stroke care is part of a more extensive complex comprising poor functional outcome, depressive mood, poor self-perceived general health, and dissatisfaction not only with acute care but also with health care and social services at large. Several aspects of stroke care organization are associated with a lower risk of dissatisfaction."

2354684,1,a,"One thousand seven hundred and fifty one Secondary school girls aged 12 to 19 years were interviewed by means of a self-administered questionnaire. 416 (23.8%), of them reported to have been sexually experienced at the time of the study. 4.1% of the sexually experienced girls had started sex below the age of 10 years, some of whom had been raped. The low and middle class private schools in the city centre had higher incidence of sexually experienced girls. The same was observed in those girls staying away from their parents. Majority of the sexually experienced girls had started coitus within one to two years of attaining menarche or having a boyfriend. Some of these girls may have been forced to indulge in sex by the men/boys or circumstances. Lack of factual knowledge, parental guidance and lust for material gains are some of the factors the girls felt may be responsible for the upsurge in adolescent sexual behaviour. The role played by these factors in adolescent sexuality is discussed, and possible remedial measures are suggested."
19204797,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) conducted the World Health Survey (WHS) between 2002 and 2004 in 70 countries to provide cross-population comparable data on health, health-related outcomes and risk factors. The aim of this study was to apply Grade of Membership (GoM) modelling as a means to condense extensive health information from the WHS into a set of easily understandable health profiles and to assign the degree to which an individual belongs to each profile. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This paper described the application of the GoM models to summarize population health status using World Health Survey data. Grade of Membership analysis is a flexible, non-parametric, multivariate method, used to calculate health profiles from WHS self-reported health state and health conditions. The WHS dataset was divided into four country economic categories based on the World Bank economic groupings (high, upper-middle, lower-middle and low income economies) for separate GoM analysis. Three main health profiles were produced for each of the four areas: I. Robust; II. Intermediate; III. Frail; moreover population health, wealth and inequalities are defined for countries in each economic area as a means to put the health results into perspective. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses have provided a robust method to better understand health profiles and the components which can help to identify healthy and non-healthy individuals. The obtained profiles have described concrete levels of health and have clearly delineated characteristics of healthy and non-healthy respondents. The GoM results provided both a useable way of summarising complex individual health information and a selection of intermediate determinants which can be targeted for interventions to improve health. As populations' age, and with limited budgets for additional costs for health care and social services, applying the GoM methods may assist with identifying higher risk profiles for decision-making and resource allocations."
18479518,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The overall number of involuntary admissions is increasing in many European countries. Patients with severe mental illnesses more often progress to stages in which acute, coercive treatment is warranted. The number of studies that have examined this development and possible consequences in terms of optimizing health care delivery in emergency psychiatry is small and have a number of methodological shortcomings. The current study seeks to examine factors associated with compulsory admissions in the Amsterdam region, taking into account a comprehensive model with four groups of predictors: patient vulnerability, social support, responsiveness of the health care system and treatment adherence. METHODS/DESIGN: This paper describes the design of the Amsterdam Study of Acute Psychiatry-I (ASAP-I). The study is a prospective cohort study, with one and two-year follow-up, comparing patients with and without forced admission by means of a selected nested case-control design. An estimated total number of 4,600 patients, aged 18 years and over, consecutively coming into contact with the Psychiatric Emergency Service Amsterdam (PESA) are included in the study. From this cohort, a randomly selected group of 125 involuntary admitted subjects and 125 subjects receiving non-coercive treatment are selected for further evaluation and comparison.First, socio-demographic, psychopathological and network characteristics, and prior use of health services will be described for all patients who come into contact with PESA. Second, the in-depth study of compulsory versus voluntary patients will examine which patient characteristics are associated with acute compulsory admission, also taking into account social network and healthcare variables. The third focus of the study is on the associations between patient vulnerability, social support, healthcare characteristics and treatment adherence in a two-year follow-up for patients with or without involuntarily admittance at the index consultation. DISCUSSION: The current study seeks to establish a picture of the determinants of acute compulsory admissions in the Netherlands and tries to gain a better understanding of the association with the course of illness and patient's perception of services and treatment adherence. The final aim is to find specific patient and health care factors that can be influenced by adjusting treatment programs in order to reduce the number of involuntary admissions."
1611411,1,a,"Persistent gambling was studied as a function of the reinforcement of arousal and winning during normal poker machine playing sessions. Play rate, heart rate, winnings, subjective excitement and expectations of winning were recorded for five male and five female high-frequency players. Autoregressive regression analysis indicated that wins affect play rate for up to three minutes, while effects of the other variables were inconsistent. Markov chain analysis confirmed that wins smaller than 50 credits tend to elevate play rate, while larger wins cause a breakdown in the otherwise very regular rate of play. Results are discussed in relation to the development of impaired control of gambling behaviour."
10972425,0,a,"The economic crisis in Thailand in July 1997 had major social implications for unemployment, under employment, household income contraction, changing expenditure patterns, and child abandonment. The crisis increased poverty incidence by 1 million, of whom 54% were the ultra-poor. This paper explores and explains the short-term health impact of the crisis, using existing data and some special surveys and interviews for 2 years during 1998-99. The health impacts of the crisis are mixed, some being negative and some being positive. Household health expenditure reduced by 24% in real terms; among the poorer households, institutional care was replaced by self-medication. The pre-crisis rising trend in expenditure on alcohol and tobacco consumption was reversed. Immunization spending and coverage were sustained at a very high level after the crisis, but reports of increases in diphtheria and pertussis indicate declining programme quality. An increase in malaria, despite budget increases, had many causes but was mainly due to reduced programme effectiveness. STD incidence continued the pre-crisis downward trend. Rates of HIV risky sexual behaviour were higher among conscripts than other male workers, but in both groups there was lower condom use with casual partners. HIV serosurveillance showed a continuation of the pre-crisis downward trend among commercial sex workers (CSW, both brothel and non-brothel based), pregnant women and donated blood; this trend was slightly reversed among male STD patients and more among intravenous drug users. Condom coverage among brothel based CSW continued to increase to 97.5%, despite a 72% budget cut in free condom distribution. Poverty and lack of insurance coverage are two major determinants of absence of or inadequate antenatal care, and low birthweight. The Low Income Scheme could not adequately cover the poor but the voluntary Health Card Scheme played a health safety net role for maternal and child health. Low birthweight and underweight among school children were observed during the crisis. The impact of the crisis on health was minimal in some sectors but not in the others if the pre-crisis condition is efficient and healthy and vice versa. We demonstrated some key health status parameters during the 2-year period after the 1997 crisis but do not have firm conclusions on the impact of the economic crisis on health status, as our observation is too short and there is uncertainty on how long the crisis will last."
12406469,0,a,"While there is a large and growing literature investigating the relationship between an individual's employment status and health, considerably less is known about the effect on this relationship of the context in which unemployment occurs. The aim of this paper is test for the presence and nature of contextual effects in the ways unemployment and health are related, based on a simple underlying model of stress, social support and health using a large population health survey. An individual's health can be influenced directly by own exposure to unemployment and by exposure to unemployment in the individual's context, and indirectly by the effects these exposures have on the relationship between other health determinants and health. Based on this conceptualization an empirical model, using multi-level analysis, is formulated that identifies a five-stage process for exploring these complex pathways through which unemployment affects health. Results showed that the association of individual unemployment with perceived health is statistically significant. Nevertheless, this study did not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the association of unemployment with health status depends upon whether the experience of unemployment is shared with people living in the same environment. Above all, this study demonstrates both the subtlety and complexity of individual- and contextual-level influences on the health of individuals. Our results caution against simplistic interpretations of the unemployment-health relationship and reinforce the importance of using multi-level statistical methods for investigation of it."
15156843,0,a,"Health-related behavior is a function of the sociocultural and environmental contexts in which it occurs. With South Asian immigrants, a comprehensive approach that focuses on community and individual factors may be more effective than an individualistic one. This article explores the factors that may influence HIV/AIDS-related health care seeking by South Asian immigrants to the United States. It focuses on South Asians from Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. The need to involve the community in any intervention process is discussed. An understanding of the determinants of HIV-related health care seeking and behavioral change factors can help social work practitioners develop effective interventions for and with South Asian immigrants."
10926127,0,a,"The aim of this study was to evaluate possible changes in predisposing factors in sexual preventive behaviors that could result from the availability of an efficient new antiretroviral therapy. A total of 136 young adults were randomly assigned a vignette to read describing AIDS as a lethal or chronic disease. After reading the vignette, the participants completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial determinants of intention to use a condom with a new sexual partner. The variables were measured according to Ajzen's (1985, 1988, 1991) theory of planned behavior and Triandis's (1977) theory of interpersonal behavior. The experimental manipulation was more successful when the disease was described as lethal (66 of the 68 subjects) rather than chronic (30 of the 68 subjects). For the 96 participants who correctly identified the expected outcome of the disease presented in the vignette, a significant difference in intention was found between the two experimental situations (p < .05). Regression of intention to use condoms on the psychosocial variables yielded an adjusted R2 of .62. Perceived behavioral control, social norms, personal normative belief and anticipated affective reaction were the significant variables explaining this intention. The results suggest that intention to use condoms with a new sexual partner is likely to be modified by the expected outcome of the disease, that is, whether lethal or chronic. Thus, it is suggested that interventions aimed at young adults take into account the impacts the new antiretroviral treatments are likely to have on preventive behaviors."
17531746,0,a,"Despite rhetorical attention there is little programmatic guidance as to how best to ensure that women and men living with HIV have access to sexual and reproductive health services that help them realise their reproductive goals, while ensuring their human rights. A dynamic relationship exists between the manner in which health services and programmes are delivered, and the individuals who seek these services. A review of the literature shows clear gaps and highlights areas of concern not yet sufficiently addressed. The delivery and use of health services and programmes is shaped by the underlying determinants of people's access to and use of these services, the health systems in place at community and country level, and the legal and policy environment these systems operate in. Few governments can provide the full range of services that might be required by their populations. In most places, people access health services from a variety of formal and informal providers, and health-related behaviour is influenced from many directions. The synergistic roles of health systems, law and policy and underlying social determinants in helping or hindering the development and delivery of adequate programmes and services for HIV positive people must be addressed."
9257397,1,a,"Quality of life (QofL) has emerged as a new outcome paradigm. It is now the endpoint in various taxonomies of patient outcomes, in which relationships are modeled amongst biological abnormalities, symptom status, functional status, disability, health perceptions and quality of life. Although current models and taxonomies point at important determinants of QofL, they do not provide a heuristic that guides the conceptualization of QofL and the systematic development of an explanatory theory of how ill health affects QofL. General mechanisms linking ill health, behavior, and QofL are lacking. In this paper we propose social production function (SPF) theory as providing such a heuristic, relating the effects of ill health, the activities that patients engage in to maintain QofL, and QofL itself. This theory basically asserts that people produce their own well-being by trying to optimize achievement of universal human goals via six instrumental goals within the environmental and functional limitations they are facing. Three important notions of SPF theory are: (1) the linkages between goals, needs, and well-being; (2) the distinction between universal needs and instrumental goals; and (3) substitution among instrumental goals, activities and endowments according to cost-benefit considerations, whereby costs refer to scarce resources such as functional capacity, time, effort and money. We will argue that SPF theory meaningfully relates the ""biomedical model""-with its focus on pathological processes and biological, physiological and clinical outcomes-to the ""quality of life"" model, with its focus on functioning and well-being. We describe SPF theory and how SPF theory can be used to: (1) operationally define and measure QofL; (2) clarify persistent measurement problems; and (3) develop an explanatory framework of the effects of disease on QofL. In the discussion section, we address the limitations of the SPF approach of QofL and its relationship with personality."
9696119,1,a,"The current study set out to investigate the structure, determinants, and relationship between lay theories of the etiology and efficacy of ""cures"" for four types of paraphilia: fetishism, pedophilia, sexual sadism, and voyeurism. One hundred and five participants completed a four-part questionnaire, which was divided into (a) demographic details, (b) perceptions of the etiology, (c) ratings of cure for each paraphilia, and (d) the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Previous studies of lay theories have demonstrated a clear and interpretable factor structure similar to that of explicit academic theories, as well as a clear and logical relationship between perceived etiology and cure. A similar structure was expected to emerge in this study, together with positive correlations between the various factors and personality type. A factor analysis revealed a clear and logical factor structure for etiology and cure items. Further, etiology and cure factors correlated strongly with each other but only moderately with demographic details and personality differences. These findings are discussed in relation to growing literature in the field."
19195421,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To explore knowledge, attitudes and behaviours regarding caloric soft drinks in a group of young adults attending university and to identify opportunities for a health promotion intervention aimed at reducing consumption. DESIGN: In-depth, semi-structured focus groups segmented by gender. SETTING: Sydney, Australia. SUBJECTS: Undergraduate University of Sydney students aged 18-30 years (n 35). RESULTS: Social and environmental cues, intrinsic qualities of beverages and personal health beliefs were identified as important influences on consumption. Social cues included settings in which alcohol is usually consumed, socialising with friends, and family influences. Environmental cues included purchasing of fast foods, and ready availability, preferential pricing and promotion of caloric beverages. Reinforcing intrinsic qualities of caloric soft drinks included taste, sugar and caffeine content, and their association with treats and rewards. Major gender differences as well as variations in individual readiness for behaviour change were observed. Raising awareness of the sugar content of various beverages and the potential health impacts associated with their consumption was considered important. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide new insights with important implications for policy and practice, and suggest that there is considerable scope for promoting awareness in this group. Carefully designed social marketing campaigns highlighting the health issues and addressing social and environmental cues relating to caloric soft drink consumption are required. There is a need for gender-differentiated intervention programmes which are both informational and appealing to young adults. Further research is warranted, particularly to investigate beverage consumption relating to fast-food meal deals and young adults' consumption patterns in more depth."
9360741,1,a,"The self-esteem and fear of negative evaluation of 77 fan-club members age 16 or below and 128 age-equivalent secondary school students who had never joined a fan club were investigated. Consistent with common observations, fan-club respondents were mostly females. Significant differences were found between the two samples. Logistic regression analysis showed that being a fan-club member was associated with poor self-esteem and strong fear of negative evaluation, while the bias toward females in the fan-club sample could be attributed to the effects of these two variables."
9589525,1,a,"The aim of this study was to assess and compare spinal cord injured (SCI) and traumatic brain injured (TBI) persons and people from the general population concerning partner relationships, functioning, mood and global quality of life. One hundred and sixty seven SCI persons, 92 TBI persons and 264 controls participated in the study. The median age was: SCI persons 33 years (range 19 to 79 years), TBI persons 40 years (range 20 to 70 years), and controls 31 years (range 19 to 79 years). Age at injury ranged among SCI persons from 14 to 76 years (Md 28 years), and among TBI persons from 16 to 56 years (Md 32 years). Half of the SCI group (51%), 58% of the TBI group and 59% of the controls had a stable partner relationship at the time of the investigation. Many of these SCI and TBI relationships (38% and 55% respectively) were established after injury. Both SCI and TBI persons showed significantly more depressive feelings compared with the controls. Perceived quality of life (global QL rating) was significantly lower in the SCI group compared with the controls, whereas the ratings of TBI persons and controls did not differ significantly. SCI and TBI persons did not differ significantly in level of education, perceived quality of life or distress. In all three groups, global quality-of-life ratings were significantly lower among single persons compared to those with a partner relationship. It was concluded that both SCI and TBI appear to affect overall quality of life and mental well-being negatively. The number of partner relationships contracted after injury among both SCI and TBI persons indicates, however, that the injury is not a major barrier to establishing close partner relationships. Being in good spirits, that is, lack of depressive feelings has a profound impact on the perception of a high quality of life in all three groups. For the SCI and TBI persons, a high level of physical and social independence were further positive determinants of a perceived high quality of life."
18365511,0,a,"Loneliness is an indicator of social well-being and pertains to the feeling of missing an intimate relationship (emotional loneliness) or missing a wider social network (social loneliness). The 11-item De Jong Gierveld scale has proved to be a valid and reliable measuring instrument for overall, emotional and social loneliness, although its length has sometimes rendered it difficult to use the scale in large surveys. In this study, we empirically tested a shortened version of the scale on data from two surveys (N=9448). Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the specification of two latent factors. Congruent validity and the relationship with determinants (partner status, health) proved to be optimal. The 6-item De Jong Gierveld scale is a reliable and valid measuring instrument for overall, emotional and social loneliness, which is suitable for large surveys."
1949101,1,a,"Data collected in the 1982 Sri Lanka Contraceptive Prevalence Survey and the 1985 Sri Lanka Contraceptive Survey, a follow-up study, were used to examine the reliability of respondents' preferences for additional children. At the aggregate level, consistency was remarkable: In 1982, 47 percent of women said they wanted more children and in 1985, 49 percent had more, for a slight excess of actual over wanted fertility. Even though inconsistencies existed, at the individual level preferences were moderately predictive of subsequent behavior. Unwanted fertility was related not only to the demographic characteristics of the women but also to disagreement with their husbands on desired fertility. More of those who believed that their husbands wanted additional children than those who believed otherwise reported births in the follow-up period. Nonusers of contraception were over three times more likely than contraceptors using modern methods to have had an unwanted birth."
1423121,1,a,"In recent formulations of the concept of health promotion, such as Achieving Health for All and the Ottawa Charter, emphasis is clearly placed on comprehensivity and the integration of individual and social determinants of health, broadly defined. This paper is premised on the observation that despite evidence of a paradigm shift in the way we talk about health promotion at a conceptual level, we have yet to properly articulate a 'new' research methodology to accompany the 'new' health promotion. The paper has three main sections. First, some of the limitations and contradictions that separate the rhetoric of health promotion from its current operationalization in research practice are discussed. In asserting the inherent links between theory, methodology and method, the need for a new research paradigm is demonstrated. In the second section, seven key issues derived from the literature on sociological theory are identified and discussed in terms of their implications for choosing a new research methodology for health promotion. In the third section it is suggested that using these issue areas as a 'decision map' leads to the selection of a preferred strategy which brings together both interpretive and critical perspectives to bear on our understanding of social reality as it affects health. Elements of both of these approaches and the nature of their potential complimentarity are considered. Throughout these deliberations the reader is encouraged to consider the potentially conservative or activist orientations that alternate methodologies imply, and to critically evaluate how these mesh with the emerging rhetoric of fostering empowerment that is the cornerstone of the 'new' health promotion."
7580231,1,a,"Despite addiction theorists' acknowledgment of the impact of environmental factors on relapse, researchers have not adequately investigated these influences. Ninety-six substance users provided data regarding their perceived risk for relapse, exposure to substances, and involvement in reinforcing activities. These three setting attributes were assessed in their home, work, and community settings. Reuse was assessed 3 months later. When controlling for confounding variables, aspects of the home settings significantly distinguished abstainers from reusers; perceived risk for relapse was the strongest predictor of reuse. Exposure to substances and involvement in reinforcing activities were not robust reuse indicators. The work and community settings were not significant determinants of reuse. These findings offer some initial support for the utility of examining social settings to better understand addiction relapse and recovery. Identification of setting-based relapse determinants provides concrete targets for relapse prevention interventions."
8784533,1,a,"With the onset of science-based medicine in the mid-19th century, environmental factors were almost totally discarded as health determinants. This was a complete rupture with the medical thinking which had prevailed since the time of Hippocrates. Yet, for the vast majority of mankind, harmony with environmental reality remains the most important determinant of good or ill health. This scission explains to a great extent the differences between traditional and Western medicine, which are based on entirely different concepts and on distinct paradigms. Environment as a health determinant--in its broadest definition to include both physical and social environments--is again being considered of importance as a result of better understanding of causality factors, and because of the influence of disciplines such as ecology and epidemiology. Here we show that human societies can develop different methods of adjusting to their environments, some of which would increase the risks of disease and others which can be considered as resistance factors of a social nature. Societies and individuals alike are not equal in relation to health risks."

The National Institutes of Health-sponsored Centers for Population Health and Health Disparities are the first federal initiative to support transdisciplinary multilevel research on the determinants of health disparities. Their novel research approach combines population, clinical, and basic science to elucidate the complex determinants of health disparities. The centers are partnering with community-based, public, and quasi-public organizations to disseminate scientific findings and guide clinical practice in communities. In turn, communities and public health agents are shaping the research. The relationships forged through these complex collaborations increase the likelihood that the centers' scientific findings will be relevant to communities and contribute to reductions in health disparities."
18314472,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Wage losses after breast cancer may result in considerable financial burden. Their assessment is made more urgent because more women now participate in the workforce and because breast cancer is managed using multiple treatment modalities that could lead to long work absences. We evaluated wage losses, their determinants, and the associations between wage losses and changes for the worse in the family's financial situation among Canadian women over the first 12 months after diagnosis of early breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study among women with breast cancer from eight hospitals throughout the province of Quebec. Information that permitted the calculation of wage losses and information on potential determinants of wage losses were collected by three pretested telephone interviews conducted over the year following the start of treatment. Information on medical characteristics was obtained from medical records. The main outcome was the proportion of annual wages lost because of breast cancer. Multivariable analysis of variance using the general linear model was used to identify personal, medical, and employment characteristics associated with the proportion of wages lost. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Among 962 eligible breast cancer patients, 800 completed all three interviews. Of these, 459 had a paying job during the month before diagnosis. On average, these working women lost 27% of their projected usual annual wages (median = 19%) after compensation received had been taken into account. Multivariable analysis showed that a higher percentage of lost wages was statistically significantly associated with a lower level of education (P(trend) = .0018), living 50 km or more from the hospital where surgery was performed (P = .070), lower social support (P = .012), having invasive disease (P = .086), receipt of chemotherapy (P < .001), self-employment (P < .001), shorter tenure in the job (P(trend) < .001), and part-time work (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Wage losses and their effects on financial situation constitute an important adverse consequence of breast cancer in Canada."
18163221,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study involved a naturalistic, prospective project assessing objective and subjective dimensions of quality of life (QoL) and the range of its putative determinants in first-episode schizophrenia. METHODS: Seventy-four patients, mean age 24.7 years, participated in the study. The patients were assessed 1 month following the first hospitalisation (Time 1), 12 months later (Time 2), and 4-6 years after Time 1 (Time 3). The Social Functioning Scale and World Health Organisation Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) were applied to evaluate objective and subjective QoL, respectively. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was used to examine psychopathological status, and the Global Assessment Scale was applied to evaluate social adjustment prior to hospitalisation. RESULTS: The objective and subjective QoL was relatively low at Time 1. Over time, the objective QoL improved in three domains, decreased in one domain, and remained stable in three domains. The subjective QoL did not change. The most important predictors of both dimensions of QoL were psychopathology and duration of untreated psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Because psychopathology seems to have the greatest impact on the QoL, there is a need to develop community psychosocial treatment to reduce these symptoms and to support patients in the early phase of the disease."
14681279,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Having regained its political autonomy in 1991, Estonia experienced major changes in political, economic, and social realities. We aimed to analyse mortality changes by education from 1989 to 2000 in order to assess the impact of recent changes in Estonia, as well as the delayed effects of pre-transitional developments. METHODS: Two census-based analyses were compared. Individual cause-specific death data for those aged 20+ for 1987-1990 (72 003 deaths) and 1999-2000 (35 477 deaths) came from the national mortality database. Population denominators came from the population censuses of 1989 and 2000. Mortality for all causes combined and for selected causes of death were analysed for high, mid, and low educational groups. The absolute differences in mortality were evaluated through life expectancy at age 25 and age-standardized mortality rates. To assess the relative differences between educational levels, mortality rate ratios with 95% CI were calculated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Educational differences in mortality increased tremendously from 1989 to 2000: over the 10-year period life expectancy improved considerably for graduates, and worsened for those with the lowest education. In 2000, male graduates aged 25 could expect to live 13.1 years longer than corresponding men with the lowest education; among women the difference was 8.6 years. Large differences were observed in all selected causes of death in 1989 and in 2000 and the trends were invariably much more favourable for the higher educated. Educational differences in total mortality increased in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Social disruption and increasing inequalities in wealth can be considered main recent determinants; however, causal processes, shaped decades before recent reforms, also contribute to this widening gap."
18265961,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Possible interactions between nervous and immune systems during opioid addiction remain elusive. Recombinant mu-delta opioid receptors (MDOR) and the glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) subunit of amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid glutamate receptors are involved in acute and chronic effects of morphine. Elevated levels of autoantibodies (aAbs) to these receptors were demonstrated in heroin human addicts and in animal models. This study characterized the role of aAbs to these receptors in behavioral modulations recruited during opioid tolerance and sensitization. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Male CD-1 mice, immunized with either MDOR or GluR1 peptide fragments (80 microg intraperitoneal (i.p.)), were examined for spontaneous behavior and response to morphine (5 mg/kg i.p.). Spontaneous home-cage activity, novelty-induced self-grooming and morphine-induced hyperactivity were higher in GluR1 mice compared to Vehicle subjects, whereas MDOR immunization was associated with an increased morphine-induced conditioned place preference. In response to escalating doses of morphine (from 10 to 60 mg/kg i.p., twice daily) and naloxone-precipitated withdrawal (1 mg/kg subcutaneous), GluR1 mice exhibited a more marked stereotyped sniffing behavior and less body tremors compared to Vehicle subjects, whereas less sniffing and teeth chattering were found in MDOR mice. The expected downregulation of mu receptor binding sites, induced by chronic morphine in vehicle subjects, was completely absent following MDOR immunization. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate an altered response to morphine-related reinforcing and aversive effects in MDOR mice and altered coping with the environment in GluR1 mice. Circulating aAbs to specific neuroreceptors may alter the response to opiates and play a role as determinants of vulnerability to opiate addiction."
11404202,0,a,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) continue to be a significant and prevalent problem among adolescents. One in four sexually active teenagers are infected with one or more STDs. Certain STDs, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and possibly human papillomavirus infections have the highest prevalence in this age group. The determinants of risk for STDs in adolescence encompass a range of behavioral, biological, and social factors. This review focuses on the skin signs of STDs in adolescents. Recognition of these findings is important since they may represent the most prominent, earliest, or only evidence of an STD. The recognition of the non-AIDs STDs has the added importance of identifying a population at high risk for HIV infection. Although recent data suggest encouraging trends in sexual risk behaviors among high school students in the United States, great challenges remain in the efforts to expand primary and secondary prevention strategies for STDs in adolescents. Expertise in the recognition and treatment of STDs in adolescents remains important for clinicians who care for adolescents."

8601115,1,a,"There is a sharp divide in mortality between eastern and western Europe, which has largely developed over the past three decades and is caused mainly by chronic diseases in adulthood. The difference in life expectancy at birth between the best and worst European countries in this respect is more than 10 years for both sexes. The reasons for these differences in mortality are not clear and data currently available permit only speculation. The contributions of medical care and pollution are likely to be modest; health behaviour, diet, and alcohol consumption seem to be more important; smoking seems to have the largest impact. There is also evidence that psychosocial factors are less favourable in eastern Europe. Available data show socioeconomic gradients in all cause mortality within eastern European countries similar to those in the West. Determinants of the mortality gap between eastern and western Europe are probably related to the contrast in their social environments and may be similar to those underlying the social gradients in mortality within countries."
8184324,1,a,"In the past several decades China has witnessed an unprecedented decline in infant and child mortality. While China's success in reducing infant and child mortality has been ascribed to the unusual level of government intervention, there is evidence that change and variation have been, and are, influenced by socioeconomic conditions, familial relations as well as biosocial determinants. This study investigates these influences using retrospective report from 1985 survey in Shaanxi province. The study reveals that social revolution in Chinese families is the mediating force linking the broad societal forces and biosocial determinants with infant mortality; whereas social transformation of the Chinese society has a consistent effect on infant as well as child mortality."
11236399,0,a,"The privatization, or individualization, of risk factor knowledge has been largely responsible for a rising tide of criticism of epidemiology. The current debate seems polarized into 2 sides, those who support and those who attack ""risk factor"" epidemiology. This commentary aims to reinvigorate some of Geoffrey Rose's central arguments and show that this debate may miss a key point: a risk factor is a probabilistic concept that applies to an aggregate of individuals, not to a specific individual. Risk factor knowledge compels those in public health to seek actions that shift population distributions of these factors and, to do so, to understand their social, economic, and political determinants. The author links Rose's qualitative distinction between the causes of cases and the causes of incidence to an examination of the conceptual and quantitative limits of ""individual risk"" estimation. The attempt to predict individuals' futures on the basis of risk factor profile is especially prominent now with breast cancer. The author suggests reasons why a policy promoting private decision making about risk, while likely ineffective from a population standpoint, is viewed as the only feasible primary prevention option against this disease."
19191176,0,a,"PURPOSE: International and national programs to control vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD) among children in developing countries are reducing the magnitude but VADD still occurs in deprived populations. The purpose of the study was to estimate the prevalence of and identify risk factors for xerophthalmia in children aged 6-71 months living in slums in Pune, India in 2003. METHODS: Children were enrolled into a cross sectional study from randomly selected Anganwadis (kindergartens) in selected slums using proportional to size sampling. Parents/caregivers were interviewed by social workers about night blindness, risk factors for VADD at individual and household levels, intake of vitamin A rich foods, and history of vitamin A supplementation. Children were examined for signs of xerophthalmia by an ophthalmologist. Risk factors for xerophthalmia were explored using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: 1,589 children were examined (response rate 80.2%) 22 of whom had xerophthalmia, prevalence 1.32% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.88%). There were no gender differences. Independent risk factors for xerophthalmia were having an illiterate mother [Odds ratio [OR]15.4 (95% CI 4.4-64.1)] and lack of a safe water supply [OR 6.11, 95% CI 2.5-5.1)]. Only 11.3 and 13.3% of children in different slums had taken vitamin A supplements. CONCLUSIONS: Xerophthalmia was at a level of public health significance in children living in slums in Pune. This study highlights the importance of female education and indicates that vitamin A supplementation and other approaches to control need to be improved in children living in deprived areas like urban slums."
8907736,1,a,"This study examined both the content of school district programs related to sexual orientation, and the social and political determinants of these school programs. Data were collected from districts within all 126 U.S. communities with legal protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and from a random sample of 129 U.S. jurisdictions without such legislation. Results showed that most school districts are not offering recommended program elements related to sexual orientation issues. Districts within localities with gay rights protection are doing more than those without. Although compositional factors account for some of the differences in educational efforts, a politically engaged constituency also made a major difference in school district efforts. To the extent that gays and lesbians served in local public office and mobilized to influence school elections, they were able to affect school programs and policies."
15353189,0,a,"The role of lifestyle in mediating the relationship between socio-economic characteristics and health has been discussed extensively in the epidemiological and economic literatures. Previous analyses have not considered a formal framework incorporating unobservable heterogeneity. In this paper, we develop a simple economic model in which health is determined (partially) by lifestyle, which depends on preferences, budget and time constraints and unobservable characteristics. We estimate a recursive empirical specification consisting of a health production function and reduced forms for the lifestyle equations using Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL) for a multivariate probit (MVP) model with discrete indicators of lifestyle choices and self-assessed health (SAH) on British panel data from the 1984 and 1991 Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS). We find that sleeping well, exercising, and not smoking in 1984 have dramatic positive effects on the probability of reporting excellent or good SAH in 1991, and that these effects are much larger having accounted for endogeneity. The failure of epidemiological analyses to account for unobserved heterogeneity can explain their low estimates of the relevance of lifestyle in the socio-economic status-health relationship. Indicators for prudent alcohol consumption and eating breakfast in 1984 are not found to be statistically significant determinants of SAH in 1991."
16732741,0,a,"The aim of this study was to test whether the association between disability and depressive symptoms in patients with cervicogenic headache is similar to that found in primary headaches or to the pattern found in low back pain. During a 2-year period, 716 consecutive patients with the clinical diagnosis of cervicogenic headache (n=182), low back pain (n=116), migraine (n=231), tension-type headache (n=176), and cluster headache (n=11) filled in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Disability was scored by the migraine disability score questionnaire reflecting the number of days with lost or decreased work, household and social activities. Non-parametric tests and multiple general regression were used for statistical analysis. In multivariate testing, significant independent determinants of disability were pain frequency, pain intensity and the severity of depressive symptoms in migraine and tension-type headache; pain frequency and the BDI score in cervicogenic headache, and pain frequency alone in low back pain. Disability is related to pain frequency in all pain syndromes evaluated in the present study. The level of disability is associated with the severity of pain only in primary headaches, but not in pain syndromes of vertebral origin (cervicogenic headache and low back pain). Disability is associated with the severity of depressive symptoms in all headache types but not in low back pain. Both the location and the etiology of pain have importance in determining the interrelationship between pain characteristics, depression and disability."

9690286,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This work was aimed at identifying differences in HIV and HCV risk behaviors among intravenous drug users (IDUs) according to the gender and their determinants. METHODS: IDUs over 18 years, having had sexual intercourse and able to answer the questionnaire were interviewed in 10 drug abuse treatment centers or social institutions using a questionnaire adapted from the one used in the survey of sexual lifestyle in France. RESULTS: Over 612 eligible IDUs, 595 completed the questionnaire (women: 29%);37% had multiple partners with no difference according to the gender; 14% of the women and 7% of the men reported trading sex. More women reported inconsistent condom use (46% vs. 55%) and inconsistent clean equipment use (65% vs. 73%). A younger age, independently associated to sharing equipment (men: OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.90-0.99; women: OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.85-0.99) and inconsistent HIV serology testing, independently associated to inconsistent condom use (men: OR = 3.36; 95% CI = 2.02-5.60; women: OR = 10.72; 95% CI = 3.18-36.18), were the only risk markers common to both genders. For women, being HIV negative increased the risk of inconsistent condom use. Low educational level increased the risk of inconsistent clean equipment use. No risk marker among those analyzed was associated to having had multiple partners. For men, low socioeconomic status markers, a steady sexual partner or not living in couple and educational level were associated with sexual risk behaviors (inconsistent condom use and having multiple partners); low socioeconomic status markers were associated with injecting risk behaviors (inconsistent clean equipment use and sharing). CONCLUSIONS: Women were more likely to have both sexual and injecting risk behaviors; their significant risk markers are less numerous thus harm reduction could be more difficult than for men."
19766946,0,a,"PURPOSE: To empirically quantify the role of peer social networks in explaining smoking behavior among adolescents. We follow adolescents over time to examine whether the role of adolescent peers persists in affecting individual behaviors as adolescents transition into adulthood. METHODS: Using longitudinal data of a nationally representative sample of adolescents we use a multivariate structural model with school-level fixed effects to account for the problems of contextual effects, correlated effects, and peer selections to purge the potential biases from the estimates of peer influence. Our peer group measures are drawn not only from the nomination of close friends but also from classmates. Smoking prevalence among the peer groups were constructed using the peers' own reports of their cigarette consumption. RESULTS: Controlling for parent level characteristics and other demographic parameters, we find that a 10% increase in the proportion of classmates who smoke will increase the likelihood of smoking by more than 3%. Also, an increase in smoking rates among an individual's close friends by 10% will increase the likelihood of smoking by 5%. We find evidence to show that the influence of close friends from adolescence years continue to have an impact on smoking propensities even when a transition into adulthood is made. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the literature reporting that peer effects are important determinants of smoking even after controlling for potential biases in the data and that these effects persist into adulthood. Effective policy aimed at reducing smoking rates among adolescents would consider these long-lasting peer effects."
19344503,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Few research projects have analyzed how social determinants of health impact cities in North Africa. The sustained growth in these countries has nevertheless proven to exacerbate health disparities and create many social and economic inequalities. This strategic analysis examines selected social determinants of health in a major urban centre of Tunisia, identifies the most influential stakeholders able to influence equity/inequity, and reviews the accomplishments and need for action to foster health equity. METHODS: This analysis was performed through a literature review and participatory research methods that included focus groups discussions and interview with key informants. RESULTS: Access to health care, changes in lifestyles, housing issues and gender-related inequities are prime, socially-determined elements that affect health in Ariana. CONCLUSION: Recognition of emerging health issues is needed along with improved inter and intrasectoral coordination among stakeholders. The community-participatory approach used in this paper proved to be a useful scoping technique for this setting. A similar methodology could be used by other researchers as a first step toward health equity action at a city level."
1503072,1,a,"A 14-y follow-up of 581 children who took part in a randomized controlled trial of the effect of a milk supplement on growth of children was conducted to investigate the supplement's effect on adult bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD). BMC and BMD of the nondominant forearm were measured by single-photon absorptiometry in 371 subjects (64%) aged 20-23 y, at a proximal site (shaft of radius and ulna) and at a distal site near the wrist. BMCs and BMDs tended to be higher in the intervention group (NS). Cross-sectionally, BMD was positively associated with body weight (P less than 0.01) in both sexes; inversely associated with alcohol consumption (P less than 0.05), and positively with manual occupation (NS) in men; positively associated with current intakes of calcium (P less than 0.05), vitamin D (P less than 0.01), and sports activity during adolescence (P less than 0.01), and inversely with parity (NS) in women. In multiple linear-regression analysis body weight and sports activity during adolescence were stronger determinants of female BMD than was diet."
8771926,1,a,"Despite the vast amount of literature on the relationship between social class and health, little work has been done on postretirement populations. Using the 1991 General Social Survey, a sample of respondents (N = 1,943) aged 65 to 99 were selected for analysis. Three social class variables, income adequacy, education and occupation, were used along with several lifestyle variables and demographic controls to predict six different measures of health status. The findings supported a ""condition-specific"" approach to the study of class differences in morbidity. Income adequacy was the most consistent class predictor of these health measures in this sample. As well, 'risky' lifestyle variables were used to test the hypothesis that such factors may mediate the relationship between class and health. This hypothesis was not well supported in these data."
1293861,1,a,"This report examines Malaysian women's perceptions of the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding, the determinants of their perceptions, and any effect these perceptions might have on nursing duration and contraceptive use. The report also considers whether women are consciously replacing breastfeeding with modern contraceptive methods. Data from the 1976 Malaysian Family Life Survey are analyzed, and the author concludes that Malaysian women do perceive that breastfeeding has a contraceptive effect, but that this perception is not universal. Ethnicity and desire for a particular family size are the most significant determinants of this perception. Finally, Malaysian women's recognition of the contraceptive effect of nursing does not influence either the duration of their breastfeeding or their adoption of contraception. Malaysian women may not be abandoning breastfeeding to adopt contraception. More probably, breastfeeding declines and contraceptive prevalence increases with modernization."
18156100,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Sex (referring to the strict biological sense) and gender (referring to the sociocultural dimension) are major determinants of health and disease. OBJECTIVE: This review examines similarities and differences between the sexes in the prevalence of osteoporosis and fractures, bone- and fall-related risk factors for incident fractures, and the possibilities of fracture prevention, as well as gender differences in the perception of osteoporosis. METHODS: We reviewed recent English-language publications on sex and gender differences in the context of osteoporosis and fracture risk. We refer to several reviews that provide extensive reference lists on the topics discussed. RESULTS: The incidence of fractures is higher in boys than in girls. The burden of fractures in adults increases with age, and it starts earlier and is higher in adult women than in adult men. With life expectancy increasing, the annual number of fractures is likely to increase substantially. Fractures in adults contribute to increased mortality (more in men than in women), increased morbidity (equal in men and women), and high costs (greater for women than for men). Adult men experience fewer fractures than women do. Men build larger bones with better microarchitecture while they are growing and thereafter have less increase in bone remodeling. Furthermore, they develop bone loss at a later age. Compared with their female counterparts, fewer older men are hypogonadic, and life expectancy is shorter for men than for women. There are multiple reasons for the differences in the incidences of fractures between men and women, related to the many factors associated with both bone and falls that influence fracture risk from the molecular and cellular level to the organ level. Sex hormones play a central and essential role in the physiology of bone by direct and indirect mechanisms (eg, by interfering with the growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 axis). Case-finding strategies to identify patients at highest risk for fractures, including bone densitometry and clinical risk factors, are much better documented at the population level in women than in men. Drug therapies that reduce the risk of a broad spectrum of fractures, even in the short term, are more clearly demonstrated in randomized controlled studies in women than in men. Drug therapy is more widely available for women with osteoporosis,but it is rarely given to men with osteoporosis. Differences in the perception of osteoporosis between men and women are even less well documented. CONCLUSIONS: In general, osteoporosis is underdiagnosed and undertreated in women but even more so in men, and is related to limits in the patient's and the physician's awareness at all clinical stages, from case finding to compliance with and persistence of therapy. Furthermore, the lay perception of a healthy lifestyle, the level of social isolation, networking within the health care system, and opportunities for screening appear to contribute to gender differences in participating in osteoporosis prevention and therapy. These aspects of health care deserve further attention and research."
11594699,0,a,"This is a study of psychosocial outcomes of adolescents born to teenage mothers. Adolescents'problem behaviors, psychological well-being, social support, school variables, and sexual behaviors are compared across three groups- those born to mothers 17 or younger, mothers 18-19 years old, and mothers 20 or older. Analyses from two samples of African American adolescents from Maryland (n = 205) and Michigan (n = 570) are reported. The results from both samples indicate that mother's age at birth is unrelated to adolescents' psychosocial outcomes. These two studies add to the limited number of analyses that examine adolescent outcomes for children of teen mothers. The results suggest that efforts to understand social structural determinants of healthy and problematic adolescent development may be more informative than examining the effects of mother's age. They also suggest that teen pregnancy prevention programs may be more effective if they are part of a larger prevention strategy that incorporates social structural change efforts and not only a focus on individual level change."
16910806,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Family caregivers caring for a patient with terminal cancer may experience significant psychological distress. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the family caregivers' psychological distress is influenced by the patients' performance status while taking into account individual characteristics of caregivers and their unmet needs. METHODS: Two hundred twelve family caregivers were assigned to three cohorts according to the patient's performance status, as measured by the Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group Functional Scale (ECOGS). Interview information was collected on the services and care provided, as well as on the caregivers' characteristics and level of psychological distress. RESULTS: Family caregivers' psychosocial distress is strongly associated with the patients' terminal disease progress and declined functioning. The level of psychological distress varies from 25.2 to 33.5 (p = 0.0008) between the groups. Moreover, the percentage of caregivers with a high level of psychological distress varies from 41% to 62%, while this percentage is estimated at 19.2% in general population. A high distress index was significantly associated with the caregiver's burden, the patient's young age, the patient's symptoms, the caregiver's young age and gender, a poor perception of his/her health and dissatisfaction with emotional and tangible support. CONCLUSIONS: Family caregivers of patients in the advanced stages of cancer experience a high level of psychological distress, which increases significantly as the patient loses autonomy. Health care policies and programs need to be revisited in order to take the reality of these patients and their families into account."
11890169,0,a,"Successful aging calls for effective adaptation, which in turn implies flexible use of coping strategies to optimize personal functioning and well-being. The present paper studied adaptive choice behavior of older, independently living persons faced with complications in their houses. The goal was to gain insight into the concrete coping process and its outcome-in terms of the choice of assimilative vs. accommodative strategies-and in the role of three determinants on this process. The determinants were perceived self-efficacy, importance of the problem, and personal dispositions (flexibility and tenacity). A sample of 199 independently-living older persons participated in an experiment that was based on a scenario and questionnaire method, with problems stemming from the domain of independent living. Results mainly underlie the crucial role of perceived self-efficacy and are discussed in view of the concept of successful aging."
7983095,1,a,"This study analysed factors associated with unintended pregnancy among adolescent and young adult women in Santiago, Chile. Three variations of a behavioural model were developed. Logistic regression showed that the effect of sex education on unintended pregnancy works through the use of contraception. Other significant effects were found for variables reflecting socioeconomic status and a woman's acceptance of her sexuality. The results also suggested that labelling affects measurement of 'unintended' pregnancy."
11761316,0,a,"Two studies examined how ""syndromal"" approaches to assessment confound differences between individuals in the person and situation variables that contribute to their behavior. In a field study, a widely used instrument was found to be sensitive to the base rates of boys' aggression but, as expected, did not discriminate between boys who were similar in their behavior base rates but different in their social environments and how they responded to them. A laboratory experiment replicated this finding and demonstrated that social observers discriminated between targets on the basis of their functional properties even though syndrome scores did not. The results clarify how syndromal methods can obscure situational factors, conflict with people's social knowledge, and reinforce the view that syndromes exist ""in the individual"" rather than in person-environment interactions. Implications for developing more contextually sensitive instruments are discussed."
16137331,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This study focuses on determinants of a healthy work environment in two departments in a Swedish university hospital. The study is based on previously conducted longitudinal studies at the hospital (1994-2001), concerning working conditions and health outcomes among health care personnel in conjunction with downsizing processes. Overall, there was a general negative trend in relation to mental health, as well as long-term sick leave during the study period. The two departments chosen for the current study differed from the general hospital trend in that they showed stable health development. The aim of the study was to identify and analyse experiential determinants of healthy working conditions. METHODS: Thematic open-ended interviews were carried out with seventeen managers and key informants, representing different groups of co-workers in the two departments. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and an inductive content analysis was made. RESULTS: In the two studied departments the respondents perceived that it was advantageous to belong to a small department, and to work in cooperation-oriented care. The management approaches described by both managers and co-workers could be interpreted as transformational, due to a strain of visionary, delegating, motivating, confirmative, supportive attitudes and a strongly expressed solution-oriented attitude. The daily work included integrated learning activities. The existing organisational conditions, approaches and attitudes promoted tendencies towards a work climate characterised by trust, team spirit and professionalism. In the description of the themes organisational conditions, approaches and climate, two core determinants, work-pride and confidence, for healthy working conditions were interpreted. Our core determinants augment the well-established concepts: manageability, comprehensiveness and meaningfulness. These favourable conditions seem to function as a buffer against the general negative effects of downsizing observed elsewhere in the hospital, and in the literature. CONCLUSION: Research illuminating health-promoting aspects is rather unusual. This study could be seen as explorative. The themes and core dimensions we found could be used as a basis for further intervention studies in similar health-care settings. The result could also be used in future health promotion studies in larger populations. One of the first steps in such a strategy is to formulate relevant questions, and we consider that this study contributes to this."
16228697,0,a,"The aim of this was to examine rates and determinants of depressive symptomatology in the immediate postpartum period among Hispanic women in the United States. A total of 3952 Hispanic women who had delivered infants (parturients) were interviewed in postpartum wards in Miami, New York City and San Francisco. Symptoms of depression were regressed onto a series of social, psychological, and socioeconomic variables. Results showed that 42.6% of participants were probable cases of depression (CES-D > or = 16). Depression was negatively associated with perceived level of social support (adjusted OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.53-0.67) and health insurance coverage (adjusted OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.95), but not with the degree of acculturation or immigration status. It was found that depressive symptoms are common among Hispanic parturients. Pregnant Hispanic women should be carefully monitored for signs of depression and appropriate preventive measures are needed."
7608352,1,a,"In a prospective design, it was predicted that the role of negative mood in precipitating relapses and crises among alcohol-dependent participants would be greater when assessed with retrospective mood ratings than when assessed by prospective mood ratings because of participants' attributional biases. This hypothesis was not supported. Support was found, however, for a relationship between negative bias and the amount of negative mood assessed at the time the retrospective report was given. As has been previously found, the most frequent precipitant of relapses and crises in this study was negative emotional states. Female participants were more likely to report interpersonal and less likely to report intrapersonal determinants than male participants. Minor relapses were more likely to be precipitated by social pressure and less likely to be related to negative emotions than major relapses."
19068150,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Amidst a hunger-obesity paradox, the purpose of the present study was to examine the grocery shopping behaviour and food stamp usage of low-income women with children to identify factors influencing their food choices on a limited budget. DESIGN: Focus groups, which included questions based on Social Cognitive Theory constructs, examined food choice in the context of personal, behavioural and environmental factors. A quantitative grocery shopping activity required participants to prioritize food purchases from a 177-item list on a budget of $US 50 for a one-week period, an amount chosen based on the average household food stamp allotment in 2005. SUBJECTS: Ninety-two low-income women, with at least one child aged 9-13 years in their household, residing in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 37 years, and 76% were overweight or obese (BMI> or =25.0 kg/m2). Key findings suggest that their food choices and grocery shopping behaviour were shaped by not only individual and family preferences, but also their economic and environmental situation. Transportation and store accessibility were major determinants of shopping frequency, and they used various strategies to make their food dollars stretch (e.g. shopping based on prices, in-store specials). Generally, meat was the most important food group for purchase and consumption, according to both the qualitative and quantitative data. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve food budgeting skills, increase nutrition knowledge, and develop meal preparation strategies involving less meat and more fruits and vegetables, could be valuable in helping low-income families nutritionally make the best use of their food dollars."
15927800,0,a,"We developed and validated a self-administered questionnaire (Subjective Quality of Life Analysis, S.QUA.L.A.) to measure subjective quality of life. S.QUA.L.A. is a multidimensional instrument. This scale includes 22 domains of life. It covers traditional areas (food, family relation etc)., and more abstract aspects of life (politic, justice, freedom, truth, beauty and art, love). For each domain, patients are asked to evaluate their degree of satisfaction. They have also to indicate how important this domain is for them. We questioned 92 patients with schizophrenia and 357 para-medical students. The research demonstrated reproducibility, high internal consistency reliability, and sensitivity to change. Principal components analysis with varimax rotation was performed. A five-factor solution was selected, showing a great contribution of different dimensions of the self. Determinants of quality of life were identified by using correlations with Lehman's Quality of Life Interview (QOLI), and with measures of psychopathology and social functioning. Satisfaction approach and QOLI showed the same construct. We confirmed the influence of symptoms of depression and anxiety on subjective quality of life assessment, and the poor impact of disease parameters."
8935459,1,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify the determinants of childhood pedestrian injuries, taking the child's exposure to the road environment into account. DESIGN: This was a case-control study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia between 1991 and 1993. Altogether 100 injured and 400 uninjured child pedestrians aged 1 to 14 years were studied. Aspects of the child's social and physical environments, measures of his or her behaviour, cognitive skills, and ""habitual"" exposure to the road environment, as well as his or her knowledge of road safety, were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: The likelihood of injury increased by 12% with each 10,000 vehicles per day increase in the volume of traffic (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05, 1.19) on roads most frequently crossed. In addition, the presence of visual obstacles on the verge of the child's street of residence increased the likelihood of injury by more than 2.6 times (OR 2.68, 95% CI = 1.42, 5.02). In contrast, the absence of footpaths was associated with a 52% reduction in the likelihood of injury compared with the presence of footpaths on the child's street of residence (OR 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27, 0.87). CONCLUSION: The amount of exposure to the road environment and the nature of the road environment to which the child pedestrian was exposed partly influenced the likelihood of injury in children from low socioeconomic areas, male children, and children aged 13 to 14 years. Until now, the excess incidence of childhood pedestrian injuries in these subgroups of the population had not been explained because the child's exposure per se had not been examined."
2188515,1,a,"The author cites significant changes in the conduct of the psychiatric profession between the fourth and ninth decades of this century. Determinants of the changes included the impact of World War II, the National Mental Health Act of 1946, the evolution of multiple modes of psychotherapy, the move from a system of involuntary incarceration and treatment in public institutions to a voluntaristic and pluralistic system, the provision of public and private insurance support for office, outpatient, and inpatient psychiatric care, the resurgence of psychopharmacology, and the pursuit of research in biological and psychosocial fields. The social goals of the profession are also discussed."
18030822,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In 2006, the city of Milwaukee ranked worse than any Wisconsin county for health outcomes and worse than all but 1 county for health determinants. METHODS: To further examine disparities in health, Milwaukee city ZIP codes were stratified into 3 groups (lower, middle, and upper) by socioeconomic status (SES). Health determinants (15 measures) and health outcomes (2 measures) were compared across these ZIP code groups, and to the rest of Wisconsin. RESULTS: The risk ratio for the lower SES group in comparison to the upper SES group was at least 2.0 for 5 of the 17 measures examined, and was at least 1.5 for 13 of the 17 measures. The upper SES group in Milwaukee, while the healthiest in the city, was worse than the state average in 6 measures. CONCLUSIONS: Large health disparities within the city of Milwaukee are associated with geographic regions of differing socioeconomic status. As the state's largest urban center, Milwaukee's relatively poor health and significant health disparities have a considerable impact on the overall health of the state. To improve population health in Wisconsin, substantial efforts and resources are needed to address these disparities, and their related upstream factors."
11673127,0,a,"The objectives of this study were to to identify maternal characteristics associated with traditional food consumption and to examine food items associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury body burden in pregnant Inuit women from Northern Quebec. We interviewed women from three communities at mid-pregnancy and at 1 and 11 months postpartum. We measured PCBs, Hg, and selenium in maternal blood; Hg was also measured in maternal hair. The women reported eating significant amounts of fish, beluga muktuk/fat, seal meat, and seal fat. Although consumption of fish and seal was associated with lower socioeconomic status, consumption of beluga whale was uniform across strata. Fish and seal meat consumption was associated with increased Hg concentrations in hair. Traditional food intake during pregnancy was unrelated to PCB body burden, which is more a function of lifetime consumption. This study corroborated previous findings relating marine mammal and fish consumption to increased Hg and selenium body burden. Despite widespread knowledge regarding the presence of these contaminants in traditional foods, a large proportion of Inuit women increased their consumption of these foods during pregnancy, primarily because of pregnancy-related changes in food preferences and the belief that these foods are beneficial during pregnancy."
9027535,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Viral hepatitis is a major public health problem in China. Hepatitis A infections represent a substantial proportion of these, particularly in urban centres. Little is known about the social and behavioural factors in the urban household environment that influence the transmission of hepatitis A. METHODS: We conducted a register-based case-control study to investigate the risk factor patterns for hepatitis A in the general population of the City of Wuhan, in the PR China. Cases were selected from district-based health registers. One control, matched for sex and age, was identified from the case's neighbourhood. Home-based interviews combined with household observation were performed to obtain information on social, behavioural and economic risk factors and the household's indoor and outdoor environment. Analysis included conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Hepatitis A infection was associated with a variety of social and household-related factors, like handwashing habits (after working in the garden: adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 8.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-44.2, before food preparation: OR = 4.68, 95% CI: 1.8-12.0; before eating: OR = 4.92, 95% CI: 1.5-15.7), and the source of fresh vegetables (OR = 3.90, 95% CI: 1.6-9.8). Hygiene in the kitchen and the household surroundings and the disposal of children's stools in vegetable gardens or refuse pits were significantly associated with univariate analysis only. The lack of possession of luxury consumer items as a surrogate indicator for income was significantly associated with the disease (OR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.0-6.1). The study clearly established that exposure to health and hygiene education was less in the group of hepatitis A cases when compared to healthy controls (OR = 2.80, 95% CI: 0.9-8.3). CONCLUSION: The results of this study underline how social and behavioural factors are important determinants for hepatitis A in urban Chinese populations. These issues could be addressed by appropriate health and hygiene education targeted at high risk groups, and by strengthening existing procedures for monitoring and control of food hygiene."
8794456,1,a,"The primary health care model targets social, political, and economic environments as key determinants of health for populations, as well as for individuals. If nursing in Uganda is to make a difference in health care outcomes and in the health of all Ugandans, nurses must look broadly at situations and be educated to practice primary health care nursing. After 14 years of civil war, Uganda is finally experiencing a period of reconstruction and rehabilitation: the whole infrastructure is undergoing a face-lift. Ugandan nurses recognize that their educational preparation has stagnated for many years and that it was not only the political unrest in their country that put them behind professionally. They realize that, given the new directions set by the government, they must become prepared to implement primary health care. They are demanding a university education so they may take their place alongside other health care providers prepared at the university level. Some of the most convincing arguments for a university program for nurses came from doctors at the university who spoke about the need to raise the standards of nursing practice, the quality of teachers, and the morale of practitioners. One nurse said: ""If we lose hope for a BScN program, I think all the nurses will quit and we won't have any new students going into the profession."" This program is designed to improve the health and well-being of all Ugandans, especially the most vulnerable groups of women and children in rural areas, through strengthening and expanding health services by targeting the educational preparation of nurses. Health planners in Uganda envision the professional nurse as key to the implementation of the national health policy of primary health care. University-educated nurses should be able to assess problems, make clinically sound decisions, and act appropriately within the scope of nursing practice. They should be able to interact and consult collegially with other health care professionals. Placed in rural community sites, nurses should function independently as community leaders, health education facilitators, primary health care practitioners, and educators for nursing students. Such intervention in community health care by BScN nurses should improve health care utilization and decrease mortality and morbidity from preventable causes. BScN nurses should make an impact on health care policy, nursing education, and primary health care. The evaluation of this project needs to be as comprehensive as its development and implementation. It will focus on health outcomes, particularly for women and children in rural areas of Uganda. Measurement of the effects of the process of nursing education (the BScN curriculum) in terms of output (nurses educated and placed in rural practice, nursing education, or government policy posts), outcomes (change in health status of rural communities), and broader impacts (changes in the status of women and in government policy toward women, nurses, or health at the local, regional, and national levels) is planned. An element of sustainability is present, as an operations research structure will be left in place at the community level. Timing, as the saying goes, is everything, and this project has had good timing. Our belief in the efforts and the goals of the project also gave us the strength to get support from various funding agencies for ""small"" things. For example, we got support from churches in the United States for building schools in Uganda; we persisted with the women's income-generating project when other support was pulled; we got books for the library in Uganda and got clothes, books, and furnishings for the students who came to this country. The motivation for project personnel has been altruism. The services that the two consultants provided to their Ugandan colleagues have extended far beyond the scope of the project."
9589525,1,a,"The aim of this study was to assess and compare spinal cord injured (SCI) and traumatic brain injured (TBI) persons and people from the general population concerning partner relationships, functioning, mood and global quality of life. One hundred and sixty seven SCI persons, 92 TBI persons and 264 controls participated in the study. The median age was: SCI persons 33 years (range 19 to 79 years), TBI persons 40 years (range 20 to 70 years), and controls 31 years (range 19 to 79 years). Age at injury ranged among SCI persons from 14 to 76 years (Md 28 years), and among TBI persons from 16 to 56 years (Md 32 years). Half of the SCI group (51%), 58% of the TBI group and 59% of the controls had a stable partner relationship at the time of the investigation. Many of these SCI and TBI relationships (38% and 55% respectively) were established after injury. Both SCI and TBI persons showed significantly more depressive feelings compared with the controls. Perceived quality of life (global QL rating) was significantly lower in the SCI group compared with the controls, whereas the ratings of TBI persons and controls did not differ significantly. SCI and TBI persons did not differ significantly in level of education, perceived quality of life or distress. In all three groups, global quality-of-life ratings were significantly lower among single persons compared to those with a partner relationship. It was concluded that both SCI and TBI appear to affect overall quality of life and mental well-being negatively. The number of partner relationships contracted after injury among both SCI and TBI persons indicates, however, that the injury is not a major barrier to establishing close partner relationships. Being in good spirits, that is, lack of depressive feelings has a profound impact on the perception of a high quality of life in all three groups. For the SCI and TBI persons, a high level of physical and social independence were further positive determinants of a perceived high quality of life."
8454215,1,a,"The human behavior and its social determinants are critical variables for understanding the etiology, treatment, and prevention of many disorders previously attributed to biological substrates. Among the many categories of human behavior to receive special attention from health researchers and practitioners are life events, coping responses and emotional state. The relation between these categories constituted a particular field of investigation. This relationship rather than forcing to focus on disease, distress, disability, and other failures in human functioning, permits to address health, abilities, resources, and other positive aspects of human functioning. On the other hand, the re-organization of health services considers interdisciplinary work as an objective, as it is necessary to care for the patient in an integral manner, with the consequent benefit of a more efficient service. In addition it is known that patients with psychosocial dysfunctions who use general practice care facilities overutilize these services in an unnecessary manner. With this in mind it is clear that is necessary to balance the service's cost-benefit for a more efficient clinical attention. In this paper we present the results of the categories mentioned above: life events, coping responses and its relationship with emotional state in a representative sample of 399 female patients who in 1986 received services at the National Institute of Perinatology-INPer-. Of these patients, 297 were obstetrical patients -OBS- and 102 gynaecological ones -GINE-. All patients answered these instruments: General Health Questionnaire -GHQ-7 of 30 items, a subscale of Health and Daily Living for Coping Responses and Life Events Scale.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
18341123,0,a,"Renewed international interest in the structural determinants of health manifests itself in a focus on the social determinants of health and the public policy antecedents that shape their quality. This increased international interest in public policy in support of the structural determinants of health has had little traction in the United States. This should be surprising since the United States presents one of the worst population health profiles and public policy environments in support of health among wealthy developed nations. The U.S. position as a health status and policy outlier results from long-term institutional changes that are shaped by political, economic, and social forces. U.S. public health researchers' and workers' neglect of these structural and public policy issues conforms to the dominant ideological discourses that serve to justify these changes. The author presents some means by which public health researchers and workers can challenge these dominant discourses."
9642904,1,a,"This study examines the determinants of social support among a sample of 642 caregivers of persons with AIDS living in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Respondents include both traditional family caregivers (mothers, spouses, other relatives) and non-traditional caregivers (friends, homosexual partners). Multiple regression analyses are conducted to assess the independent effects of six sets of variables on emotional and instrumental support: social-structural factors (age, education, employment status), caregiver's relationship to the person with AIDS, situational variables (caregiver's HIV status, patient's functional disability, interpersonal conflict), social network factors (contact with family, contact with friends, community integration), personal resources (mastery, caregiving competence), and use of formal community services (patient-directed services, caregiver-directed services). A number of factors and conditions appear to be relevant for caregiver support. For example, results indicate that network factors, including frequency of contact, conflict, and community integration, are importantly related to caregivers' perceptions of emotional support. There is also a trend suggesting lower emotional support among traditional family caregivers, relative to nonfamily caregivers, within gender categories. With respect to instrumental assistance with caregiving, factors that place greater demands and time constraints on caregivers, such as being employed and caring for an AIDS patient with greater functional limitations, appear to increase the level of informal instrumental support the caregiver receives. Partners and spouses, however, receive significantly lower instrumental assistance, independent of other factors. Implications of the findings are discussed."
15582347,0,a,"The purpose of this study was to describe changes in physical activity and determinants in youngsters treated for obesity. Self-reported physical activity and determinants were assessed at start, during and after an intervention in 24 obese patients (mean age 13.5+/-2.1 years). Participation in activities of moderate to high intensity increased during treatment, but 6-months after treatment this decreased again to pre-treatment levels. Participation in activities of low intensity and television watching decreased during treatment and increased following treatment. Very little change was found in perceived benefits, barriers or self-efficacy scores. Modelling of siblings decreased after treatment, whereas there was no evolution in modelling of parents. Social support by family members increased during treatment, but decreased following treatment. We can conclude that the intervention was successful in activating obese youngsters to move at the desirable exercise intensity and frequency; however, maintenance of the exercise habit after treatment was not successful."
12512223,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Psychological resources and social support are important determinants of health, but brief and validated scales measuring these dimensions in French are lacking. METHODS: Instruments measuring self-esteem and mastery, and affective and confident social support were administered by mail to 1257 university students. Factor analysis, internal consistency statistics, and correlations with related variables were used to derive abbreviated scales and confirm their validity. RESULTS: Factor analysis and item reduction yielded four brief scales: mastery (4 items), self-esteem (4 items), affective social support (2 items), and problem-solving social support (4 items). All four scales had few missing items and adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.70). All scores were associated with self-reported general health, and with visits to mental health specialists. Scores of self-esteem and mastery were also associated with physician visits (inversely), and confidence in finishing studies and finding a job. Scores of affective and confident social support correlated with the intensity of social activities and the number of people the respondent could count on. CONCLUSIONS: The abbreviated scales retained adequate psychometric properties and may be usefully applied in health research among similar French-speaking populations."
19377537,0,a,"Alarming trends in childhood obesity even among preschool children have re-focused attention on the importance of physical activity in this age group. With this increased attention comes the need to identify the amount and type of physical activity appropriate for optimal development of preschool children. The purpose of this paper is to provide the scientific evidence to support a link between physical activity and biological and psychosocial development during early childhood (ages 2-5 years). To do so, we summarize pertinent literature informing the nature of the physical activity required to promote healthy physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development during these early years. A particular focus is on the interaction between physical activity and motor skill acquisition. Special emphasis is also placed on the nature of physical activity that promotes healthy weight gain during this period of childhood. The paper also discusses the strongest determinants of physical activity in preschool-age children, including the role of the child's environment (e.g., family, child-care, and socio-economic status). We provide recommendations for physical activity based on the best available evidence, and identify future research needs."
9561644,1,a,"International comparison of food intake and health studies amongst the aged is providing new insight into the importance of food culture in social context for healthy aging. At same time the possible variance in eating behavior compatible with good health requires consideration. The IUNS (International Union of Nutritional Sciences) FHILL (Food Habits in Later Life) Project, comprises (1) a morbidity study on about 2,000 elderly in 13 communities (now available on CD Rom) and (2) a mortality follow-up study. In the morbidity study, a total health assessment score or Later Life Status Score (LLSS) has been considered in relation to non-nutritional and nutritional factors. The elderly Greek cohorts aged 70+ in Melbourne. Australia (M = 94, F = 95) and Spata, Greece (M = 51, F = 53) have been used as a model for multivariate analyses to determine separately the importance of non-nutritional (well-being, memory, general health, medication-use, activities of daily living, exercise, social activity and social networks scores) and nutritional variables (intake of food groups g/day, food group variety scores, nutrients) in accounting for LLSS. A mortality follow-up study on the elderly cohort in Spata, Greece has also been completed and published. The findings from these preliminary analyses on the Greek cohorts will be reviewed as an example of how food culture may be influencing both quality of life and survival in Greek elderly. The most important non-nutritional determinants of LLSS in Greeks included: mobility and independence (exercise and activities of daily living), well-being and memory (collectively explained 80% of the variation of LLSS). For nutritional variables, a high intake and variety of plant foods (in particular vegetables, legumes and fruit); a high intake and variety of seafood and a low intake of meat emerged with statistical and biological significance. Results from the mortality study also agree with findings from the morbidity study--particularly the importance of the overall traditional greek food culture, with its emphasis on plant derived food of various kinds, as opposed to individual food categories, in protecting against premature death. Strategies are advanced which may optimise nutritionally related health problems amongst the aged around the globe."
28253113,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Simulated patients are commonly used to evaluate medical trainees. Unannounced simulated patients provide an accurate measure of physician performance. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of detection of SPs on physician performance, and identify factors leading to detection. METHODS: Fixty-six family medicine residents were each visited by two unannounced simulated patients presenting with alcohol-induced hypertension or insomnia. Residents were then surveyed on their detection of SPs. RESULTS: SPs were detected on 45 out of 104 visits. Inner city clinics had higher detection rates than middle class clinics. Residents' checklist and global rating scores were substantially higher on detected than undetected visits, for both between-subject and within-subject comparisons. The most common reasons for detection concerned SP demographics and behaviour; the SP ""did not act like a drinker"" and was of a different social class than the typical clinic patient. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-clinic studies involving residents experienced with SPs should ensure that the SP role and behavior conform to physician expectations and the demographics of the clinic. SP station testing does not accurately reflect physicians' actual clinical behavior and should not be relied on as the primary method of evaluation. The study also suggests that physicians' poor performance in identifying and managing alcohol problems is not entirely due to lack of skill, as they demonstrated greater clinical skills when they became aware that they were being evaluated. Physicians' clinical priorities, sense of responsibility and other attitudinal determinants of their behavior should be addressed when training physicians on the management of alcohol problems."

9008668,1,a,"BACKGROUND: In consultative models of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), lack of implementation of CGA recommendations is well documented and appears to be a potential explanation for negative findings. The purpose of this study is to identify patient determinants of adherence to recommendations received from a community-based CGA consultative model program. METHODS: Subjects (N = 139) received self-care and/or physician-initiated CGA recommendations and were interviewed three months later to determine adherence with the most important recommendation, and health belief, communication, and social support factors associated with adherence. Independent variables were organized into the Andersen Behavioral Model for analysis. RESULTS: At the bivariate level, one predisposing factor (intention) and six enabling factors (low difficulty level, high support, high utility, high self-efficacy, agreement on the importance of the recommendation and good specific communication about the recommendation) were significant determinants of adherence. Two functional health measures and seriousness of the target condition of the recommendation were significant need factors. In the final logistic regression model, one predisposing variable (intention), one enabling variable (utility), and one need factor (high functional status), and two interaction terms significantly predicted adherence. CONCLUSION: CGA recommendations that are seen as worthwhile, not too much trouble, and able to be accomplished are the most likely to be initiated. Older adults with relatively higher functional levels are also more likely to follow through with CGA recommendations even though their needs may be lower. We found the Andersen Behavioral Model useful in the analysis of factors associated with adherence behavior to consultative CGA recommendations."
8822410,1,a,"A study using data for mothers from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and their children aged 14 or older indicates that, after accounting for a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic antecedents, children are significantly more likely to become sexually active before age 14 if their mother had sex at an early age and if she has worked extensively. In addition, early sexual debut is eight times as likely among black boys as among non-Hispanic white boys. Children who use controlled substances at an early age are more than twice as likely to have sex before age 14 as those who do not, although the type of substance having an effect is different for girls (cigarettes) and boys (alcohol). Church attendance is an important determinant of delayed sexual activity, but only when a child's friends attend the same church."
19003692,0,a,"In this paper I argue that a narrow view of justice dominates the bioethics literature. I urge a broader view. As bioethicists, we often conceive of justice using a medical model. This model focuses attention at a particular point in time, namely, when someone who is already sick seeks access to scarce or expensive services. A medical model asks how we can fairly distribute those services. The broader view I endorse requires looking upstream, and asking how disease and suffering came about. In contrast to a medical model, a social model of justice considers how social determinants affect the health of a population. For example, social factors such as access to clean drinking water, education, safe workplaces, and police protection, profoundly affect risk for disease and early death. I examine one important social determinant of health, health care coverage, to show the limits of a medical model and the merits of a broader view."
16986650,0,a,"The purpose of this study is to examine the association between lacking emotional support from parents early in life and adult alcohol abuse. A series of logistic regression models were run with data collected from a nationally representative sample of over 2500 adults ages 25-74. The findings reveal a linear relationship between level of deficiency in early maternal support and odds of alcohol abuse during adulthood, with even moderate deficiencies being associated with elevated risk. Further examination suggests that this association persists throughout adulthood. This association does not appear to be explained by the early initiation of alcohol use, but poor psychological well-being during adulthood does account for a large portion of this association. These findings expand our understanding of the risks associated with poor parental support during childhood, and underscore the importance of adopting a life course perspective in studying the social determinants of alcohol problems among adults."
16449588,0,a,"In 1975, New York City experienced a fiscal crisis rooted in long-term political and economic changes in the city. Budget and policy decisions designed to alleviate this fiscal crisis contributed to the subsequent epidemics of tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and homicide in New York City. Because these conditions share underlying social determinants, we consider them a syndemic, i.e., all 3 combined to create an excess disease burden on the population. Cuts in services; the dismantling of health, public safety, and social service infrastructures; and the deterioration of living conditions for vulnerable populations contributed to the amplification of these health conditions over 2 decades. We estimate that the costs incurred in controlling these epidemics exceeded 50 billion US dollars (in 2004 dollars); in contrast, the overall budgetary saving during the fiscal crisis was 10 billion US dollars. This history has implications for public health professionals who must respond to current perceptions of local fiscal crises."

During the 12 months of the study (1 May 199930 April 2000) 196 booked patients at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife who delivered at mission houses were analysed. All ages and parity groups, educational level and social classes were involved. The majority (73%) were of low socio-economic class. The reasons for mission house delivery included financial constraints (41%), fear of possible caesarean section (46%), industrial action by health-care workers (39%), transport difficulty at night (26%), previous deliveries in mission houses (16%) and communal feud (12%). Four maternal deaths occurred (MMR 978/100 000 births) and 20 perinatal deaths (PNMR 118/1000 total births). Reduction of hospital user fees, provision of transportation and efficient telecommunication facilities at all times, conflict resolution and proper remuneration of health care workers are urgent needs to be addressed. Legislation against delivery in unsafe places and establishment of appropriate facilities by churches interested in maternity services is highly recommended."

Social determinants of female vulnerability to HIV-1 include gender disparities, poverty, cultural and sexual norms, lack of education, and violence. Women are also more susceptible to HIV-1 because of hormonal changes, vaginal microbial ecology and physiology, and a higher prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases. Prevention strategies must address the wide range of gender inequalities that promote the dissemination of HIV-1."
12134731,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate in a population-based sample of hypertensive men and women the impact of factors that determine frequency and pattern of antihypertensive treatment. METHODS: We used pooled data of two independent surveys conducted 1989/90 and 1994/95 in the Augsburg region among men and women aged 25 to 74 years. Co-morbidity and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed by questionnaire and examination. Multivariate and polytomous logistic regression analyses were used to assess treatment patterns adjusting for cofactors. RESULTS: Among a total of 9,795 survey participants, 2,279 men and 1,699 women were hypertensive with 30% of men and 43% of women using antihypertensive drugs. Hypercholesterolemia was unrelated and smoking even inversely related to treatment (adjusted odds ratio OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.56-0.92). Women were more likely to be treated than men (adjusted OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.34-1.82). Furthermore, women on monotherapy used diuretics significantly more often than men (adjusted OR relative to betablocker use 2.8, 95% CI: 1.6-4.8). CONCLUSIONS: We identified several determinants of drug treatment among hypertensives in the community. During the study period antihypertensive treatment seemed to be determined primarily by clinical disease but not by concomitant cardiovascular risk factor status, such as male gender, smoking, or hypercholesterolemia."
14758854,0,a,"The geographic distribution of health status across Italian regions shows a North-South gradient, with better conditions in the North for both males and females. Using data from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey, the authors first analyze the geographic variation in subjective health and presence of chronic conditions, with specific attention to the effects of individual and area-based socioeconomic conditions and their heterogeneity across regions. The results suggest the North-South gradient in health is mainly affected, at least for subjective health, by the different composition of macro-areas with respect to individual education, and is slightly influenced by contextual circumstances. Moreover, being less educated results in poorer health in some regions (mainly South and Isles) than in others (mainly Northeast). The authors next analyze the circumstances affecting the presence of more disadvantaged people in the South, to highlight features of the Southern context that might exacerbate social inequalities in health and features of Northern areas that might allay them. Indicators of inequalities, welfare, labor, and power resources were analyzed. The results confirm the disadvantage of the South in terms of social, economic, and cultural features, mainly revealing the compositional effects found in the first part of the study. However, the contextual predictive value of income inequalities, quality of care, and social cohesion can have a supplementary effect on health outcomes of disadvantaged persons."
16326659,0,a,"PURPOSE: Healthful eating is important for optimal diabetes self-care. However, the level of food sufficiency may influence the degree of adherence to dietary self-care behaviors through the affordability of nutritionally appropriate food. This study examines whether homebound older adults with diabetes were at greater risk for heightened food insufficiency over 1 year, despite regular receipt of home-delivered meals. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a longitudinal study of a randomly recruited sample of 268 homebound older adults in the Nutrition and Function Study (NAFS) who regularly received home-delivered meals and completed baseline and 1-year in-home assessments. Based on an economic context model, self-reported data were collected on fundamental and proximate factors, food-sufficiency status, and intervening events. Determinants of heightened food insufficiency were examined with multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Not only did food-sufficiency status diminish over time in this sample, but it became or remained worse for older adults with diabetes. In addition to diabetes status, heightened food insufficiency was associated with perceived inadequacy of economic resources. IMPLICATIONS: Health care providers and nutrition programs should attempt to identify high-risk older adults - those who have diabetes and are at risk of food insufficiency - and develop community linkages and strategies that integrate nutrition with diabetes care plans, thus supporting a multidisciplinary, chronic care model to improve diabetes management and outcomes."
1939293,1,a,"Data from an historical population in which fertility control was minimal and modern health services were mostly unavailable are used to show that there appears to have been a strong association between previous birth interval length and infant mortality, especially when the previous child survived. Although only imperfect proxies for breast-feeding practices and other potentially confounding factors are available for this population, the results suggest that the association between previous interval length and infant mortality in this population is not solely, or primarily, a function of differences in breast-feeding behaviour or socioeconomic status. Other factors, e.g. maternal depletion or sibling competition, are more likely to explain the observed association."
9847029,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Hospitalization for cardiac disease is associated with an increased risk for depression, which itself confers a poorer prognosis. Few prospective studies have examined the determinants of depression after hospitalization in cardiac patients, and even fewer have examined depression within the weeks after hospital discharge. The present study assessed the prospective relations among perceptions of social support and trait hostility in predicting symptoms of depressive symptoms at 1 month after hospitalization for a diagnostic angiography in 506 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. METHOD: A series of structural equation models 1) estimated the predictive relations of social support, hostility, and depressive symptoms while in the hospital to symptoms of depression 1 month after hospitalization, and 2) compared these relations across gender, predicted risk classification, and age. RESULTS: Social support assessed during hospitalization was independently negatively associated with depressive symptoms 1 month after hospitalization, after controlling for baseline symptoms of depression, gender, disease severity, and age. Hostility was an indirect predictor of postdischarge depressive symptomology by way of its negative relation with social support. This pattern of relations did not differ across gender, predicted risk classification, and age. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a patient's perceived social support during hospitalization is a determinant of depressive symptoms 1 month later. The relation of social support and hostility to subsequent depressive symptoms was similar across a variety of populations."
10326697,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate the personal experience of patients with nonmetastatic breast carcinoma who were treated with the concurrent administration of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in terms of side effects and quality of life (QL). METHODS: One hundred nine patients with nonmetastatic breast carcinoma, recruited between May 1995 and February 1997, were included in a protocol combining chemotherapy with mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide, administered intravenously in 4 cycles of 21 days, and concomitant radiotherapy. Side effects of treatment and its impact on patients' daily lives were measured using ad hoc questionnaires; QL was measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 QL questionnaire, and pain was measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: All patients agreed to participate. The mean number of chemotherapy and radiotherapy symptoms per cycle were: 7.2+/-2.5 and 2.4+/-1.8, respectively. Chemotherapy symptoms generally were more frequent and distressing than those of radiotherapy. The average pain score reported on the VAS by patients during treatment was 3.0+/-2.0. Multidimensional QL assessment showed that treatment mainly affects physical functioning and global QL. Multivariate analysis showed that the main determinants of QL at the end of treatment were fatigue, pain, and loss of appetite experienced during treatment. Moreover, 62.8% of patients required specific help for transportation to the hospital and/or home upkeep. CONCLUSIONS: The concurrent administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy deteriorates patients' QL but in a proportion similar to sequential administration while presenting the advantage of a shorter duration of treatment. However, increased fatigue, pain, and loss of appetite as well as difficulties in patients' daily lives have to be taken into account in therapeutic decision-making analysis."
16300663,0,a,"Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a multifactorial problem, which affects men of all ages and in all demographics. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence of prostatitis is approximately 2-10% among unselected men in North America, Europe and Asia. This data clearly indicates that chronic prostatitis constitutes an important problem in international health care. Nevertheless, the aetiology and pathogenesis of chronic prostatitis have yet to be clearly delineated, despite the numerous efforts which have been made, with regard to both basic and clinical research. In fact, factors other than leucocytes and bacteria have been shown to contribute to the symptoms typically associated with prostatitis. Studies of the epidemiology and determinants of prostatitis risk factors may also provide clues to the general aetiology of prostatitis. Other epidemiological data appears to indicate that certain as-yet-unknown factors might be associated with an increased tendency towards the development of chronic prostatitis. However, findings from most studies are considered to represent only preliminary data, because of the small sample sizes or lack of generalizability inherent to most of the studies. The identification and characterization of these relevant risk factors might accelerate or augment the development of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these syndromes."
9634135,1,a,"This paper presents a structural model of the determinants of harsh parenting among Mexican mothers. One hundred five mothers (46 from the community; 59 referred to agencies for child maltreatment) were recruited from Sonora (Northern) Mexico and interviewed. In this model the use of physical punishment was explained by (1) authoritarian parenting style (mothers' beliefs concerning the effective use of physical punishment and mothers' lack of disciplinary skills) and (2) family dysfunction (a latent variable constructed from reports of interspousal violence and the parents' use of alcohol and drugs). In addition, the indirect effects of demographic and historical variables on harsh parenting was included. The findings show that the most important factor influencing the use of physical punishment in these families was authoritarian parenting style, exerting a significant direct effect on the mothers' reports of their use of harsh punishment. Family dysfunction had an indirect effect through parenting style. Some sociodemographic variables also indirectly influenced the use of beliefs maternal punishment It is concluded that cultural beliefs play a major role in parenting within the framework of Mexican family relations."
16963673,0,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible role of low socioeconomic status (SES) as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) among obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients requiring treatment. DESIGN: Polysomnographic and demographic characteristics and associated morbidity were measured in 686 prospectively recruited adult OSAS patients from two regions in Israel. SETTING: Two university-affiliated sleep laboratories. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The multiple logistic regression (after adjusting for gender, body mass index [BMI], and smoking) revealed that the following are independent determinants for CVD in OSAS patients requiring treatment: each decrease in income level category (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 1.7), age > or = 1 year (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.1), hypertension (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.1), and hyperlipidemia (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 5.8); area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) = 81.9%. The multivariate determinants describing the low-SES OSAS patients included: minorities and immigrants combined (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 12), female gender (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.9), increased BMI (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.9), unmarried status (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.1), and years of education (> or = 1 year) [OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7 to 0.8]; area under the ROC = 78.1%. CONCLUSION: In addition to the already known traditional risk factors, low SES was found to be a novel independent risk factor for CVD among adult OSAS patients requiring treatment."

The paper begins with a review of the time series properties of the data and summarizes the long-term equilibrium relationships identified in previous work.... An investigation is made of the impact of shocks to real wages and mortality on demographic variables as measured by generalized impulse responses and persistence profiles."""
1927071,1,a,Contrary to many widely discussed theories of anorexia nervosa the conclusive human genetic results of research with twins have been almost totally ignored and individual casuistry has often been misinterpreted. The two twin-series studies at hand (Crisp et al./London and the author)--totally independent of each other and compiled during the same time period--speak unmistakably for a great genetic determination and genesis of anorexia nervosa. The AN-twin pairs compiled by the author over a period of 30 years are described here.
16020637,0,a,"The world is increasingly shaped by powerful global forces, many of which have consequences for human health and the social, economic, and environmental factors that influence health are increasingly determined at a supranational level. As a result, local or national level efforts to influence health determinants can have only a limited impact and it is all too easy for the individual public health practitioner to feel powerless. Yet while public health practitioners, on their own, may indeed be comparatively powerless, together they can achieve a great deal. Part I of this glossary explores a range of issues that arise as they seek to make a difference."
11020935,0,a,"In Bangladesh, the total fertility rate declined from more than six children per woman of reproductive age in 1980 to 3.3 children per woman in 1996. Much discussion has ensued about the circumstances responsible for this decline and, in particular, about the contribution made by the national family planning program. For this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with 67 women concerning the factors influencing their reproductive behavior. The participants, residents of a rural area in southwestern Bangladesh, consisted of two groups: women who were currently practicing family planning and women who had never practiced or had not done so for at least four years. The findings suggest that the family planning program has played an important role in reducing family size, but also indicate that economic and social changes, and especially growing aspirations (particularly for a life outside agriculture) have combined with changes in the nature of family decision making to make couples more receptive to the idea of family planning."
1502962,1,a,"As a part of the SAMAR 89 Project on mental health, we present the results of a psychiatric epidemiological research (in two stages) in a representative sample of the elderly urban population of Zaragoza (Spain). We study the relation between psychological disorders and sociodemographic factors, and network and social support. In the first stage we use a adaptation of the Enquete Sante Quebec and the General Health Questionnaire of 28 items of Goldberg. The Clinical Interview Schedule and the monumental state of Folstein were used for the psychiatric diagnoses in the second stage (diagnoses criteria of the DSM-III). The psychological disorders were more frequent on the women, the more aged and the ones of low socioeconomic level. Also was detected a correspondence between bad mental health and problems in the network and social support."
16566822,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Because of the rapid aging population, the demand for residential care exceeds availability. This paper presents the results of a study that focuses on the demand of elderly people for residential care and determinants (elderly people's personal characteristics, needs and resources) that are associated with this demand. Furthermore, the accuracy of the waiting list as a reflection of this demand has been examined. METHODS: 67 elderly people waiting for admission into a home for the elderly, are subjected to semi-structured interviews. The data are analyzed by using multivariate statistics. RESULTS: Elderly people who indicate that they would refuse an offer of admission into a home for the elderly feel healthier (p = 0.02), have greater self-care agency (p = 0.02) and perceive less necessity of admission (p < 0.01), compared to those who would accept such an offer. Especially the inability to manage everyday activities and the lack of a social network are highly associated with the elderly people's demand for residential care. Furthermore, it is evident that waiting lists for homes for the elderly do not accurately reflect the demand for residential care, since 35% of the elderly people on a waiting list did not actually experience an immediate demand for residential care and stated that they would not accept an offer of admission. Quite a lot of respondents just registered out of a sense of precaution; a strategic decision dictated by current shortages in care provision and a vulnerable health status. CONCLUSION: The results contribute to the understanding of waiting lists and the demand for residential care. It became apparent that not everybody who asks for admission into a home for the elderly, really needed it. The importance of elderly people's resources like social networks and the ability to manage everyday activities in relation to the demand for care became clear. These findings are important because they indicate that resources also play a role in predicting elderly people's demand and as a result can guide the development and the (re)design of adequate health care services."

Genomics through biotechnologies offers also for the first time in history the possibility to create a new living world. Genomics can be seen as a component of actual culture that is in close connection with the economic strategies with strong political implications especially for health care and environment. This article analyses the historical determinants of genomics culture and questions the sense of the interpretations given to life by genomists. It also underlines their responsibility in elaborating this new kind of knowledge."
9696257,1,a,"The aim was to compare how general lifestyle, gender and occupational status determine dental health behavior. All the 1012 55-year-old citizens of Oulu (a medium-sized Finnish town) were invited to participate in this study. 780 of them did so. Information about frequency of toothbrushing, use of extra cleaning methods, use of sugar in coffee or tea, and time of the last dental visit, lifestyle, occupational status and gender was gathered from the 533 dentate subjects. Lifestyle was measured by means of questions about physical activity, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and dietary habits. Females and people with a healthy lifestyle brushed their teeth more often. Extra cleaning methods were used more often by people with a healthy lifestyle, whereas gender and occupational status had a weaker association. Males and people with a lower occupational status used sugar in coffee or tea more often. The time from the last dental visit was longer among workers and men; lifestyle had no significant association. At the population level oral cleaning habits are a matter of a health-oriented lifestyle and gender-related behavior. The dental visiting habit has a weaker association with general lifestyle."
12147165,0,a,"In recent years public health research has increasingly focused upon exploring the social determinants of health. This interest has partly arisen through an acknowledgement of the limitations of educational preventive approaches in improving population health and reducing health inequalities. Many health education interventions have been influenced by health behaviour research based upon psychological theories and models. These theories focus at an individual level and seek to explore cognitive and affective processes determining behaviour and lifestyle. Current psychological theories have only a limited value in the development of public health action on altering the underlying social determinants of health. New theoretical approaches have however, emerged which explore the relationship between the social environment and health. This paper aims to review and highlight the potential value to oral health promotion of three important public health theoretical approaches: life course analysis, salutogenic model and social capital. It is important that an informed debate takes place over the theoretical basis of oral health promotion. As the field of oral health promotion develops it is essential that it is guided by contemporary and appropriate theoretical frameworks to ensure that more effective action is implemented in the future."
12348290,1,a,"""This paper...[analyzes] the distance moved by one-year migrants using a multi-level modelling approach. Controlling for a range of socio-economic variables, derived from the 1991 British Census Sample of Anonymised Records (SAR), at both the individual and area level, the distance moved by household heads in public, privately rented and owner-occupied housing within Britain is assessed.... It is confirmed that migrants in public housing are less likely to migrate long distances than owner-occupiers and that the proportion of public housing in a SAR area, and the absolute reduction in public housing in a SAR area between 1981 and 1991, does not have a significant effect on the distance that in-migrants have moved."""
19648131,0,a,"AIM: While many studies report determinants of adolescent cigarette smoking, few identify risk factors for nicotine dependence (ND). This study distinguished between risk factors for three hallmarks of ND including cravings, withdrawal symptoms and tolerance. METHODS: A total of 319 novice smokers were followed every 3 months from first puff on a cigarette until the end of secondary school. Outcomes included time to first report of cravings, withdrawal symptoms and tolerance. RESULTS: Female sex, inhalation, smoking a whole cigarette, weekly smoking, daily smoking and alcohol use each independently increased the incidence of the onset of cravings. Inhalation, weekly smoking, daily smoking and alcohol use predicted the onset of withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms, smoking a whole cigarette, monthly smoking, daily smoking and friends and siblings smoking increased the incidence of the onset of tolerance. None of parental education, impulsivity, novelty seeking, self-esteem, depression, stress, parental smoking, physical activity, or participation in sports teams was associated with the outcomes. CONCLUSION: The hallmarks of early ND are related to intensity and frequency of cigarette use. Avoidance of daily smoking may be particularly important in preventing the onset of ND symptoms and sustained smoking."
9810070,1,a,"CONTEXT: Evidence synthesized from social epidemiology, psychophysiology, and behavioral medicine suggests that religiousness may represent a significant correlate of absorption, a construct for which few if any psychosocial determinants have been identified. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between absorption and intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness. PARTICIPANTS: 83 respondents of a self-administered survey of adult survivors of cancer or other life-threatening diseases, recruited from participants in a pilot study of psychosocial factors related to recovery from illness. MAIN MEASURES: Tellegen Absorption Scale and Religious Orientation Scale. RESULTS: Absorption, as assessed by the Tellegen Absorption Scale, was positively and significantly associated with intrinsic religiousness, as measured by the Religious Orientation Scale. Predominantly intrinsic subjects had absorption scores at least 20% higher than did predominantly extrinsic, proreligious, or nonreligious subjects. DISCUSSION: Prior research has found that absorption and hypnotizability have psychophysiological correlates, and that religiousness shows protective effects against morbidity and mortality. In light of this work, the present findings suggest that certain religious cognitions, emotions, or experiences may generate an internally focused state that enhances health and attenuates disease through self-soothing psychophysiological mechanisms."
16257477,0,a,"The aging of populations increases the importance of cognitive function as a public health issue. The Whitehall II study is investigating influences on aging processes within social context, with tests in five domains of cognitive function (short-term memory, inductive reasoning, vocabulary, phonemic and semantic fluency). The tests have now been completed three times over a 10-year period, by participants initially aged 40-60 years. In mid-life, socioeconomic differences in cognitive function were large, while APOE genotype had little influence. Higher occupational status was strongly related to lower metabolic syndrome prevalence. This social-biological gradient illustrates that potential confounding of psychosocial, behavioral and biological effects on cognitive decline is an important consideration in etiologic research. Additionally, it highlights the importance for population health of the 'causes of the causes' of cognitive aging. Epidemiology contributes to our understanding of risk and protective factors for cognitive decline by showing the links between the wider determinants of health and biological markers such as glucose intolerance and the metabolic syndrome."
19558191,0,a,"Chronic diseases are now the major causes of death and disability worldwide, and non-communicable diseases (NCD) account for the majority of the global health burden. About half of premature deaths are related to health-risking behaviours that are often established during youth and extend to adulthood. While these diseases might not be curable, they are preventable. Prevention is possible when sustained actions are directed at individuals and families, as well as at the broader social, economic and cultural determinants of NCD. A 'life-course' approach to promoting healthy behaviour should begin early in life. The aim of this article is to discuss the impact of the 'health-promoting school' (HPS) on improvements in youth health. HPS can be described as a holistic, whole-school approach in which a broad health education curriculum is supported by the environment and ethos of the school. HPS moves beyond individual behavioural change to consider organizational and policy change such as improving the physical and social environment of the school, as well as its curricula and teaching and learning methods. A positive culture for health would facilitate higher levels of health literacy by helping individuals tackle the determinants of health better as they build the personal, cognitive and social skills for maintaining good health. There is reasonable evidence to demonstrate that the whole-school approach using the HPS framework is effective in improving health, ranging from physical activities and healthy eating to emotional health. Schools adopting the HPS framework have demonstrated changes in culture and organizational practice to become more conducive to health improvement. These schools were reported to have better school health policies, higher degrees of community participation, and a more hygienic environment than non-HPS schools, and students in these schools had a more positive health behaviour profile. Health promotion and disease prevention is essential to reduce the healthcare burden of children and adolescents. HPS would help to combat the global burden of childhood obesity by promoting healthy eating behaviours and encouraging higher levels of physical activity. There are gaps in service provision for children and adolescents from both the health and education perspective; the HPS framework has the potential to develop a mechanism of closer integration with the primary healthcare system, making youth health services more school based and student centred. A new model of interconnection between HPS and different components of primary healthcare can be evolved to make services for disease prevention and health promotion more student friendly."
9347588,1,a,"This article focuses on the relationship between women's economic status earlier in their lives and their poverty status in old age. Previous research on the determinants of poverty among aged women has documented the socioeconomic and demographic correlates of the poor, and has examined the financial impact of adverse later-life events such as widowhood, deterioration of health, and loss of employment. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women (NLSMW), we find that most women who experience these types of adverse events in their later years do not become poor and that a large majority of older NLSMW respondents who were poor in 1991-92 were poor earlier in their adult lives. Whether women are impoverished by adverse later-life events depends on their economic resources just prior to the event. But, the financial resources available in old age, in turn, depend very much on their long-term economic status throughout much of their adult lives. This article underscores the fact that for most older women, these adverse events do not appear to precipitate poverty spells--at least not within the first couple of years--and directs attention at longer term circumstances that make some women more vulnerable to poverty."

8350037,1,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To measure delay in admission to a large hospital and to study the role of social class and other potential determinants of delay. DESIGN: Interview of a 10% sample of newly diagnosed patients admitted to medical or surgical wards, and all those admitted for external hernia or colon cancer between June 1989 and May 1990. SETTING: The largest hospital in an Italian region of five million inhabitants. SUBJECTS: The study population consisted of 330 patients with a range of different medical and surgical conditions, 83 patients with external hernias, and 97 patients with colon cancers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After patient interview and discharge from hospital, the clinical record was consulted for information on the length of stay and the diagnosis, and in particular for the staging of hernia or colon cancer (according to the protocol of the Jefferson Medical College). Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. There was an association between advanced disease at hospital admission and the patient's educational level. In each of the three groups of patients, those with the highest educational level had a 30% or lower probability of being admitted to hospital with advanced disease compared with those with the lowest education level (after allowance for sex, age, area of residence, and marital status). CONCLUSION: Lower social class was associated with a more advanced clinical stage of hernia or colon cancer, and with a higher probability of urgent admission to the hospital for a newly diagnosed disease. Delay in seeking care, did not however, seem to explain the social class differentials for disease stage."
