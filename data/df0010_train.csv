26499771,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There is little evidence as to why or why not insurees decide to seek medical services. Steps prior to the entry of the insuree into the professional health care system have not been sufficiently examined and can only be partially described by secondary data of the statutory health insurance (SHI). We report the first investigation using case vignettes based on the generic health-related quality of life questionnaire EQ-5D as part of a choice study to assess insurees' stated preferences in health services utilization. METHODS: We invited 1500 randomly selected citizens (age 30 to 70 years) from the East German state of Saxony-Anhalt by postal mail to participate in the choice study. Attributes of the case vignettes involved in choice tasks were the five dimensions of the EQ-5D. We used multilevel mixed effects logit regression analysis with the dependent variables: preference to seek medical services (model 1) and preferred time until consultation (model 2) for the assessed case vignette. The EQ-5D attributes of the case vignettes and participant characteristics served as the independent variables. We also included the respondent's certainty of choosing from the choice set, and the order of questions of the questionnaire as control variables. RESULTS: Of the 1500 questionnaires 683 were evaluable (net response rate 48.0%). On the level of the case vignettes, problems in all five dimensions of the EQ-5D were statistically significant factors of the estimated likelihood to seek medical services (model 1). On the respondent level, there was a significant relationship between the preference for medical consultation for the assessed case vignette and the respondent's gender, age, educational level, the existence of a regular doctor, and the certainty of choosing from the choice set. Problems in four of the five dimensions of the EQ-5D (except anxiety/depression) of the case vignettes were significantly associated with the preferred time until consultation (model 2). On the respondent level, gender, educational level, the certainty of choosing from the choice set, and the order of questions of the questionnaire were significant determinants of the time until consultation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers a promising new approach for the national and cross-national study of preferences in health services utilization from the insurees' perspective."
28446253,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The present research aimed to investigate the efficacy of a multifaceted intervention that included motivational interviewing (MI) and psychoeducation in improving medication adherence (MA) among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). METHOD: A multicenter, cluster randomized, observer-blind, controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted in ten academic centers in Iran. Patients with BD were randomly assigned to the experimental group (EXP; n = 136) or the usual care group (UC; n = 134). The EXP group received five sessions of MI and psychoeducation together with their family members. The primary outcome measure was changes in scores on the Medication Adherence Rating Scale from baseline to 6 months post-intervention. Other outcome measures included serum levels of mood stabilizers, clinical symptoms, quality of life, as well as measures of intention, beliefs about medicine, perceived behavioral control, automaticity, action and coping planning, and adverse reactions. RESULTS: Medication adherence improved over time in both groups, but patients in the EXP group improved more (baseline score: 6.03; score at the sixth month: 9.55) than patients in the UC group (baseline score: 6.17; score at the sixth month: 6.67). In addition, patients in the EXP group showed greater improvement than patients in the UC group in almost all secondary outcomes 6 months following the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Multifaceted interventions that include motivational-interviewing and psychoeducation can significantly improve MA and clinical and functional outcomes in patients with BD. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The trial was registered with theClinicalTrials.gov database (NCT02241863) https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02241863."
24441832,0,a,"Limited data on smoking prevalence allowing valid between-country comparison are available in Europe. The aim of this study is to provide data on smoking prevalence and its determinants in 18 European countries. In 2010, within the Pricing Policies And Control of Tobacco in Europe (PPACTE) project, we conducted a face-to-face survey on smoking in 18 European countries (Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, England, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden) on a total of 18 056 participants, representative for each country of the population aged 15 years or older. Overall, 27.2% of the participants were current smokers (30.6% of men and 24.1% of women). Smoking prevalence was highest in Bulgaria (40.9%) and Greece (38.9%) and lowest in Italy (22.0%) and Sweden (16.3%). Smoking prevalence ranged between 15.7% (Sweden) and 44.3% (Bulgaria) for men and between 11.6% (Albania) and 38.1% (Ireland) for women. Multivariate analysis showed a significant inverse trend between smoking prevalence and the level of education in both sexes. Male-to-female smoking prevalence ratios ranged from 0.85 in Spain to 3.47 in Albania and current-to-ex prevalence ratios ranged from 0.68 in Sweden to 4.28 in Albania. There are considerable differences across Europe in smoking prevalence, and male-to-female and current-to-ex smoking prevalence ratios. Eastern European countries, lower income countries and those with less advanced tobacco control policies have less favourable smoking patterns and are at an earlier stage of the tobacco epidemic."
15797980,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic illness with an unpredictable and variable course, profoundly affects the quality of life (QOL). General health questionnaires are used to assess QOL in SLE, but a disease-specific instrument could offer enhanced responsiveness and content validity. We detail the steps we took to develop and validate a new SLE-specific QOL instrument, SLEQOL. METHODS: Rheumatology professionals nominated items that they felt were important determinants of QOL of SLE patients. One hundred SLE patients were asked to assess the importance and frequency of occurrence of these items and to suggest those that had not been listed. Item reduction was performed using Rasch model and factor analyses to create a new questionnaire in English. This final questionnaire was administered to a cohort of 275 patients to study its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Fifty-one items covering a wide range of QOL concerns were identified. The patients' responses led to the elimination of 11. The new questionnaire of 40 items was found to have Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 and to consist of eight domains covering physical, mental and social QOL issues. It has good test-retest reliability, poor to fair cross-sectional correlation with the SF-36, with poor correlation with lupus activity or damage indices. The SLEQOL was more responsive to change than the SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new 40-item SLEQOL in English and showed that it is valid for use in SLE patients in Singapore. It offers better content validity and responsiveness to change than the SF-36."
17929613,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The term Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) has been used since the 1980s. NORCs are defined as communities where people remain or move to when they retire. NORCs develop 'naturally', meaning that seniors tend to remain or move there when they retire, although the residences and physical environment were not constructed for a senior population. The term, Healthy-NORC, has been introduced and is associated with healthy aging. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: We describe how demographic trends will facilitate a dramatic growth in NORCs. Acknowledging the 'Determinants of Health' model, we suggest that some determinants impact people differently at different ages. We also suggest that more attention be focused on the impact of physical/social environments on health, and that some determinants of health are particularly relevant for seniors. We argue that NORCs exist on a spectrum, from NORC to H-NORC, and that health benefits for seniors increase as NORCs adopt additional characteristics associated with improved senior health. We also illustrate H-NORC research methods and policy options for local governments. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Compared to the provision of additional medical and social services, H-NORCs represent a low-cost approach to facilitating healthy aging. Municipal governments can promote healthy aging and should pursue policies that will stimulate H-NORC development."
16954510,1,a,"ISSUES: The Health Care Quality Indicator (HCQI) Project of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is aimed at developing a set of indicators for comparing the quality of health care across OECD member countries, requires a balanced conceptual framework that outlines the main concepts and domains of performance that should be captured for the current and subsequent phases of the project. ADDRESSING THE ISSUES: This article develops a conceptual framework for the OECD's HCQI Project. It first argues that developing such a framework should start by addressing the question, 'performance of what-and to what ends?' We identify at least two different major classes of frameworks: (i) health and (ii) health care performance frameworks, both of which are in common use. For the HCQI, we suggest a conceptual framework that is largely a purposeful modification of the existing performance frameworks and which is driven by the health determinants model. CONCLUSIONS: The conceptual basis for performance frameworks can be traced back to the health determinants model. A health performance framework takes a broader, societal or public health view of health determination, whereas a health care performance takes a narrower, mostly clinical or technical view of health care in relation to health (needs). This article proposes an HCQI framework that focuses on the quality of health care, maintains a broader perspective on health and its other determinants, and recognizes the key aims of health policy."
17315529,1,a,"BACKGROUND: There are conflicting findings regarding the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and bone mineral density. We aimed to investigate bone status and its possible determinants by comparing students from two schools, located in a high and a low SES district. METHODS: Data were gathered by using anthropometric measurements and a questionnaire for both families and the students from the two schools chosen by the Ministry of Education. Quantitative ultrasound measurements were done with Omnisense 700P. For normally distributed variables t-test and for others Mann-Whitney U test was utilized. We used the chi-squared test for nominal variables. RESULTS: Forty-two girls and 35 boys from a low SES school, and 41 girls and 38 boys from a high SES school were included in the study. Students in the high SES school had significantly higher calcium scores and more physical activity compared to those in the low SES school. Boys in the high SES school had higher z-scores for quantitative ultrasound; however, they had higher Tanner stages when compared to boys from the low SES school. Speed of sound (SOS) and z-scores of the girls were similar between the two schools. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the notion that certain environmental factors, such as calcium intake and physical activity, might reflect socioeconomic trends in adolescents, similar to adults; however, genetic influences may dominate in terms of bone status."
26168045,0,a,"The growing scarcity of water resources worldwide is conditioned not only by precipitation changes but also by changes to water use patterns; the latter is driven by social contexts such as capital intensity, trade openness, and income. This study explores the determinants of water use by focusing on the effect of trade openness on the degree to which water is withdrawn and consumed. Previous studies have conducted analyses on the determinants of water use but have ignored the endogeneity of trade openness. To deal with this endogeneity problem, we adopt instrumental variable estimation and clarify the determinants of water use. The determinants of water use are divided into scale, technique, and composition effects. Calculating each trade-induced effect, we examine how trade openness affects the degree of water use. Our results show that while trade has a positive effect on water withdrawal/consumption through trade-induced scale effects and direct composition effects, the trade-induced technique and the indirect composition effect, both of which exhibit a negative sign, counteract the scale effect and the direct composition effect, resulting in reduced water withdrawal/consumption. The overall effect induced by trade is calculated as being in the range of -1.00 to -1.52; this means that the overall effect of a 1% increase in the intensity of trade openness reduces the degree of water withdrawal/consumption by roughly 1.0-1.5%, on average. This result indicates that international bilateral trade would promote efficient water use through the diffusion of water-saving technologies and the reformation of industry composition."
11761316,1,a,"Two studies examined how ""syndromal"" approaches to assessment confound differences between individuals in the person and situation variables that contribute to their behavior. In a field study, a widely used instrument was found to be sensitive to the base rates of boys' aggression but, as expected, did not discriminate between boys who were similar in their behavior base rates but different in their social environments and how they responded to them. A laboratory experiment replicated this finding and demonstrated that social observers discriminated between targets on the basis of their functional properties even though syndrome scores did not. The results clarify how syndromal methods can obscure situational factors, conflict with people's social knowledge, and reinforce the view that syndromes exist ""in the individual"" rather than in person-environment interactions. Implications for developing more contextually sensitive instruments are discussed."
16053643,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence that demographic determinants, socioeconomic determinants, chronic diseases, and functional capacity have on self-rated health among elderly persons (60 years and older) living in the city of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and to investigate the existence of differences between men and women in terms of their self-rated health. METHODS: The study was carried out using data collected in the city of Sao Paulo as part of a project called Health, Well-being, and Aging in Latin America and the Caribbean (the ""SABE project""). We analyzed data on 2,135 elderly individuals (58.6% women; mean age, 69.4 years; median age, 68.0 years). The dependent variable was self-rated health (good or poor). The following independent variables were considered: (1) demographic ones (age, sex, marital status, and living arrangements (whether the elderly person lived alone or with others)), (2) socioeconomic ones (schooling and income), (3) the number of chronic diseases (hypertension, arthritis or rheumatism, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, bronchitis or emphysema, embolism or stroke, and cancer), and (4) functional capacity. To estimate the association between self-rated health and the independent variables and to study gender differences, a multiple binary logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The presence of chronic diseases in association with gender was the strongest determinant of self-rated health among the elderly in Sao Paulo. Among men with four or more chronic diseases, they were 10.53 times as likely to characterize their health as poor; among women with four or more chronic diseases, the ratio was 8.31. Functional capacity, schooling, and income were also strongly associated with self-rated health, and the influence of age was significant. The elderly women were more likely to report good self-rated health than were men when the women or men either had no chronic diseases or had two or more. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the need for simultaneous, comprehensive actions in the health sector, social services, and the economic sector to address the main determinants of self-rated health in order to promote well-being and quality of life among the elderly."
17176233,1,a,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: If they are to respond effectively to health inequities, organisations involved in health promotion need to refocus on the social determinants of health (SDH) and the distribution of resources for health. METHODS: This paper examines the potential of health promotion foundations (HPFs), a semi-autonomous arm of the state, to act at several policy and program intervention points to address the SDH and reduce health inequities. CONCLUSION: The public purpose, enterprise and innovation potential of health promotion foundations provides them with unique capacity to respond to SDH. In the complex and contested policy environment surrounding action on the determinants of health, the role that foundations can most usefully play is that of a change agent in a broader social movement seeking health equity."
11264268,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of self-rated health to a measure of physical status, based on a professional rating of the individual's health from a strictly physical point of view. METHODS: A random selection of 407 people over the age of 20 from the north-western catchment area of greater Stockholm were invited in 1995 to a physical examination, including a self-report questionnaire with questions about self-rated health, lifestyle, psychosocial factors and quality of life. A measure of physical health on a 5-point graded scale was constructed using the information from the records of the physical examination as a base. RESULTS: Self-rated health and the professional ratings of health coincided in approximately 60% of the cases. There were a relatively large number of cases where the ratings were contradictory. The correlation between the scales was 0.45. Comparison between the two ratings with respect to association with potential determinants showed that physical factors naturally explained most of the variances in physical health, whereas social and mental well-being and somatic conditions (women) were the most important explanatory variables for self-rated health. Irrespective of whether they had ""favourable"" or ""unfavourable"" health, those with ""poor"" self-rated health also had perceived lower social and mental well-being, less appreciation, more somatic conditions (women) and worse coping abilities (men). CONCLUSIONS: With mental, psychosocial and social problems becoming more pronounced in sickness patterns for primary care patients, self-rated health could be a helpful device, especially when time resources for consultations are short. This measure could also give a more global view of the patient's situation when effectivity and rationality can be a threat to a holistic view of the patient."
31744477,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC), the coexistence of two or more chronic conditions, is becoming more prevalent as the population ages. Primary care and home care providers play key roles in caring for older adults with MCC such as facilitating complex care decisions, shared decision-making, and access to community health and support services. While there is some research on the perceptions and experiences of these providers in caring for this population, much of this literature is focused specifically on family physicians. Little is known about the experiences of other primary care and home care providers from multiple disciplines who care for this vulnerable group. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of primary and home care healthcare providers in supporting the care of older adults with MCC living in the community, and identify ways of improving care delivery and outcomes for this group. METHODS: The study used an interpretive descriptive design. A total of 42 healthcare providers from two provinces in Canada (Ontario and Alberta) participated in individual semi-structured, face-to-face 60-min interviews. Participants represented diverse disciplines from primary care and home care settings. Inductive thematic analysis was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The experiences and recommendations of healthcare providers managing care for older adults with MCC were organized into six major themes: (1) managing complexity associated with MCC, (2) implementing person-centred care, (3), supporting caregivers, (4) using a team approach for holistic care delivery, (5) encountering challenges and rewards, and (6) recommending ways to address the challenges of the healthcare system. Healthcare providers identified the need for a more comprehensive, integrated system of care to improve the delivery of care and outcomes for older adults with MCC and their family caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that community-based healthcare providers are using many relevant and appropriate strategies to support older adults living with the complexity of MCC, such as implementing person-centred care, supporting caregivers, working collaboratively with other providers, and addressing social determinants of health. However, they also identified the need for a more comprehensive, integrated system of care."
11410405,1,a,"The major skeletal determinants of fracture risk are bone mass and postmenopausal bone loss with gradual destruction of trabecular bone architecture. Therefore, the management of osteoporosis is to prevent bone loss after menopause in women below 60 years of age. We need a screening test of bone mineral density (BMD) with the ability to identify correctly individuals with accelerated bone loss; unnecessary treatment has to be avoided. But without measurable extraskeletal factors, no technique assessing BMD as single test has the reasonable high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of fast bone losers. It is on principle the repeated volumetric bone measurement--within 12 months--in the pure trabecular bone, especially at distal radius of the non-dominant arm with the peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), being able to detect accurately the individuals as fast bone losers with trabecular bone loss > 8 mg/cm3 or > 3.5% per year (prevalence about 35%). Only women with very high trabecular BMD (in highest quintile) have no risk for osteoporosis."
15768772,1,a,"This is an exploratory study to examine the social and cultural determinants of the teaching of HIV/AIDS sex education among secondary school teachers in Eastern Nigeria. The research analyses how teachers perceive passing their knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention measures to their students in the context of their cultural and social norms, which restrict open discussion of sex. This is a qualitative study based on in-depth interviews with 60 teachers drawn from secondary school teachers in Eastern Nigeria, supplemented with five focus group discussions, and content analysis of teachers' lesson preparatory notes. The findings show a high level knowledge of HIV/AIDS preventive measures among teachers. However, teachers are not passing on this knowledge because of cultural and social inhibitions. In addition, teachers have not been receiving adequate training and motivation on information, education and communication for HIV/AIDS sex education. The situation calls for serious policy intervention."
18567407,1,a,"There are relatively few systematic investigations concerning sexual disorders in schizophrenia. In the paper, the most important set of symptoms of sexual disorders in schizophrenia, such as weaker libido, erection and ejaculation disturbances in men, and lubrication and orgasm disturbances in women are described. The lacking of satisfactory partner and sexual relationships is emphasized in the article. In the case of women, the most significant are the problems related to the period of pregnancy, childbirth and care giving. The overview of research literature is focused on differences between females and males in relation to sexual disorders determinants as well as clinical, mental and social effects in the course of schizophrenia."
19641993,0,a,"This paper concerns the medical, religious, and social discourse around abortion. The primary goal of this paper is to better understand how seven of the world's major religious traditions (Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Jewish, Islamic, Buddhist, Confucian, and Hindu) address abortion 'in the clinic'. We do not aim to critique these commentaries but to draw out some of the themes that resonate through the commentaries and place these within complex social contexts. We consider the intersection of ontology and morality; the construction of women's selfhood; the integration of religious beliefs and practices in a secular world. We suggest that for many women, religious doctrine may be balanced with secular logic as both are important and inextricably linked determinants of decision making about the termination of pregnancy."

30585640,0,a,"Gallstones, a common gastrointestinal condition, can lead to several digestive complications and can result in inflammation. Risk factors for gallstones include obesity, diabetes, smoking and physical inactivity, all of which are known risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC), as is inflammation. However, it is unclear whether gallstones are a risk factor for CRC. We examined the association between history of gallstones and CRC in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, a prospective cohort of over half a million participants from ten European countries. History of gallstones was assessed at baseline using a self-reported questionnaire. The analytic cohort included 334,986 participants; a history of gallstones was reported by 3,917 men and 19,836 women, and incident CRC was diagnosed among 1,832 men and 2,178 women (mean follow-up: 13.6 years). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between gallstones and CRC were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by sex, study centre and age at recruitment. The models were adjusted for body mass index, diabetes, alcohol intake and physical activity. A positive, marginally significant association was detected between gallstones and CRC among women in multivariable analyses (HR = 1.14, 95%CI 0.99-1.31, p = 0.077). The relationship between gallstones and CRC among men was inverse but not significant (HR = 0.81, 95%CI 0.63-1.04, p = 0.10). Additional adjustment for details of reproductive history or waist circumference yielded minimal changes to the observed associations. Further research is required to confirm the nature of the association between gallstones and CRC by sex."

By bypassing the effects of disparities, the POP-C intervention may help to decrease suffering among African American patients with cancer pain; consequently, it contributes to improving quality of life and addressing social and other determinants of health among members of this population. ."
21862532,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the trend in the association between socioeconomic status and sex and median age at death from cystic fibrosis in England and Wales, over the past 50 years. DESIGN: Series of annual cross sectional studies of all registered deaths with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in England and Wales, from 1959 to 2008. METHODS: We obtained national mortality data for cystic fibrosis from the Office for National Statistics. From 1959 to 2000, the Registrar General's Social Class coded socioeconomic status as manual or non-manual. From 2001 onwards, the National Statistics Socioeconomic Classification was implemented and socioeconomic status was split into three groups: professional and managerial, intermediate, and routine and manual. We calculated median age at death for every study year. We calculated the effects of sex and socioeconomic status on the odds of death above the median age at death for every study decade using logistic regression. RESULTS: From 1959 to 2008, 6750 deaths were attributed to cystic fibrosis in England and Wales. Males were more likely to die above the annual median age at death than females (from 1959 to 1999, adjusted odds ratio for socioeconomic status 1.28, 95% confidence intervals 1.13 to 1.45; from 2000 to 2008, 1.57, 1.18 to 2.08). Individuals in the highest socioeconomic class were also more likely to die above the median age of death than those in the lowest socioeconomic class (from 1959 to 2000, adjusted odds ratio for sex 2.50, 2.16 to 2.90; from 2001 to 2008, 1.89, 1.20 to 2.97). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic status and sex remain strong determinants of survival from cystic fibrosis in England and Wales, and the magnitude of these effects does not appear to have substantially reduced over time."
14765475,1,a,"This article is one of a series commissioned to mark the tenth anniversary of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, discussing past developments and future directions in areas of policy and law related to HIV/AIDS. It takes a critical look at Canada's drug policy. Despite calls for a balanced approach focused on reducing drug-related harm, Canada's method of dealing with problems of illicit drug use has remained prohibitionist in nature, and by far the greatest part of federal funding is devoted to supply-reduction initiatives. Considerable changes in policy and law are needed to significantly reduce the harms associated with injection drug use in Canada. These include developing a comprehensive and integrated strategy, exploring alternative legal frameworks, piloting innovative approaches to reducing injection-related harms, and investing in broad social policies that address the determinants of injection drug use."
10726937,1,a,"In order to understand and elicit the psychosocial factors influencing compliance with sexual partner referral, 10 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 40 individual interviews based on the attitude-social influence-self efficacy (ASE) model were held in Mbarara District of Uganda. The focus groups were derived from both rural and urban areas. Informal interviews were held with 20 men and 20 women presenting with symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease (STD) at the outpatient department of Mbarara Hospital. The emerging outcome of attitudinal beliefs regarding health consequences of partner referral were mainly positive. However, outcome beliefs relating to the relationship with the partners were mainly negative. Social influence for sexual partner referral was from health-care providers, partner(s), friends and relatives. The self-efficacy beliefs were mainly negative especially among women. Barriers hampering sexual partner referral were related to poor quality of health care, gender relations and type of sexual partners. There is a need to target these beliefs and self-efficacy expectations in health education and STD counselling and for more research to evaluate the psychosocial determinants of sexual partner referral quantitatively."
15353189,1,a,"The role of lifestyle in mediating the relationship between socio-economic characteristics and health has been discussed extensively in the epidemiological and economic literatures. Previous analyses have not considered a formal framework incorporating unobservable heterogeneity. In this paper, we develop a simple economic model in which health is determined (partially) by lifestyle, which depends on preferences, budget and time constraints and unobservable characteristics. We estimate a recursive empirical specification consisting of a health production function and reduced forms for the lifestyle equations using Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL) for a multivariate probit (MVP) model with discrete indicators of lifestyle choices and self-assessed health (SAH) on British panel data from the 1984 and 1991 Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS). We find that sleeping well, exercising, and not smoking in 1984 have dramatic positive effects on the probability of reporting excellent or good SAH in 1991, and that these effects are much larger having accounted for endogeneity. The failure of epidemiological analyses to account for unobserved heterogeneity can explain their low estimates of the relevance of lifestyle in the socio-economic status-health relationship. Indicators for prudent alcohol consumption and eating breakfast in 1984 are not found to be statistically significant determinants of SAH in 1991."
18573196,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Many youth fail to meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity. Walking and cycling, forms of active travel, have the potential to contribute significantly towards overall physical activity levels. Recent research examining the associations between physical activity and the environment has shown that environmental factors play a role in determining behaviour in children and adolescents. However, links between the environment and active travel have received less attention. METHODS: Twenty four studies were identified which examined the associations between the environment (perceived or objectively measured) and active travel among youth aged 5-18 years. Findings were categorised according to the location of the environmental measure examined; attributes of the neighbourhood, destination and the route between home and destination. RESULTS: Results from the reviewed studies indicated that youth active travel is positively associated with social interactions, facilities to assist active travel and urban form in the neighbourhood as well as shorter route length and road safety en-route. A conceptual framework is presented which highlights the associations between active travel behaviours and environmental factors, drawing upon both existing and hypothesised relationships. CONCLUSION: We provide a review of the available literature and present a novel theoretical framework that integrates the environment into the wider decision making process around travel choices for children and adolescents. Further work should explore associations where gaps in understanding have been identified, and account for the main moderators of behaviour so hypothesised associations can be confirmed."
11580765,1,a,"PURPOSE: Part of our research intended to explain ""Quality of Life"" (QoL) differences between people with epilepsy. To this end, a series of already existing generic and disease-specific health status measures were used. In this study, they were considered as determinants of people's QoL, whereas QoL itself was conceived as a general ""value judgment"" about one's life. METHODS: From the records of four outpatient clinics, 210 persons with epilepsy were randomly selected. During their visit to the outpatient clinic, they completed a questionnaire assessing, among other things, health perceptions and social and psychological functioning. Additional information about their medical and psychosocial status was gathered from the patient files. Data were analysed by using a hierarchical regression analysis. RESULTS: In decreasing order of importance, ""psychological distress,"" ""loneliness,"" ""adjustment and coping,"" and ""stigma perception"" appeared to contribute most significantly to the outcome QoL as judged by the patients themselves, regardless of their physical status. In the final model, none of the clinical variables (onset, seizure frequency, side effects of antiepileptic drugs) contributed significantly anymore to the patients' ""quality-of-life judgement."" Apparently the effect of other variables such as seizure frequency and health perceptions, medication and side effects, life fulfillment, self-esteem, and mastery is mediated by these variables. CONCLUSIONS: Because all of the variance in QoL of the patients was explained by the psychosocial variables included in this study, health professionals should be aware of the significance of the psychosocial functioning of the patients and the role it plays in the achievement of a good QoL. Both informal and professional support may be an adjunct to conventional treatment. In future research, this issue should be given high priority."
18556168,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this exploratory study was to test the applicability of a theoretical model to develop patient-related interventions. In this model knowledge, psychosocial mediators, self-efficacy and behaviour are determinants of patient-related interventions. METHODS: The model was tested on 278 patients with mild or moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recruited in a primary care setting. Hierarchical regression analyses were applied using data from self-reported questionnaires and clinical data from an electronic data registry. RESULTS: Knowledge, psychosocial mediators, self-efficacy and behaviour proved to be, to a moderate degree, predictors of outcomes in COPD care. Moreover, physical activity appeared to be a significant predictor for all clinical and functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: Theoretically expected associations of patient-related interventions are existent in patients with mild or moderate COPD. The application of theoretical models in designing patient-directed interventions in COPD care is therefore feasible. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: More attention should be paid to the patterns of physical activity in patients with mild to moderate COPD. The results of this study are also useful in the development of patient-related interventions. Future interventions should be designed along the lines of theory on behaviour change, such as social cognitive theory."
11565446,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The negative health effects of cigarette smoking are nowadays well known. An important prerequisite for the implementation of rewarding health promotion campaigns aiming at reducing the tobacco dependency in the general population is the knowledge about smoking prevalences in different social population groups, and specific information about social factors and determinants influencing smoking behaviour. METHODS: In this regard, the Microcensus is a very valuable data source for Germany. Included in the present analysis are persons aged 18 years and older, which are present in the ""Microcensus Public Use File 1995"" and had answered the questions about their smoking behaviour (N = 186,424). The dependent study variable is current cigarette smoking. Independent study variables are sociodemographic factors (age, sex, family status), occupational status, unemployment, socio-economic situation and regional-specific variables (size of community, East vs West Germany). RESULTS: All together, 30.5% of the males and 18.0% of the females were current smokers. Significantly higher smoking rates were observed for persons living in metropolitan areas, persons with low educational achievement and low occupational status, for people being divorced, unemployed, and living on social welfare. In a second step, we analysed the cumulative effect of these social factors for current smoking status. In summary, it was found that the cumulation of social determinants explained a great part of the variance in smoking prevalence. Current smoking was four to six times more prevalent in population groups characterised by several unfavourable social conditions compared to more privilege population groups. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, smoking related prevention activities should be evaluated, among others, regarding their potential to reduce the social polarisation of the smoking epidemic."
15629682,1,a,"Accidental drug overdose continues to be a substantial cause of mortality for drug users. Characteristics of the neighborhood built environment may be important determinants of the likelihood of drug overdose mortality independent of individual-level factors. Using data from the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, we conducted a multilevel case control study using data on accidental overdose deaths as cases and non-overdose accidental deaths as controls. We used archival data from the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey and the Mayor's Office of Operations to assess characteristics of neighborhood external (e.g. dilapidation of buildings) and internal (e.g. quality of utilities in houses) built environment. Multilevel analyses were used to assess the relations between the neighborhood built environment and the likelihood of overdose death. Six out of the eight characteristics of the external environment studied and three out of the six characteristics of the internal environment studied were significantly associated with the likelihood of fatal drug overdose in multilevel models after adjusting for individual-level (age, race, sex) and neighborhood-level (income, drug use) variables. Deterioration of the built environment, particularly the external environment, is associated with an increased likelihood of fatal accidental drug overdose. Disinvestment in social resources, psychosocial stressors, neighborhood differences in response to a witnessed overdose, and differences in vulnerability to the adverse consequences of drug use in different neighborhoods may explain the observed associations."
27342990,0,a,"Lower mental health functioning, unstable housing, and drug use can complicate HIV clinical management. Merging programmatic and surveillance data, we examined characteristics and outcomes for HIV Care Coordination clients enrolled between December 2009 and March 2013. For clients diagnosed over 12 months before enrollment, we calculated post- versus pre-enrollment relative risks for short-term (12-month) care engagement and viral suppression. Both outcomes significantly improved in all subgroups, including those with lower mental health functioning, unstable housing, or hard drug use. Analyses further stratified within barrier-affected groups showed a tendency toward greater improvement when that barrier was reduced during the follow-up year."
12830862,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors (eg, familiarity, sex, neutering status, and time of year) associated with aggression between domestic ferrets and test a method for reducing aggression when introducing ferrets. DESIGN: Prospective trial. ANIMALS: 56 healthy domestic ferrets. PROCEDURE: To identify variables associated with aggression, pairs were placed in an enclosed area and observed. To test whether increasing familiarity would decrease aggression when introducing ferrets, pairs of ferrets were housed in separate cages next to each other or in separate rooms for 2 weeks prior to introduction. RESULTS: 49 of 82 pairs of strangers fought, but 31 cage mate pairs did not. Time of year had no apparent effect. Pairs consisting of 2 neutered females or 2 sexually intact males were significantly more likely to fight than were pairs consisting of a neutered female and a sexually intact male. Pairs caged next to each other for 2 weeks prior to introduction were no less likely to fight than were control pairs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that familiarity, sex, and neutering status are important determinants of aggression between ferrets. If unfamiliar neutered ferrets are introduced, then pairing 2 males or a male and female would likely result in the lowest levels of aggression. However, neutered females and sexually intact males are not indiscriminately aggressive, as a neutered female can be paired with a sexually intact male without resulting in aggression. Caging ferrets next to each other for 2 weeks does not decrease aggression when the ferrets are introduced."
24957318,0,a,"Pandemic influenza represents an ongoing public health threat. Understanding the associated behavioural domain is vital for future intervention development. Cross-sectional qualitative research employing purposive sampling employed a combination of one-to-one semi-structured interviews (n = 57) and focus groups (n = 59). Data were analysed using (1) inductive thematic analysis and (2) theoretical thematic analysis focusing upon resonance with psychosocial and sociocultural constructs. Two broad themes highlighted an important duality regarding the determinants of pandemic behaviour: (1) psychosocial determinants (e.g. agency, cognitions and identity) and (2) sociocultural determinants (e.g. social context and capacity). These findings suggest this duality should shape future intervention development."
17020496,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Profound advances in biomedical science have contributed to increased longevity and improved quality of life for many Americans. Despite this progress, a heavier burden of disease is borne by some population groups in the United States, particularly the poor and underserved. Landmark reports published since 1973 have highlighted these health disparities, explored their causal factors, and outlined strategies to reduce them. More recent research studies underscore the results of these early reports that identify social position, economic status, culture, and environment as critical determinants of who develops and survives cancer and of the quality of life of cancer survivors. METHODS: The Patient Navigation Program was established in Harlem, New York, in 1990 to address the dramatic disparities in breast cancer mortality among minority women in the community. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The success of the Harlem Patient Navigation Program has provided the impetus for the development of many similar patient navigation programs across the country and for federal support for Patient Navigation research to address the critical need for effective interventions to eliminate cancer health disparities, particularly among minorities and the underserved."
28637091,0,a,"AIM(S): To explore nurse managers' behaviours, attitudes, perceived social norms, and behavioural control in the prevention and management of patient and visitor aggression in general hospitals. BACKGROUND: Patient and visitor aggression in general hospitals is a global problem that incurs substantial human suffering and organizational cost. Managers are key persons for creating low-aggression environments, yet their role and behaviours in reducing patient and visitor aggression remains unexplored. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study underpinned by the Reasoned Action Approach. METHOD(S): Between October 2015-January 2016, we conducted five focus groups and 13 individual interviews with nurse leaders in Switzerland. The semi-structured interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analysed in a qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: We identified three main themes: (i) Background factors: ""Patient and visitor aggression is perceived through different lenses""; (ii) Determinants and intention: ""Good intentions competing with harsh organizational reality""; (iii) Behaviours: ""Preventing and managing aggressive behaviour and relentlessly striving to create low-aggression work environments"". CONCLUSION(S): Addressing patient and visitor aggression is difficult for nurse managers due to a lack of effective communication, organizational feedback loops, protocols, and procedures that connect the situational and organizational management of aggressive incidents. Furthermore, tackling aggression at an organizational level is a major challenge for nurse managers due to scant financial resources and lack of interest. Treating patient and visitor aggression as a business case may increase organizational awareness and interest. Furthermore, clear communication of expectations, needs and resources could optimize support provision for staff."
27232878,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Socially disadvantaged people have an increased need for medical care due to a higher burden of health problems and chronic diseases. In Germany, outpatient care is chiefly provided by office-based general practitioners and specialists in private practice. People are free to choose the physician they prefer. In this study, national data were used to examine differences in the use of outpatient medical care by socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: The analyses were based on data from 6,754 participants in the Robert Koch Institute's German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1) aged between 18 and 69 years. The number of outpatient physician visits during the past twelve months was assessed for several medical specializations. SES was determined based on education, occupation, and income. Associations between SES and physician visits were analysed using logistic regression and zero-truncated negative binomial regression for count data. RESULTS: After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health indicators, outpatients with low SES had more contacts with general practitioners than outpatients with high SES (men: incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.46; women: IRR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.07-1.34). The use of specialists was lower in people with low SES than in those with high SES when sociodemographic factors and health indicators were adjusted for (men: odds ratio [OR] = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.51-0.91; women: OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.41-0.77). This applied particularly to specialists in internal medicine, dermatology, and gynaecology. The associations remained after additional adjustment for the type of health insurance and the regional density of office-based physicians. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that socially disadvantaged people are seen by general practitioners more often than the socially better-off, who are more likely to visit a medical specialist. These differences may be due to differences in patient preferences, physician factors, physician-patient interaction, and potential barriers to accessing specialist care."
22824498,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of tuberculosis has been shown to influence health seeking behaviour; and urban slum dwellers are at a higher risk of acquiring tuberculosis than the general population. The study aim was to assess knowledge of tuberculosis and identify the associated socio-demographic determinants, in order to inform tailored interventions for advocacy, communication and social mobilisation in three urban-slum communities of Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 1361 adults between April and October 2011. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of potential determinants of tuberculosis (TB) knowledge were estimated by multivariable ordinal logistic regression using Stata 11.2 software. RESULTS: We found low knowledge of TB cause (26.7%); symptoms (46.8%), transmission (54.3%), prevention (34%) and free treatment (35%). Knowledge about TB treatment (69.4) and cure (85.1) was relatively high. Independent determinants of poor knowledge of TB in the multivariable analysis included (aOR, 95% CI) lack of formal education (0.56; 0.38 - 0.83, P = 0.004), unemployment (0.67; 0.49 - 0.90, P = 0.010) and never testing for HIV (0.69; 0.51 - 0.92, P < 0.012). Whilst, older age (1.73; 1.30 - 2.29, P < 0.001) and residing in Lira (2.02; 1.50 - 2.72, P < 0.001) were independent determinants of higher knowledge of TB. CONCLUSION: This study revealed deficiencies in the public health knowledge about TB symptoms, diagnosis and treatment among urban-slum dwellers in Uganda. Tuberculosis control programmes in similar settings should consider innovative strategies for TB education, advocacy, communication and social mobilisation to reach the youth, unemployed and less-educated; as well as those who have never tested for HIV."
16365074,1,a,"Size at birth and early postnatal growth are determinants of adult height and BMI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of birth weight on body composition and fat distribution in a group of Spanish adolescents. Current body composition was assessed by both skinfold thickness and dual X-ray absorptiometry in 234 adolescents born at term (140 girls and 94 boys), now aged 13-18 y and living in the city of Zaragoza. Relative fat distribution was estimated using the ratio of the subscapular to triceps skinfolds (S:T). Birth weight and gestational age were assessed by a questionnaire. Birth weight was inversely associated with the S:T ratio (P < 0.05) in boys and directly associated with bone mass (P < 0.01) and fat-free mass (P < 0.05) in girls. This association was independent of factors such as age, Tanner stage, gestational age, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and height. In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that impaired fetal growth, measured by birth weight, may be related to central fat distribution in boys and decreased bone and fat-free mass in girls."
30132381,0,a,"The quality of decision and assessment of risk are key determinants of successful sport performance. Athletes differ fundamentally in their decision-making ability according to their athletic expertise level. Moreover, given the influence of emotions on decision-making, it is likely that a trait reflecting emotional functioning, trait emotional intelligence, may also influence decision-making. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the respective contribution of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence to non-athletic decision-making. In total, 269 participants aged between 18 and 26 years with a range of athletic experience i.e. none (n = 71), novice (n = 54), amateur (n = 55), elite (n = 45) and super-elite (n = 44), completed the Emotional Intelligence Scale and the Cambridge Gambling Task. Regression modelling indicated a significant positive relationship of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence with the quality of decision-making, and a negative relationship with deliberation time and risk-taking. Cognitive skills transfer may explain the higher decision-making scores associated with higher athletic expertise, while individuals with higher trait emotional intelligence may anticipate better the emotional consequences linked with a gambling task, which may help individuals make better decisions and take less risks."
19195421,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To explore knowledge, attitudes and behaviours regarding caloric soft drinks in a group of young adults attending university and to identify opportunities for a health promotion intervention aimed at reducing consumption. DESIGN: In-depth, semi-structured focus groups segmented by gender. SETTING: Sydney, Australia. SUBJECTS: Undergraduate University of Sydney students aged 18-30 years (n 35). RESULTS: Social and environmental cues, intrinsic qualities of beverages and personal health beliefs were identified as important influences on consumption. Social cues included settings in which alcohol is usually consumed, socialising with friends, and family influences. Environmental cues included purchasing of fast foods, and ready availability, preferential pricing and promotion of caloric beverages. Reinforcing intrinsic qualities of caloric soft drinks included taste, sugar and caffeine content, and their association with treats and rewards. Major gender differences as well as variations in individual readiness for behaviour change were observed. Raising awareness of the sugar content of various beverages and the potential health impacts associated with their consumption was considered important. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide new insights with important implications for policy and practice, and suggest that there is considerable scope for promoting awareness in this group. Carefully designed social marketing campaigns highlighting the health issues and addressing social and environmental cues relating to caloric soft drink consumption are required. There is a need for gender-differentiated intervention programmes which are both informational and appealing to young adults. Further research is warranted, particularly to investigate beverage consumption relating to fast-food meal deals and young adults' consumption patterns in more depth."
19369822,1,a,"Disclosure of HIV serostatus remains an important tool for the prevention of new infections and early initiation of treatment for HIV-positive individuals' regular sexual partners. Our aim is to identify factors associated with disclosure to partner in patients taking antiretroviral treatment, with a gender- and sex-based approach. In this study conducted in Mali and Burkina Faso, men (154) and women (164) who reported being in a marital or cohabitating relationship were included. Sex-specific bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify determinants of disclosure. Disclosure to partner was 72.1% in men and 79.9% in women. Results of bivariate and multivariate analyses indicated that cohabiting with partner was strongly associated with disclosure in both men and women. In men only, older age, literacy and having good communication with the treating doctor were significantly associated with disclosure. Among women, disclosure was associated with having children and high self-reported importance of religion. Future research and interventions promoting disclosure should take into account these differences reflecting the social construction of gender roles in these settings."
22517529,0,a,"Medical waste management (MWM) is an important public health concern worldwide. Although physicians must participate in medical waste management, their personal and organizational predictors in this process are unknown. This study aimed to the determinants of physicians' knowledge, attitudes and practices related to MWM in eight hospitals of Mazandaran province, northern Iran. A validated, reliable self-administered questionnaire was used including 30 questions about the respondents' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) and personal and professional variables. Of a total of 200 physicians, 150 persons completed the questionnaire (response rate of 75%). The average score (+/- SD) for physicians' knowledge was 6.50 (+/- 1.50) out of 10, whereas those for attitudes and practices were 4.44 (+/- 0.88) and 4.02 (+/- 1.35) out of 5, respectively. Surgeons and orthopaedists had the lowest scores, whereas para-clinical specialists and internal medicine specialists had the highest scores. The score of knowledge showed significant differences among speciality groups and the various speciality groups' scores differed significantly only for knowledge (P = 0.024) and the mean of total KAP was significantly different between educational and non-educational hospitals (P < 0.05). As hospital type and physician speciality was related to the KAP concerning MWM, therefore it is recommend that all hospitals should develop appropriate protocols for medical waste management based on the this variables using a participatory process with teamwork and continuous training."
15864975,1,a,"INTRODUCTION: Delays in providing effective treatment for a patient with psychosis has significant negative effects on the outcome. This includes more hospitalizations, longer periods of inpatient care, slower and less complete recovery, and more frequent relapses. In this study, we established the Duration of Psychosis (DUP) in a sample of patients with first-episode psychosis and examined the pathways to care. METHODS: The sample comprised patients presenting with first-episode psychosis to the psychiatric services of the Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, from January to December 2000. The association between the DUP and demographic, clinical and social variables was examined. RESULTS: The DUP ranged from 0.1 to 336 months. The mean DUP was 32.6 (SD = 59.8) months, with a median of 12 months. Twenty four percent of the patients had sought consultation with a traditional healer prior to consulting a psychiatrist. The DUP of this group of patients was not significantly different from those who sought help elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: The DUP of our patients was longer than that reported in studies done in the West. The attitudes and beliefs of family in the Asian society are likely to be crucial in the pathways to care."
16078556,1,a,"This article reviews current literature and research on literacy and health and identifies priorities for research on this topic in Canada. Information sources included documents found through an environmental scan, the Alpha Plus collection and a computer search of recent documents. The information was analyzed using a conceptual framework. The review found that low literacy has direct and indirect impacts on health. Families are at risk due to difficulty reading medication prescriptions, baby formula instructions and health and safety education materials. People with lower levels of literacy tend to live and work in less healthy environments. They have more difficulties obtaining employment and income security. Determinants of literacy include: education, early childhood development, aging, living and working conditions, personal capacity/genetics, gender and culture. Action is needed to improve literacy and health through a combination of health communication, education and training, community development, organizational development, and policy development. There is some evidence that such interventions can have a positive effect on health, particularly when combined with one another. Further program and policy development requires greater evidence and evaluation of existing initiatives, more cost/benefit analyses, more culturally specific studies, and greater attention to current social trends and needs."
16122570,1,a,"Recent findings support and add to earlier findings of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Deficits across neurocognitive domains such as attention, working memory, language skills, and executive functioning tend to be moderate, with the most pronounced deficits found in verbal learning and memory. All these neurocognitive domains are related to adaptive and social skills, with executive functions and verbal learning and memory showing more variance across more domains than other neuro-cognitive variables. Negative symptoms and neurocognitive domains, although correlated, are distinct and have differential pathways of change with treatment. General psychopathology symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, may become important treatment targets as strategies are developed for translating cognitive enhancement to real-world functional performance."
28427389,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Malaria risk can vary markedly between households in the same village, or between villages, but the determinants of this ""micro-epidemiological"" variation in malaria risk remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify factors that explain fine-scale variation in malaria risk across settings and improve definitions and methods for malaria micro-epidemiology. METHODS: A systematic review of studies that examined risk factors for variation in malaria infection between individuals, households, clusters, hotspots, or villages in any malaria-endemic setting was conducted. Four databases were searched for studies published up until 6th October 2015. Crude and adjusted effect estimates for risk factors for malaria infection were combined in random effects meta-analyses. Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. RESULTS: From 743 retrieved records, 51 studies were selected, representing populations comprising over 160,000 individuals in 21 countries, in high- and low-endemicity settings. Sixty-five risk factors were identified and meta-analyses were conducted for 11 risk factors. Most studies focused on environmental factors, especially increasing distance from a breeding site (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.86-0.92, 10 studies). Individual bed net use was protective (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.77, 12 studies), but not household bed net ownership. Increasing household size (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15, 4 studies) and household crowding (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.48-2.16, 4 studies) were associated with malaria infection. Health seeking behaviour, medical history and genetic traits were less frequently studied. Only six studies examined whether individual-level risk factors explained differences in malaria risk at village or hotspot level, and five studies reported different risk factors at different levels of analysis. The risk of bias varied from low to high in individual studies. Insufficient reporting and comparability of measurements limited the number of meta-analyses conducted. CONCLUSIONS: Several variables associated with individual-level malaria infection were identified, but there was limited evidence that these factors explain variation in malaria risk at village or hotspot level. Social, population and other factors may confound estimates of environmental risk factors, yet these variables are not included in many studies. A structured framework of malaria risk factors is proposed to improve study design and quality of evidence in future micro-epidemiological studies."
15662576,1,a,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To date, there have been several prospective cohort studies investigating the workplace experiences of junior physicians, but with limited focus on gender issues. The objective of the present study is to explore the workplace experiences of first-year residents according to gender, type of training hospital, and clinical field. METHODS: Data reported are from the second assessment of the longitudinal Swiss physicians' career development study, begun in 2001. In 2003, 497 residents (54.7% females, 45.3% males) assessed their workplace conditions, social support at work, and effort-reward imbalance. RESULTS: There are few, but relevant, gender related differences in workplace experiences, with female physicians experiencing less mentoring and higher over-commitment, yet more positive social relationships at work. In a multivariate model, significant differences in some workplace variables with regard to type of training hospital and/or clinical field are found: workplace conditions are rated worse in type ""A"" hospitals (university and cantonal hospitals) than in type ""B""/""C""/""D"" hospitals (regional hospitals and highly specialised units), and in surgical fields than in internal medicine. In ""A"" hospitals mentoring is assessed as better, but positive social relationships as worse. Both scales are rated worse in surgical fields than in internal medicine. The effort-reward imbalance (ERI) is rated significantly higher (unfavourable) in ""A"" hospitals than in ""B""/""C""/""D"" hospitals, regardless of gender and clinical field. Significantly more subjects with an ERI quotient above 1 (which is unfavourable) work in ""A"" hospitals, and in surgical fields regardless of hospital type. Of the total sample, 81 subjects (16.3%), 41 males and 40 females, show an ERI quotient above 1. The greater the workload, the worse the rating of workplace conditions, effort-reward imbalance, and over-commitment. CONCLUSION: Institutional determinants are crucial factors for the workplace experiences and first career steps of junior physicians. Medical educators, especially those in ""A"" hospitals, should become more involved in structured residency programs and be aware of potential gender inequalities in the career support of female physicians."
29635335,0,a,"Background: The French Chronic Kidney Disease-Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (CKD-REIN) cohort study was designed to investigate the determinants of prognosis and care of patients referred to nephrologists with moderate and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). We examined their baseline risk profile and experience. Methods: We collected bioclinical and patient-reported information from 3033 outpatients with CKD and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) of 15-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 treated at 40 nationally representative public and private facilities. Results: The patients' median age was 69 (60-76) years, 65% were men, their mean eGFR was 33 mL/min/1.73 m2, 43% had diabetes, 24% had a history of acute kidney injury (AKI) and 57% had uncontrolled blood pressure (BP; >140/90 mmHg). Men had worse risk profiles than women and were more likely to be past or current smokers (73% versus 34%) and have cardiovascular disease (59% versus 42%), albuminuria >30 mg/mmol (or proteinuria > 50) (40% versus 30%) (all P < 0.001) and a higher median risk of end-stage renal disease within 5 years, predicted by the kidney failure risk equation {12% [interquartile range (IQR) 3-37%] versus 9% [3-31%], P = 0.008}. During the previous year, 60% of patients reported one-to-two nephrologist visits and four or more general practitioner visits; only 25% saw a dietician and 75% were prescribed five or more medications daily. Physical and mental quality of life (QoL) were poor, with scores <50/100. Conclusions: The CKD-REIN study highlights high-risk profiles of cohort members and identifies several priorities, including improving BP control and dietary counselling and increasing doctors' awareness of AKI, polypharmacy and QoL. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03381950."
16273992,1,a,"Most studies investigating correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregiver burden have focused on the role of objective factors as opposed to subjective factors. Although objective variables (e.g., caregiver age, patient dementia severity, functional status) have been shown to be significantly associated with burden, the correlations generally are modest and explain relatively little of the variability in caregiver outcomes. Moreover, many of these objective variables are not modifiable and are of limited use in the development of caregiver interventions. Thus, there continues to be a need to identify powerful and modifiable determinants of caregiver burden. This study examined the role of two subjective factors-self-efficacy and depressive symptoms-as predictors of AD caregiver burden. Based on a sample of 80 AD caregivers, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that self-efficacy and depressive symptoms each had a significant independent effect on the experience of burden even after accounting for objective factors. These findings suggest that caregiver interventions aimed to reduce burden may benefit from the incorporation of specific strategies to increase self-efficacy and decrease depressive symptoms."
15296585,1,a,"Understanding determinants of mothers' decisions regarding long-term breastfeeding is important for the promotion of breastfeeding for up to 12 months postpartum and beyond. In this longitudinal infant feeding study, the theory of planned behavior was used to explain the intended and actual breastfeeding duration of 80 participants who were breastfeeding 9-month-old infants. Participants perceived less approval for breastfeeding the longer they breastfed. Perceived approval did not explain prenatal intended duration but strongly explained intended duration at 9 months postpartum. The amount of control mothers perceived they had over breastfeeding, however, explained both prenatal and 9-month breastfeeding duration intentions. Reasons for weaning between 9 and 12 months reflected the effects of perceived control but not of perceived approval. These results suggest the need for (1) interventions to increase the social acceptability of long-term breastfeeding and (2) ongoing breastfeeding guidance and support for long-term breastfeeders."
17307955,1,a,"This paper advocates that mental health promotion receive appropriate attention within health promotion. It is of great concern that, in practice, mental health promotion is frequently overlooked in health promotion programmes although the WHO definitions of health and the Ottawa Charter describe mental health as an integral part of health. It is suggested that more attention be given to addressing the determinants of mental health in terms of protective and risk factors for both physical and mental conditions, particularly in developing countries. Examples of evidence-based mental health programmes operating in widely diverse settings are presented to demonstrate that well designed interventions can contribute to the well-being of populations. It is advocated that particular attention be given to the intersectorial cooperation needed for this work."
25709700,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Midwifery cares take place in diverse communities with different ethnics groups. Therefore, midwifery cares could be planned wisely and principally based on women's and their families' changeable demands which focus on social and cultural issues. This qualitative study explored the midwives' experiences of care in the community. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted by descriptive phenomenological approach. The subjects, selected by purposive sampling, comprised 13 midwives employed in Isfahan, Iran. Semi-structured interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and simultaneously analyzed through Colaizzi's method. RESULTS: With descriptive analysis of participants' experiences, three main themes were explored (personal characteristics of the community midwife, social determinants of women's health, and achieving community-based midwifery skills). CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of women's social status, gender inequality in health, and existence of social health risk factors for women in their community helps midwives to provide reproductive health care based on clients' needs and demands. Therefore, midwives should enhance the quality of their care through integrating professional skills with a full understanding of the social context."
26416016,0,a,"HIV risk in vulnerable groups such as itinerant male street labourers is often examined via a focus on individual determinants. This study provides a test of a modified Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model to predict condom use behaviour among male street workers in urban Vietnam. In a cross-sectional survey using a social mapping technique, 450 male street labourers from 13 districts of Hanoi, Vietnam were recruited and interviewed. Collected data were first examined for completeness; structural equation modelling was then employed to test the model fit. Condoms were used inconsistently by many of these men, and usage varied in relation to a number of factors. A modified IMB model had a better fit than the original IMB model in predicting condom use behaviour. This modified model accounted for 49% of the variance, versus 10% by the original version. In the modified model, the influence of psychosocial factors was moderately high, whilst the influence of HIV prevention information, motivation and perceived behavioural skills was moderately low, explaining in part the limited level of condom use behaviour. This study provides insights into social factors that should be taken into account in public health planning to promote safer sexual behaviour among Asian male street labourers."
10984986,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Self-perceived class results from directly questioning subjects about his or her social class. The aim of this investigation was to analyse self-perceived class in relation to other indicator variables of socioeconomic level. METHODS: Data from the 1994 Catalan Health Interview Survey, a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of the non-institutionalised population of Catalonia was used. We conducted a discriminant analysis to compute the degree of right classification when different socioeconomic variables potentially related to self-perceived class were considered. All subjects who directly answered the questionnaire were included (N = 12,245). With the aim of obtaining the discriminant functions in a group of subjects and to validate it in another one, the subjects were divided into two random samples, containing approximately 75% and 25% of subjects (analysis sample, n = 9,248; and validation sample, n = 2,997). RESULTS: The final function for men and women included level of education, social class (based in occupation) and equivalent income. This function correctly classified 40.9% of the subjects in the analysis sample and 39.2% in the validation sample. Two other functions were selected for men and women separately. In men, the function included level of education, professional category, and family income (39.2% of classification in analysis sample and 37.2% in validation sample). In women, the function (level of education, working status, and equivalent income) correctly classified 40.3% of women in analysis sample whereas the percentage was 38.9% in validation sample. The percentages of right classification were higher for the highest and lowest classes. CONCLUSION: These results show the utility of a simple variable to self-position within the social scale. Self-perceived class is related to education, income, and working determinants."
19451199,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Despite a high prevalence of smoking for decades, recent research has documented an increase in the rates of both male and female smoking in post-Soviet Russia. As yet, however, little research has taken place on smoking at the subnational level. The current study addresses this deficit by examining smoking in Moscow -- the city that has been at the forefront of the entry into the Russian market of transnational tobacco corporations (TTCs) in the transition period. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Moscow Health Survey 2004 -- a stratified random sample of 1190 people representative of Moscow's larger population. Information was obtained about subjects' smoking habits and age of smoking initiation. RESULTS: The prevalence of smoking was high among both men (55.5%) and women (26.9%), with significantly higher rates in the younger age groups. There was also a high prevalence of smoking initiation before age 15 years, especially in the youngest women (18-30 years). Logistic regression analysis showed that respondents' age, binge drinking, locus of control and economic situation were important determinants of smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Although lifestyle factors seem to underpin the generally high levels of smoking, other things, such as its high prevalence in the younger generations and the factors associated with smoking (locus of control), nevertheless suggest that the TTCs may have played an important role in the spread of smoking in transitional Russia's changing social environment."
30760829,0,a,"Neuropsychiatric disease has polygenic determinants but is often precipitated by environmental pressures, including adverse perinatal events. However, the way in which genetic vulnerability and early-life adversity interact remains obscure. We hypothesised that the extreme environmental stress of prematurity would promote neuroanatomic abnormality in individuals genetically vulnerable to psychiatric disorders. In 194 unrelated infants (104 males, 90 females), born before 33 weeks of gestation (mean gestational age 29.7 weeks), we combined Magnetic Resonance Imaging with a polygenic risk score (PRS) for five psychiatric pathologies to test the prediction that: deep grey matter abnormalities frequently seen in preterm infants are associated with increased polygenic risk for psychiatric illness. The variance explained by the PRS in the relative volumes of four deep grey matter structures (caudate nucleus, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and lentiform nucleus) was estimated using linear regression both for the full, mixed ancestral, cohort and a subsample of European infants. Psychiatric PRS was negatively associated with lentiform volume in the full cohort (beta = -0.24, p = 8 x 10(-4)) and a European subsample (beta = -0.24, p = 8 x 10(-3)). Genetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric disease increase vulnerability to abnormal lentiform development after perinatal stress and are associated with neuroanatomic changes in the perinatal period."
10962782,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle advice from general practitioners (GPs) has been shown to have a positive effect on population health. In practice, GPs provide lifestyle advice to a minority of their patients only, those who are high risk or already have symptoms. AIM: To look in depth at GPs' attitudes towards adopting a population approach to lifestyle advice and to use these results to identify ways of maximising the potential of GPs to affect population health. METHOD: Thirty-six GPs, purposively sampled by identifying characteristics likely to affect their health promotion activity, participated in a focus group study. Data from the focus groups were transcribed verbatim and analysed using standard methods. RESULTS: The main themes that emerged suggested that GPs do not take a population approach to lifestyle advice because they prefer a high risk approach and doubt their ability to be effective in a population approach. GPs believed that social, cultural, and environmental factors were the most important determinants of population health. Furthermore, they were concerned about the detrimental effects on the doctor-patient relationship of providing lifestyle advice to all patients. GPs believed that a multi-agency, centrally co-ordinated approach was the preferred way to improve population health and that their role should be limited to secondary prevention. CONCLUSION: Large amounts of resources would be necessary to convince GPs to adopt a population approach to lifestyle advice. Measures to tackle the social and environmental determinants of health may be a more effective and efficient means of improving the nation's health."
23681268,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics, driven by antibiotic consumption, imposes a major threat to the effective treatment of bacterial infections. In addition to reducing the amount of antibiotics prescribed, avoiding broad-spectrum antibiotics could extend the lifetime of the current arsenal of antibiotic substances. Therefore, we documented prescriber and patient characteristics associated with the choice between amoxicillin and broader-spectrum alternatives (co-amoxiclav or moxifloxacin) in recent years in Belgium. METHODS: Complete reimbursement claims data (2002-09) for antibiotic prescriptions in outpatient care, including patient and prescriber characteristics, were collected for both young children (1-5 years) and the adult population (30-60 years). A backwards selection procedure within generalized estimating equations retained the most relevant determinants. RESULTS: The age, gender and social category of the patient were found to be predictive of the extent to which amoxicillin was prescribed instead of the broader-spectrum alternatives, with female patients generally taking a higher proportion of amoxicillin than male patients. The age category of 40-44-year-old prescribers exhibited a preference for broad-spectrum antibiotics compared with both younger and older age groups. Significant interactions between the region and the prescriber's qualification (general practitioner or paediatrician) on the choice of antibiotic for children were found. CONCLUSIONS: Patient (age, gender and social category) and prescriber characteristics (age, gender, region and qualification) had an influence on whether amoxicillin or the alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed. These findings should help policy makers to better target future campaigns to promote prudent prescribing of antibiotics."
20107704,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess and analyze the associations between adherence to treatment and social position in women living with HIV/AIDS. METHOD: A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study among 269 Colombian women was conducted. Participants completed three questionnaires: a socio-demographic and clinical characteristics survey, a treatment adherence scale, and a social position survey. RESULTS: Women of low social position had a significantly higher probability of low treatment adherence (OR = 5.651, P < 0.0001), and the majority of social position variables measured had a significant effect on adherence. A general model considering the variables 'type of national health care plan' ('contributive,' 'subsidized,' or, in the case of vinculadas or the uninsured, 'none'); 'having HIV-positive children'; and 'level of viral load' was statistically reliable in predicting study participants' treatment adherence. Membership in the subsidized plan or being uninsured had a greater effect on the probability of low adherence than membership in the contributive plan (OR = 3.478, P < 0.0001). Univariate regression analyses confirmed that women with HIV-positive children and a viral load > 400 copies/ml were more likely to have low adherence than women without those characteristics (OR = 2.395, P = 0.0274 and OR = 2.178, P = 0.0050, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Improving women's adherence to HIV/AIDS treatment in Colombia would require eliminating barriers to national health care system and comprehensive health care services and implementing programs that take into account women's role as maternal caregivers The findings underscore the need to integrate variables related to gender inequality and social position in treatment adherence analysis, as advocated in the social determinants of health approach."
30183970,0,a,"OBJECTIVE : Perform a literature review about systems of sanitary and epidemiological surveillance for frontier zones and the points of entry of Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS : A systematic literature review using the Prisma methodology, MeSH and DECS terms, was developed in PubMed and BVS bibliographic databases between 2000 and 2014. We included 51 documents according to inclusion-exclusion criteria and we proposed and discussed these categories: health services, mental health, health status and social determinants. RESULTS : The analysis makes it possible to evidence that the epidemiological and sanitary surveillance of borders and entry points worldwide, focused mainly on axes such as mental health, transmissible events and events of non-communicable conditions. In addition, the importance of comprehensive care in health services, as well as the analysis of the health status of immigrant population under the territorial, ethnic and cultural differential approach. However, there are few experiences with a social determinants analysis in borders zone and / or entry points. CONCLUSIONS : Differences in the context, health systems, information systems and priorities of each country make the exchange and cooperation between borders challenging. It is necessary to have instruments of cooperation between neighboring countries and a common information based on the Social Determinants of Health."
16810371,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze sociodemographic inequalities in prenatal and childbirth care and their consequences on birth weight. METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 10,072 postpartum women treated at public (those outsourced by the National Health System) and private maternity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1999 to 2001. To test the association between birth weight and maternal sociodemographic and biological characteristics and prenatal care (modified Kotelchuck index), postpartum women were stratified by level of schooling and two multiple linear regressions were performed. The bootstrap technique was used in addition to accurate confidence intervals for the estimated effects. RESULTS: For nearly all of the variables analyzed in the bivariate analysis, birth weight was lower among children of mothers with low schooling. In the multivariate analysis, among women with low schooling, there was a direct association between birth weight and the modified Kotelchuck index and gestational age. The variables black skin color, smoking, and history of premature birth were negatively associated with birth weight, while maternal age and parity showed distinct behaviors from the central range of data at the extremes. In the group with high schooling, only parity, gestational age, and modified Kotelchuck index were significant and directly associated with birth weight. The protective effect of prenatal care was observed, as well as the negative effect of smoking, regardless of the mother's level of schooling. CONCLUSIONS: The variables associated with neonates' birth weight of mothers with high schooling in Rio de Janeiro were biological, in contrast to the social determinants in the group with low schooling."
23144236,0,a,"Digital technologies are increasingly important as ways to gain access to most of the important social determinants of health including employment, housing, education and social networks. However, little is known about the impact of the new technologies on opportunities for health and well-being. This paper reports on a focus group study of the impact of these technologies on people from low socio-economic backgrounds. We use Bourdieu's theories of social inequities and the ways in which social, cultural and economic capitals interact to reinforce and reproduce inequities to examine the ways in which digital technologies are contributing to these processes. Six focus group discussions with 55 people were held to examine their access to and views about using digital technologies. These data are analysed in light of Bourdieu's theory to determine how people's existing capitals shape their access to and use of digital technologies and what the implications of exclusion from the technologies are likely to be for the social determinants of health. The paper concludes that some people are being caught in a vicious cycle whereby lack of digital access or the inability to make beneficial use reinforces and amplifies existing disadvantage including low levels of reading and writing literacy. The paper concludes with a consideration of actions health promoters could take to interrupt this cycle and so contribute to reducing health inequities."
20502599,0,a,"This PLoS Medicine Debate examines the different approaches that can be taken to tackle neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Some commentators, like Jerry Spiegel and colleagues from the University of British Columbia, feel there has been too much focus on the biomedical mechanisms and drug development for NTDs, at the expense of attention to the social determinants of disease. Burton Singer argues that this represents another example of the inappropriate ""overmedicalization"" of contemporary tropical disease control. Peter Hotez and colleagues, in contrast, argue that the best return on investment will continue to be mass drug administration for NTDs."
19079707,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Arbovirus diseases have emerged as a global public health concern. However, the impact of climatic, social, and environmental variability on the transmission of arbovirus diseases remains to be determined. OBJECTIVE: Our goal for this study was to provide an overview of research development and future research directions about the interrelationship between climate variability, social and environmental factors, and the transmission of Ross River virus (RRV), the most common and widespread arbovirus disease in Australia. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search on climatic, social, and environmental factors and RRV disease. Potentially relevant studies were identified from a series of electronic searches. RESULTS: The body of evidence revealed that the transmission cycles of RRV disease appear to be sensitive to climate and tidal variability. Rainfall, temperature, and high tides were among major determinants of the transmission of RRV disease at the macro level. However, the nature and magnitude of the interrelationship between climate variability, mosquito density, and the transmission of RRV disease varied with geographic area and socioenvironmental condition. Projected anthropogenic global climatic change may result in an increase in RRV infections, and the key determinants of RRV transmission we have identified here may be useful in the development of an early warning system. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis indicates that there is a complex relationship between climate variability, social and environmental factors, and RRV transmission. Different strategies may be needed for the control and prevention of RRV disease at different levels. These research findings could be used as an additional tool to support decision making in disease control/surveillance and risk management."
11818587,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinants of mental health among severe hearing-impaired adults in the Netherlands, separately by prelingual and postlingual age of onset. METHODS: Five hundred twenty-three face-to-face interviews were carried out by persons with practical skills in communication with hearing-impaired people. RESULTS: Of prelingually and postlingually deaf men, 27.1% and 27.7%, respectively, reported mental distress (scores on the General Health Questionnaire > or = 2), and among women these figures were 32.4% and 43.2%. These rates are higher than in the general population (men: 22.0%; women: 26.6%). Among the prelingual category, none of the demographic or hearing loss-related characteristics was associated with mental health status as measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Of these variables, only additional impairment or serious illness was associated with the brief Symptom Checklist (SCL-8D). Among the postlingual category, female gender and equilibrium disturbance was associated with both the GHQ and SCL-8D, and additional impairment or serious illness with the SCL-8D. For both categories, the risk of mental distress also was higher in those with more communication problems, lower levels of self-esteem, and poorer acceptance of the hearing loss. Opportunities for identification in youth and social support were not associated with mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health status differs between the hearing-impaired and the general population, but not as much as is sometimes suggested. Mental distress is greater in those in certain categories of the hearing-impaired."
14502860,1,a,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the prevalence of ischemic stroke, little is known regarding driving resumption and its determinants after stroke. This study documents driving resumption poststroke and describes the relationship between specific variables and driving resumption. METHOD: Between May 2001 and January 2002, 110 consecutive patients admitted to Hartford Hospital with acute ischemic stroke, who had driven during the month before admission, were enrolled in this cohort study. Stroke outcome measures including the NIH Stroke Scale, Barthel Index, Short Form (SF-12), COOPS social support scale, and an original questionnaire were administered. Patients were followed up at three and six months to establish poststroke driving status. The relationship between driving resumption and the predictor variables was determined using correlations (point-biserial and phi coefficients) and forward multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Forty (50%) of the surveyed patients resumed driving within one month of their strokes. The best logistic regression model (R2 = 0.391) for predicting resumption of driving after stroke included the variables prestroke driving frequency (OR = 7.74 [2.47-24.3]), poststroke Barthel Index score (OR = 1.16 [1.06-1.27]), and marital status (OR = 3.55 [1.28-9.83]). CONCLUSION: Resumption of driving is early after mild strokes. Factors other than the specific consequences of the stroke contribute to the prediction of driving resumption. While factors such as prestroke driving frequency, functional independence and marital status should not be used as a sanction for driving resumption, they offer insights to individuals who are likely to resume driving early after an ischemic stroke."
22692441,1,a,"University students may encounter personal, family, social, and financial stresses while trying to cope with their academic challenges. Such constraints could affect their eating behavior and health status which, in turn may have negative effects on their studies. In light of little information in Malaysia on this subject, this study was undertaken on a sample of 180 students pursuing different academic programs in a Malaysian university. The study objectives were to determine the students' eating behavior including body weight control and the extent of fear of being fat, their social self concept that reflects the five selves namely, the psychological self, the social self, the sexual self, the family self and the physical self. Eating behavior and social self concept were determined based on various methods previously validated in studies on young adults in Asia and Australia. This article focuses on gender comparisons for these determinants. The results showed that psychological and emotional factors have a significant bearing on the eating behavior of university students. Uninhibited eating behavior of both the males and females showed significant and negative correlations with feelings pertaining to personal worth, the physical self, and their relationships with peers and families. Gender differences were manifested for some determinants. The females showed more restrained eating behavior than the males; the females have a significantly higher score for family relationship, which appears to be a significant factor on male students' eating behavior. Future studies on a larger sample size may help to unravel the extent to which psychological factors influence eating behavior of students, and the underlying psychosocial basis for some of the gender differences reported in this study."
19055806,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on the development, implementation and evaluation processes of physical activity promotion programmes among older adults. More integrative insights into interventions describing the planned systematic development, implementation and evaluation are needed. METHODS AND DESIGN: The purpose of this study is to give an integrative insight into the development of the Active plus programme applying the six-step Intervention Mapping protocol. The Active plus programme consisted of two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity promotion interventions, both comprising three tailored letters delivered over four months and aimed at raising awareness of insufficient physical activity, and stimulating physical activity initiation and maintenance among the over-fifties. The first intervention, the basic tailored intervention, provided tailored letters that intervened on the psychosocial determinants of physical activity. The second intervention, the intervention plus, provided the same tailored information but additionally provided tailored information about physical activity opportunities in the specific environment in which the older adults lived. This environment-based component also provided access to a forum and e-buddy system on a website. A plan for implementation and evaluation is also described. DISCUSSION: The planned development of the Active plus programme resulted in two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity interventions targeted at the over-fifties. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register NTR 920."
18441275,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: . Objectives were to study the effects of socioeconomic factors on transitions in living arrangements and mortality for men and women. METHODS: We used a sample of Finns aged 65 years and older living alone or with a partner at the end of 1997 (N = 250,787) drawn from population registers, and followed them up for transitions in living arrangements (with partner, alone, with others, institutionalized) and death at the end of 2002. RESULTS: Health conditions associated with functional difficulties were major determinants of institutionalization and death and were associated with transitions between private households. Low income among men and in particular not owning a home were independently associated with institutionalization and death among those living alone or with a partner at baseline. Among those living with a partner, the transition to living alone was associated with all socioeconomic factors but most strongly with a low income and not owning a home. Transitions to living with others were associated in particular with low occupational social class and education. DISCUSSION: Variations in the associations of different socioeconomic indicators with living arrangement transitions imply different social pathways. However, material socioeconomic indicators dominated other measures of socioeconomic status in determining such transitions, and their effects were only partly mediated by chronic conditions."
29619391,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Dynamic and static activities in dentistry cause musculoskeletal disorders, but dental students do not have sufficient awareness about the effects of ergonomic factors on their health. The aim of this study was to investigate ergonomic factors that cause pain muscle in dental students in Kerman Medical University, Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis study was carried out on dental students of the 3(rd), 4(th), 5(th), and 6(th) year, in clinical practice in the School of Dentistry, Kerman University of Medical Sciences. A convenient sample of 199 students who met the inclusion criteria was selected and those willing to participate signed an informed consent form. Data were collected by means of a structured questionnaire for ergonomic factors and the presence of pain. The variables evaluated were pain, affected zones, gender, postures, and work environment. RESULTS: The present research work reveals that over 69% of the dental students complained of pain in at least one part of their body. Most individuals suffered from hand and elbow (23%) and head (19%) pain. The clinical areas where more pain was found were endodontics and pedodontics. Furthermore, it was found that a high percentage of students usually worked with their legs slightly separated, with the sole of the feet resting on the stool when working. The presence of muscular pain was higher in males in this study. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant relationship with the final Rapid Entire Body Assessment score in different body parts and the participants' demographic data (sex, age, weight, height, sports, and smoking). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that the students' sitting positions and working environments need to be improved and it seems more training is necessary in this field."
16497606,1,a,"Although a number of studies have shown that various measures of religiosity are inversely correlated with smoking behavior, none of these studies have used genetically informative samples to test for a gene-environment interaction between the determinants of smoking initiation and religiosity. We tested the moderating effects of three measures of religiosity (religious affiliation, organizational religious activity, and self-rated religiousness) on the genetic and environmental determinants of smoking initiation in 237 monozygotic twin pairs, 315 dizygotic twin pairs, 779 full-sibling pairs, and 233 half-sibling pairs in young adults surveyed from the third wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Primary analyses incorporated all sibling pairs, irrespective of whether they were concordant or discordant for the environmental moderator, in models designed to account for the confounding effects of a gene-environment correlation. High levels of self-rated religiousness attenuated the additive genetic component for smoking initiation and were associated with a lower prevalence of smoking initiation. Although all three measures of religiosity were associated with lower rates of smoking initiation, only self-rated religiousness moderated genetic influences on the liability for smoking."
15087153,1,a,"This paper is a follow-up of earlier findings by the Kagera AIDS Research Project (KARP), which documented declining trends in the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection in the Kagera region of Tanzania. The paper examines socio-cultural and sexual behavioral changes as possible determinants of the observed declining trends in Bukoba, the largest urban area of the region. The study used in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, field observations and ethnographic assessments to collect the required data. The findings suggest that since the initial years of the epidemic there have been significant changes in sexual behaviors, norms, values, and customs that are considered high-risk for HIV transmission. The findings show an increase in condom use, abstinence, zero grazing (sticking to one sexual partner) and uptake of voluntary HIV testing while traditional practices such as polygamy, widow inheritance, excessive alcohol consumption, and sexual networking are declining. We suggest that these changes are partly a result of the severity of the epidemic itself in the study area, and interventions that have been carried out in this area since 1987. The major interventions have included health education, the distribution of condoms, AIDS education in schools, voluntary HIV counseling and testing. These are encouraging findings that give hope and we believe that other places within Tanzania and other countries experiencing a severe AIDS crisis have much to learn from this experience. However, changes in norms and behavior are vulnerable; people in Kagera are still at risk and there is a need for continued intervention together with monitoring of the direction of the epidemic."
30479982,0,a,"Background: Prevalence of F&V consumption in Namibia is not known. In this study we aimed to address this gap by using nationally representative data with the objectives of measuring the prevalence of adequate F&V consumption among adult men and women and their socio demographic determinants. Methods: This study is based on data from Namibia Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS2013). Sample population were 14 185 men and women aged between 15 and 49 years.Amount of fruit and vegetable consumption was measured by self-reported frequencies and was defined as adequate (at least 5 servings/day) according to World Health Organization (WHO)guidelines. Results: Overall, only 4.3% (3.8-4.9%) of the men and women reported consuming at least 5 servings of F&V a day, with the percentage being slightly higher among women (4.8%,95% CI=3.7-6.2) compared with men (4.2%, 95% CI=3.6-4.8). In the multivariable analysis,education level and household wealth status appeared to be the only factors associated with adequate F&V intake. Men and women who had primary level education had higher odds of eating at least 5 servings of F&V a day compared with those who had no education. Regarding wealth status, men and women from non-poor households had respectively 2.13 times(OR=2.13, 95% CI=1.01-4.48) and 2.2 times (OR=2.19, 95% CI=1.56-3.38) higher odds of eating at least 5 servings of F&V a day. Conclusion: Only a small proportion of the men and women consumed adequate amount of F&V on daily basis. Having primary level education and non-poor household wealth status were positively associated with adequate amount of F&V intake."
31373039,0,a,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have demonstrable negative effects on long-term physical and mental health. Low-income and ethnic minority communities face significant disparities in exposure to ACEs. Pediatric settings offer an opportune context to identify and address ACEs, with the potential to reduce barriers in access to resources and services. The current study examined the feasibility and acceptability of screening infants and their parents for ACEs at a community medical clinic. Feasibility data indicated that 151 (92%) of the 164 unique patients that presented for well-child visits for infants (4- to 12-months) across a 13-month period were screened for infant and parent ACEs. Of these 151 patients, 47% met eligibility (infants with 1 + ACEs, parents with 2 + ACEs) deemed intermediate risk and indicated referral to prevention services. The majority of referred families (77%) accepted prevention services, including appointments with bilingual and bicultural wellness navigators who provided a cultural bridge and access to resources that could address patients' social determinants of health. Qualitative interviews with providers expand upon screening acceptability. Implications for integrated behavioral health, ACEs screening, and trauma-responsive prevention in a pediatric setting are discussed."
27370020,0,a,"RATIONALE: Preclinical studies indicate that gonadal hormones are important determinants of drug self-administration. To date, little is known about the influence of sex and estrous cycle on drug self-administration in ecologically relevant social contexts. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the role of sex and estrous cycle in a rat model during cocaine and heroin self-administration with male-female and female-female social dyads. METHODS: Male and female virgin rats were trained to self-administer cocaine and heroin in operant conditioning chambers that permitted two rats to self-administer concurrently, but prevented physical contact. Experiment 1 examined cocaine self-administration on a progressive ratio schedule in male-female dyads. Experiments 2 and 3 examined heroin self-administration on a fixed ratio schedule in male-female dyads at constant and varying doses, respectively. Experiment 4 examined heroin self-administration in female-female dyads on a fixed ratio schedule. RESULTS: Cocaine-maintained breakpoints increased by approximately 17 % in females during estrus, but remained consistent in males. Heroin self-administration decreased by approximately 70 % during proestrus in females whether they were isolated, housed with males, or housed with females. Heroin self-administration was lower in males than females under some conditions and was not consistently associated with the responding of females. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine and heroin self-administration is influenced by the estrous cycle in females when in the presence of a male partner. As a novel finding, these data illustrate that heroin self-administration is reduced in females during proestrus regardless of the social context tested. Finally, these data suggest that drug self-administration in males is only minimally influenced by the hormonal status of a female partner."
20706935,0,a,"Environmental determinants for participation of disabled subjects in tourism and recreation comprise an important social problem. The amount and use of free time for individuals with disabilities in daily life, holidays, and vacation leave and the location for tourism and recreation were examined. Seven hundred and fifty individuals, aged 16-75 yr, with varying degrees of disability, from three eastern provinces of Poland: Podlaskie, Lubelskie and Podkarpackie were investigated. In these studies, a diagnostic survey method with the use of questionnaire, interviews, and analysis of data was carried out. It was found that individuals with disabilities have a significant amount of free time, which is usually spent with family and friends. Among the specific benefits of participation in physical activities are well-being, health improvement, and making new acquaintances. The main factors determining participation in tourism and recreation were price, a friendly group, and doctor recommendations."
28397324,0,a,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Evidence suggests that patterns of substance use are changing amongst some members of migrant groups in the UK. This study explored the extent to which residing in the UK has an impact on substance use behaviours amongst Brazilian migrants. DESIGN AND METHODS: A mixed methods approach was adopted comparing Brazilians residing in the UK (n = 164) and Brazilians residing in Brazil (n = 161), age 27.82 (SD = 5.65) average. Participants' socio-demographic characteristics, resilience, personality traits, drinking motives, psychological distress, frequency of alcohol intake, smoking and other drugs used (Brazil and UK), acculturation outcomes and length of residence (UK) were explored. Six in-depth interviews were conducted with Brazilian residents in the UK and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants from the UK reported higher prevalence of substance use; however, significant country differences were only found in binge drinking and poly drug use. While in Brazil, substance use was associated with being male, no religious practices, having resided in another country and higher scores in drinking for social motives and sensation seeking, in the UK it was associated with elementary occupations, higher scores in drinking for social and enhancement motives, threat to cultural identity and lower length of residence in the UK. Interview data suggested that living in the UK was stressful. CONCLUSIONS: Country differences in patterns of substance use were associated with changes resulting from the migratory process to the UK. The stresses associated with the process of acculturation presents a promising path for addressing substance use problems in migrant populations."
25077801,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the individual and social factors of students enrolled in undergraduate programs of midwifery, nursing, and social work, regarding their negative attitudes on organ donation and transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was descriptive research, consisting of 29 first- and second-year students from the departments of midwifery, nursing, and social work at the Kocaeli School of Health, Kocaeli University, in Kocaeli, Turkey, who expressed that they were opposed to organ donation and transplant. Data were collected in June 2012 during focus group discussions with a semistructured questionnaire and analyzed by thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Regarding negative attitudes toward organ donation and transplant, 7 themes were identified: fear, lack of knowledge, religious belief, loss of bodily integrity, the degree of recipient relationship, the decision 's effect on the family, and fulfilment of certain criteria for a recipient. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that the most important determinants of students' negative attitudes regarding organ donation and transplant are fear, lack of knowledge, and religious beliefs. Adding courses to the undergraduate curricula of midwifery, nursing, and social work programs about organ donation and transplant would increase these students ' knowledge."
16533108,1,a,"This article reviews the historical development of population health indicators. We have long known that environmental, socioeconomic, early life conditions, individual actions, and medical care all interact to affect health. Present quantitative reporting on the impact of these factors on population health grew out of Bills of Mortality published in the 1500s. Since then, regular censuses, civil registration of vital statistics, and international classification systems have improved data quality and comparability. Regular national health interview surveys and application of administrative data contributed information on morbidity, health services use, and some social determinants of health. More recently, traditional health databases and datasets on ""nonhealth"" sector determinants have been linked. Statistical methods for map-making, risk adjustment, multilevel analysis, calculating population-attributable risks, and summary measures of population health have further helped to integrate information. Reports on the health of populations remain largely confined to focused areas. This paper suggests a conceptual framework for using indicators to report on all the domains of population health. Future ethical development of indicators will incorporate principles of justice, transparency, and effectiveness."
11029135,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to predict and explain nurses' adherence to Universal Precautions (UPs) when performing venipunctures. METHODS: Data were gathered from 156 registered nurses working at a regional hospital. A self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial variables (intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived control, etc) was completed at baseline, and behavior was self-reported 3 months later. RESULTS: The regression of intention on the variables yielded an adjusted R(2) of 0.68, with perceived barriers (beta =.62, P <.001), social norm (beta =.17, P <.01), and personal normative belief (beta =.19, P <.01) being the significant variables. With respect to the 3-month follow-up, 28% of the variance associated with UPs adherence was explained by intention (beta =.37, P <.001) and perceived behavioral control (beta =.23, P <.05). Moreover, high (n = 116) and low intenders (n = 40) differed on several normative beliefs (P =.0003) and perceived barriers (P =.0001). CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that perception of control, assessed either globally or by means of a belief-based measure, is a key factor in adherence. Specifically, the perceived difficulties associated with adherence to UPs appear to be related to a nurse's training on UPs and to the existence of suboptimal working conditions."
16014164,1,a,"This paper contributes to a nascent scholarly discussion of sex and gender as determinants of health. Health is a composite of biological makeup and socioeconomic circumstances. Differences in health and illness patterns of men and women are attributable both to sex, or biology, and to gender, that is, social factors such as powerlessness, access to resources, and constrained roles. Using examples such as the greater life expectancy of women in most of the world, despite their relative social disadvantage, and the disproportionate risk of myocardial infarction amongst men, but death from MI amongst women, the independent and combined associations of sex and gender on health are explored. A model for incorporating gender into epidemiologic analyses is proposed."
29033059,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Inter-sectoral policy networks may be effective in addressing environmental determinants of health with interventions. However, contradictory results are reported on relations between structural network characteristics (i.e., composition and integration) and network performance, such as addressing environmental determinants of health. This study examines these relations in different phases of the policy process. METHODS: A multiple-case study was performed on four public health-related policy networks. Using a snowball method among network actors, overall and sub-networks per policy phase were identified and the policy sector of each actor was assigned. To operationalise the outcome variable, interventions were classified by the proportion of environmental determinants they addressed. RESULTS: In the overall networks, no relation was found between structural network characteristics and network performance. In most effective cases, the policy development sub-networks were characterised by integration with less interrelations between actors (low cohesion), more equally distributed distances between the actors (low closeness centralisation), and horizontal integration in inter-sectoral cliques. The most effective case had non-public health central actors with less connections in all sub-networks. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that, to address environmental determinants of health, sub-networks should be inter-sectorally composed in the policy development rather than in the intervention development and implementation phases, and that policy development actors should have the opportunity to connect with other actors, without strong direction from a central actor."
18537814,1,a,"This paper investigates the determinants of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture utilization for cancer patients who are simultaneously having conventional Western medical treatments. This study used five leading cancers in Taiwan, namely cervical, breast, lung, liver and colorectal cancers. A total of 2499 cancer patients were interviewed, of which 2034 had full information and were analysed. Logistic regressions were used for both TCM and acupuncture. The results showed that type of cancer and cancer duration determine the utilization for alternative treatments. While socio-economic factors also affect choice of alternative medicine, the magnitude differs by types of alternative treatment and cancer. Compared with men and older patients, women and younger patients tend to prefer alternative medicine, and patients from south have higher preference for alternative medicine, which could be a reflection of local culture. Our results are useful for the government to determine higher users of TCM and acupuncture among cancer patients, and make policies to suit these patients' needs."
19789061,1,a,"While global prevalence of obesity continues to increase dramatically, treatment options remain less than optimal. The etiology of obesity is multifactorial, ranging from lifestyle choices such as excess food intake and insufficient physical activity, to use of medications that have weight gain as an undesirable side effect. Economic and political determinants of available foodstuffs and even social networks may also contribute to obesity. Successful management of obesity requires the understanding and acceptance of a new paradigm that identifies obesity as a disease--one defined by waist circumference--that requires treatment. Obesity meets all accepted criteria of a medical disease, including a known etiology, recognized signs and symptoms, and a range of structural and functional changes that culminate in pathologic consequences. Excess adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ to produce excess free fatty acids, as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, leptin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. These bioactive molecules are associated with hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, development of diabetes, endothelial damage, and the onset and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Options for treating obesity include lifestyle modifications (dietary changes, increased physical activity, behavior modification) and, for the morbidly obese, surgery. Lifestyle modification is rarely successful over the long term; therefore, addition of pharmacotherapy should be considered for obese individuals who have difficulty achieving and maintaining weight goals with lifestyle modifications alone. Several weight loss drugs are available for long-term use, with others in various stages of clinical development."
31794294,0,a,"In May 2019, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services warned that ""around one million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction."" In September 2019, Naomi Klein, an astute writer on environmental change, described the interconnected social and ecological breakdowns on the planet in a new book. Ecological crises noted by these and other scholars speak well to the rise of planetary health as a new scholarship. Loss of biodiversity has manifold negative impacts on health, for example, rise of zoonotic infections and changes in healthy microbiome. But reducing our ecological footprints is not enough. We ought to change mindsets, the narrow science, and technology governance regimes that value nature and other life forms instrumentally by their usefulness to us. I describe three new, broader and critically informed, frames on governance for planetary health. First, I explain why we ought to acknowledge animal sentience, for example, as recognized in Article 13 of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. I describe how political determinants of health, power, and agency operate at multiple sociological and planetary loci, not only among human beings but also at human and nonhuman animal interfaces. Second, planetary health calls for a shift toward ecological and political determinants beyond a narrow anthropocentric view, while resisting the entrenched dogma of exponential growth with finite planetary natural resources. Third, for critically informed governance of emerging technologies in planetary health (e.g., glycomics, artificial intelligence, health care robots), I refer to a question highlighted recently (Frodeman, 2019): ""When Plato (more exactly, Juvenal) asked who guards the guardians, he was questioning whether any group can be trusted to look past its own interests for the common good."" Hence, it is time we broaden the question ""Who will guard the guardians?"" beyond the scientific community, to actors in science policy as well. Policy questions cannot be limited to ""which social issues emerge from a new technology?"" but ought to include, ""who should be framing science and technology policy, and why?"" Youth leaders of the global climate movement such as Greta Thunberg and others are now rightly asking these epistemological questions that might contribute toward a new social contract on health for all sentient beings on planet Earth. While ecological changes accelerate and a new space industry is emerging, governance for planetary health will continue to be at the epicenter of systems thinking, responsible innovation and science policy in the 21st century."
16937950,1,a,"Every fifth unintentional injury treated at a healthcare facility in the industrialised part of the world is associated with sports or physical exercise. This article reviews the literature regarding the theoretical and practical underpinnings for community-based sports safety promotion, including both professional and recreational sports. While injury prevention entails the implementation of specific interventions in terms of structural or educational measures, sports safety promotion includes also the antecedent and wider campaigns that are required to succeed with these measures. Comprehensive sports safety promotion programmes thus require that the perspective on the sports injury problem is made broader than consideration of the individual athlete. The results display that involvement in sports safety issues from the sports federations that formulate policies and allocate resources is necessary for coordinated implementation of programme actions. The authorities responsible for sports facilities and legislations in the civil society also need to be included, because of the fact that they control many of the central safety determinants in the sporting environment. It is concluded that the sports injury problem needs to be addressed in liaison with the leaders of socially defined sports communities and the governments representing geographically defined civic communities, and that the safety-supporting environment in professional sports is underdeveloped compared with other areas of working life."

11338330,1,a,"This study refines and tests an individual client model of service use and contrasts it with a model of service provision based on gateway provider perspectives. Structural equation models demonstrate that provider variables account for more service use variation than client variables. The client model accounts for 24% of the variance in service use, while the provider model accounts for 55% of the variance. Youth self-reported mental health was not positively associated with increased services or with provider perception of youth mental health. The provider model demonstrates the critical role played by provider perceptions, which are influenced more by work environment than by client problems."
10755056,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QOL) has gained importance as a global measure of social and clinical outcome in schizophrenia. AIMS: To identify the clinical correlates of QOL at the time of first presentation with schizophrenia. METHOD: Over two years, consecutive first-episode psychosis patients presenting to a catchment area psychiatric service underwent validated clinical assessments of premorbid adjustment, illness duration, symptoms and QOL. RESULTS: At presentation, subjects already had a diminished QOL. Although independent of gender and age at onset of psychosis, QOL was influenced by premorbid adjustment, duration of untreated psychosis and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the duration of untreated psychosis may have a beneficial effect on the subsequent QOL of patients presenting with schizophrenia. First-episode patients with a protracted duration of untreated psychosis or impaired premorbid adjustment may warrant specific treatment interventions to prevent the development of secondary handicaps."
27009062,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although evidence-based and effective treatments are available for people with depression, a substantial number does not seek or receive help. Therefore, it is important to gain a better understanding of the reasons why people do or do not seek help. This study examined what predisposing and need factors are associated with help-seeking among people with major depression. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 102 subjects with major depression. Respondents were recruited from the general population in collaboration with three Municipal Health Services (GGD) across different regions in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria were: being aged 18 years or older, a high score on a screening instrument for depression (K10 > 20), and a diagnosis of major depression established through the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 65 % (n = 66) had received help in the past six months. Results showed that respondents with a longer duration of symptoms and those with lower personal stigma were more likely to seek help. Other determinants were not significantly related to help-seeking. CONCLUSIONS: Longer duration of symptoms was found to be an important determinant of help-seeking among people with depression. It is concerning that stigma was related to less help-seeking. Knowledge and understanding of depression should be promoted in society, hopefully leading to reduced stigma and increased help-seeking."
26815750,1,a,"INTRODUCTION: Due to remarkable improvements in emergency and intensive care medicine in the recent past, the mortality rate for severely injured patients is decreasing. Outcome research therefore should no longer focus only on questions of survival, but also on aspects of the quality of life after severe trauma. This study examined the long-term effect of different sociodemographic, economic, trauma, and hospital-related factors on the health-related quality of life (SF-36) of severely injured patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A written questionnaire was sent to 121 trauma patients who received treatment in two hospitals in Cologne/Northrhine-Westfalia between 1996 and 2001. The inclusion criteria were more than one injury and a sum of abbreviated injury score of the two worst injuries >/= 6. The response rate after using the total-design-method was 77.6% (n = 90). RESULTS: Severely injured patients showed significant reductions for all subscales of the SF-36, on average 4 years after discharge on average, in comparison to a German norm population. Specifically, aspects of the physical-component scale were dramatically reduced. Linear regressions controlling for time after discharge suggested that higher age, lower socioeconomic status, living together with a partner, and the severity of trauma and injury of extremities were significant predictors for a reduced quality of life, while satisfaction with the hospital stay had a positive effect. DISCUSSION: All in all, it is important to identify trauma- patients who will suffer a reduced quality of life. In so doing, it will be possible to take into account the specific circumstances of their recovery during medical treatment, care, and rehabilitation."
15947174,1,a,"More than 20 years into the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) epidemic, women account for nearly half of the 40 million people living with HIV-1 worldwide, with an even higher proportion existing in developing countries. Social determinants of female vulnerability to HIV-1 include gender disparities, poverty, cultural and sexual norms, lack of education, and violence. Women are also more susceptible to HIV-1 because of hormonal changes, vaginal microbial ecology and physiology, and a higher prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases. Prevention strategies must address the wide range of gender inequalities that promote the dissemination of HIV-1."
26637387,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the factors affecting the development of preterm children in Germany is limited. We analysed the prevalence of preterm birth in Germany using the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents 2003-2006 and assessed factors associated with quality of life (QOL) and behavioural development in preterm children (< 37 weeks' gestational age). METHODS: Data were weighted and preterm prevalence was calculated by socioeconomic status (SES) and year of birth for 1,106 preterm children. Using linear regression models, the relationship between sociodemographic, pre- and perinatal, lifestyle, and contextual determinants on the one hand, and the QOL (KINDL(R) parent questionnaire) and behavioural problems (the total problem behaviour scale, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ]) on the other was calculated. RESULTS: Prevalence of preterm birth (mean 7.5 %) was higher in families with low compared with high SES (8.4 versus 7.0 %). In the final regression models, preterm children with high SES had higher QOL scores (+ 3.3 KINDL points, p = 0.024) compared with children with low SES, and adolescents (aged 14-17 years) had a higher QOL than children aged 7-13 years. All other variables (contextual, pre- and perinatal) were not related to QOL. In contrast, there were many determinants of behavioural development in preterms: the SDQ total score was lower in girls, children with older mothers, those from high SES and those with a high level of physical activity. However, both very low birth weight (< 1,500 g) and birth at > 34 weeks' gestation were associated with a higher SDQ total score. CONCLUSION: Given its high prevalence, preterm birth is a relevant public health issue in Germany. While SES may be the most important determinant of QOL in preterms, determinants of behavioural problems are the same as those in term children and also encompass perinatal factors."
12811671,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess age- and nationality-specific trends in abortion rates over the last decade, and to describe women's characteristics, identifying risk factors for repeated abortion. METHODS: From 1990-1999, the Health Department of Canton Vaud (Switzerland) received 13'857 abortion requests from residents aged 14-49. Population data were obtained to compute rates. RESULTS: Both the number of abortions (1400 annually) as well as their rate (8.9 per thousand women [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.3-10.5]) were stable over the decade in question. The rate of abortion for foreign women, especially from ex-Yugoslavia and Africa, was twice that for Swiss women. Half of the requests came from single women, 43% had a low education level, and half were childless. The main reason for requesting termination of pregnancy was psychosocial (93%). The mean gestational age was 7.7 weeks (SD +/- 2.3), but 96% of requests were submitted before 12 weeks. Sixty-three percent of women reported that they had used no contraception, 36% the condom and 17% the pill. Among requests, the adjusted risk of repeated abortion (22% of abortion candidates) was greater among divorced/separated/widowed women (odds ratio [OR] 1.9 [95% CI 1.5-2.4]), unemployed women (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.5-2.1]), and those who had not attended university (OR 1.6 [95% CI 1.1-2.2]). CONCLUSIONS: Although Swiss law only permitted abortion under strict conditions, this procedure was widely available in Vaud, which nevertheless has one of the lowest rates worldwide. Efforts must be intensified to ensure universal access to family planning services, especially for foreign women and adolescents. Professionals should also target ""repeaters"" to provide personalised counselling."
25113566,0,a,"We use genome wide data from respondents of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to evaluate the possibility that common genetic influences are associated with education and three health outcomes: depression, self-rated health, and body mass index. We use a total of 1.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained from the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-4v1 chip from 4233 non-Hispanic white respondents to characterize genetic similarities among unrelated persons in the HRS. We then used the Genome Wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) toolkit, to estimate univariate and bivariate heritability. We provide evidence that education (h(2) = 0.33), BMI (h(2) = 0.43), depression (h(2) = 0.19), and self-rated health (h(2) = 0.18) are all moderately heritable phenotypes. We also provide evidence that some of the correlation between depression and education as well as self-rated health and education is due to common genetic factors associated with one or both traits. We find no evidence that the correlation between education and BMI is influenced by common genetic factors."
30922399,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The current nationwide study, for the first time, aimed to assess and compare the trend of pre-hypertension and hypertension among urban and rural adolescents in Iran. METHODS: This study has been conducted in the framework of the National Surveys of Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases. To estimate pre-hypertension and hypertension prevalence among 9715 adolescents, aged 15-19 years, data collected in four repeated cross-sectional surveys (2007-2011) has been used. The prevalence trends of pre-hypertension and hypertension were examined across urban and rural areas of Iran. To calculate the adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) of pre-hypertension and hypertension over cycles across area of residence and genders, a complex sample survey and multinomial logistic analysis were performed. RESULTS: Using the definition of pre-hypertension and hypertension presented by the seventh Joint National Committee (JNC-VII) for adolescents, after adjusting for confounders, the prevalence of pre-hypertension changed in both urban (boys:28.96% to 29.24% and girls:18.33% to 20.06%) and rural (boys 31.58% to 32.05% and girls 22.25% to 24.13%) areas over the study duration. Non-significant rising prevalence of hypertension was also observed in boys and girls of both regions (urban 12.76% to 15.04% and 8.02% to 9.06%; rural 9.95% to 11.79% and 10.35% to 11.60%, for boys and girls respectively). The adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) of pre-hypertension (2.16; 95% CI 1.68-2.79 and 1.92, 95% CI 1.57-2.34, in urban and rural, respectively) and hypertension (2.40; 95% CI 1.65-3.51 and 1.82, 95% CI 1.36-2.45, in urban and rural, respectively) were higher in boys than girls. Comparing the adjusted PRs of pre-hypertension and hypertension in urban versus rural areas, in both genders, showed higher PRs of pre-hypertension in rural girls (1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.75). CONCLUSION: The current results showed high constant trends of pre-hypertension and hypertension in Iranian boys and girls, residing in both urban and rural areas."
15714217,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To outline the rationale, objectives and strategies used in a systematically designed research programmme to study specific weight gain-inducing behaviours, their social-psychological as well as environmental determinants, and the effects of interventions aimed at the prevention of weight gain. DESIGN: The evidence for potential behavioural determinants and strategies to prevent weight gain was reviewed, and the methods applied within the Netherlands Research programme weight gain prevention (NHF-NRG) project were described. The project is designed according to the Intervention Mapping protocol. SETTING: The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: The main target groups are (a) adolescents (12-16 y) in secondary school, (b) young adults (20-40 y) at the workplace and (c) recently retired people (55-65 y) at home. INTERVENTIONS: Each intervention includes an individual component, in which computer-tailored information is provided. Additionally, interventions are aimed at changing environmental components. RESULTS: The short-term results of this project can be expected by the beginning of 2005. Guidelines for nationwide weight gain prevention, based on this research programme, will become available in 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the few interventions that were evaluated to date, no robust conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of obesity prevention. The systematic and multidisciplinary design of the NHF-NRG programme enables the identification of potentially effective methods and strategies for the prevention of weight gain."
28612807,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In the early 1960s, the Kingdom of Bhutan began to develop its modern health-care system and by the 1990s had developed an extensive network of health-care facilities. These developments, in tandem with wider social and economic progress encapsulated in the Gross National Happiness concept, have resulted in major gains in child survival and life expectancy in the past 50 years. In order to sustain these gains, the country has identified a constitutional and health-policy mandate for universal access to health. METHODS: Based on analysis of the literature, and qualitative and quantitative health data, this case study aims to provide an assessment of universal health coverage in Bhutan, and to identify the major challenges to measuring, monitoring and sustaining universal coverage. RESULTS: The study reveals that the wide network of primary and secondary care, reinforced by constitutional and policy mandates, ensures high population coverage, as well as wide availability and accessibility of care, with significant levels of financial protection. This achievement has been attributable to sustained state investment in the sector over past decades. Despite this achievement, recent surveys have demonstrated gaps in utilization of health services and confirmed associations between socioeconomic variables and health access and outcomes, which raise important questions relating to both supply- and demand-side barriers in accessing health care. CONCLUSION: In order to sustain and improve the quality of universal health coverage, improved measurements of service availability at subnational levels and of the determinants of pockets of low service utilization are required. More rigorous monitoring of financial protection is also needed, particularly in relation to rates of public investment and the impact of out-of-pocket costs while accessing care. These approaches should assist improvements in quality and equity in universal health coverage, in the context of ongoing epidemiological, demographic and social transition."
19967219,1,a,"This study analyzes meanings that health workers attribute to DOTS and points out alternatives that contribute to its performance. After the Research Ethics Committee approved the project, a semi-structured interview was applied to 15 health workers from the central region of the city of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil between August and December 2004. This study used hermeneutic-dialectic reference and the theory of social determinants of the health-disease process. DOTS contributes to treatment adherence and promotes interfacing in encounters and conversations between workers and users at the institutional and territorial levels, which permits identifying health needs and implementing appropriate interventions. One of the main challenges to its implementation is to become a space that enables grasping, decoding and reconstructing meanings in relation to the health-disease process including the treatment and life projects of patients with tuberculosis."
19459050,1,a,"Incarceration is associated with multiple and concurrent partnerships, which are determinants of sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV. The associations between incarceration and high-risk sex partnerships may exist, in part, because incarceration disrupts stable sex partnerships, some of which are protective against high-risk sex partnerships. When investigating STI/HIV risk among those with incarceration histories, it is important to consider the potential role of drug use as a factor contributing to sexual risk behavior. First, incarceration's influence on sexual risk taking may be further heightened by drug-related effects on sexual behavior. Second, drug users may have fewer economic and social resources to manage the disruption of incarceration than nonusers of drugs, leaving this group particularly vulnerable to the disruptive effects of incarceration on sexual risk behavior. Using the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, we conducted multivariable analyses to estimate associations between incarceration in the past 12 months and engagement in multiple partnerships, concurrent partnerships, and unprotected sex in the past 12 months, stratified by status of illicit drug use (defined as use of cocaine, crack, or injection drugs in the past 12 months), among adult men in the US. Illicit drug users were much more likely than nonusers of illicit drugs to have had concurrent partnerships (16% and 6%), multiple partnerships (45% and 18%), and unprotected sex (32% and 19%). Analyses adjusting for age, race, educational attainment, poverty status, marital status, cohabitation status, and age at first sex indicated that incarceration was associated with concurrent partnerships among nonusers of illicit drugs (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-2.22) and illicit drug users (aPR 2.14, 95% CI 1.07-4.29). While incarceration was also associated with multiple partnerships and unprotected sex among nonusers of illicit drugs (multiple partnerships: aPR 1.66, 95% CI 1.43-1.93; unprotected sex: aPR 1.99, 95% CI 1.45-2.72), incarceration was not associated with these behaviors among illicit drug users (multiple partnerships: aPR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79-1.35; unprotected sex: aPR 0.73, 95% CI 0.41-1.31); among illicit drug users, multiple partnerships and unprotected sex were common irrespective of incarceration history. These findings support the need for correctional facility- and community-based STI/HIV prevention efforts including STI/HIV education, testing, and care for current and former prisoners with and without drug use histories. Men with both illicit drug use and incarceration histories may experience particular vulnerability to STI/HIV, as a result of having disproportionate levels of concurrent partnerships and high levels of unprotected sex. We hypothesize that incarceration works in tandem with drug use and other adverse social and economic factors to increase sexual risk behavior. To establish whether incarceration is causally associated with high-risk sex partnerships and acquisition of STI/HIV, a longitudinal study that accurately measures incarceration, STI/HIV, and illicit drug use should be conducted to disentangle the specific effects of each variable of interest on risk behavior and STI/HIV acquisition."
16451892,1,a,"Students' beliefs and attitudes towards the medical profession have been studied in relation to career choices, but most research has been restricted to either predetermined aspects or to a limited number of specialties. This study aimed at getting unprompted insight in the students' perceptions of their future profession in dimensions that may be determinants of study success and career choice. Undergraduate and graduated medical students were interviewed and asked to characterize the medical profession in general and four contrasting specialties in particular. Grounded Theory methodology was used to analyse the data. Participants were medical students at the start of their training (n = 16), during clerkships (n = 10) and after graduation (n = 37). Beginning students perceive the medical profession in limited dimensions: the activities of a physician, their relationship to patients and the physician's knowledge, skills and personality. They do not see many differences between specialties, in contrast with students with clinical experience and graduate students. Undergraduate students' perception is focussed more on social aspects of the profession compared to graduates."
16160718,1,a,"INTRODUCTION: The AIDS pandemic has led to the global clamouring for its control. This work was aimed at assessing the level and factors that determine the awareness of undergraduate Students of Usmanu Dandfodiyo University, Sokoto. METHODOLOGY: In a descriptive cross-sectional study, a total of 450 students were recruited by means of multistage and simple random sampling techniques. RESULTS: Overall, there is a knowledge gap on aetiology, mode of transmission and preventive measures with only 40.2% and 38.5% of the respondents having adequate knowledge and indicated their willingness to learn more about AIDs respectively. Age (P<0.05), Sex (P<0.005) and number of years spent in the University (P<0.025) are important determinants of level of AIDS knowledge. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: This finding could be as a result of strong interactions between the social environment and human sexuality. Hence, student bodies should be involved in reproductive health programmes. Key words: awareness, university students, AIDS."
29286227,0,a,"Introduction: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women throughout world, with incidence rates increasing in India. Improved survival in breast cancer patients has resulted in their quality of life (QOL) becoming an important issue. Identifying determinants for QOL may provide insights into how to improve their living conditions. This study aimed to assess socio-demographic and clinical factors, as well as the role of self-efficacy, in relation to QOL among women with breast cancer in rural India. Methods: A total of 208 female patients with infiltrating carcinoma of the breast participated in the study. A questionnaire was administered that included sections for socio-demographic characteristics, clinical stage of the cancer and patient delay in seeking health care. A standardized instrument to measure self-efficacy was applied. To assess QOL, the WHOQOL - BREF instrument was used. Results: The overall mean score for QOL was 59.3. For domain 1 (physical health) the mean score across all groups was 55.5, for psychological health 58.2, for social relationships 63.2 and for environmental factors, 60.4. The environmental domain in QOL was negatively associated with lower education. Being divorced/widowed/unmarried had a negative association with the psychological health and social relationship dimensions, whereas higher income was positively associated with QOL parameters such as psychology, social relationships and environmental factors. Self-efficacy was positively associated with all four domains of QOL. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated a moderate QOL in women with breast cancer in rural India. Young age, lack of education and being without a partner were negatively related to QOL, and employment as casual and industrial workers, high monthly family income and higher self-efficacy were positively associated with QOL. A comprehensive public health initiative is required, including social, financial and environmental support, that can provide better QOL for breast cancer survivors."
19563694,1,a,"This paper examines the gender differential in health and its socioeconomic and demographic determinants in the old-age population of India based on the National Sample Survey 60th round data collected in 2004. As in developed countries, older women in India report poorer self-reported health and experience greater immobility compared with men. Stepwise logistic regression analysis shows that the gender differential in health is linked to various socioeconomic and demographic variables and that the gender gap could be narrowed with appropriate policy intervention. Specifically, paying special attention towards improving the socioeconomic status of widowed/separated women could attenuate a substantial portion of the observed gender gap in the health of the old-age population."
26340644,0,a,"Mega-sporting event regeneration, as a specific approach to urban renewal, uses impending host-city status as a catalyst for revitalisation and has the potential to improve health both through addressing deprivation and by promoting increased sport and physical activity among the host-city's population. This qualitative study explored how hosting of the London 2012 Games impacted upon the way East London residents perceived and experienced the social determinants of health in their local neighbourhood. We conducted narrative family interviews, go-along interviews and video focus group workshops with 66 Newham residents, aged 12-55 years, immediately after the Games. A narrative analytic approach examined accounts of health and wellbeing experiences in terms of neighbourhood change and the spectacle of the Games. Participants of this qualitative study generally welcomed the respite and the unexpected chance to live in a cleaner, safer and more unified environment. However, this positivity was underscored by an acute awareness that this was a very temporary situation and one that was intended to support the event rather than residents."
15081204,1,a,"This new study goes beyond the well-established correlation between mortality differentials and occupational status, to focus on the impact of professional careers on mortality risk. It shows heterogeneity in the mortality risks within occupational classes, strongly related to the type of occupational moves experienced. The occupational data are taken from the French longitudinal census sample-using 1968 and 1975 census records-and mortality risks are estimated over the 1975-1980 period, for both occupational classes and pathways between classes. Results show a close relationship between occupational mobility and mortality. For men, favorable occupational moves-e.g. from clerks to upper class-put them less at risk of mortality than their counterparts who remained in their class. An inverse relationship is found for unfavorable moves. In most cases, the mortality risks of the movers are in between the risks in the class left and in the class joined. Similar patterns apply to specific groups of women only (upper classes, manual workers, clerks) for which occupational moves are probably driven, as for most men, by mortality related determinants (level of education, qualifications, health, etc.). The findings strongly support the use of a dynamic approach, based on individuals' experiences, to improve our understanding of mortality differentials."
25119933,0,a,"OBJECTIVE To analyze gender differences in the incidence and determinants of disability regarding instrumental activities of daily living among older adults. METHODS The data were extracted from the Saude, Bem-Estar e Envelhecimento (SABE - Health, Wellbeing and Ageing) study. In 2000, 1,034 older adults without difficulty in regarding instrumental activities of daily living were selected. The following characteristics were evaluated at the baseline: sociodemographic and behavioral variables, health status, falls, fractures, hospitalizations, depressive symptoms, cognition, strength, mobility, balance and perception of vision and hearing. Instrumental activities of daily living such as shopping and managing own money and medication, using transportation and using the telephone were reassessed in 2006, with incident cases of disability considered as the outcome. RESULTS The incidence density of disability in instrumental activities of daily living was 44.7/1,000 person/years for women and 25.2/1,000 person/years for men. The incidence rate ratio between women and men was 1.77 (95%CI 1.75;1.80). After controlling for socioeconomic status and clinical conditions, the incidence rate ratio was 1.81 (95%CI 1.77;1.84), demonstrating that women with chronic disease and greater social vulnerability have a greater incidence density of disability in instrumental activities of daily living. The following were determinants of the incidence of disability: age >/= 80 and worse perception of hearing in both genders; stroke in men; and being aged 70 to 79 in women. Better cognitive performance was a protective factor in both genders and better balance was a protective factor in women. CONCLUSIONS The higher incidence density of disability in older women remained even after controlling for adverse social and clinical conditions. In addition to age, poorer cognitive performance and conditions that adversely affect communication disable both genders. Acute events, such as a stroke, disables elderly men more, whereas early deficits regarding balance disable women more."
17170020,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Parent child relationships and parenting processes are emerging as potential life course determinants of health. Parenting is socially patterned and could be one of the factors responsible for the negative effects of social inequalities on health, both in childhood and adulthood. This study tests the hypothesis that some of the effect of socioeconomic risk on health in mid childhood is transmitted via early parenting. METHODS: Prospective cohort study in 10 USA communities involving 1041 mother/child pairs, selected at birth at random with conditional sampling. EXPOSURES: income, maternal education, maternal age, lone parenthood, ethnic status and objective assessments of mother child interaction in the first 4 years of life covering warmth, negativity and positive control. OUTCOMES: mother's report of child's health in general at 6 years. Modelling: multiple regression analyses with statistical testing of mediational processes. RESULTS: All five indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) were correlated with all three measures of parenting, such that low SES was associated with poor parenting. Among the measures of parenting maternal warmth was independently predictive of future health, and among the socioeconomic variables maternal education, partner presence and 'other ethnic group' proved predictive. Measures of parenting significantly mediated the impact of measures of SES on child health. CONCLUSIONS: Parenting mediates some, but not all of the detectable effects of socioeconomic risk on health in childhood. As part of a package of measures that address other determinants, interventions to support parenting are likely to make a useful contribution to reducing childhood inequalities in health."
12119990,1,a,"A decline in daily physical activity levels is clearly a major factor contributing to the current obesity epidemic affecting both developed and developing countries in the world. This escalating problem is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and reduced psychosocial health. Thus, increasing physical activity has become the strategy of choice in public health strategies to prevent obesity. Efforts to improve levels of physical activity in the population rely upon an accurate understanding of the determinants of physical activity. Most research has focused on environmental and social influences, while the potential for physical activity to be controlled by intrinsic biological processes has been largely overlooked. This review presents some of the compelling and diverse evidence that has emerged recently showing that physical activity energy expenditure is a critical factor in both the successful regulation of energy balance in normal individuals, as well as the abnormal regulation of energy balance that characterizes obesity. Although the metabolic and genetic factors involved in these regulatory processes remain mostly unidentified, some novel discoveries have been made in this area recently and these are described within this review."
31253815,0,a,"Using quantile regression analysis, the current study, conducted within the framework of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) aimed to assess the effects of parental risk clusters on different percentiles of Body Mass Index (BMI) distribution in children. Participants included 2296 school-aged children who had participated in the baseline assessment of the TLGS and were followed for an approximate duration of fifteen years. Parental socio-demographic, behavioral and clinical characteristics were considered to determine risk clusters. Comparing of the high- to the low-risk parental clusters showed that after adjusting for age in boys, BMI was significantly higher at the 75(th) (1.82, p = 03), 85(th) (1.78, p = 0.007) and 95(th) (1.66, p = 0.03) percentiles; and in girls it was significantly higher at the 25(th) (1.45, p = 0.003), 50(th) (1.05, p = 0.015), 95(th) (2.31, p = 0.018) and 97(th) (2.44, p = 0.006) percentiles in the high risk cluster. Our data indicate that during a long-term follow up, children with a high-risk family are more likely to have higher BMI, compared to their counterparts in low-risk families, a difference observed mainly at the upper percentiles of BMI distribution for both genders and at all ages, findings that should be considered for strategies aimed at preventing childhood obesity and its consequences."
10790939,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine which socio-demographic factors, health-related behaviours and physical health conditions are associated with non-drinking, binge drinking and hazardous/harmful drinking in young Australian women. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from the baseline survey of 14,762 young women (aged 18-23 years) enrolled in the Women's Health Australia study in 1996. Associations between a range of drinking patterns and socio-demographic factors, health-related behaviours and health conditions were examined. RESULTS: Half the women were 'low intake' drinkers, a third 'rarely drank' and 9% were non-drinkers; however, 70% reported binge drinking with one-quarter of the binge drinkers doing so at least weekly. Non-drinkers were more likely than drinkers to be married, pregnant, non-smokers, born in non-English speaking countries, to live in the Northern Territory, and to have lower levels of education, employment, and private health insurance. 'Low intake/binge weekly' drinkers (12%) and 'hazardous/harmful' drinkers (5%) were more likely than 'low risk' drinkers to be unmarried; to live in shared accommodation, alone or with their parents; to live in rural or remote areas; to have ever had any sexually transmitted infection; to be current smokers or ex-smokers and to have used unhealthy weight-control practices. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm findings from other countries about the importance of social conditions as determinants of alcohol consumption by young women. IMPLICATIONS: Health promotion to reduce young women's alcohol consumption needs to be carefully targeted to take account of their demographies, living environments and beliefs."
10741579,1,a,"To identify the determinants of self-medication and antibiotics abuse by parents treating their children aged between 2 and 18 over the previous year, an investigation was conducted in Hefei City, China in April, 1995. A total of 1596 students from a kindergarten, a primary school and a high school were included in the study, and 1459 completed questionnaires were collected (the response rate: 91.4%). The results showed the rate of parental self-medication for their children in the sample was 59.4%. It increased with children's age; about 51% of children had received parental self-medication on six or more occasions during the 1-year period and 32.8% on four to five occasions; there were associations between parental self-prescribers and sources of medicine and severity of disease. The rate of antibiotics abuse was 35.7%. Logistic regression analysis showed that there were significant associations between self-medication and payment of the mother's medical fees by employers, severity of diseases as well as the mother's educational level."
31321205,0,a,"Studies that explore intergenerational effects of witnessing domestic violence during childhood (""witnessing"") are lacking. We examined effects of witnessing on general health status for adults who witnessed domestic violence during childhood and their children. Cross-sectional data from population-based phone interviews conducted in Philadelphia during 2012-2013 provided health information for 329 parents and children, and parent's witnessing exposure. We used propensity scores to predict parent's witnessing status using childhood confounders; response models included inverse probability of treatment weighting and population weights for standardization. Separate standardized multivariate logistic regression models provided average treatment effects and 95% CIs for associations between childhood witnessing and below average health for: 1) adults who witnessed and 2) their children. Sensitivity analyses guided interpretation. Standardized models showed no differences in average treatment effects for below average adult health for witnesses vs. non-witnesses [0.04 (-0.12, 0.19)]. Conversely, children whose parents witnessed had considerably higher probability of having below average health than children whose parents did not witness [0.15 (0.02, 0.28)]. An unmeasured confounder would need 3.0-fold associations with both exposure and outcome to completely remove observed effects, indicating a moderate relationship. However, the lower confidence bound could cross 1.0 in the presence of a weaker unmeasured confounder having 1.2-fold associations with both exposure and outcome, while controlling for our same measured confounders. Witnessing during childhood did not affect adult health in our population, but we found moderate evidence supporting harmful intergenerational effects of witnessing on health, with parent's witnessing exposure affecting their child's health."
28617018,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The increased awareness of the financial impact associated with social determinants of health coincides with expectations of the Affordable Care Act (HR 3590) to improve care while reducing costs. The integration of behavioral health providers (BHPs) into primary care has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes. This study was designed with 2 aims, including the evaluation of the financial viability of an integrated care model in a rural setting and the demonstration of incorporating practice-based research into clinical work. METHOD: A rural health plan caring for 22,000 members funded a pilot project placing BHPs in 3 clinics to provide integrated care. Patient utilization of medical services for 6 months following BHP services was compared with baseline utilization. RESULTS: The BHPs treated 256 unique patients, with a total of 459 consultations. The percentage of patients receiving BHP services varied between clinics (Clinic A = 1.4%, Clinic B = 2.7%, and Clinic C = 3.9%). A between-clinic analysis showed differences in medical claims data between baseline and post-BH services. The overall effect sizes for reduced medical utilization for patients at clinics B and C were very large, Hedge's g = -2.31 and -4.79, respectively. Utilization of 4 of the services (emergency, lab, outpatient, and primary care) showed the large reductions in their costs. In contrast, the data for Clinic A showed no change. DISCUSSION: Patients receiving behavioral health services within the integrated care model may decrease utilization of medical services following treatment, resulting in cost offset. Potential reasons for variability between clinics are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record"
28577634,0,a,"Social determinants of health are defined as conditions in which people are born and live and the role these conditions play on health outcomes. Research indicates that risk factors and their interactions are far more complex than originally thought. This article outlines social determinant constructs and their role in understanding oral health promotion. Due to the complex interactions, oral health must be promoted using a multilevel chronic disease model or common risk factor approach. An understanding of social determinants is particularly important for the pediatric population because optimum oral health and general health in adulthood are heavily influenced by childhood."
27280000,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Human resources are the most strategic resource and the most significant input for health systems. Their behavior and motivation can strongly affect the overall performance of the health systems. The aim of this study was to determine the factors that affect motivation in frontline employees at teaching hospitals affiliated with Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBMU) in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015. The participants (nurses, physiotherapists, radiology and laboratory technicians, operating room and pharmacy staff) were 300 employees selected by the stratified random sampling method from two general and teaching hospitals. The data collection instrument was a questionnaire that consisted of 42 questions in the 7 domains of motivational factors. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and independent samples t-test by SPSS software, version 23. RESULTS: The findings indicated that working relationships (mean of 3.95) were the main determinant of job motivation of frontline employees. Job content (3.76) career development (3.75), social respect (3.75), and autonomy (3.30) were the next four affective factors. Recognition and remuneration had the least influence on the job motivation of frontline employees. The results of the Friedman test indicated that the difference between the mean scores of different dimensions was significant (chi(2) (6) = 607.00, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A hospital that seeks to engender increased motivation of its frontline employees should have in place a human resources strategy that includes facilitating communication between personnel and management, supporting employees in the community, and promoting social respect for health professions, providing educational opportunities and career development, development of appropriate promotional policies, employee participation in goal setting, facilitating a good working environment and job security, job enrichment, and delegation."
29510005,0,a,"The article presents analysis of social economic health determinants of parents of children with oncologic diseases. The evaluation of their satisfaction with accessibility of qualitative medical care was carried out. The questionnaire covered issues concerning medical social aspects of health and satisfaction with quality of medical care. the sampling included 284 parents of children with oncologic diseases receiving treatment in the profile departments of Krasnodar, Stavropol, Volgograd, Makhachkala, Grozny, Cherkessk, Nalchik and Astrakhan in August-September 2015. The parents answered to questionnaire independently. The filled questionnaires handed over to the responsible physician. The responsible physician was fully instructed how to proceed with survey. The study established that oncologic disease of child effects quality of life of parents in 33.2% of cases. The relationships within family deteriorate in 19.7% of cases. According opinion of parents, they have high level of literacy in health issues. Only every second parent trusts official medicine and certain percentage of respondents resorts to non-traditional care including psychic individuals and priests. The analysis of answers permitted to derive that hospitalization provides no difficulties though dissatisfaction with treatment costs and attitude of medical personnel remains.It is established that parents of children with oncologic diseases suffer from anxiety and depression on clinical and sub-clinical level that requires implementation of complex of measures of psychological support. The direct dependence is established concerning between presence of anxiety and depression and also presence of depression and physical indisposition of respondents."
14674958,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess patient and/or illness characteristics associated with aspects of quality of life (QOL) in first-episode psychosis (FEP). METHOD: Patient characteristics, symptom ratings and Wisconsin QOL scale (client version) were assessed. Data were analysed with correlation coefficients and a hierarchical regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients presented with varying levels of QOL on different domains. The level of 'general satisfaction' was related to age of onset and social premorbid adjustment; 'weighted index of QOL' to social premorbid adjustment and inversely to educational premorbid adjustment; 'social relations' inversely to duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), length of prodrome and negative symptoms; 'psychological well-being' inversely to depression and educational premorbid adjustment; 'activities of daily living' to social premorbid adjustment and inversely to negative symptoms; and 'outlook on symptoms' to level of depression. CONCLUSION: Domains of self-rated QOL in FEP patients are differentially associated with malleable and non-malleable aspects of patient and illness characteristics."
30800743,0,a,"Introduction: Social Contexts in Medicine (SCIM) is an 18-month program that connects medical students, patients, and physicians for a longitudinal learning experience. SCIM was developed for first- and second-year medical students and seeks to supplement students' biomedical education with practical experiences built around community and continuity. The program increases students' awareness of, and skills to address, social determinants of health via a seminar series, a home visit program, and a mentoring component. Methods: The program begins with a seminar series covering communication skills and the basics of social determinants of health, providing the foundation for successful home visits. Students are then paired with a patient for home visits to learn firsthand about the complex social factors that affect health and illness, patient participation in health care systems, and the doctor-patient relationship. In conjunction with the home visits, students obtain guidance from a physician mentor. Results: The SCIM program has been successful during its first 3 years at our institution. Analysis of changes in student attitudes using Crandall's Medical Student Attitudes Toward the Underserved survey has shown that SCIM students develop more positive attitudes toward the underserved than do their peers completing traditional clinic-based preceptorships. Additionally, in student surveys, the average response to the statement ""I learned something valuable I would not have otherwise learned in my classes"" has been 4.5 out of 5. Discussion: These findings suggest that the SCIM model contributes to medical education by broadening students' understanding about the influence of social factors on health and disease."
29064345,0,a,"Research indicates that older adults receive only about half of their recommended care, with varying quality and limited attention to social issues impacting their health through the most commonly used quality measures. Additionally, many existing measures neglect to address nonclinical social determinants of health. Evidence of the need for more comprehensive measures for seniors is growing. The primary purpose of this article, which is supported by a limited review of literature, is to describe gaps among current quality measures in addressing certain nonclinical needs of older adults, including key social determinants of health. In doing so, the authors describe their position on the need for expanded measures to incorporate these factors to improve care and quality of life. The authors conducted a limited review of the literature to inform this article, focusing specifically on selected measures for older adults rather than a broader systematic review of all measures. Most research identified was related to clinical practice guidelines rather than quality measures of care as applied to older adults. Furthermore, the literature reviewed reflected limited evidence of efforts to tailor quality measures for the unique social needs of older adults, confirming a potential gap in this area. A growing need exists for improved quality measures specifically designed to help providers address the unique social needs of older adults. Filling this gap will improve overall understanding of seniors and help them to achieve optimal health and successful aging."
26205987,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is prevalent in rural communities in Canada, however little is known about the social determinants of health and obesity in rural populations. Socioeconomic status has been found to be inversely associated with the risk of obesity in developed countries. This study investigated the relationship between income adequacy, education and obesity in a rural setting. METHODS: The study used data from 5391 adults aged 18-69 who participated in the Saskatchewan Rural Health Study in 2010. Participants completed a survey that included questions about location of residence, body weight, height, and socio-demographic and behavioral factors. Obesity was defined as body mass index being >/= 30 kg/m(2). Logistic regression using generalized estimating equation was conducted to assess the associations of income adequacy and education level with the prevalence of obesity taking covariates into consideration. RESULTS: Approximately a third of the participants were obese and the prevalence of obesity was similar for men and women. The prevalence of obesity was significantly higher for rural residents not living on farm compared with those living on farm (p < 0.05). After adjustment for potential confounders, the risk of obesity was increased for those with </= 12 years of education compared with those with > 12 years of education (aOR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.05-1.34). Low income adequacy was significantly associated with an increased risk of obesity but only among those not living on farm (aOR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.16-2.79). CONCLUSIONS: Home location was associated with obesity prevalence in rural Saskatchewan and modified the influence of income adequacy, but not the influence of education, on obesity. Adults not living on farm had an increased risk of obesity and showed a significant impact of income adequacy on obesity."
14757305,1,a,"The objective of the study was to examine the sociodemographic and clinical factors influencing gender-specific attempted suicide. Suicide attempters, 40 males and 88 females, seen on a consultation-liaison psychiatric service over a period of 42 months (from January 1, 1999 to June 30, 2002) were compared on sociodemographic and clinical variables. The female attempters [22.99 years (SD 8.1)] were younger than their male counterparts [25.15 years (SD 9.5)] [P = 0.0002]. A higher proportion of the male attempters were engaged in outside occupations, compared with their female counterparts who were mainly full-time housewives or engaged in domestic duties [P = 0.003]. Alcohol misuse was more associated with male suicide attempts [P = 0.001]. Ninety percent of male attempters and 54.6% of the female attempters had the intention to die [P = 0.001]. Although depressive episode was the most common psychiatric disorder in male attempters, followed by neurotic and stress-related disorders, while neurotic and stress-related disorders ranked first in female attempters followed closely by depressive episode, the difference was not significant. However, significantly more male attempters required pharmacotherapy and psychological intervention than their female counterparts [P = 0.002]. More females had marital difficulties, although comparing the two groups on social difficulties did not yield a significant difference. Method used, personality disorders, previous attempt, repeat attempt, race, religion, and marital status were not significant distinguishing factors. Younger age, lack of employment outside home, marital problems, and nondeath motives were more influential in female attempted suicide, while alcohol misuse and severe psychiatric morbidity were more frequently associated with male attempted suicide. The findings support gender-specific preventive and interventional strategies."
20122256,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Neural tube defect (NTD) prevalence in northern China is among the highest worldwide. Dealing with the NTD situation is ranked as the number one task in China's scientific development plan in population and health field for the next decade. Physical and social environments account for much of the disease's occurrence. The environmental determinants and their effects on NTD vary across geographical regions, whereas factors that play a significant role in NTD occurrence may be buried by global statistics analysis to a pooled dataset over the entire study area. This study aims at identification of the local determinants of NTD across the study area and exploration of the epidemiological implications of the findings. METHODS: NTD prevalence rate is represented in terms of the random field theory, and Rushton's circle method is used to stabilize NTD rate estimation across the geographical area of interest; NTD determinants are represented by their measurable proxy variables and the geographical weighted regression (GWR) technique is used to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the NTD determinants. RESULTS: Informative maps of the NTD rates and the statistically significant proxy variables are generated and rigorously assessed in quantitative terms. CONCLUSIONS: The NTD determinants in the study area are investigated and interpreted on the basis of the maps of the proxy variables and the relationships between the proxy variables and the NTD determinants. No single determinant was found to dominate the NTD occurrence in the study area. Villages where NTD rates are significantly linked to environmental determinants are identified (some places are more closely linked to certain environmental factors than others). The results improve current understanding of NTD spread in China and provide valuable information for adequate disease intervention planning."
16326068,1,a,"This study explored the factorial structure of the Italian version of the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders questionnaire (SCARED), and investigated the contributions of genetic and environmental influences of individual variation of anxiety dimensions as reported in the SCARED. Three hundred and seventy-eight twin pairs aged 8-17 from the Italian Twin Registry filled in the SCARED through a mail survey. Four, distinct empirical factors, that corresponded closely to the original SCARED subscales of Generalized Anxiety (GAD), Panic (PD), Social Phobia (SP), and Separation Anxiety (SAD) disorder emerged from Exploratory Factor Analysis. The empirically derived scores were analyzed by structural equation modeling; moderate-to-high heritability, without age or sex differences, emerged for all dimensions with the exception of GAD, for which an age effect was found. The DSM-IV anxiety dimensions identified by the SCARED have a psychometric structure that can be replicated in the Italian culture, and are influenced at different extents by genetic and nonshared environmental determinants."
19556325,1,a,"BACKGROUND: previous studies examining the relationship between socioeconomic status and telomere length showed conflicting results, one study finding shorter telomere length in subjects with lower socioeconomic status and one showing no relationship. DESIGN: cross-sectional study. SETTING: community-living elderly Chinese in Hong Kong. OBJECTIVE: this study examines the relationship between self-rated social economic status and telomere length in Hong Kong Chinese men and women aged 65 years and over living in the community. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: information was collected from 958 men and 978 women regarding possible confounding factors such as the presence of chronic diseases, smoking, physical activity level, dietary intake and body mass index. Telomere length was measured by quantitative PCR. RESULT: in men only, after adjustment for age and other confounding factors, a higher ranking in community standing was associated with shorter telomere length. CONCLUSION: men with higher self-rated socioeconomic status have shorter telomeres, possibly mediated through psychosocial rather than lifestyle factors or the presence of chronic disease. There may be cultural ethnic and age-related differences in social determinants of health."
16612193,1,a,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The reality of schizophrenia is not fully expressed by measures of psychopathology and both descriptive research and research into interventions benefit from the investigation of social outcomes. We define these as measures which reflect performance compared to normal social expectations, either of oneself or of another. The studies we reviewed looked at the effects on summary measures, for example, quality of life, as well as simpler, more self-explanatory outcomes such as employment, marital status, financial independence and housing. RECENT FINDINGS: The review contrasts studies which describe the determinants of social outcomes and studies designed to estimate the effects of interventions on these outcomes. Recent descriptive studies demonstrate that social outcomes have both longitudinal and cross-sectional associations with cognitive impairment, preexisting functional impairment and certain symptoms. Studies of both pharmacological and social interventions suggest that, at best, these can affect social outcomes. SUMMARY: Simpler social outcomes are reported less frequently than summary measures which can make interpretation more difficult, thus diluting a potential advantage of social outcome measures to researchers and clinicians alike. Social outcomes are underreported compared to measures of psychopathology, particularly in trials of interventions."
29652958,0,a,"Cervical cancer is the fourth most common neoplasm in women worldwide and its incidence is associated with profound social inequities. In Chile, it is the second cause of death in women of reproductive age. The Chilean clinical guideline identifies the vaccine against Human Papillomavirus (HPV) as the main preventive measure. Since 2014, the Ministry of Health has implemented free immunization against HPV for girls and female adolescents. This article critically analyzes this public policy from the viewpoint of health equity, using as framework the Social Determinants of Health Model. Specifically, we address the structural determinants of income and gender, which act as material and social barriers for achieving immunization, affecting protection against cervical cancer. These barriers correspond to the high cost of the vaccine, and social attitudes/cultural beliefs towards sexual behavior in Latin America and Chile that affect the acceptability of vaccination. The Social Determinants of Health Model constitutes a useful tool for identifying health inequities and understanding public policy from an equity viewpoint that complements the biomedical and epidemiological understanding of disease. In this topic, the initiative aims to strengthen the idea of health as a human right and health promotion as an essential function of public health policy."
24627055,0,a,"The trend towards decline and stabilization of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil should be analyzed carefully, since aggregate data can mask regional or local inequalities in such a large and diverse country. The current study reevaluates the epidemic's spatial dissemination and the AIDS-related mortality pattern in Brazil. The study considered all AIDS cases diagnosed in individuals over 18 years of age and living in Brazil, as well as AIDS deaths recorded in 1998-2008. Three-year moving average rates were estimated, and a spatial analysis was conducted using a local empirical Bayesian method. The epidemic was only found to be expanding in the North and Northeast regions, while declining in the rest of the country, especially in the Southeast. According to the findings, the apparent stabilization of AIDS mortality tends to mask regional disparities. Social determinants of health and regional disparities should be taken into account in program development and policymaking."
12521802,1,a,"This study examines the determinants of Mission House Delivery among booked patients in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. During the 12 months of the study (1 May 199930 April 2000) 196 booked patients at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife who delivered at mission houses were analysed. All ages and parity groups, educational level and social classes were involved. The majority (73%) were of low socio-economic class. The reasons for mission house delivery included financial constraints (41%), fear of possible caesarean section (46%), industrial action by health-care workers (39%), transport difficulty at night (26%), previous deliveries in mission houses (16%) and communal feud (12%). Four maternal deaths occurred (MMR 978/100 000 births) and 20 perinatal deaths (PNMR 118/1000 total births). Reduction of hospital user fees, provision of transportation and efficient telecommunication facilities at all times, conflict resolution and proper remuneration of health care workers are urgent needs to be addressed. Legislation against delivery in unsafe places and establishment of appropriate facilities by churches interested in maternity services is highly recommended."
26613821,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of an educational program based on the PRECEDE model to improve sexual function among women with hysterectomy. METHODS: The present randomized trial, conducted in Iran during 2014, included 48 women with hysterectomy who were selected through convenience sampling and randomly divided into two equal groups. Women in the experimental group received an educational program based on constructs of the PRECEDE model. The control group received only routine interventions. Before the interventions, the women completed two questionnaires: one that measured the PRECEDE model constructs and the Rosen Female Sexual Function Index. The questionnaires were repeated 4 weeks after the intervention and the results were compared within and between groups. RESULTS: In each group, a significant improvement in sexual function was demonstrated after the intervention (P<0.001). The mean sexual function score increased to a greater extent in the experimental group (difference 16.95+/-6.33) than in the control group (difference 4.35+/-1.94; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings confirm the effectiveness of an educational program based on the PRECEDE model in terms of improving sexual function among women with hysterectomy.

30118538,0,a,"AIMS: Research regarding the determinants of concordance with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treatment is limited. Here, we test whether the psychosocial changes outlined in the teachable moments model, as proposed by McBride et al. (McBride CM, Emmons KM, Lipkus IM. Understanding the potential of teachable moments: the case of smoking cessation. Health Educ Res 2003; 18: 156-170) are associated with following GDM treatment recommendations. METHODS: Fifty-nine women completed a baseline questionnaire (1 week after GDM diagnosis) in which they reported risk perception, social support, emotional response, the importance of their maternal identity and self-efficacy. One month later, participants reported their concordance with instructions regarding glucose monitoring, diet and, if applicable, medication. We used regression analysis to test for associations between the psychosocial factors measured at baseline and concordance at 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Those who perceived their risk as higher or felt supported by family or friends were more likely to report a high level of concordance with GDM treatment. Emotional response, identity salience and self-efficacy were not related to concordance. CONCLUSIONS: Future interventions designed to increase concordance could benefit from a focus on risk perception and social support, as these factors appear to be most strongly associated with following GDM treatment recommendations."
15098428,1,a,"Despite significant debate about the efficacy, ideology, and ethics of the method, condom social marketing (CSM) has become the dominant approach to AIDS education in many sub-Saharan African countries. However, critics have charged that social marketing (SM) distracts from the structural determinants of health-related behavior and excludes genuine community participation. This article argues that the diffusion of SM techniques in Africa is not driven by demonstrated efficacy but is attributable to the promotion of privatization and free markets in the structural adjustment era across the region. The CSM experience in a central Mozambican community reveals the dangers of using the method at the expense of community dialogue and participation to confront the AIDS epidemic. The advertising campaign developed to sell condoms has clashed with Pentecostal and Independent Churches, now a majority of the population, that have expanded rapidly across the region spreading a contrasting message about sexuality and risky behavior."
24143156,0,a,"Large knowledge gaps currently exist that limit our ability to understand and characterise dynamics and patterns of land-use intensity: in particular, a comprehensive conceptual framework and a system of measurement are lacking. This situation hampers the development of a sound understanding of the mechanisms, determinants, and constraints underlying changes in land-use intensity. On the basis of a review of approaches for studying land-use intensity, we propose a conceptual framework to quantify and analyse land-use intensity. This framework integrates three dimensions: (a) input intensity, (b) output intensity, and (c) the associated system-level impacts of land-based production (e.g. changes in carbon storage or biodiversity). The systematic development of indicators across these dimensions would provide opportunities for the systematic analyses of the trade-offs, synergies and opportunity costs of land-use intensification strategies."
19560371,1,a,"PURPOSE: In middle-income countries, interest in the study of inequalities in health has focused on aggregate types of health outcomes, like rates of mortality. This work moves beyond such measures to focus on disease-specific health outcomes with the use of national health survey data. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the national Health and Welfare Survey 2003, covering 52,030 adult aged 15 or older, were analyzed. The health outcomes were the 20 most commonly reported diseases. The age-sex adjusted concentration index (C *) of ill health was used as a measure of socioeconomic health inequality (values ranging from -1 to +1). A negative (or positive) concentration index shows that a disease was more concentrated among the less well off (or better off). Crude concentration indices (C) for four of the most common diseases were also decomposed to quantify determinants of inequalities. RESULTS: Several diseases, such as malaria (C * = -0.462), goiter (C * = -0.352), kidney stone (C * = -0.261), and tuberculosis (C * = -0.233), were strongly concentrated among those with lower incomes, whereas allergic conditions (C * = 0.174) and migraine (C * = 0.085) were disproportionately reported by the better off. Inequalities were found to be associated with older age, low education, and residence in the rural Northeast and rural North of Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-equity health policy in Thailand and other middle-income countries with health surveys can now be informed by national data combining epidemiological, socioeconomic and health statistics in ways not previously possible."
24583944,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Guided by the social comparison theory, we examined correlates of the discrepancy between chronological and felt ages in three age groups of community-dwelling older adults: 65 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 and older. METHOD: Data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study and linear regression models were used to test the hypothesis that age discrepancy would be significantly associated with objective health indicators among those in the 65 to 69 and 70 to 79 age groups but not among the 80+ group. RESULTS: Objective health indicators were significantly associated with age discrepancy only in the 70 to 79 age group, while subjective health perceptions and psychological well-being were significantly associated with age discrepancy in all age groups. DISCUSSION: The correlates of the discrepancy in the 65 to 69 age group appear to resemble those in the 80+ group more than those in the 70 to 79 age group. Further research is needed to identify the determinants of age group differences."
11697274,1,a,"We examined the effect of relation between interferences from distractor and inhibitory mechanism on the occurrence of negative priming, by using a matching paradigm. The ease of perceptual target selection was determined by magnitudes of interference. Stereoscopic depth was used to manipulate the relative position of a target, a distractor and a standard figure. When the ease of perceptual target selection was manipulated by separation of the target from the distractor in depth, positive priming occurred. However, the ease of target selection turned out to be unnecessary in the occurrence of priming effects. When the distractor and the standard figure were displayed at the same depth plane, where the distractor was supposed to interfere with the encoding of a standard figure, negative priming occurred consistently regardless of the ease of perceptual target selection. This study suggests that inhibitory mechanism contributes to the suppression of inappropriate processes by distractor, and inhibitory mechanism actively keeps distractors from interfering with standard figures."
22411393,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The intensive care of patients at home had probed important beneficialness for the patient and the Health System. There are very few experiences of this kind of care from the Public Hospitals. OBJECTIVE: To develop a social-sanitary analysis of the feasibility of the implementation of HPN on patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) from a Public Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients hospitalized between 1985-2009 were included. We analyzed: age, residual intestine length (RIL), time between de indication and the beginning of HPN, HPN duration, treatment modality and clinical outcome. Social determinants: home place, habitat conditions, employment conditions, educational level, social security and Low Socioeconomic Status (LSS). The group were divided in two: 1- patients with feasibility of HPN when it was prescribed; 2- patients without feasibility of HPN. RESULTS: 61 patients were included, RIL x: 21.7 +/- 11.6 cm. The HPN was feasible (G1) in 32 patients (52.4%) and no feasible (G2) in 29 (47.6%). The home treatment modality was in self-caring 25 (81%) and with nurses support 7 (19 %). The social determinants associated with the HPN feasibility were: more than one takecare (p 0.03), educational level (p 0.01), adequate habitat conditions (p 0.02) and Low Socioeconomis Status (LSS) (p 0.07). 17 patients reached intestinal adaptation (28%), 6 (10%) were transplanted, 19 (31%) died and 19 (31%) are actually on HPN. CONCLUSION: The HPN realized from the Public Hospital is feasible. Different social determinants were observed. The care of this group of patients must be done by an interdisciplinary group including general aspects of the child and the family."
19841546,1,a,"AIM: To assess the impact of socio-demographic and clinical variables on the oral hygiene and periodontal status in a sample of mentally disabled subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample comprised of 171 mentally disabled subjects attending a special school in Udaipur, India. Oral hygiene status was assessed by Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) and periodontal status by Community Periodontal Index. RESULTS: Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that the best predictors in the descending order for oral hygiene index were disabled sibling, medical diagnosis, IQ level, education of mother and father. Having Down syndrome, less educated parents, poor economic status and a disabled sibling were the most important predictors for poor periodontal status. CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlighted that the oral hygiene and periodontal status of the present study population is poor and was influenced by medical diagnosis, IQ level, disabled sibling, parent's level of education and economic status."
23687797,0,a,"Marital satisfaction is important for health and well-being, although determinants of satisfaction among older couples are unclear. Much of the marital literature has focused on the role of the spouse, in isolation from satisfaction with broader social relationships. We conducted separate semi-structured interviews with both members of n = 40 couples (mean age 76 years) to measure satisfaction with particular types of social networks (confidant, friend, children, other relatives) as well as levels of physical and psychological well-being. In order to account for the likely interdependence among observations within married couples, a series of multi-level models, culminating in a full actor-partner interdependence model, were fitted. Results indicate that an individual's own depressive symptoms were related to their levels of marital satisfaction, whereby higher scores on the depression scale predicted lower marital satisfaction scores for the individual. None of the individual's other variables (physical well-being, sociodemographic, or social network satisfaction), nor any of the spouse variables, were related to individual levels of marital satisfaction. These findings reinforce the importance of psychological well-being as influencing the quality of older couple relationships."
12862185,1,a,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Outcome in patients hospitalized for acute stroke varies considerably between populations. Within the framework of the GAIN International trial, a large multicenter trial of a neuroprotective agent (gavestinel, glycine antagonist), stroke outcome in relation to health care resource use has been compared in a large number of countries, allowing for differences in case mix. METHODS: This substudy includes 1,422 patients in 19 countries grouped into 10 regions. Data on prognostic variables on admission to hospital, resource use, and outcome were analyzed by regression models. RESULTS: All results were adjusted for differences in prognostic factors on admission (NIH Stroke Scale, age, comorbidity). There were threefold variations in the average number of days in hospital/institutional care (from 20 to 60 days). The proportion of patients who met with professional rehabilitation staff also varied greatly. Three-month case fatality ranged from 11% to 28%, and mean Barthel ADL score at three months varied between 64 and 73. There was no relationship between health care resource use and outcome in terms of survival and ADL function at three months. The proportion of patients living at home at three months did not show any relationship to ADL function across countries. CONCLUSIONS: There are wide variations in health care resource use between countries, unexplained by differences in case mix. Across countries, there is no obvious relationship between resource use and clinical outcome after stroke. Differences in health care traditions (treatment pathways) and social context seem to be major determinants of resource use. In making comparisons between countries, great care should be exercised in using outcome variables as indicators of quality of stroke care."
31927365,0,a,"Methylisothiazolinone (MI) and the mixture of methylchloroisothiazo notlinone/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI, 3:1) are widespread biocides used in cosmetics, household products, paints or as disinfectant in air-conditioning systems. Exposure to these compounds has raised concerns due to their sensitizing potential, as rates of skin sensitization were reported to increase in the last decade. We have analyzed N-methylmalonamic acid (NMMA), a common metabolite of MI and MCI in 24-h urine samples of the German Environmental Specimen Bank collected from 480 participants (240 male/240 female) between the years 2000 and 2017. Using these data, we were able to calculate the overall daily intake of MI and/or MCI/MI (3:1) of the study participants and point out time trends. NMMA was determined in all urine samples investigated above the LOQ of 0.5 mug/L urine. Median and 95th percentile level of NMMA in all 24-h urine samples was 4.1 mug/g creatinine and 8.5 mug/g creatinine, respectively. This would correspond to a median and 95th percentile daily intake of 0.35 mug/kg bw and 0.71 mug/kg bw for exclusive uptake of MI and 0.64 mug/kg bw and 1.28 mug/kg bw for exclusive uptake of MCI/MI (3:1). We noted only slight variations over time for median exposures, but an increasing time trend in the 95th percentile exposure between 2006 and 2011 with a decrease in recent years, probably reflecting regulatory measures on MI and MCI/MI (3:1) in cosmetic products. Increasing knowledge on determinants of exposure to MI and/or MCI/MI (3:1) would be necessary to further lower exposure to these sensitizing compounds."
27340312,0,a,"The role of religion in explaining fertility differences is often overlooked in demographic studies, particularly in Western Europe, where there has been a substantial decline in institutional forms of religious adherence. The current study explores the changing relationships between religion and childbearing in Britain, France and the Netherlands. Using data from the Generations and Gender Programme and the British Household Panel Survey, religious differences in completed fertility and the transition to first birth are explored across cohorts of women. In addition, a longitudinal analysis is employed to examine the influence of religion on subsequent childbearing. Although the secularization paradigm assumes that the influence of religion on individual behavior will diminish over time, it is found that religious affiliation and practice continue to be important determinants of fertility and family formation patterns. However, there is some variation in the relationship between religion and fertility across countries; while in France and the Netherlands fertility gaps by religiosity are either consistent or increasing, in Britain, this gap appears to have narrowed over time. These findings suggest that fertility differences by religion also depend on the particular social context of religious institutions in each country."
24926187,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Current evidence consistently confirm inequalities in health status among socioeconomic none, gender,ethnicity, geographical area and other social determinants of health (SDH), which adversely influence health ofthe population. SDH refer to a wide range of factors not limited to social component, but also involve economic, cultural,educational, political or environmental problems. Measuring inequalities, improving daily living conditions, andtackling inequitable distribution of resources are highly recommended by international SDH commissioners in recentyears to 'close the gaps within a generation'. To measure inequalities in socio-economic determinants and core healthindicators in Tehran, the second round of Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban HEART-2)was conducted in November 2011, within the main framework of WHO Centre for Health Development (Kobe Centre). METHOD: For 'assessment' part of the project, 65 indicators in six policy domains namely 'physical and infrastructure','human and social', 'economic', 'governance', 'health and nutrition', and also 'cultural' domain were targetedeither through a population based survey or using routine system. Survey was conducted in a multistage random sampling,disaggregated to 22 districts and 368 neighborhoods of Tehran, where data of almost 35000 households(118000 individuals) were collected. For 'response' part of the project, widespread community based development(CBD) projects were organized in all 368 neighborhoods, which are being undertaken throughout 2013. CONCLUSION: Following the first round of Urban HEART project in 2008, the second round was conducted to trackchanges over time, to institutionalize inequality assessment within the local government, to build up community participationin 'assessment' and 'response' parts of the project, and to implement appropriate and evidence-based actionsto reduce health inequalities within all neighborhoods of Tehran."
20157439,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There is growing concern about physical inactivity in adolescents and young adults. Identifying determinants that are associated with low levels of physical activity and with changes in physical activity levels will help to develop specific prevention strategies. The present study describes the prevalence and potential determinants of physical activity behavior and behavior changes of young adults. The study is based on the Swiss Household Panel (SHP), a longitudinal study assessing social changes in a representative sample of Swiss households since 1999. METHODS: Data is collected yearly using computer-assisted telephone interviews. Information is obtained from each household member over 14 years of age. Participants between 14 and 24 years entering the SHP between 1999 and 2006 were included (N = 3,068). ""Inactive"" was defined as less than 1 day/week of at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity, ""no sport"" as exercising less than once a week. Age, gender, nationality, linguistic region, household income, education, membership in a sport club, reading, and Internet use were included as potential determinants of physical activity behavior and behavior change. RESULTS: In both young men and young women, the prevalence of inactivity, ""no sport"", and non-membership in a sport club was increasing with age. Women were less active than men of the same age. From one wave to the following, 11.1% of young men and 12.1% of young women became active, and 11.9% of men and 13.7% of women became inactive, respectively (pooled data over all eight waves). Non-membership in a sport club was the strongest predictor for ""no sport"" (OR(men )6.7 [4.9-8.9]; OR(women )8.1 [5.7-11.4]), but also for being inactive (OR 4.6 [3.5-6.0]; 4.6 [3.3-6.4]). Leaving a sport club (OR 7.8 [4.4-14.0]; 11.9 [5.9-24.1]) and remaining non-member (OR 7.8 [4.7-12.9]; 12.4 [6.4-24.1]) were the strongest predictors of becoming ""no sport"". Effects for becoming inactive were similar, though smaller (OR 5.9 [3.4-10.5] and 5.1 [2.7-9.6] for leaving a club, OR 5.1 [3.1-8.4] and 6.9 [4.0-11.8] for remaining non-member). CONCLUSIONS: The most important findings were the strong effects of sport club membership on general physical activity. The correlation between sport club membership and exercise was not surprising in its nature, but in its strength."
24491081,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Further research is needed to improve the evidence regarding determinants of physical activity (PA) as a crucial step to plan higher effective intervention strategies. The goal of the present study is to identify socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of primary care (PHC) insufficiently active patients that are associated with longitudinal changes in the level of physical activity. METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of baseline socio-demographic and clinical predictors of physical activity change in insufficiently active PHC patients who participated in a PA-promoting multi-centre randomized clinical trial conducted from October 2003 through March 2006. The primary outcome measure was the self-reported physical activity assessed with the 7-day Physical Activity Recall (PAR), at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months. Baseline covariates included sex, age, social class, anthropometric measures and other cardiovascular risk factors or associated diseases (Diabetes, HTA, tobacco use, etc.), and stage of readiness to change PA. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate longitudinal association of studied variables on PA change over the three follow-up measurements. RESULTS: A total of 3691 patients (85% of the 4317 recruited in the trial) with at least one follow-up measurement were included in the longitudinal analysis. At baseline, analysed patients (mean age: 50.6 years; 64.6% women) devoted 34.7 minutes and 2.36 metabolic equivalent hours per week (MET.h/week) to moderate and vigorous physical activity. Older age, male gender, higher social class, lower BMI, diagnosis of diabetes or hypertension, and measurement season were significant predictors of PA longitudinal change. The effect of baseline readiness to change on PA dose was modified by time, showing a positive gradient in favour of those with more readiness to change that increases significantly at 12 and 24 months (p-value interaction < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Identified baseline characteristics such as readiness to change and risk factors can guide physicians to prioritize time and intervention efforts for maximizing their impact on insufficiently active PHC patients."

Caregiver burden was correlated to their level of depression and quality of life and, differently from other chronic disorders, increased with the worsening of patients' disability. ALS patients have a good objective perception of their impact on caregivers."
21328806,0,a,"Using survival models, we test whether short-term changes in the labour market affect poverty duration. Data are from the Brazilian Monthly Employment Survey. Such a monthly dataset permits more accurate estimations of events than using annual data, but its panel follows households for a short period. Then methods that control for both right- and left-censoring should be used. The results are as follows: households with zero income are not those with the lowest chances of exiting; changes in aggregate unemployment do not affect poverty duration; and increasing wages in the informal sector has a negative effect on poverty duration."
17905053,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Sickness absence is a major occupational health problem, but evidence for associations between potentially modifiable psychosocial work factors and sickness absence is still scarce. We studied the impact of relational justice and effort-reward imbalance on subsequent rates of sickness absence. METHODS: The Whitehall II prospective cohort study of British civil servants, 10,308 men and women, was established between 1985 and 1988. Indicators of effort-reward imbalance and the relational component of organizational justice were constructed from questions included at baseline. Participants were classified into three groups (low, intermediate, and high) for both effort-reward imbalance and relational justice. Short (< or =7 days) and long (>7 days) spells of sickness absence during 1985-1989 and 1991-1995 were used to study immediate and longer term effects of work characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, employment grade, and baseline health, men and women with low relational justice had increased risks of long spells of sickness absence of 14% and 28% in comparison to men and women experiencing high levels of justice. Similar effect sizes (25% and 21%) were found for high vs. low effort-reward imbalance. Both work measures also predicted short spells of sickness absence. Effort-reward imbalance (men and women) and relational justice (women only) each predicted long spells of sickness absence independently of the other. CONCLUSIONS: Both relational justice and effort-reward imbalance are important determinants of sickness absence. Workplace interventions to improve these aspects of working conditions have the potential to reduce levels of sickness absence."
28981336,0,a,"To address barriers to adequate engagement in medical care among people living with HIV, Wisconsin's AIDS/HIV Program created a new position, the Linkage to Care (LTC) Specialist. Specialists provide intensive, short-term case management and patient navigation services for small caseloads of individuals at high risk of disengaging with medical care. Clients are eligible if they are newly diagnosed with HIV or new to medical care, recently released from incarceration, recently out of care, nonadherent to scheduled medical care visits, or have detectable viral load while in care. Interviews with 30 clients of Specialists were conducted to understand experiences with the program and medical care. Common themes included the ability of Specialists to navigate complex systems of care and support services, the unique role Specialists played in their clients' lives, and the challenges of transitioning out of the program. Although the primary goal of Specialists is to address barriers to medical care, they often adopted a holistic approach that also included housing, financial assistance, and other social determinants of health. Descriptions of the Specialist's role in implementation manuals focus on their functional roles and the services provided. However, clients often discussed the emotional support they received, especially for clients without strong social support networks. Many clients also desired an ongoing relationship with their Specialists even after discharge, but had been able to establish independence and self-efficacy. The LTC Specialists are resource-intensive considering their small caseloads, but fill an important gap in existing, often overtaxed case management systems."
23057971,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study describes the design and implementation of a health impact assessment (HIA) conducted in 2010 of the regeneration project of San Fernando Street, the main avenue crossing the San Miguel-El Castillo neighborhood in Alcala de Guadaira (Seville, Spain). This project is part of the wider URBAN Plan aimed at the social, urban and economic regeneration of the city's historic center. METHODS: This experience followed the standard HIA stages and procedures. The review of published evidence was complemented with new qualitative information gathered by means of a participative workshop with the local population and interviews with social and health workers involved in the neighborhood. RESULTS: During the building stage of the project, the adverse impacts were related to a worsening of the air quality, increased noise pollution, mobility restrictions and a higher risk of accidents, particularly among older or disabled people. Once the building stage was finished, the health benefits were associated with significant improvements in physical accessibility and the population's access to health services and other goods and services. Other positive effects were the enhanced safety and attractiveness of the neighborhood and the new opportunities for socializing, social cohesion and increasing the community's self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first HIA experience in Andalusia whose results have been integrated into a formal cycle of decision making in the local community. This experience has provided new evidence of the potential of HIA and its applicability and acceptance at the municipal level and has has also facilitated a learning process and the piloting of new methods and tools associated with the HIA process."
30362862,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although causality is difficult to establish, the regular use of marijuana has been associated with many adverse physiological and sociological consequences. There is considerable concern regarding marijuana use among adolescents, as the likelihood of adverse consequences increases significantly for this age group. The most comprehensive data for identifying risk factors for adolescent marijuana use is typically self-report, which may be over- or under-reported for a variety of reasons, including stigmatization, peer-pressure, or fear of being discovered. OBJECTIVES: To identify the prevalence of adolescent marijuana use in Washington State, and the associated risk and protective factors, while controlling for and estimating the extent of misreporting, and its determinants. METHOD: Data came from the 2014 Washington State Healthy Youth Survey. We accounted for missingness using chained multivariate imputation equations, resulting in 33,320 complete observations. Our model was estimated using a maximum likelihood multiple regression designed to control for systematic misclassification in binary dependent variables. RESULTS: Approximately 12% of Washington adolescents claimed to have used marijuana in the past 30 days. Our estimates indicate this figure is likely closer to 18%. Determinants of use included use of other substances, gender, age, and measures of deviant social influences, personality/attitude, school and family bonds, bullying, and acquisition ease. Determinants of misreporting included use of other substances, gender, parental education, and family bonds. CONCLUSIONS: Failing to control for misreporting considerably underestimates the prevalence of marijuana use among adolescents. Our model allows us to better identify at-risk adolescents and inform focused prevention efforts."

12048146,1,a,"Neurocognitive deficits are believed to be important predictors of functional outcome in chronic psychotic disorders, but few supporting studies have utilized prospective designs and adequate control. The aim of this study was to estimate the relative influence of symptoms and neurocognitive deficits on the development of social behavior skills in a cohort of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder recovering from acute symptom exacerbations. Forty-six individuals were recruited upon discharge from an inpatient unit and completed assessments of symptoms, neurocognitive function, and social behavior at 3-month intervals for 1 year. Correlational analyses and random regression models were used to model social behavioral capacities longitudinally. Social behavior improved modestly (10% improvements in ratings) over the follow-up period for the group as a whole. Disorganized and negative symptoms, as well as neurocognitive deficits in short-term and working memory predicted changes in social behavior over time. Individuals with better working memory function showed significantly greater abilities to recover social behavior skills, whereas those with working memory deficits showed no functional improvement over time. Both symptoms and neurocognitive deficits are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia. It is proposed that clinicians should consider neurocognitive thresholds for treatment response when developing rehabilitation plans."

16848259,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of preschool children are being referred for specialist dental management in a paediatric hospital. Most cases have severe early childhood caries and require comprehensive management under general anaesthesia. The present study investigated risk factors for disease presence at initial consultation. METHODS: A convenience sample of 125 children under four years of age from the north Brisbane region were examined and caries experience recorded using dmft and dmfs indices. A self-administered questionnaire obtained information regarding social, demographic, birth, neonatal, infant feeding and dental health behaviour variables. The data were analysed using the chi-square and one-way analysis of variance procedures. RESULTS: Ninety-four per cent of referred children had severe ECC with mean dmft of 10.5 +/- 3.8 and mean dmfs of 27.1 +/- 15.1. Prevalence of severe ECC was significantly higher in children allowed a sweetened liquid in the infant feeding bottle (99 per cent) and allowed to sip from an infant feeding bottle during the day (100 per cent). Mean dmfs was significantly higher in children allowed to sleep with a bottle (28.7) and sip from a bottle during the day (29.9), children from a non-Caucasian background (31.8), those children that commenced regular toothbrushing between 6 to 12 months of age (28.1), had no current parental supervision of daily tooth-brushing (34.2) and had not taken daily fluoride supplements (27.8), vitamin supplements (27.8) or prescription medicine previously (27.6). CONCLUSIONS: The behavioural determinants for severe early childhood caries presence in hospital-referred children were similar to those identified in the regional preschool population."
17132545,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study assesses neuropsychological and psychosocial determinants of judgements of personality change (PC) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from 87 participants with TBI analysed using hierarchical binary regression. METHODS: Interview of participants assessed, injury severity (post-traumatic amnesia), degree of cognitive impairment (IQ and memory), presence of orbitofrontal and/or medial temporal damage (olfaction) and emotional reactions (anger, depression and anxiety questionnaires). Separate interview of relatives assessed their own response to the injury (emotional reactions and critical comments from the Expressed Emotion index) and their judgements of participants' behavioural change. RESULTS: As expected, memory loss and impaired olfaction predicted relatives' PC judgements. However, the most striking and novel result was that social-emotional factors (participants' and relatives' reactions) predicted PC judgements best. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the need (a) for future studies measuring social behaviours (e.g. impulsivity and emotional perception) (b) to explore the differing determinants of relatives' and participants' PC judgements and (c) to develop and to tailor clinical responses to the various psychosocial determinants of PC."
16379145,1,a,"High quality clinical outcome, good oral health and prevention of oral diseases depend heavily on the patient's adherence to suggested behaviour. Improved awareness of psycho-social determinants of patient's health behaviours may aid to modify patient behaviour, increase patients' adherence, contribute to general health and quality of life of individual patients and the public and maximise the benefits that dentistry can offer."
18390845,1,a,"Schools are overloaded with health promotion programs that, altogether, focus on a broad array of behavioral domains, including substance abuse, sexuality and nutrition. Although the specific content of programs varies according to the domain focus, programs usually address similar concepts: knowledge, attitudinal beliefs, social influences and skills. This apparent conceptual overlap between behaviors and programs provides opportunities for a transfer-oriented approach which will stimulate students to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in one domain (e.g. skills for resisting tobacco use) to other domains (e.g. alcohol, sex). A requirement for such an approach is that behaviors share at least some determinants. This review addresses this issue by examining similarities between domain-specific determinants of smoking, drinking, safe sex and healthy nutrition among adolescents. Recent empirical studies and reviews were examined. The results show that the following determinants are relevant to all four behaviors: beliefs about immediate gratification and social advantages, peer norms, peer and parental modeling and refusal self-efficacy. Several other determinants have been found to relate to at least two behaviors, e.g. health risk beliefs and parental norms. These results can be used for the development of a transfer-oriented school health promotion curriculum."
15798114,1,a,"The innovative practice that resulted from the Ottawa Charter challenges public health knowledge about programming and evaluation. Specifically, there is a need to formulate program theory that embraces social determinants of health and local actors' mobilization for social change. Likewise, it is imperative to develop a theory of evaluation that fosters reflexive understanding of public health programs engaged in social change. We believe advances in contemporary social theory that are founded on a critique of modernity and that articulate a coherent theory of practice should be considered when addressing these critical challenges."
25582809,0,a,"Over the past decades, Internet use has grown substantially, and it now serves people as a supportive tool that is used regularly and-in large parts of the world-inevitably. Some people develop problematic Internet use, which may lead to addictive behavior and it is becoming important to explore the risk factors for compulsive Internet use. Data were analyzed on compulsive Internet use [with the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS)] from 5247 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) adolescent twins registered with the Netherlands Twin Register. The participants form a sample that is informative for genetic analyses, allowing the investigation of the causes of individual differences in compulsive Internet use. The internal consistency of the instrument was high and the 1.6-year test-retest correlation in a subsample (n = 902) was 0.55. CIUS scores increased slightly with age. Remarkably, gender did not explain variation in CIUS scores, as mean scores on the CIUS were the same in boys and girls. However, the time spent on specific Internet activities differed: boys spent more time on gaming, whereas girls spent more time on social network sites and chatting. The heritability estimates were the same for boys and girls: 48 percent of the individual differences in CIUS score were influenced by genetic factors. The remaining variance (52 percent) was due to environmental influences that were not shared between family members. Because a life without Internet is almost impossible nowadays, it is important to further explore the determinants of compulsive Internet use, including genetic risk factors."
15935588,1,a,"Centenarians represent an intriguing model for ageing studies, since they demonstrate extreme longevity by definition, and at the same time a proportion of them have aged successfully. Here, we present data from the first nationwide study on Greek centenarians concerning their functional health status and life-style characteristics. We have identified 489 individuals (77% women) born in 1900 or before who were still alive between the years 2000 and 2002. Socio-demographic characteristics, activities of daily living (ADLs), living conditions, dependence on other people, former and current diseases and health disorders, current medication, nutrition and personal habits were recorded for every subject. Interestingly, only 2% of Greek centenarians lived in nursing homes, while the majority lived with their family or relatives. Furthermore, 6% were free from severe health disorders, autonomous (based on simple criteria for ADLs) and also leading an active social life, and hence may be considered as being in optimal condition. This group of centenarians may serve as a valuable source of information on genetic, environmental, and psychosocial determinants of successful ageing."

18378372,1,a,"The emerging fields of social epidemiology and population health seek to understand the social determinants of health. Especially, with regards to how income inequality causes health disparities, attention has been focused on material and psychosocial mechanisms. I use examples from the epidemiological and social science literature to argue for a third broad etiological framework: the role played by the ways we generally recognize, define, name, and categorize disease states and attribute them to a cause or set of causes. These framing effects shape population health by influencing: health and illness beliefs; patterns of consumption and other behaviors; perceptions of what interventions and policies work; class, ethnic, and other social dynamics; and clinical and public health practices. Important characteristics of many framing phenomena are their capacity to be self-perpetuating and their performative power. A better understanding of framing effects can lead to deploying them more deliberatively and flexibly to improve individual and population health."
28830030,0,a,"The diagnosis of epilepsy in children is known to impact the trajectory of their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) over time. However, there is limited knowledge about variations in longitudinal trajectories across multiple domains of HRQOL. This study aims to characterize the heterogeneity in HRQOL trajectories across multiple HRQOL domains and to evaluate predictors of differences among the identified trajectory groups in children with new-onset epilepsy. Data were obtained from the Health Related Quality of Life in Children with Epilepsy Study (HERQULES), a prospective multi-center study of 373 children newly diagnosed with new-onset epilepsy who were followed up over 2years. Child HRQOL and family factors were reported by parents, and clinical characteristics were reported by neurologists. Group-based multi-trajectory modeling was adopted to characterize longitudinal trajectories of HRQOL as measured by the individual domains of cognitive, emotional, physical, and social functioning in the 55-item Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire (QOLCE-55). Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess potential factors that explain differences among the identified latent trajectory groups. Three distinct HRQOL trajectory subgroups were identified in children with new-onset epilepsy based on HRQOL scores: ""High"" (44.7%), ""Intermediate"" (37.0%), and ""Low"" (18.3%). While most trajectory groups exhibited increasing scores over time on physical and social domains, both flat and declining trajectories were noted on emotional and cognitive domains. Less severe epilepsy, an absence of cognitive and behavioral problems, lower parental depression scores, better family functioning, and fewer family demands were associated with a ""Higher"" or ""Intermediate"" HRQOL trajectory. The course of HRQOL over time in children with new-onset epilepsy appears to follow one of three different trajectories. Addressing the clinical and psychosocial determinants identified for each pattern can help clinicians provide more targeted care to these children and their families."
19459122,1,a,"Often missing from the discourse on alcohol use is that ""alcohol-related problems among college students"" appears to be a euphemism for ""white college men"" in that students who experience alcohol-related problems disproportionately tend to be white men. An important aspect of promoting social and behavioral change is to understand race-related mechanisms that structure desire for students to engage in alcohol use. This article presents findings based on undergraduate students attending a Midwest university. The current study contributes to the theoretical literature on alcohol use and race. We use logistic regression models which suggest race and attitudes pertaining to race relations matter in predicting non-binge drinking and abstinence behavior."
25792337,0,a,"The simultaneous burdens of communicable and chronic non-communicable diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality in middle-income countries. The poor are at particular risk, with lower access to health care and higher rates of avoidable mortality. Integrating health-related services with microfinance has been shown to improve health knowledge, behaviors, and access to appropriate health care. However, limited evidence is available on effects of fully integrating clinical health service delivery alongside microfinance services through large scale and sustained long-term programs. Using a conceptual model of health services access, we examine supply- and demand-side factors in a microfinance client population receiving integrated services. We conduct a case study using data from 2010 to 2012 of the design of a universal screening program and primary care services provided in conjunction with microfinance loans by Pro Mujer, a women's development organization in Latin America. The program operates in Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Peru. We analyze descriptive reports and administrative data for measures related to improving access to primary health services and management of chronic diseases. We find provision of preventive care is substantial, with an average of 13% of Pro Mujer clients being screened for cervical cancer each year, 21% receiving breast exams, 16% having a blood glucose measurement, 39% receiving a blood pressure measurement, and 46% having their body mass index calculated. This population, with more than half of those screened being overweight or obese and 9% of those screened having elevated glucose measures, has major risk factors for diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease without intervention. The components of the Pro Mujer health program address four dimensions of healthcare access: geographic accessibility, availability, affordability, and acceptability. Significant progress has been made to meet basic health needs, but challenges remain to ensure that health care provided is of reliable quality to predictably improve health outcomes over time."
12415928,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the major psychosocial determinants of smoking in adolescents and the school influence on these determinants. METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey in 8th grade (age 14.8 years, n = 459) of 14 schools. Logistic regression with smoking as the dependent, and psychosocial indicators as independent variables. Total climate score for each school computed as the sum of scores of five school-related indicators. Linear regression analysis on aggregate data (school level), controlling for gender, ethnicity, and social class. RESULTS: Five out of 15 tested psychosocial indicators were identified as independent protective factors. The prevalence of smoking decreased steeply with an increasing number of protective factors. In the regression analysis on the aggregate level the mean number of protective factors per school and the prevalence of smoking were significantly related to the school climate score (R2 = 0.650, p < 0.001, and R2 = 0.456, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Provided a causal interpretation of the cross-sectional statistical associations is correct, efforts to improve the general climate in schools appear as a promising strategy to enhance individual protective factors. Longitudinal evaluative studies are needed to prove the effectiveness of such a strategy."

The multiracial categories used here are derived from youths' reports of their own and their parents' race(s). Comparisons are made within groups of multiracial respondents who make different choices among single-race categories. Results show differences between subgroups in strength and importance of ethnic identity, self-esteem, and perceptions of ethnic discrimination. Multinomial logistic regression shows further that physiognomy, ethnic identity, and race of coresident parent(s) are significantly associated with reported race. Also related to racial identification among part-Hispanic youth are the racial distribution and socioeconomic status of their neighborhoods and the racial distributions of their schools."
15222847,1,a,"Research bearing on several popular conceptions of the major determinants of anger arousal indicates that the particular appraisals often identified as causes of anger frequently only serve to affect the intensity of the anger that is generated. Research into effects of physical pain or other physically unpleasant conditions or involving social stresses suggests that decidedly aversive conditions are a major spur to anger. Experiments are also reviewed showing that anger-related muscular movements can also lead to anger-related feelings, memories, cognitions, and autonomic responses. Alternative explanations for the findings are discussed. The authors urge emotion theorists to widen their methodology and analyses so that they give careful, detailed attention to the many different factors that can influence anger."
25885537,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Addressing the social determinants of health (SDH) is identified as a role for local public health units (PHUs) in the province of Ontario. Despite this authorization to do so there is wide variation in PHU practice. In this article we consider the factors that shape local PHU action on the SDH through a critical realist analysis. METHODS: Interviews with Medical Officers of Health (MOHs) and lead staff from nine PHUs in Ontario identify the structures and powers that allow PHUs to address the SDH as well as the many factors that either activate or inhibit these structures and powers. RESULTS: We found that personal backgrounds and attitudes of MOHs and leading staff people as well as local jurisdictional characteristics shape whether and how PHUs carry out SDH-related activities. CONCLUSIONS: Action on the SDH is a result of a complex interplay of micro-, meso- and macro-level factors that requires recognition of the contested nature of public health, presence of Ministry of Health mandates, local jurisdictional characteristics, and politics. The most effective way to assure PHU action on the SDH is for the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to mandate such activities and develop accountability mechanisms that assure implementation."
29370430,0,a,"Background: Social relationships are important determinants of health-related outcomes for patients with chronic conditions. However, the effects of social networks and social support on health outcomes of dialysis patients in different treatment modalities have been under studied. Methods: We surveyed peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD) patients in the Choice of Renal Replacement Therapy project about their social relationships and health-care outcomes at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Two propensity score-matched groups (n = 353; HD = 200, PD = 153) with similar age, comorbidity level, education and employment status were compared. We used an ego-centred Network Generator to assess quantitative and qualitative aspects of social networks and the Berlin Social Support Scales to evaluate dimensions of social support, and analysed the effects of the social variables on anxiety, depression, autonomy preferences, and physical and psychological quality of life. Results: Over time, the non-family networks (e.g. friends) of both groups decreased (P = 0.04) and the absolute number of types of relationships increased (P = 0.01). The family-network size, quality of relationships and social support remained stable. Larger social networks were associated with higher participation-seeking preferences (B = 1.39, P = 0.002) and lower anxiety (B = -0.11, P = 0.03). Closer and more satisfying relationships were associated with better psychological well-being (B = 3.41, P = 0.003). PD patients had larger networks, more types of relationships and received more social support than HD patients (P </= 0.05). Conclusions: These differences may reflect the degree of autonomy and self-care associated with the different treatment modalities. In practice, our findings suggest that the early identification and inclusion of persons providing social support for patients may have a positive effect on different aspects of their care and quality of life."
27400922,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Frequent emergency department (ED) users account for a disproportionately high number of ED visits. Studies on case management (CM) interventions to reduce frequent ED use have shown mixed results, and few studies have been conducted within a universal health coverage system. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a CM intervention-compared to standard emergency care-reduces ED attendance. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty frequent ED users (5 or more visits in the prior 12 months) who visited a public urban ED at the Lausanne University Hospital between May 2012 and July 2013 were allocated to either an intervention (n = 125) or control (n = 125) group, and monitored for 12 months. INTERVENTIONS: An individualized CM intervention consisting of concrete assistance in obtaining income entitlements, referral to primary or specialty medical care, access to mental health care or substance abuse treatment, and counseling on at-risk behaviors and health care utilization (in addition to standard care) at baseline and 1, 3, and 5 months. MAIN MEASURES: We used a generalized linear model for count data (negative binomial distribution) to compare the number of ED visits during the 12-month follow-up between CM and usual care, from an intention-to-treat perspective. KEY RESULTS: At 12 months, there were 2.71 (+/-0.23) ED visits in the intervention group versus 3.35 (+/-0.32) visits among controls (ratio = 0.81, 95 % CI = 0.63; 1.02). In the multivariate model, the effect of the CM intervention on the number of ED visits approached statistical significance (b = -0.219, p = 0.075). The presence of poor social determinants of health was a significant predictor of ED use in the multivariate model (b = 0.280, p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: CM may reduce ED use by frequent users through an improved orientation to the health care system. Poor social determinants of health significantly increase use of the ED by frequent users."
30639805,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Increasing research capacity is important for health services as part of improving the conduct of high-quality research, which addresses the needs of patients and the public. It is a core function of the 13 Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRCs) established in England between 2008 and 2013. This article reports on the development of an innovative capacity building programme in CLAHRC West over an 18-month period (May 2015 to December 2016). It aims to disseminate the learning from the initiative and share our experience with other CLAHRCs. STUDY DESIGN: The study design was an evaluation of a training programme to build research capacity. METHODS: We carried out a training needs assessment among local stakeholders and scoped existing provision of research-related training. This informed the development of a programme of free short courses, which were targeted at health and social care professionals including those working in local authorities and the voluntary sector. We aimed to engage professionals working at all levels in these organisations and to promote interprofessional education, to build a research culture. We engaged a variety of educators to provide a range of 1-day courses at an introductory level, which were accessible to practitioners. RESULTS: During the first 18 months of the training programme, we delivered 31 courses and trained 350 participants. Attendees came from secondary care (20%), voluntary sector (18%) and local authorities (18%). Professionals working in the mental health sector comprised 11% and commissioning 6%. Less well represented were primary care (3%) and community care (4%). The largest professional group was public health, followed by medical, nursing and allied health professionals in approximately equal proportions. Courses were evaluated on a scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent) with the mean being 3.6 (range 3.3-4.0). CONCLUSIONS: The training programme has been highly successful with many courses oversubscribed, and all courses being well evaluated by participants. It has met the needs of local professionals for brief, applied training in research, as well as attracting those from other parts of the United Kingdom, suggesting the courses are both appropriate and helping to fill a gap in provision. We are building on this work to further engage audiences working in areas such as the wider determinants of health and commissioning, as well as primary and community sectors. CLAHRCs are uniquely placed to drive a culture change in the use, understanding and application of research across the healthcare community."
18163221,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study involved a naturalistic, prospective project assessing objective and subjective dimensions of quality of life (QoL) and the range of its putative determinants in first-episode schizophrenia. METHODS: Seventy-four patients, mean age 24.7 years, participated in the study. The patients were assessed 1 month following the first hospitalisation (Time 1), 12 months later (Time 2), and 4-6 years after Time 1 (Time 3). The Social Functioning Scale and World Health Organisation Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) were applied to evaluate objective and subjective QoL, respectively. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was used to examine psychopathological status, and the Global Assessment Scale was applied to evaluate social adjustment prior to hospitalisation. RESULTS: The objective and subjective QoL was relatively low at Time 1. Over time, the objective QoL improved in three domains, decreased in one domain, and remained stable in three domains. The subjective QoL did not change. The most important predictors of both dimensions of QoL were psychopathology and duration of untreated psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Because psychopathology seems to have the greatest impact on the QoL, there is a need to develop community psychosocial treatment to reduce these symptoms and to support patients in the early phase of the disease."
11923901,1,a,"The purpose of this paper is to present a comparative analysis of the determinants of physical activity among adolescents in Taiwan and in the United States. Pender's Health Promotion Model (HPM) served as the theoretical framework for both studies (Pender, 1996). The major determinants of health behavior in the HPM are perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, activity-related affect, interpersonal influences, situational influences, commitment to a plan of action, and immediate competing demands. In Taiwan, 969 middle school students (55% males; 45% females) from Taipei provided data for the study. In the United States, the sample was collected from 286 late elementary and middle school students (48% males; 52% females). Results showed the gender differences in activity levels were apparent in the youths from both countries. In both Taiwanese and American youths, boys were more active than girls. Cross-cultural differences in the importance of barriers to physical activity emerged. Among Taiwanese adolescents, barriers did not emerge as a significant direct predictor of physical activity as they did among US adolescents. Perceived efficacy directly predicted physical activity among Taiwanese youths while it indirectly predicted physical activity and appeared to be mediated by beliefs regarding exercise benefits and barriers among American youths. In addition, the paths of effect for interpersonal influences were different when Taiwanese and US youths were compared. The findings from this paper have important and culturally-relevant information that can inform future physical activity intervention studies with diverse adolescents."
20670346,0,a,"AIMS: This paper reviews a set of theories of behaviour change that are used outside the field of addiction and considers their relevance for this field. METHODS: Ten theories are reviewed in terms of (i) the main tenets of each theory, (ii) the implications of the theory for promoting change in addictive behaviours and (iii) studies in the field of addiction that have used the theory. An augmented feedback loop model based on Control Theory is used to organize the theories and to show how different interventions might achieve behaviour change. RESULTS: Briefly, each theory provided the following recommendations for intervention: Control Theory: prompt behavioural monitoring, Goal-Setting Theory: set specific and challenging goals, Model of Action Phases: form 'implementation intentions', Strength Model of Self-Control: bolster self-control resources, Social Cognition Models (Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour, Health Belief Model): modify relevant cognitions, Elaboration Likelihood Model: consider targets' motivation and ability to process information, Prototype Willingness Model: change perceptions of the prototypical person who engages in behaviour and Social Cognitive Theory: modify self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: There are a range of theories in the field of behaviour change that can be applied usefully to addiction, each one pointing to a different set of modifiable determinants and/or behaviour change techniques. Studies reporting interventions should describe theoretical basis, behaviour change techniques and mode of delivery accurately so that effective interventions can be understood and replicated."
25770437,0,a,"Buenos Aires informal recyclers (cartoneros) confront multiple health hazards in their work. Based in a survey with (n=397) informal recyclers, this study establishes that these workers experience uneven health landscapes as evidenced through their health outcomes, the social determinants of their health, and their living and working environments. I argue that the analytical framework of urban political ecology can provide insights to the ways that the urban environments where cartoneros live and work are socially-constructed phenomena, drawing on concepts of crisis, metabolism, and multi-scalar analyses."
24640712,0,a,"By using the method of factor analysis (principal component method) the determinants of disease in elderly and senile patients were searched with an estimate of their influence degree in the population of the North-West Russia. The data from medical records of 712 patients of both sexes aged 59 to 98 years were analyzed. The factor 1 proved to be associated with: marital status, living conditions, family relationships, bad habits, appearance, cough, diet, hearing and vision, laxatives, joint health, ability to move and sleep disturbances. Factor 2 combined diseases of older: cerebral stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, kidney disease, obesity, thyroid disease, Parkinson's disease, lung disease, anemia, arthritis, osteoporosis, the number of surgeries and joint diseases. The factor 3 was found to self-association ability before and after admission to the assessment of the patients' mental state for MMSE test after admission. It is concluded that the development of age-related (especially the musculoskeletal system pathology) is associated with social characteristics and living conditions of patients, and treatment of the most age-related diseases requires consideration of comorbidity."
19027442,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study was to examine the need for psychosocial support in a consecutive sample of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). Out of an initial sample of 250 patients, 239 patients could be assessed at the beginning of their RT. Two hundred eight patients were reassessed at the end of RT 4-8 weeks later. METHODS: Measures comprised the Hornheide Screening Instrument, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, the Resilience Scale, and the Short Form 12 as a measure of health-related quality of life (QoL). Medical and radiological data were continuously registered. RESULTS: Within the sample, the need for psychosocial support as reflected in the screening instrument was high (>70%). Patients with the need for psychosocial support revealed significantly higher fatigue scores than patients who where not identified as needing psychosocial support. Furthermore, a negative correlation of the need for psychosocial support and QoL as well as resilience could be observed. QoL turned out to be the strongest predictor for the need of psychosocial support. CONCLUSION: The study confirmed that the need for psychosocial support is an important aspect in the treatment of cancer patients undergoing RT, which appeared to be powerfully predicted by the patients' health-related QoL. Fatigue turned out to be an important illness- and treatment-related factor that affects QoL. Psychological interventions for cancer patients should explicitly focus on decreasing patients' fatigue and increasing their resilience, thus improving their QoL."
19750381,1,a,"This study analyzes the specific conditions involved in dengue transmission in various areas in Itaipu, a coastal neighborhood in the city of Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, with a focus on socio-environmental determinants and conditioning factors. Four areas were selected with similar dengue incidence rates but different urban planning and socioeconomic patterns. The socio-spatial characteristics of each area were obtained through interviews with key informants and systematic observation. Two distinct factors were identified that may potentially condition the risk of dengue transmission. The first related to the limited water supply and scarce financial resources in a lower-income population. The second was associated with a group having better socioeconomic status, which allowed them to store water in larger tanks. The implementation of a housing infrastructure generated by real estate speculation was a determining factor for the creation of socio-spatial segregation, resulting in different forms of receptiveness and vulnerability to dengue. In this sense, the incomplete and unequal installation of housing infrastructure is a determining factor for the differentiated generation of vector breeding sites and thus for dengue transmission."
25904944,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to detect low parasite and asymptomatic malaria infections by means of three malaria diagnostic tests, in a low transmission region of Minab district, Hormozgan Province, southern Iran. METHODS: Blood samples of 200 healthy volunteers from Bagh-e-Malek area were evaluated using microscopic, rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and nested-PCR to inspect malaria parasite. RESULTS: The results showed no Plasmodium parasite in subjects by means of microscopy and RDT. However, 3 P. vivax positive samples (1.5%) were discovered by Nested-PCR while microscopy and RDT missed the cases. CONCLUSION: Microscopy as the gold standard method and RDT correctly identified 98.5% of cases, and molecular analysis is sensitive and reliable, especially in the detection of ""asymptomatic"" infections for active case surveillance. Regarding the existence of asymptomatic malaria in endemic area of Hormozgan, Iran, nested-PCR could be considered as a sensitive tool to interrupt malaria transmission in the country, beside the microscopic and RDT methods."
17908738,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The differences between child self-reports and parent proxy reports of quality of life in a large population of children with cerebral palsy were studied. We examined whether child characteristics, severity of impairment, socioeconomic factors, and parental stress were associated with parent proxy reports being respectively higher or lower than child self-reports of quality of life. METHODS: This study was conducted in 2004-2005 and assessed child quality of life (using the Kidscreen questionnaire, 10 domains, each scored 0-100) through self-reports and parent proxy reports of 500 children aged 8 to 12 years who had cerebral palsy and were living in 7 countries in Europe. RESULTS: The mean child-reported scores of quality of life were significantly higher than the parent proxy reports in 8 domains, significantly lower for the finances domain, and similar for the emotions domain. The average frequency of disagreement (child-parent difference greater than half an SD of child scores) over all domains was 64%, with parents rating their child's quality of life lower than the children themselves in 29% to 57% of child-parent pairs. We found that high levels of stress in parenting negatively influenced parents' perception of their child's quality of life, whereas the main factor explaining parents' ratings of children's quality of life higher than the children themselves is self-reported severe child pain. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the factors associated with disagreement are different according to the direction of disagreement. In particular, parental well-being and child pain should be taken into account in the interpretation of parent proxy reports, especially when no child self-report of quality of life is available. In the latter cases, it may be advisable to obtain additional proxy reports (from caregivers, teachers, or clinicians) to obtain complementary information on the child's quality of life."

There is a dearth of community studies from India investigating geriatric depression and its associated risk factors. This study aimed to establish the nature, prevalence and factors associated with geriatric depression in a rural south Indian community. METHODS: We recruited 1000 participants aged over 65 years from Kaniyambadi block, Vellore, India. We assessed their socio-demographic profile, psychiatric morbidity, cognitive functioning, anthropometrics and disability status using the following structured assessment tools: Geriatric Mental State, Community Screening Instrument for Dementia, Modified CERAD 10 word list learning task, History and Aetiology Schedule Dementia Diagnosis and Subtype, WHO Disability Assessment Scale II, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory. We adopted a case control framework to study the factors associated with geriatric depression. RESULTS: Prevalence of geriatric depression (ICD-10) within the previous one month was 12.7% (95% CI 10.64-14.76%). Low income (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.08-2.91), experiencing hunger (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.56-4.26), history of cardiac illnesses (OR 4.75; 95% CI 1.96-11.52), transient ischemic attack (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.17-5.05), past head injury (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.36-5.36) and diabetes (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.15-4.72) increased the risk for geriatric depression after adjusting for other determinants using conditional logistic regression. Having more confidants (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.06-0.26) was the significant protective factor. Age, female gender, cognitive impairment and disability status were not significantly associated with geriatric depression. DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression was significantly correlated with experiencing hunger, diabetes, transient ischemic attack, past head injury, more disability and less nourishment; having more friends was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric depression is prevalent in rural south India. Poverty and physical ill health are risk factors for depression among elderly while good social support is protective."
17435206,1,a,"BACKGROUND: In earlier studies, determinants of socioeconomic gradient in mobility have not been measured comprehensively. AIM: To assess the contribution of chronic morbidity, obesity, smoking and physical workload to inequalities in mobility. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on 2572 persons (76% of a nationally representative sample of the Finnish population aged > or = 55 years). Mobility limitations were measured by self-reports and performance rates. RESULTS: According to a wide array of self-reported and test-based indicators, persons with a lower level of education showed more mobility limitations than those with a higher level. The age-adjusted ORs for limitations in stair climbing were threefold in the lowest-educational category compared with the highest one (OR 3.3 in men and 2.9 in women for self-reported limitations, and 3.5 in men and 2.2 in women for test-based limitations). When obesity, smoking, work-related physical loading and clinically diagnosed chronic diseases were simultaneously accounted for, the educational differences in stair-climbing limitations vanished or were greatly diminished. In women, obesity contributed most to the differences, followed by a history of physically strenuous work, knee and hip osteoarthritis and cardiovascular diseases. In men, diabetes, work-related physical loading, musculoskeletal diseases, obesity and smoking contributed substantially to the inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Great educational inequalities exist in various measures of mobility. Common chronic diseases, obesity, smoking and workload appeared to be the main pathways from low education to mobility limitations. General health promotion using methods that also yield good results in the lowest-educational groups is thus a good strategy to reduce the disparities in mobility."
24496556,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Sufficient sleep is needed for the healthy development of youth. However, only a small minority of adolescents obtain adequate amounts of sleep. Although individual-level correlates of sleep have been identified, studies investigating the influence of the environment on sleep are warranted. METHODS: By using cross-sectional data collected from 1878 urban adolescents living in 38 neighborhoods participating in the 2008 Boston Youth Survey (BYS), we determined the association between neighborhood social fragmentation and sleep. Social fragmentation of each participant's residential neighborhood was composed using 2010 US Census data. Multilevel regression models were used to determine the association between social fragmentation and meeting the recommended hours of sleep (>8.5 h) and sleep duration while controlling for individual-level sex, race, age and nativity. RESULTS: Moderate (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.27, 0.97) and high (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.61) social fragmentation within the residential neighborhood was associated with a decreased likelihood of obtaining adequate sleep. Those in moderate (beta = -23.9, 95% CI = -43.1, -4.8) and high (beta = -22.1, 95% CI = -43.3, -0.9) socially fragmented neighborhoods obtained fewer minutes of sleep per night. CONCLUSIONS: Social fragmentation may be an important determinant of sleep among youth living in urban settings."
24685665,0,a,"Children with epilepsy show a high co-morbidity with psychiatric disorders and autism. One of the critical determinants of a child's behavioral outcome with autism and cognitive dysfunction is the age of onset of seizures. In order to examine whether seizures during postnatal days 7-11 result in learning and memory deficits and behavioral features of autism we administered the inhalant flurothyl to induce seizures in C57BL/6J mice. Mice received three seizures per day for five days starting on postnatal day 7. Parallel control groups consisted of similarly handled animals that were not exposed to flurothyl and naive mice. Subjects were then processed through a battery of behavioral tests in adulthood: elevated-plus maze, nose-poke assay, marble burying, social partition, social chamber, fear conditioning, and Morris water maze. Mice with early-life seizures had learning and memory deficits in the training portion of the Morris water maze (p<0.05) and probe trial (p<0.01). Mice with seizures showed no differences in marble burying, the nose-poke assay, or elevated plus-maze testing compared to controls. However, they showed a significant difference in the social chamber and social partition tests. Mice with seizures during postnatal days 7-11 showed a significant decrease in social interaction in the social chamber test and had a significant impairment in social behavior in the social partition test. Together, these results indicate that early life seizures result in deficits in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks and produce long-term disruptions in social behavior."
26022369,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Knowledge and effective interventions exist to address many current global health inequities. However, there is limited awareness, uptake, and use of knowledge to inform action to improve the health of disadvantaged populations. The gap between knowledge and action to improve health equity is of concern to health researchers and practitioners. This study identifies and critically examines the usefulness of existing knowledge to action models or frameworks for promoting health equity. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of existing literature to identify knowledge to action (KTA) models or frameworks and critiqued the models using a health equity support rubric. RESULTS: We identified forty-eight knowledge to action models or frameworks. Six models scored between eight and ten of a maximum 12 points on the health equity support rubric. These high scoring models or frameworks all mentioned equity-related concepts. Attention to multisectoral approaches was the factor most often lacking in the low scoring models. The concepts of knowledge brokering, integrative processes, such as those in some indigenous health research, and Ecohealth applied to KTA all emerged as promising areas. CONCLUSIONS: Existing knowledge to action models or frameworks can help guide knowledge translation to support action on the social determinants of health and health equity. There is a need to further test existing models or frameworks. This process should be informed by participatory and integrative research. There is room to develop more robust equity supporting models."
30576532,0,a,"In the context of health inequalities, spatial stigma refers to the ways that areas experiencing socioeconomic inequalities become negatively portrayed and labelled in public, official and policy discourses. With respect to the body of research on social determinants of health and health inequalities, and attention accorded to this issue in policy or practice, spatial stigma remains significantly under-represented compared with other possible causal factors. We suggest three explanations contributing to this neglect. First, the lack of research into spatial stigma originates from a more limited public health focus on the symbolic meanings of places for health, compared to their physical and social dimensions. Second, lay involvement and evidence of lived experiences of health inequalities continues to be under-represented in public health decision-making. Finally, it is the case that public health organizations may also be contributing to negative area portrayals in their communications of health inequalities. There are growing examples of social action being taken by groups of residents to resist this stigma through the promotion of more positive portrayals of areas and communities. Greater public health attention to this issue as well is likely to result in health gains and aid the development of more effective health inequalities strategies."
26955473,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the determinants of preventable deaths of children under the age of five is important for accelerated annual declines - even as countries achieve the UN's Millennium Development Goals and the target date of 2015 has been reached. While research has documented the extent and nature of the overall rapid decline in child mortality in Niger, there is less clear evidence to provide insight into the contributors to such deaths. This issue is the central focus of this paper. METHODS: We analyzed a nationally representative cross-sectional sample of 620 child deaths from the 2012 Niger Verbal Autopsy/Social Autopsy (VASA) Survey. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the data on preventive and curative care, guided by the coverage of proven indicators along the continuum of well child care and illness recognition and care-seeking for child illnesses encompassed by the BASICS/CDC Pathway to Survival model. RESULTS: Six hundred twenty deaths of children (1-59 months of age) were confirmed from the VASA survey. The majority of these children lived in households with precarious socio-economic conditions. Among the 414 children whose fatal illnesses began at age 0-23 months, just 24.4% were appropriately fed. About 24% of children aged 12-59 months were fully immunized. Of 601 children tracked through the Pathway to Survival, 62.4% could reach the first health care provider after about 67 minutes travel time. Of the 306 children who left the first health care provider alive, 161 (52.6%) were not referred for further care nor received any home care recommendations, and just 19% were referred to a second provider. About 113 of the caregivers reported cost (35%), distance (35%) and lack of transport (30%) as constraints to care-seeking at a health facility. CONCLUSION: Despite Niger's recent major achievements in reducing child mortality, the following determinants are crucial to continue building on the gains the country has made: improved socio-economic state of the poor in the country, investment in women's education, adoption of the a law to prevent marriage of young girls before 18 years of age, and implementation of health programs that encourage breastfeeding and complementary feeding, immunization, illness recognition, prompt and appropriate care-seeking, and improved referral rates."
30963510,0,a,"We used four methods (direct count, indirect count, wisdom of the crowd, and unique object multiplier) to map and estimate the population size of street children in six major cities in Iran in 2017. In aggregate for the six cities, the number of street children was estimated at 5296 (interquartile range [IQR] 4122-7071) using the median of the four methods. This corresponds to a rate of 16.3 (IQR 12.5-24.5) per 10,000 children age 5-18 years old, or 3.2 (IQR 2.4-5.3) per 10,000 total population. The total number for street children in the country is estimated at 26,000 (IQR 20,239-34,719) children. Results can help policy-makers advocate for resources, plan programs, and evaluate the reach of programs for street children. The maps created through the course of the population size estimation exercise can also guide outreach efforts to provide street children with health and social welfare services."
31524189,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Workers engaged in dairy farming are exposed to awkward and poor postures that may result in work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). OBJECTIVE: This study carried out ergonomic interventions in order to eliminate and reduce awkward postures in dairy farming. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study applied rapid entire body assessments (REBA) to evaluate the risks associated with each posture while performing the assigned tasks on a dairy farm in Iran to identify high and very high-risk tasks. A participatory ergonomics model was used that incorporated suggestions by dairy workers to design the used interventions. RESULTS: In the first intervention, by using an automatic transmission system for pouring milk, one high and one very high-risk task- pouring milk into a bucket and pouring milk from a bucket into a tank, respectively- were eliminated. In the second intervention, two high-risk tasks- filling corn containers and pouring corn into the milling machine- were eliminated by using a material conveying vacuum pump to transfer corn from the ground to the opening of the milling machine. In the third intervention, a simple and cheap holding device for the bag was designed to reduce the posture risk score from very high to medium. The fourth intervention involved the use of a shovel with a handle appropriate to the anthropometric characteristics of the workers that reduced the posture risk from very high to medium. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that applying participatory ergonomic principles along with low cost and simple designs with high performance resulted in significant reductions in postural risks pertaining to of musculoskeletal disorders on Iran dairy farms."
12471853,1,a,"I examine racial differences in child stunting in mid-1990s South Africa and Brazil, two multiracial societies with different histories of legal support for racial discrimination. Using data from nationally representative household samples linked to community-level measures, the analysis shows that racial inequality in the distribution of socioeconomic resources across households and communities explains much of the racial difference in stunting in both countries. Even after these factors are controlled, however, the results indicate that in South Africa, nonwhite children are still at greater risk of growth faltering than are white children. The nature of socioeconomic and racial differences in children's growth is examined, and major determinants are discussed. These findings suggest that although state-sanctioned racism may help to explain the greater racial inequality in stunting in South Africa than in Brazil, the eradication of a disadvantage for nonwhites will depend on changes in the same fundamental socioeconomic inequalities that characterize both nations."
17391344,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have highlighted the prevalence, severity and persistence of the disability associated with bipolar disorder (BPD). Reliable instruments are needed to support research into the factors associated with disability and treatment response. Contextual factors (e.g., availability of supported employment programs) can affect functionality, posing a challenge to such investigations. We present preliminary findings regarding the validity of the Multidimensional Scale of Independent Functioning (MSIF) in BPD. The MSIF provides discrete ratings of support separate from both role responsibility and performance quality in work, residential and educational environments. These distinctions allow the 'correction' for variability explained by contextual factors that allows the comparison of studies conducted in different environments and time. METHODS: Participants with BPD were administered the MSIF, the Social Adjustment Scale II (SAS-II) and an interview recording objective data regarding work, school and residential activities as part of an ongoing longitudinal study of BPD disability. RESULTS: Construct validity estimated using standardized Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.76 (n = 58). MSIF global ratings were significantly lower (reflecting higher functionality) for subjects engaged in productive activity compared with participants who were not active (t = -3.6, p = 0.001) demonstrating external validity. Inter-rater reliability estimates ranged from 0.86 to 0.99 (n = 49). Significant, high correlations were demonstrated between comparable MSIF and SAS-II global ratings (criterion validity = 0.70-0.79) and low correlations were found between non-comparable ratings (discriminant validity = -0.07 to -0.35) (n = 14). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the MSIF is a valid and reliable instrument optimally designed for studying determinants of disability and treatment response in BPD."
19740880,1,a,"In sexually dimorphic and polygynous mammals, sexual selection often favours large males with well-developed weaponry, as these secondary sexual characters confer advantages in intrasexual competition and are often preferred by females. Little is known, however, about the effects of sexually selected paternal traits on offspring phenotype in wild mammals, especially when considering that shared phenotypic traits and selection can also differ greatly between genders. Here, we conducted molecular parentage analyses in a long-term study population of mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), an ungulate exhibiting high sexual dimorphism in mass, to first assess the determinants of yearly reproductive success (YRS) in males. We then examined the effects of paternal characteristics on offspring mass at 1 year of age. Paternity was highly skewed, with 9 per cent of 57 males siring 51 per cent of 96 offspring assigned over 12 years. Male YRS increased with age until apparent reproductive senescence at 9 years, but mass was a stronger determinant of siring success than age, horn length or social rank. Mass of sons increased with paternal mass, but the mass of daughters was negatively related to that of their father, a finding consistent with recent theory on intralocus sexual conflict. Because early differences in mass persisted to early adulthood, sex-specific effects of paternal mass can have important fitness consequences, as adult mass is positively linked with reproduction in both sexes. Divergent father-offspring phenotypic correlations may partly explain the maintenance of sexual dimorphism in mountain goats and the large variance observed for this homologous trait within each gender in polygynous mammals."
27578563,0,a,"What are the determinants of altruism? While economists assume that altruism is mainly driven by fairness norms, social psychologists consider empathy to be a key motivator for altruistic behavior. To unite these two theories, we conducted an experiment in which we compared behavior in a standard economic game that assesses altruism (the so-called Dictator Game) with a Dictator Game in which participants' behavioral choices were preceded either by an empathy induction or by a control condition without empathy induction. The results of this within-subject manipulation show that the empathy induction substantially increased altruistic behavior. Moreover, the increase in experienced empathy predicted over 40% of the increase in sharing behavior. These data extend standard economic theories that altruism is based on fairness considerations, by showing that empathic feelings can be a key motivator for altruistic behavior in economic interactions."
27663703,0,a,"Objectives The broad maternal and child health community has witnessed increased attention to the entire continuum of reproductive and perinatal health concerns over the past few years. However, both recent discouraging trends in prenatal care access and utilization and a renewed understanding of prenatal care as a critical anchor of the reproductive/perinatal health continuum for women who do get pregnant demand a new effort to focus on the prenatal period as a gateway for maternal and infant health. Methods This commentary: describes the Medicaid expansions and the momentum for universal access to prenatal care of the 1980-1990s; examines the pivot away from this goal and its aftermath; provides a rationale for why renewed attention to prenatal care and the prenatal period is essential; and, explores the potential focus of an updated prenatal care agenda. Conclusion We conclude that increasing women's access to high quality prenatal care will require substantial effort at the clinical, community, policy, and system levels. Only when attention is paid to all phases of the reproductive/perinatal health continuum with an emphasis on continuity between all periods, and on the social determinants that affect health and well-being, will our nation be able to ensure the health of all women across the life course (whether or not they ever become mothers), while simultaneously fulfilling our nation's promise that all children-no matter their income or race/ethnicity-will have the opportunity to be born well."
10784368,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This study examined (1) disparities in the proportion of persons who accessed a physician for treatment of a diagnosed mental disorder across 17 health regions in Alberta, Canada, and (2) the extent to which regional disparities in physician access could be explained by differences in regional demographies, population needs, or physician supply. METHODS: The study illustrates the use of ecological comparisons for regional health system performance evaluations. Regional characteristics were aggregated from four sources of data: the health insurance registry file (population denominators and regional demographies), physician claims data (treatment access), census data (social indicators of population need), and the medical directory of the College of Physicians of Surgeons (physician supply). RESULTS: Regional variability in needs-adjusted measures of access to physician-based treatment services were comparatively small (varying by a factor of 1.6). Models containing adjustments for demography, need, and physician supply explained 41% of regional variation in access. Of the total variation explained, physician supply explained a smaller proportion (39%) in comparison to social demography and needs (61%). Few large regional imbalances were noted when needs-adjusted and supply-adjusted estimates were compared. Only two areas appeared to be underserviced in comparison to their local needs, reflecting approximately 6% of the provincial population. CONCLUSIONS: While all three study factors proved important, findings support the broad conclusion that social demography and social risk (a proxy for need) will remain the key determinants predicting access to physician services for treatment of mental disorders in publicly funded health systems."
10972425,1,a,"The economic crisis in Thailand in July 1997 had major social implications for unemployment, under employment, household income contraction, changing expenditure patterns, and child abandonment. The crisis increased poverty incidence by 1 million, of whom 54% were the ultra-poor. This paper explores and explains the short-term health impact of the crisis, using existing data and some special surveys and interviews for 2 years during 1998-99. The health impacts of the crisis are mixed, some being negative and some being positive. Household health expenditure reduced by 24% in real terms; among the poorer households, institutional care was replaced by self-medication. The pre-crisis rising trend in expenditure on alcohol and tobacco consumption was reversed. Immunization spending and coverage were sustained at a very high level after the crisis, but reports of increases in diphtheria and pertussis indicate declining programme quality. An increase in malaria, despite budget increases, had many causes but was mainly due to reduced programme effectiveness. STD incidence continued the pre-crisis downward trend. Rates of HIV risky sexual behaviour were higher among conscripts than other male workers, but in both groups there was lower condom use with casual partners. HIV serosurveillance showed a continuation of the pre-crisis downward trend among commercial sex workers (CSW, both brothel and non-brothel based), pregnant women and donated blood; this trend was slightly reversed among male STD patients and more among intravenous drug users. Condom coverage among brothel based CSW continued to increase to 97.5%, despite a 72% budget cut in free condom distribution. Poverty and lack of insurance coverage are two major determinants of absence of or inadequate antenatal care, and low birthweight. The Low Income Scheme could not adequately cover the poor but the voluntary Health Card Scheme played a health safety net role for maternal and child health. Low birthweight and underweight among school children were observed during the crisis. The impact of the crisis on health was minimal in some sectors but not in the others if the pre-crisis condition is efficient and healthy and vice versa. We demonstrated some key health status parameters during the 2-year period after the 1997 crisis but do not have firm conclusions on the impact of the economic crisis on health status, as our observation is too short and there is uncertainty on how long the crisis will last."
31799000,0,a,"Primary health care (PHC) strengthening in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal has again, 40 years after the Alma-Ata declaration, been declared a priority by the global health community. Despite initial progress the Alma-Ata vision of Health for All by the year 2000 was not realised. In this analysis we (1) examine the challenges that comprehensive PHC faced after the Alma-Ata declaration, (2) provide an analysis of the current opportunities and threats to comprehensive PHC strengthening on the global, national and community level and (3) review the most important policy recommendations and related evidence to address these threats for success of the Astana declaration. Factors that are predominantly opportunities are the treasure of historical lessons from the past 40 years, the increased attention to social and environmental determinants of health, the global economic growth and new technologies, in particular digital medicine, which also have the potential to revolutionise community involvement. Factors that are currently predominantly threats are insecurity, conflicts and disease outbreaks; lack of sustained political commitment and inappropriate monitoring and evaluation structures; inappropriate and unsustainable financing models; insufficient health workforce recruitment, employment and retention; missing support of physicians and their professional organisations; inadequately addressing the needs of the community and not giving attention to gender equity. In contrast to the policy and evidence context in 1978 when Alma-Ata was passed there are today policy recommendations and a large body of evidence that can address the threats to comprehensive PHC-and turn them into opportunities."
26843783,0,a,"This article borrows from the intersectionality literature to investigate how legal status, labor market position, and family characteristics structure the labor supply of immigrant Latinas in Durham, NC, a new immigrant destination. The analysis takes a broad view of labor force participation, analyzing the predictors of whether or not women work; whether and how the barriers to work vary across occupations; and variation in hours and weeks worked among the employed. I also explicitly investigate the extent to which family constraints interact with other social characteristics, especially legal status, in shaping women's labor market position. Results highlight that immigrant Latinas experience multiple, interrelated constraints on employment owing to their position as low-skill workers in a labor market highly segregated by gender and nativity, to their status as members of a largely undocumented population, and as wives and mothers in an environment characterized by significant work-family conflict."
31226344,0,a,"Researchers examining the influence of the built environment on health are increasingly using mixed methods approaches. The use of more than one type of methodology to address a single research question is compelling in this field because researchers investigating the impact of the built environment on health have been faced with proposing solutions to a complex societal problem involving interacting systems and social uncertainties. Mixed methods studies can help researchers to gain a better understanding of the relationships that exist between humans and their environment by drawing on qualitative and quantitative methods. Mixed methods studies could also be instrumental for providing effective policy solutions. This is because they allow researchers to identify built environment determinants of health in a population of interest and to understand the social and cultural factors that might influence the uptake of an intervention by this population. The objective of this paper is to assist those conducting research on the built environment and health who may have little background in mixed methods. We provide an overview of mixed methods research designs and provide concrete techniques for the integration of diverse methods. We also discuss the recommendations for mixed methods research in the field of built environment - health research, drawing on specific examples from published studies. Reporting a research design and an integration strategy in mixed methods studies could help to strengthen our ability to gain new insights into the multidimensional nature of the relationship between the built environment and health."
15117117,1,a,"The first aim of the present study was to assess the validity of self-reported information concerning previous cancer. The second aim was to investigate determinants for under- and over-reporting of cancer. The Malmo Diet and Cancer Study is a prospective cohort study including 28,098 subjects. A questionnaire assessed lifestyle and medical conditions, e.g. previous cancer (yes/no). Cancer follow-up was made using the Swedish Cancer Registry (SCR). Questionnaire information concerning previous cancer was considered as test, and SCR information as golden standard (any tumour in the SCR, and specific sites were investigated). The validity analysis assessed agreement, sensitivity and specificity. Under- and over-reporting were studied in relation to lifestyle and socio-demographic factors. Sensitivity of the questionnaire in relation to malignant tumours was 0.82. It was 0.53 when cancer in situ of the breast and uterine cervix together with benign lesions of the urinary bladder and the nervous system were included in the cancer definition. Under- and over-reporting (in relation to malignant tumours) were more common among women and old people. Obesity, size of household, place of birth, smoking, social participation, educational level, type of employment, alcohol consumption and poor well-being was associated with under- or over-reporting in relation to at least one of the studied endpoints in either men or women. We conclude that there was a considerable disagreement between self-reported information and cancer registry data."
19827286,1,a,"A short review of main results obtained in occupational stress research is presented. Stress activates the sympato-adrenal system with possible dangerous consequences on the cardiovascular apparatus. In field studies the relation between stress and coronary diseases is controversial. However, from a clinical and experimental perspective the relation between breakdown in adaptation and cardiovascular disorder is a fact. More consistent results on the psychosocial determinants of an increased cardiovascular risk are obtained when stress is studied in relation to the socio-economic condition of groups and individuals. To better embrace and describe such factors, a new theoretical contribution has been introduced: social capital. This is a more sophisticated version of social cohesion, social integration and social support. For the future, an interdisciplinary approach is recommended in health surveillance of life and work environment."
28848609,0,a,"This study aimed to determine the parental correlates of body weight status among adolescents in Tehran. The participants were 465 high school students and their parents who resided in Tehran. Body weight and height of the students were measured, and body mass index (BMI)-for-age and body weight status of the students were determined according to the world health organization growth reference (2007). Parents of the students completed a self-administered questionnaire including socio-demographic information, self-reported parental body weight and height, and parental perception of student's body weight status. About half of the parents had an incorrect perception about body weight status of their children with higher rates of underestimation than overestimation. The percentage of parents who correctly perceived body weight status of the students decreased from 100.0% in severe thinness group to 14.0% in obese group. There were no significant associations between marital status, occupation, and education of parents and BMI-for-age of the students. While, both BMI of mother and BMI of father were significantly associated with students' BMI-for-age (r = 0.29 and r = 0.27, respectively; P < 0.05). A great number of parents had incorrect perception regarding body weight status of their offspring; this was true specifically for parents of overweight and obese students. Both parental BMI and parental perception regarding students' body weight status were associated with students' BMI-for-age, indicating the need for parental involvement in weight management programs targeting adolescents."
15822090,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: We examined the potential for ethnicity to moderate the relationships between awareness and internalization of sociocultural ideals of appearance and between internalization and body dissatisfaction. METHOD: Spanish (n = 100), Mexican American (n = 100), and European American (n = 100) female participants completed measures of sociocultural attitudes and body dissatisfaction. Path analysis using maximum likelihood with robust standard errors tested the relationships across and within ethnic groups. RESULTS: There was evidence for the mediational effect of internalization on the relationship between awareness and body dissatisfaction. Furthermore, both relationships were significantly stronger for European American women than for Mexican American or Spanish women (the predicted moderator effect). DISCUSSION: Results demonstrate how ethnicity may protect against the development of eating disorder symptoms and suggest that eating disorder prevention should involve denouncing the thin ideal, minimizing appearance as an indicator of value, and emphasizing traits other than appearance as determinants of worth."
17824939,1,a,"AIM: This paper is a report of a study to identify the determinants of physical activity (PA) in patients with venous leg ulcers to develop recommendations for behavioural interventions aimed at enhancing physical activity. BACKGROUND: Physical activity promotes wound healing and prevents the recurrence of wounds in venous patients with leg ulcers. Many patients with leg ulcers, however, have a sedentary lifestyle. METHOD: A random sample of 25 patients from two clinics were interviewed in 2003 using a combination of prestructured and open-ended questions. All these patients were being treated at an outpatient dermatology clinic and had a leg ulcer with venous or mixed aetiology at the time of the interview or in the month prior to the interview. FINDINGS: Only nine of the 25 patients (36%) reported sufficient levels of moderate strenuous physical activity, defined as 30 minutes a day on at least 5 days a week. The results show limited knowledge about the relationship between physical activity and leg ulceration, and low self-efficacy for increasing physical activity. In addition, multi-morbidity, pain and social support were identified as main determinants of physical activity. CONCLUSION: Suggestions for improving physical activity levels include influencing knowledge, beliefs and self-efficacy. Patient's individual physical limitations, pain, adequate footwear and social support should be taken into account. Programmes offered by specialized dermatology nurses to stimulate physical activity might fulfil patient needs and help enhance physical activity levels."
28086971,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There is wide agreement that there is a lack of attention to health in municipal environmental policy-making, such as urban planning and regeneration. Explanations for this include differing professional norms between health and urban environment professionals, system complexity and limited evidence for causality between attributes of the built environment and health outcomes. Data from urban health indicator (UHI) tools are potentially a valuable form of evidence for local government policy and decision-makers. Although many UHI tools have been specifically developed to inform policy, there is poor understanding of how they are used. This study aims to identify the nature and characteristics of UHI tools and their use by municipal built environment policy and decision-makers. METHODS: Health and social sciences databases (ASSIA, Campbell Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, Social Policy and Practice and Web of Science Core Collection) will be searched for studies using UHI tools alongside hand-searching of key journals and citation searches of included studies. Advanced searches of practitioner websites and Google will also be used to find grey literature. Search results will be screened for UHI tools, and for studies which report on or evaluate the use of such tools. Data about UHI tools will be extracted to compile a census and taxonomy of existing tools based on their specific characteristics and purpose. In addition, qualitative and quantitative studies about the use of these tools will be appraised using quality appraisal tools produced by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and synthesised in order to gain insight into the perceptions, value and use of UHI tools in the municipal built environment policy and decision-making process. This review is not registered with PROSPERO. DISCUSSION: This systematic review focuses specifically on UHI tools that assess the physical environment's impact on health (such as transport, housing, air quality and greenspace). This study will help indicator producers understand whether this form of evidence is of value to built environment policy and decision-makers and how such tools should be tailored for this audience. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: N/A."
16135394,1,a,"Racial differences in infant mortality in South Africa are studied using household-level data from 1987 to 1989 and 1998. Logistic regression models are estimated to explore the determinants of the overall trend in infant mortality and racial disparities in infants' survival chances. We do not find evidence for reduced overall risk of infant death among births that occurred from 1993 to 1998 when compared to those that occurred from 1982 to 1989, despite policy and action directed toward this goal by the new government that was elected in early 1994. We also find that persistent inequalities in the personal and household resources of South Africa's four main racial groups substantially account for racial differences in infant survival rates in both periods. These findings are discussed in light of contemporary social and health issues in South Africa."
15058797,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Mental health is a central determinant of quality of life. While psychiatric morbidity of populations has been studied extensively, the role of perceived stress, social support, and internal resources as determinant of health is still poorly understood. METHODS: We surveyed 2000 randomly selected university students. Perceived stress was measured by the Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument, social support by the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, internal resources (mastery and self-esteem) by a brief version of the Pearlin coping questionnaire. Linear regression models were used to explore the relationships between these variables and mental health, based on the SF-12 health survey. RESULTS: After two reminders, 1257 students answered the questionnaire. In bivariate analysis, mental health was negatively associated with stress and positively associated with internal resources and social support (all p-values < 0.001). In multiple regression analysis, internal resources were positively associated with mental health, and buffered the negative impact of stress on mental health. Internal resources and stress mediated the positive impact of social support on mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that perceived stress is an important risk factor for low mental health and suggest that mastery and self-esteem are important protective factors of mental health among young adults."
22955185,0,a,"The global epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD) calls for multidisciplinary and multiprofessional approaches to the management of this condition, with strategic emphasis on prevention, treatment, and control. In addition, there is increasing recognition that effective prevention and management of CVD requires a diverse workforce skilled in the social, environmental, and policy determinants of health. Nowhere are these approaches and strategies brought together and more closely aligned than in the field of preventive cardiovascular nursing. This executive summary of ""Global Cardiovascular Prevention: A Call to Action for Nursing"" includes key points from the 6 papers written by the Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association and published in July-August 2011 as a supplement to the Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing and the European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing. This supplement addresses innovative efforts to stem the current global epidemic of CVD and emphasizes the need for effective team-based interventions for lifestyle and behavior changes across the life span. Social solutions, strategies for working with key players to develop interactive models, as well as coordinated multilevel policies, partnerships, and programs that are culturally relevant and context specific are examined. Such approaches are urgently needed to reduce death and disability from CVD in the United States and globally. Nurse leaders and other members of the healthcare team are well positioned internationally to meet these challenges."
18434246,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the personal, social and cultural factors likely to explain recourse to the Internet as a preferred source of personal health information. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a population of 2923 Internet users visiting a firmly established website that offers information on personal health. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the determinants of site use. MEASUREMENT: The analysis template comprised four classes of determinants likely to explain Internet use: beliefs, intentions, user satisfaction and socio-demographic characteristics. Seven-point Likert scales were used. An analysis of the psychometric qualities of the variables provided compelling evidence of the construct's validity and reliability. A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the correspondence with the factors predicted by the theoretical model. FINDINGS: The regression analysis explained 35% of the variance in Internet use. Use was directly associated with five factors: perceived usefulness, importance given to written media in searches for health information, concern for personal health, importance given to the opinions of physicians and other health professionals, and the trust placed in the information available on the site itself. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the importance of the credibility of information on the frequency of Internet use as a preferred source of information on personal health. It also shows the potentially influential role of the Internet in the development of personal knowledge of health issues."
25731129,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Cities are important settings for production and prevention of non-communicable diseases. This article proposes a conceptual framework for identification of opportunities to prevent diet-related non-communicable diseases in cities. It compares two cities, Cape Town in South Africa and New York City in the United States, to illustrate municipal, regional, national and global influences in three policy domains that influence NCDs: product formulation, shaping retail environments and institutional food practices, domains in which each city has taken action. STUDY DESIGN: Comparative case study. METHODS: Critical analysis of selected published studies and government and non-governmental reports on food policies and systems in Cape Town and New York City. RESULTS: While Cape Town and New York City differ in governance, history and culture, both have food systems that make unhealthy food more available in low-income than higher income neighborhoods; cope with food environments in which unhealthy food is increasingly ubiquitous; and have political economies dominated by business and financial sectors. New York City has more authority and resources to take on local influences on food environments but neither city has made progress in addressing deeper social determinants of diet-related NCDs including income inequality, child poverty and the disproportionate political influence of wealthy elites. CONCLUSIONS: Through their intimate connections with the daily lives of their residents, municipal governments have the potential to shape environments that promote health. Identifying the specific opportunities to prevent diet-related NCDs in a particular city requires intersectoral and multilevel analyses of the full range of influences on food environments."
19168935,1,a,"BACKGROUND: In Canada the incidence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 1 in 100 live births. FASD is the leading cause of developmental and cognitive disabilities in Canada. Only one study has examined the cost of FASD in Canada. In that study we did not include prospective data for infants under the age of one year, costs for adults beyond 21 years or costs for individuals living in institutions. OBJECTIVE: To calculate a revised estimate of direct and indirect costs associated with FASD at the patient level. METHODS: Cross-sectional study design was used. Two-hundred and fifty (250) participants completed the study tool. Participants included caregivers of children, youth and adults, with FASD, from day of birth to 53 years, living in urban and rural communities throughout Canada participated. Participants completed the Health Services Utilization Inventory (HSUI). Key cost components were elicited: direct costs: medical, education, social services, out-of-pocket costs; and indirect costs: productivity losses. Total average costs per individual with FASD were calculated by summing the costs for each in each cost component, and dividing by the sample size. Costs were extrapolated to one year. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to identify significant determinants of costs and to calculate the adjusted annual costs associated with FASD. RESULTS: Total adjusted annual costs associated with FASD at the individual level was $21,642 (95% CI, $19,842; $24,041), compared to $14,342 (95% CI, $12,986; $15,698) in the first study. Severity of the individual's condition, age, and relationship of the individual to the caregiver (biological, adoptive, foster) were significant determinants of costs (p < 0.001). Cost of FASD annually to Canada of those from day of birth to 53 years old, was $5.3 billion (95% CI, $4.12 billion; $6.4 billion). CONCLUSIONS: Study results demonstrated the cost burden of FASD in Canada was profound. Inclusion of infants aged 0 to 1 years, adults beyond the age of 21 years and costs associated with residing in institutions provided a more accurate estimate of the costs of FASD. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed. Key words: Alcohol, pregnancy, cost, economic burden, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder."
15827917,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To study the employment rate and determinants of return to work for persons with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in Taiwan. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Taiwan community. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-nine people who had sustained traumatic SCI, had been completely rehabilitated in a university hospital between 1989 and 2002, and who were between 18 and 60 years of age at the time of interview in 2003. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A structured questionnaire was used to identify demographic and injury-related status, functional status, and pre- and postinjury work-related information. RESULTS: At the time of survey, only 47% of the participants were engaged in remunerative employment. Cox regression analysis, with time elapsed between injury and survey as the underlying time axis, showed that education and functional independence were associated with employment. Subjects with a high school education had a 2.2-fold higher chance (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.8) of returning to work than those without. Subjects with higher scores on the Barthel Index and ability to use public or private transport independently had a 2.7-fold higher chance (95% CI, 1.5-4.9) of returning to work than those unable to travel independently. Other factors significantly associated with employment included marital status, with marriage having a favorable influence; age at injury, with age below 25 years being favorable; preinjury occupation; and vocational training after injury. The importance of functional independence training in rehabilitation is stressed. CONCLUSIONS: Functional independence was a strong factor predicting return to work. Rehabilitation focused on education, vocational training, self-care ability, community mobility, and environmental modifications could improve employability after SCI."
29561832,0,a,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine the need for supportive care among women suffering from breast cancer in China and to identify its potential determinants to inform the development of effective and efficient healthcare services across different settings. MATERIAL AND METHODS In a tertiary-care hospital in Weifang, China, between July 2015 and January 2016, all women attending the Breast Cancer Clinic for regular physical examinations after treatment for breast cancer were consecutively recruited. The 34-item Supportive Care Needs Survey tool (Chinese version) (SCNS-SF34-C) was used to assess the unmet needs among participants. RESULTS Among 264 recruited patients, based on at least single-item endorsement, 60.2% had moderate to high level of need for supportive care, while only 13.3% expressed no need. Lack of information regarding health systems was the most common domain with moderate to high unmet needs, more so among rural patients (8 vs. 5 out of 10). In each information-related domain, huge unmet need was observed among all patients irrespective of urban or rural residence. Both overall and individual information-related domain-specific unmet needs were significantly higher among rural patients as opposed to their urban counterparts. Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant rural-urban variation of unmet needs. Moreover, education and post-diagnosis time duration were negatively associated with unmet needs while stage of cancer was positively associated with these unmet needs. CONCLUSIONS There is a huge burden of unmet needs for information on the healthcare system among breast cancer survivors in China. Rural residence, less education, advanced stage of cancer, and shorter duration since diagnosis were the identified determinants requiring targeted intervention."
15603114,1,a,"Occupational violence is a worldwide, multifaceted problem affecting all industries, including healthcare. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the experiences of 158 allied health professionals, 135 doctors, and 1229 nurses working in a rural area in eastern Australia. Response rates were 72 percent for allied health professionals and 62 percent for general practitioners (GPs) and nurses. Proportionately more nurses experienced occupational violence than did allied health providers and GPs. During the past 12 months (August 2001 to July 2002), 68 percent of nurses, compared with 47 percent of allied health providers and 48 percent of GPs, reported violence. All three professional groups indicated that the most distressing occupational violence was perpetrated by patients, followed by patients' relatives. The most frequent form of occupational violence was verbal abuse, followed by threatening behavior, physical violence, and obscene behavior. No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of violence was found among the different allied health professional disciplines or fields of nursing. Health services management strategies addressing occupational violence need to be comprehensive and multidisciplinary in scope. Strategies to minimize violence need to focus on resource allocation, cultural change, and perseverance. Systems to monitor violence are a priority. Further research into the determinants of this pattern of violence is required."
23445747,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The prospective cohort study design is ideal for examining diseases of public health importance, as its inherent temporal nature renders it advantageous for studying early life influences on health outcomes and research questions of aetiological significance. This paper will describe the development and characteristics of the All Our Babies (AOB) study, a prospective pregnancy cohort in Calgary, Alberta, Canada designed to examine determinants of maternal, infant, and child outcomes and identify barriers and facilitators in health care utilization. METHODS: Women were recruited from health care offices, communities, and through Calgary Laboratory Services before 25 weeks gestation from May 2008 to December 2010. Participants completed two questionnaires during pregnancy, a third at 4 months postpartum, and are currently being followed-up with questionnaires at 12, 24, and 36 months. Data was collected on pregnancy history, demographics, lifestyle, health care utilization, physical and mental health, parenting, and child developmental outcomes and milestones. In addition, biological/serological and genetic markers can be extracted from collected maternal and cord blood samples. RESULTS: A total of 4011 pregnant women were eligible for recruitment into the AOB study. Of this, 3388 women completed at least one survey. The majority of participants were less than 35 years of age, Caucasian, Canadian born, married or in a common-law relationship, well-educated, and reported household incomes above the Calgary median. Women who discontinued after the first survey (n=123) were typically younger, non-Caucasian, foreign-born, had lower education and household income levels, were less likely to be married or in a common-law relationship, and had poor psychosocial health in early pregnancy. In general, AOB participants reflect the pregnant and parenting population at local and provincial levels, and perinatal indicators from the study are comparable to perinatal surveillance data. CONCLUSIONS: The extensive and rich data collected in the AOB cohort provides the opportunity to answer complex questions about the relationships between biology, early experiences, and developmental outcomes. This cohort will contribute to the understanding of the biologic mechanisms and social/environmental pathways underlying associations between early and later life outcomes, gene-environment interactions, and developmental trajectories among children."
21316832,0,a,"Health disparities are, to a large extent, the result of socio-economic factors that cannot be entirely mitigated through the health care system. While an array of social services are thought to be necessary to address the social determinants of health, budget constraints, particularly in difficult economic times, limit the availability of such services. It is therefore necessary to prioritize interventions through some fair process. While it might be appropriate to engage in public deliberation to set priorities, doing so requires that the public accept such a deliberative process and appreciate the social determinants of health. We therefore analyzed the results of a study in which groups deliberated to prioritize socio-economic interventions to examine whether these two requirements can possibly be met and to explore the basis for their priorities. A total of 431 residents of Washington, D.C. with incomes under 200% of the federal poverty threshold participated in 43 groups to engage in a hypothetical exercise to prioritize interventions designed to ameliorate the social determinants of health within the constraints of a limited budget. Findings from pre- and post-exercise questionnaires demonstrate that the priority setting exercise was perceived as a fair deliberative process, and that following the deliberation, participants became more likely to agree that a broad number of determinants contribute to their health. Qualitative analysis of the group discussions indicate that participants prioritized interventions that would provide for basic necessities and improve community conditions, while at the same time addressing more macro-structural factors such as homelessness and unemployment. We conclude that engaging small groups in deliberation about ways to address the social determinants of health can both change participant attitudes and yield informed priorities that might guide public policy aimed at most affordably reducing health disparities."
26382241,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), knowledge about health and its determinants has been integrated into a comparable framework to inform health policy. Outputs of this analysis are relevant to current policy questions in England and elsewhere, particularly on health inequalities. We use GBD 2013 data on mortality and causes of death, and disease and injury incidence and prevalence to analyse the burden of disease and injury in England as a whole, in English regions, and within each English region by deprivation quintile. We also assess disease and injury burden in England attributable to potentially preventable risk factors. England and the English regions are compared with the remaining constituent countries of the UK and with comparable countries in the European Union (EU) and beyond. METHODS: We extracted data from the GBD 2013 to compare mortality, causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with a disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in England, the UK, and 18 other countries (the first 15 EU members [apart from the UK] and Australia, Canada, Norway, and the USA [EU15+]). We extended elements of the analysis to English regions, and subregional areas defined by deprivation quintile (deprivation areas). We used data split by the nine English regions (corresponding to the European boundaries of the Nomenclature for Territorial Statistics level 1 [NUTS 1] regions), and by quintile groups within each English region according to deprivation, thereby making 45 regional deprivation areas. Deprivation quintiles were defined by area of residence ranked at national level by Index of Multiple Deprivation score, 2010. Burden due to various risk factors is described for England using new GBD methodology to estimate independent and overlapping attributable risk for five tiers of behavioural, metabolic, and environmental risk factors. We present results for 306 causes and 2337 sequelae, and 79 risks or risk clusters. FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2013, life expectancy from birth in England increased by 5.4 years (95% uncertainty interval 5.0-5.8) from 75.9 years (75.9-76.0) to 81.3 years (80.9-81.7); gains were greater for men than for women. Rates of age-standardised YLLs reduced by 41.1% (38.3-43.6), whereas DALYs were reduced by 23.8% (20.9-27.1), and YLDs by 1.4% (0.1-2.8). For these measures, England ranked better than the UK and the EU15+ means. Between 1990 and 2013, the range in life expectancy among 45 regional deprivation areas remained 8.2 years for men and decreased from 7.2 years in 1990 to 6.9 years in 2013 for women. In 2013, the leading cause of YLLs was ischaemic heart disease, and the leading cause of DALYs was low back and neck pain. Known risk factors accounted for 39.6% (37.7-41.7) of DALYs; leading behavioural risk factors were suboptimal diet (10.8% [9.1-12.7]) and tobacco (10.7% [9.4-12.0]). INTERPRETATION: Health in England is improving although substantial opportunities exist for further reductions in the burden of preventable disease. The gap in mortality rates between men and women has reduced, but marked health inequalities between the least deprived and most deprived areas remain. Declines in mortality have not been matched by similar declines in morbidity, resulting in people living longer with diseases. Health policies must therefore address the causes of ill health as well as those of premature mortality. Systematic action locally and nationally is needed to reduce risk exposures, support healthy behaviours, alleviate the severity of chronic disabling disorders, and mitigate the effects of socioeconomic deprivation.

18941263,1,a,"This article focuses on the measurement of the social determinants of health, and specifically on issues relating to two key variables relevant to the analysis of public health information: poverty and inequality. Although the paper has been written from the perspective of economics, the discipline of the two authors, it is also of relevance to researchers in other disciplines. It is argued that there is a need to ensure that, when considering measurement in this largely neglected area of research, sufficient thought is given to the relationships that are being examined or assessed. We argue further that any attempt at measurement in this area must take into account the historical backdrop and the complex nature of the relationships between these key variables."
14686137,1,a,"Although relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient."
25136398,1,a,"UNLABELLED: In recent decades the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been adopted by many business sectors, including the pharmaceutical industry. However, in this and other sectors its application remains variable, particularly between mature and developing economies. Its stakeholders include pharmacy and medical students, their attitude to the involvement of companies in socially responsible activities will be important determinants of public response to the industry. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of senior medical and pharmacy students towards the CSR concept in the pharmaceutical sector in mature (Germany) and developing (Russia) markets. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was carried out among senior pharmacy and medical students during the summer semester 2008 in two Russian and one German university. In each country 120 questionnaires were distributed. The response rate was 95% in Russia and 93% in Germany. RESULTS: Although the relevance of CSR was widely acknowledged by the students, very few were aware of CSR practices currently performed by companies. THE REPUTATION OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WAS GENERALLY POOR: less than 15% of respondents gave credence to the information provided in advertisements and fully supported pricing strategies as well as policies towards the developing countries. When choosing an employer more than 90% of respondents consider the policies affecting an employee directly as pivotal. However, for a high proportion of students (59% in Russia and 64% in Germany) socially irresponsible behavior by companies has a significant negative impact. CONCLUSIONS: This paper identifies practices which students believe should be a part of the CSR programmes for the pharmaceutical industry, and also some that should be abandoned. It recommends that corporate communication on CSR should be expanded. Key differences are seen in perceptions of students in Germany and Russia towards the extent of irresponsible actions and the variation between them."
18280480,1,a,"AIM: The aim of this study is to explore whether the work organisation of diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs) differs significantly from nurses working in hospital and nursing home and if so, does this difference result in positive or negative consequences regarding work and health. BACKGROUND: In traditional health care settings, nurses exhibit a high level of environmental uncertainty and low decision-making authority, which has a negative effect on psychological reactions towards work. In professional nursing, specialisation, e.g. diabetic nursing, is a current trend in many countries. Therefore, insight into the determinants of the work situation of nursing specialists is becoming increasingly relevant. METHODS: Comparisons were made between 3 different samples: 1204 nurses employed by 15 hospitals, 1058 nurses employed by 14 nursing homes, and 350 diabetes nurses working in other health care settings throughout the Netherlands. Data concerning organisation, work aspects, and psychological reactions were measured via questionnaires. Variances between the groups were analysed with ANCOVA, besides hierarchical multiple regression analysis was applied. FINDINGS: Environmental uncertainty scored lower amongst diabetes nurses when compared to nurses working in the other two types of health care settings. Social support and role conflict scored low for diabetes nursing specialists who simultaneously perceived autonomy and role ambiguity highest. Diabetes nursing specialists also scored highest on intrinsic work motivation and job satisfaction and lowest for psychosomatic health. CONCLUSION: Except for social support and role ambiguity, diabetic nurses rate their [work] organisation, [work] aspects and psychological [work] reactions more positively than nurses employed in other health care settings."
28054430,0,a,"Over the last decade, the concept of the ""complex patient"" has not only been more widely used in multidisciplinary healthcare teams and across various healthcare disciplines, but it has also become more vacuous in meaning. The uptake of the concept of the ""complex patient"" spans across disciplines, such as medicine, nursing, and social work, with no consistent definition. We review the chronological evolution of this concept and its surrogate terms, namely ""comorbidity,"" ""multimorbidity,"" ""polypathology,"" ""dual diagnosis,"" and ""multiple chronic conditions."" Drawing on key principles of concept clarification, we highlight disciplinary usage in the literature published between 2005 and 2015 in health sciences, attending to overlaps and revealing nuances of the complex patient concept. Finally, we discuss the implications of this concept for practice, research, and theory."
14571309,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Canada with wide, unexplained regional variations in heart disease mortality. However, no studies to date have explored the relationship between a number of health region characteristics and regional variation in heart disease mortality rates across Canada. INTRODUCTION: We studied the contribution of various traditional cardiac risk factors, social determinants of health and other community characteristics to regional variations in heart disease mortality rates across Canada. METHODS: Cardiovascular disease and ischemic heart disease (IHD) age-standardized mortality rates were obtained from Statistics Canada for three years - 1995 to 1997. Health region characteristics were taken from the 2000/2001 Canadian Community Health Survey, and the 1996 Canadian Census and the Labour Force Survey. Linear regression analyses and analyses of variance were employed to identify relationships between these health region characteristics and CVD and IHD mortality rates. RESULTS: Significant regional variations in CVD mortality rates per 100,000 population were observed. Newfoundland and Labrador had the highest CVD and IHD mortality rates, while Nunavut and the Northwest Territories had the lowest CVD and IHD mortality rates. Health region smoking and unemployment rates were identified as the most important factors associated with CVD and IHD mortality at the health region level. CONCLUSIONS: Significant regional variations in age-standardized CVD and IHD mortality were noted both at the provincial/territorial level and the health region level. Efforts to reduce CVD and IHD mortality in Canada require attention to both traditional risk factors (eg, smoking) and broader determinants of health (eg, unemployment rates)."
25077079,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There has been an increase in institutional delivery rates in India in the recent years. However, in areas with high institutional delivery rates, most deliveries (>50%) occur in private institutions rather than in government facilities where zero expense delivery services are being provided. AIM: This study aimed to understand, from the community health volunteers' viewpoint, the reasons for underutilization of zero expense delivery services provided in government health facilities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five Focused Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted among Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHAs) of a Primary Health Centre (PHC) in Dayalpur village, Haryana in December 2012. Participants were asked to articulate the possible reasons that they thought were responsible for expectant mothers not choosing to deliver in government health facilities. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants. RESULT: The commonly stated reasons for underutilization of government health facilities for delivery services were lack of quality care, abominable behaviour of hospital staff, poor transportation facilities, and frequent referrals to higher centres. CONCLUSION: This study reflected the necessity for new policies to make government health facilities friendlier and more easily accessible to clients and to make all government hospitals follow a minimum set of standards for providing quality care."
28901336,0,a,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D and probiotics are nutrients of interest in the context of type 1 diabetes (T1D). We assessed the prevalence of and factors associated with vitamin D and probiotic supplementations among young children with genetic risk of T1D. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Use of supplements during the first 2 years of life was collected prospectively from 8674 children in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. RESULTS: Single and/or multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplements were reported by 81% of the children. The majority of participants in Finland, Germany and Sweden (97-99%) and 50% in the United States received vitamin D supplements that were mostly MVMs. Probiotics use varied from 6% in the United States to 60% in Finland and was primarily from probiotics-only preparations. More than 80% of the vitamin D and probiotics supplementation was initiated during infancy, and more than half of the uses lasted longer than a year. Being the first child, longer duration of breastfeeding, born in a later year, older maternal age and higher maternal education level were associated with both vitamin D and probiotics use. Shorter gestational age and mother not smoking during pregnancy were associated with a higher likelihood of probiotics supplementation only. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D and probiotics supplementations are popular in children 0-2 years old and are associated with common factors. Data documented here will allow evaluation of the relationship between early childhood dietary intake and the development of islet autoimmunity and progression to T1D."
15242021,1,a,"The aim of the study was to assess quality of life (QL) of residents of Polish urban area and analyze the influence of selected sociodemographic and clinical variables on their QL. The study revealed a very high level of reported problems, especially regarding pain and anxiety. The mean subjective assessment of health state was poor in comparison with results obtained in other (usually western) countries. Presence of major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases had an important impact on QL. Elevated blood pressure and unsatisfactory level of physical activity were the strongest factors deteriorating QL in the studied population. There is a need for implementing effective interventions in the society, especially in the area of prevention and management of hypertension and sedentary lifestyle."
27854526,0,a,"Counterfactual frameworks and statistical methods for supporting causal inference are powerful tools to clarify scientific questions and guide analyses in public health research. Counterfactual accounts of causation contrast what would happen to a population's health under alternative exposure scenarios. A long-standing debate in counterfactual theory relates to whether sex, race, and biological characteristics, including obesity, should be evaluated as causes, given that these variables do not directly correspond to clearly defined interventions. We argue that sex, race, and biological characteristics are important health determinants. Quantifying the overall health effects of these variables is often a natural starting point for disparities research. Subsequent assessments of biological or social pathways mediating those effects can facilitate the development of interventions designed to reduce disparities."
19032747,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Air pollution and social characteristics have been shown to affect indicators of health. While use of spatial methods to estimate exposure to air pollution has increased the power to detect effects, questions have been raised about potential for confounding by social factors. METHODS: A study of singleton births in Eastern Massachusetts was conducted between 1996 and 2002 to examine the association between indicators of traffic, land use, individual and area-based socioeconomic measures (SEM), and birth outcomes (birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm births), in a two-level hierarchical model. RESULTS: We found effects of both individual (education, race, prenatal care index) and area-based (median household income) SEM with all birth outcomes. The associations for traffic and land use variables were mainly seen with birth weight, with an exception for an effect of cumulative traffic density on small for gestational age. Race/ethnicity of mother was an important predictor of birth outcomes and a strong confounder for both area-based SEM and indices of physical environment. The effects of traffic and land use differed by level of education and median household income. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings of the study suggested greater likelihood of reduced birth weight and preterm births among the more socially disadvantaged, and a greater risk of reduced birth weight associated with traffic exposures. Results revealed the importance of controlling simultaneously for SEM and environmental exposures as the way to better understand determinants of health."
15113642,1,a,"Informal care is an indispensable element in the care for many patients. In order to maintain a sustainable input of informal care, it seems important to identify measures to alleviate the burden of care giving for caregivers at risk of burn out or other serious health problems, such as support and respite care. Thus, far research has focused on the burden of caregiving and on the supply of respite care. The demand side: what type of care is preferred by informal caregivers and what determines their preferences, is virtually unknown. We analysed the preferences and the underlying determinants for several types of support and respite care in a sample of 950 Dutch informal caregivers. Almost 80% of the respondents desire support or respite care in general, 42-47% would prefer more communication with other informal caregivers or more information of professional caregivers. Some time off is preferred by 40% of the respondents. The results show that caregiver characteristics, care recipient characteristics, elements of the caregiving situation and institutional variables determine the desire for support and respite care. Especially, the subjective burden of caregiving is important, whereas the number of caregiving tasks and the time invested (objective burden) hardly affect the desire for support and respite care."
14964928,1,a,"PURPOSE: This article discusses a research study that explored how rural people in Saskatchewan, Canada, respond to stressful events and adversity, without outside interventions. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 17 individuals who were living or had lived on a farm in Saskatchewan. The participants' definitions of resiliency, their experiences with resiliency or lack of resiliency, and what they identified as the barriers to and enhancers of resiliency in their lives were discussed. FINDINGS: Resiliency was defined as a process and interactive model that included ""bouncing back"" from adversity, coping, and acquiring skills, such as problem solving and learning. Resiliency was dynamic, temporal, and relational and was both proactive and reactive. There were both internal and external barriers to and enhancers of resiliency. Barriers to resiliency included fear, isolation, and depopulation, whereas enhancers included resources, support, and control. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional resiliency models are not sufficient for understanding resiliency. It is clear that social, political, and economic factors play an important role in the resiliency and health of people who live in rural areas. A conceptualization of resiliency must be embedded in a social context and include community factors. Recommendations for enhancing resiliency, such as sustaining rural life, supporting families, and providing services, are also discussed."
21289357,0,a,"Comparative effectiveness research to date has focused primarily on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and injuries in individuals. Yet the greatest drivers of people's overall health are found in their social and physical environments. We recommend that the comparative effectiveness research agenda focus on the public health issues responsible for the greatest overall illness and death levels, such as programs to increase high school graduation rates, which are strongly associated with improvements in long-term illness and death rates. In so doing, the agenda should spotlight efforts to address widely recognized social and environmental determinants of health, such as improving access to early childhood development programs and education, as well as interventions aimed at affecting climate change and addressing behavioral risk factors such as smoking. We also urge federal health agencies to invest in further development of methods to compare public health interventions and to use those methods to conduct the studies."
12517319,1,a,The population health perspective (PHP) is commonly used in addressing a wide range of health issues. This article examines the strengths and limitations of the perspective. The determinants of health that are an integral part of the PHP are used as a framework in considering the range of outcomes associated with exposure to child maltreatment. Directions for further research are outlined.
11426265,1,a,"Factors related to the characteristics of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina are described. Factors from different scientific fields converge to form the syndrome's analytical framework. Some of these factors are the history of spatial occupation, work and production structures, human migration patterns, ethnic composition, reservoir dynamics and its relationship to the different circulating viruses, and human behavior. Furthermore, the multiple factors are expressed in three ecological frameworks, associated with three different geographical regions of Argentina: 1) Northwest; 2) Central (""wet Pampa""); and 3) South Andean. In order to understand the actual causality of health or disease as an interaction of many factors, research on the primary biological, social, and environmental determinants of diseases should attend to the complexity of variable relationships in each region. The multiple-factor convergence approach allows for the design of appropriate strategies to improve the population's health status. Therefore, strategies should be developed and transferred by multidisciplinary teams, while their sustainability should be assured by community participation beginning with the earliest steps of research onward."
18486291,1,a,"An increase in the social unacceptability of smoking has dramatically decreased tobacco use in the USA. However, how policies (e.g., smoke free air laws) and social factors (e.g., social norms) drive the social unacceptability of tobacco use are not well understood. New research suggests that the stigmatization of smokers is an unrecognized force in the tobacco epidemic and could be one such mechanism. Thus, it is important to investigate the sources of smoker-related stigmatization as perceived by current and former smokers. In this study, we draw on the broader literature about stigma formation in the context of the tobacco epidemic and examine the role of attribution, fear, tobacco control policies, power and social norms in the formation of smoker-related stigma. We test hypotheses about the determinants of stigma using a population-based sample of 816 current and former smokers in New York City. The results show that perceptions of individual attributions for smoking behavior and fear about the health consequences of second hand smoke are important influences on smoker-related stigmatization. Structural forms of discrimination perpetrated against smokers and former smokers (e.g., company policies against hiring smokers) are also related to smoker-related stigma. Respondents with more education perceive more smoker-related stigma than respondents with less education and, Black and Latino respondents perceive less smoker-related stigma than White respondents. Social norms, specifically family and friends' expressed disapproval of smoking, contribute to the formation of smoker-related stigma. These findings suggest important points of leverage to harness the powerful role of stigma in the smoking epidemic and raise concerns about the possible role of stigma in the production of smoking disparities."
12973577,1,a,"This article presents the relationship between wage labor, housewifery, and health from a gender perspective. The relationship between the two types of work determines the characteristics and meaning of daily life. The methodology combined quantitative and qualitative techniques. An individual questionnaire was applied to 256 male and 121 female workers (n = 377) in a modern pharmaceutical factory in Mexico. In addition, seven in-depth interviews were performed with selected employees. Despite important similarities between female and male wage-earners, there were two key differences: gender segregation in the workplace and the division of household work. The social determinants of this uneven situation result from a complex gender relationship, leading to different disease profiles and health concepts."
18665062,1,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study presents a case analysis of how 3 urban medical centers with differing ownership models, within 1 metropolitan area, ration access to uncompensated care to uninsured patients. METHODS: Data was triangulated from 3 sources: hospital financial reports by service line for a fiscal year, a survey of 292 self-pay patients, and the self-pay policies and practices of clerical personnel described in a previous publication. RESULTS: Although the public, for-profit and not-for-profit institutions used different strategies for managing self-pays, there were also commonalities in the experiences indigent patients reported. The public institution provided the broadest access to the largest percentage of self-pay patients but offset the burden with the most successful prepayment and collection practices. The for-profit site obeyed federal regulations mandating emergency care but severely curtailed other services, and the not-for-profit limited assess (but not to the extent of the for-profit) and pursued collection (but not to the extent of the public). At all sites, actual practices by clerical staff often diverged from institutions' written self-pay policies. The probability of being turned away because of inability to pay ranged from 0% to 40% with front line personnel exercising considerable discretion on a case-by-case basis. CONCLUSIONS: Large institutional providers balance their particular social and legal obligations with strategies to limit access and optimize prepayment and collection. Stated policies generally do not reflect the practices of personnel. Uninsured patients are forced to navigate a capricious system that manages them as a liability rather than as a legitimate client."
26178206,0,a,"BACKGROUND: while sexual behaviours are potentially important for quality of life in older adults, they are under-researched. The current study examined associations between frequency and importance of sexual behaviours and quality of life in older adults. METHOD: one hundred and thirty-three participants (mean 74 years, SD = 7.1) provided information about the frequency with which they participated in six sexual behaviours and the perceived importance of these: touching/holding hands, embracing/hugging, kissing, mutual stroking, masturbating and intercourse. Participants also completed the WHO Quality of Life scale, providing an overall quality of life score, in addition to the domains of physical health, psychological health, social relationships and environment. Participants provided information on their marital status, living arrangements and self-reported health. RESULTS: both the frequency and importance of sexual behaviours were moderately positively correlated with quality of life (r = 0.52 and 0.47, respectively, both P < 0.001). In separate regression analyses, the frequency of sexual behaviours was a significant predictor of quality of life in the social relationships domain (beta = 0.225, P < 0.05), and the importance of sexual behaviours was associated with the psychological domain (beta = 0.151, P < 0.05), independent of the presence of a spouse/partner and self-reported health. CONCLUSIONS: with ageing trends, a broader understanding of the factors that influence quality of life in older adults is increasingly important. The current findings suggest that aspects of sexual behaviour and quality of life were positively associated. Researchers are encouraged to consider aspects of sex and sexuality when exploring determinants of well-being in later life."
31297879,0,a,"AIMS: To understand the epidemiology, progression, and predictive factors of urinary incontinence (UI) in community-dwelling Mexican adults aged >/= 50 by sex and UI subtypes (stress, urge, and mixed). METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal UI data in community-dwelling adults aged >/= 50 (7783 women and 5843 men) for the 2012 to 2015 period of the Mexican Health and Aging Study. We estimated mixed, stress, and urgency incontinence prevalence (2012); 2-year cumulative incidence and remissions (2015); and progression (2012-2015). A multivariate analysis was undertaken to evaluate the predictive factors for UI and its subtypes by sex. RESULTS: The prevalence of UI was higher (27.7%) for women (average age 65.9 +/- 9.5) than 12.5% men (average age 67.4 +/- 9.3) and increased with age in both sexes (26.7% in women 50 to 59, to 48.5% in >/= 90; and 6.8% in men 50 to 59, to 26.2% >/= 90). The most frequent UI subtypes were mixed in women and urge in men. The cumulative incidence of UI was higher in women (22.9%) than men (12.3%) while its remission was higher in men than women. Predictive factors for UI in both sexes were depressive symptoms, a higher number of concomitant diseases and a history of falls; while advanced age was a factor only for men. CONCLUSIONS: UI is a common health problem and its prevalence and severity increase with age. Addressing modifiable risk factors such as depression and falls could decrease the prevalence and incidence of UI and its subtypes. Further studies should also focus on the relationship between mixed UI and male mortality."
23503540,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine sociodemographic and epidemiological factors associated with private health insurance coverage in the elderly. METHODS: A total of 2,143 individuals aged 60 years or more were interviewed in the city of Sao Paulo in 2000 and 2006. Having private health insurance was the dichotomous dependent variable. Independent variables included sociodemographic characteristics and self-reported health status. The proportions of the variables studied were described and a logistic regression model considering those variables significant at p < 0.05 was constructed. RESULTS: The elderly with private insurance coverage had significantly higher income and education. The elderly with no private insurance were screened less for cancer and more for respiratory diseases; they waited longer for appointments; they performed less medical tests; they reported fewer conditions and more falls and had a more negative self-rated health. The insured respondents reported lower vaccination rates and, among those hospitalized, 11.1% had their medical costs covered by the Brazilian National Health System (SUS) in 2000 and 17.9% in 2006. Osteoporosis was the single condition associated with private health insurance. CONCLUSIONS: The elderly with private insurance coverage had significantly higher income and education than those with no private coverage, and these differences were associated with service utilization and social determinants of health."
24679837,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The determinants of the quality of life (QoL) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in Chinese population remain largely unknown. METHODS: A total of 649 PD patients from Southwest China participated in this cross-sectional study. Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) was used to evaluate the non-motor symptoms (NMS), whereas PD Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39) was used to assess the QoL of the PD patients. Multiple stepwise regression analysis was conducted to identify the determinants of the QoL. RESULTS: NMS, H-Y stage, female, disease duration, UPDRS III score, single/divorced/widowed, and motor complications accounted for 66.3% of the variables in the multiple regression analysis and were the negative determinants of the QoL. Among these variables, NMS and H-Y stage accounted for 46.7% and 14.5%, respectively. NMS were closely associated with each domain of PDQ-39. Female sex especially predicted poor emotional well-being and bodily discomfort, whereas single/divorced/widowed especially predicted poor stigma and social support of PD patients. Comorbidity, motor complications and rural living predicted poor mobility, activities of daily living and emotional well-being, respectively. CONCLUSION: Both demographic and disease-specific factors influence the QoL in PD patients. NMS are the strongest independent negative determinant of the overall QoL and closely associated with each domain of PDQ-39. The treatment of NMS may help to improve the QoL of PD patients."
30085059,0,a,"Ghana introduced a social health insurance scheme in 2003. One of its motivations was to protect consumers against adverse health shocks. Financing for the programme comes from a 2.5% goods and service tax, contributions by formal sector workers directly transferred from their social security savings and individual premiums from informal members. This arrangement makes formal workers compulsory members of the scheme while informal members voluntarily enroll. We view this as a natural experiment in which one section of the population automatically acquires insurance (with formal sector employment), and the remainder choose to obtain the same coverage (or not). Using data from the 2009/2010 Ghana Socioeconomic Panel Survey, we explore the determinants of the uptake of health insurance by informal members and test whether this voluntary health insurance uptake impacts the frequency of use of health care resources. We find robust evidence that older, wealthier and more educated individuals are more likely to buy (voluntary) health insurance. Moreover, using the method of propensity score matching, we find that voluntary health insurance uptake is strongly associated with higher health care utilization-implying that, with respect to the frequency of use, the mode of insurance acquisition matters."
29426195,0,a,"Occurrence and frequency of six most prescribed antibiotics (tetracycline, norfloxacin, azithromycin, anhydro erythromycin, cephalexin, and amoxicillin) were assessed in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and in water and sediments of the Persian Gulf at Bushehr coastline, Iran. The antibiotics concentration in the influent and effluent of septic tank (the hospital WWTP), activated sludge (the hospital WWTP), and stabilization pond (municipal WWTP) ranged between 7.89 and 149.63, 13.49-198.47, 6.55-16.37ng/L, respectively. Conventional treatment resulted in incomplete removal of most of the studied antibiotics. Furthermore, the activated sludge was more effective in terms of antibiotic elimination compared to the stabilization pond or septic tank. The mean concentration of antibiotics ranged 1.21-51.50ng/L in seawater and 1.40-25.32ng/g in sediments during summer and winter. Norfloxacin was the dominant detected antibiotic in seawater, sediments, and influent of two hospital WWTPs. Seasonal comparisons showed significant differences for erythromycin and amoxicillin concentrations in seawater. Spatial variation indicated the role of physicochemical properties on distribution of antibiotics in seawater and sediments. The results emphasize the need to pay attention to antibiotic contamination in water and sediments of the Persian Gulf."
24127257,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to prospectively determine the factors contributing to whether unaffected women from BRCA1/2 families reported that clinicians proposed psychological consultations and that they had attended these consultations during the genetic testing process. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on a national cohort, using self-administered questionnaires to determine the rates of proposal and use of psychological services at the time of BRCA1/2 test result disclosure (N = 533) and during the first year after disclosure (N = 478) among unaffected French women from BRCA1/2 families who had undergone genetic testing for BRCA1/2. Multivariate adjustment was carried out using logistic regression models fitted using generalized estimation equations, with the genetic testing centre as the clustering variable. RESULTS: At the time of BRCA1/2 test result disclosure, a psychological consultation was proposed by cancer geneticists to 72% and 32% of the carriers (N = 232) and noncarriers (N = 301), respectively (p < 0.001). One year after disclosure, 21% of the carriers had consulted a psychologist, versus 9% of the noncarriers (p < 0.001). Both the proposal and the uptake depended on the women's BRCA1/2 mutation carrier status (proposal adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 4.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4-7.2; uptake AOR: 2.2; 95% CI 1.2-4.0), their level of education (proposal AOR: 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.7; uptake AOR: 4.5; 95% CI 1.7-12.1) and the distress they experienced about their genetic test results (proposal AOR: 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.03; uptake AOR: 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.06) CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of the proposal/uptake of psychological consultations in the BRCA1/2 testing process highlight the need for inventive strategies to reach the different types of women's profiles."
30903758,0,a,"Background The present study was conducted with the aim of investigating the prevalence of potentially beneficial and harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in intensive care units (ICUs). Methods The present cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in two ICUs in Shahr-e Kord city, Iran. The study sample was consisted of 300 patients. The Drug Interaction Facts reference text book [Tatro DS. Drug interaction facts. St Louis, MO: Walters Kluwer Health, 2010.] was used to determine the type and the frequency of the DDIs. Results The participants consisted of 189 patients men and 111 women. The mean age of patients was 44.2 +/- 24.6 years. Totally, 60.5% of patients had at least one drug-drug interaction in their profile. The total number of DDIs found was 663 (the mean of the total number of drug-drug interactions was 2.4 interactions per patient). Of all the 663 interactions, 574 were harmful and others were beneficial. In terms of starting time, 98 of the potential interactions were rapid and 565 of them were delayed. In terms of severity, 511 of the potential interactions were moderate. Some of the drugs in the patients' medical records including phenytoin, dopamine, ranitidine, corticosteroid, dopamine, heparin, midazolam, aspirin, magnesium, calcium gluconate, and antibiotics, the type of ventilation, the type of nutrition and the duration of hospital stay were among the factors that were associated with high risk of potential DDIs (p < 0.05). Conclusions The prevalence of potentially beneficial and harmful DDIs, especially harmful drug-drug interactions, is high in ICUs and it is necessary to reduce these interactions by implementing appropriate programs and interventions."
30338603,0,a,"AIM: Working as a nurse, by its nature, causes a high degree of stress. Nurses are exposed to the higher levels of occupational, physical, and mental stresses in critical care units than the nurses in other units of a hospital. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of training for resilience on the intensive care unit nurses' occupational stress and resilience level. METHODS: This study is a quasi-experimental intervention study that was done by recruiting 30 nurses who were selected from critical care units of an educational hospital in Sari City, Iran, through convenience sampling between April 2015 and February 2016. The resilience training was provided in 5 sessions of 90 to 120 minutes. The pretest-posttest approach was used in this study, and the nurses completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Expanded Nursing Stress Scale, before and 2 weeks after the training program. RESULTS: The mean score of the occupational stress of the participants decreased significantly after the intervention (P = .001), and the mean score of resilience increased significantly after the intervention (P = .001). CONCLUSION: The results confirm the effectiveness of resilience training on occupational stress and resilience level of nurses working in the intensive care units."
11410405,1,a,"The major skeletal determinants of fracture risk are bone mass and postmenopausal bone loss with gradual destruction of trabecular bone architecture. Therefore, the management of osteoporosis is to prevent bone loss after menopause in women below 60 years of age. We need a screening test of bone mineral density (BMD) with the ability to identify correctly individuals with accelerated bone loss; unnecessary treatment has to be avoided. But without measurable extraskeletal factors, no technique assessing BMD as single test has the reasonable high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of fast bone losers. It is on principle the repeated volumetric bone measurement--within 12 months--in the pure trabecular bone, especially at distal radius of the non-dominant arm with the peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), being able to detect accurately the individuals as fast bone losers with trabecular bone loss > 8 mg/cm3 or > 3.5% per year (prevalence about 35%). Only women with very high trabecular BMD (in highest quintile) have no risk for osteoporosis."
30126432,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the self-reported perceived quality of life (QoL) in female to male (FTM) and male to female (MTF) transgenders and compare it with a general population sample, and to find possible determinants that likely contribute to their QoL. METHODS: Participants were 71 trandgenders participating in the communities of Isfahan and Fars provinces, Iran, including 30 MTF and 41 FTM, and 142 gender- and age-matched controls. Persian version of the Short Form 36-Item Questionnaire was used to evaluate self-reported QoL, which measures QoL across eight domains. RESULTS: Compared to control group, the QoL of transgenders in the most dimensions of the SF-36 questionnaire was lower. MTF had a lower QoL than FTM for the subscale physical functioning (p = 0.044). There was a significant relationship between education and subscales of emotional well-being (p = 0.048) and social function (p = 0.008); economic status and physical function subscale (p = 0.003); employment status and physical function (p = 0.012) and social function subscales (p = 0.003). Compared to male controls, MTF transgenders had lower physical functioning (P < 0.001), role limitation due to physical health (P = 0.015), vitality (P = 0.023), social functioning (P < 0.001) and pain score (P = 0.044) and no significant differences between female controls and FTM transgenders were seen. CONCLUSION: Transgenders have lower physical and mental QoL, FTM transgender has better QoL than MTF transgender. Employment, education, province of residence and economic status as well as therapeutic intervention is associated with transgender's QoL."
14608444,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess determinants of a high Caesarean delivery rate in a remote population in China. METHODS: A prospective cohort study including 20,891 women who gave birth between January 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998, in one of the 18 hospitals participating in a hospital-based regional perinatal surveillance system in Qingyuan, a remote rural region in Guangdong province, China. RESULTS: Of the 20,891 pregnant women registered by the Qingyuan Perinatal Surveillance System, 7.5% were delivered by elective Caesarean section, and 18.4% were delivered by non-elective Caesarean section. The most common indications for elective Caesarean delivery were socio-cultural, non-medical reasons, such as the woman's fear of pain, her wish to give birth on a date or at a time believed to be particularly auspicious, or her belief that delivery by Caesarean section would protect the baby's brain. Factors strongly related to elective Caesarean delivery included insurance status, maternal age, plurality, preeclampsia and eclampsia, gestational age, and birth weight. The most common indication for non-elective Caesarean delivery was cephalopelvic disproportion. Factors strongly related to non-elective Caesarean delivery included maternal age, preeclampsia and eclampsia, placenta previa, gestational age, and birth weight. CONCLUSION: Non-medical causes, including a woman's insurance status and her personal and social demands, accounted for a large proportion of elective Caesarean deliveries in this remote population in China."
16076786,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of design features and clinical and social cues on the extent of disagreement among participants in a formal consensus development process. METHODS: Factorial design involving 16 groups consisting of 135 general practitioners (GPs) and 42 mental health professionals from England. The groups rated the appropriateness of four mental health interventions for three conditions (chronic back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome) in the context of various clinical and social cues. The groups differed in three design features: provision of a systematic literature review (versus not provided), group composition (mixed versus GP only), and assumptions about the healthcare resources available (realistic versus idealistic). Disagreement was measured using the mean absolute deviation from a group's median rating for a scenario. RESULTS: None of the design features significantly affected the extent of disagreement within groups (all p>0.3). Disagreement did differ between treatments (closer consensus for cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural therapy than for brief psychodynamic intervention therapy and antidepressants) and cues (closer consensus for depressed patients and patients willing to try any treatment). CONCLUSION: In terms of the extent of disagreement in the groups in this study, formal consensus development was a robust technique in that the results were not dependent on the way it was conducted."
29380381,0,a,"AIM: This study aimed to summarize the available information in the literature to make an accurate estimate of the prevalence of burnout among Iranian nurses. BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION: Burnout is a work-related stress syndrome that has negative impact on healthcare providers, patients and healthcare delivery systems. METHOD: A comprehensive search of literature using international [PubMed, Scopus and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)] and Iranian scientific data bases [Scientific Information Database (SID), IranMedex and Magiran] was conducted to identify English and Persian language studies, published between 2000 and 2016, that examined the prevalence of burnout among nurses in Iran. The I-squared test and Chi-squared-based Q-test suggested heterogeneity of reported prevalence among the qualified studies; thus, a random-effects model was applied to estimate the overall prevalence of burnout among nurses in Iran. RESULTS: Based on 21 selected articles with 4180 participants, the overall prevalence of burnout among Iranian nurses was estimated to be 36% [95% confidence interval (CI), 20-53%] in Iran. Meta-regression indicated that sample size and year of data collection, mean age of samples, female to male ratio and geographic regions were not statistically significantly associated with the prevalence of burnout. Also, based on Egger's test and funnel plot, there is no publication bias among studies included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: Professional burnout affects more than one-third of nursing staff in Iran; thus, effective interventions and strategies are required to reduce and prevent burnout among nurses. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Due to the negative consequences of burnout on patients, nurses and organizations, nursing and healthcare managers should intervene to prevent and reduce burnout among nurses in Iran. Policy attention should focus on developing effective interventions to prevent and minimize the burden of burnout among nurses in Iran. Nurses' involvement in the policy-making process is crucial in the implementation of effective programs and initiatives tailored to address the higher prevalence of burnout among Iranian nurses."
11008088,1,a,"PURPOSE: To investigate a broad range of social influence-related and global determinants of smoking to aid in the design of comprehensive multiethnic interventions by testing the most important factors of initiation and escalation of smoking across various subgroups. METHODS: Cross-sectional (N = 2546) and cohort (N = 736) samples of multiethnic middle school students near a large Southwestern metropolis were surveyed through self-report questionnaires. The confidential questionnaires included information on demographics, risk factors, and smoking behavior and were administered in class by trained data collectors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the statistical significance and strength of the factors. RESULTS: Those lower in self-esteem and higher in social assertiveness appeared to be most at risk for the onset of smoking, whereas those low in optimism appeared to be the most at risk for the escalation of smoking. Attitudes, friends' norms, parents' norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived prevalence were consistent predictors of all smoking status outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral-specific determinants of smoking appear to be important predictors of smoking status outcomes in all demographic subgroups. The relationships of the global determinants were more dependent on the smoking outcome variable and subgroup examined. The findings may serve to help facilitate the targeting of comprehensive interventions aimed at reducing adolescent smoking in multiethnic and ethnic group-specific populations."
23626407,0,a,"The research on the determinants of mental health among refugees has been largely limited to traumatic events, but recent work has indicated that the daily hassles of living in refugee camps also play a large role. Using hierarchical linear modelling to account for refugees nested within camp blocks, this exploratory study attempted to model stress surrounding safety and acquiring basic needs and functional impairment among refugees from Darfur living in Chad, using individual-level demographics (e.g., gender, age, presence of a debilitating injury), structural factors (e.g., distance from block to distribution centre), and social ecological variables (e.g., percentage of single women within a block). We found that stress concerning safety concerns, daily hassles, and functional impairment were associated with several individual-level demographic factors (e.g., gender), but also with interactions between block-level and individual-level factors as well (e.g., injury and distance to distribution centre). Findings are discussed in terms of monitoring and evaluation of refugee services."
12637842,1,a,"To determine the treatment preferences (, medication, counseling, or both) for victims of recent trauma at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder and the determinants of those choices, preferences were elicited from 466 consecutive victims of physical or sexual assault at an urban emergency department as part of the routine clinical evaluation by emergency department social workers. Demographics, assault characteristics, and clinical history were used to predict preference. More than 80% of victims expressed an interest in treatment, with more interested in counseling (76%) than medication (62%). Female gender and assaults of a sexual nature were most highly predictive of preference for medication, whereas female gender, sexual assault, a history of psychiatric treatment, and perceived life threat from the trauma were most predictive of preference for counseling and preference for any treatment. Because treatment preferences were easily obtained from assault victims seeking emergency care, the elicitation of these treatment preferences and the consideration of them in the treatment planning process could facilitate engagement in treatment and overcome the avoidance of treatment by some victims."
12971112,1,a,"As we move forward in the new century, epidemiologists and public health practitioners are faced with the challenge of reviewing the current direction of epidemiology and its links with public health. While the history of epidemiology has been a successful and productive one, there is a danger that modern epidemiology is becoming too narrow in its scope, concerned primarily with the analysis of risk factors in individuals, while ignoring sociological and ecological perspectives of health. We argue that a theoretical framework to guide the practice of epidemiology is needed which encompasses a role for social determinants of health while simultaneously also acknowledging the importance of behaviour and biology, and the inter-connectedness of all these factors. This paper presents a public health model of social determinants of health, which provides a framework for testing the causal pathways linking social determinant variables with health care system attributes, disease inducing behaviours and health outcomes. This approach provides an improved opportunity to identify and evaluate evidence-based public health interventions, and facilitates stronger links between modern epidemiology and public health practice."
25805778,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This article presents the scope and development of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, reviews trend papers published on international HBSC data up to 2012 and discusses the efforts made to produce reliable trend analyses. METHODS: The major goal of this article is to present the statistical procedures and analytical strategies for upholding high data quality, as well as reflections from the authors of this article on how to produce reliable trends based on an international study of the magnitude of the HBSC study. HBSC is an international cross-sectional study collecting data from adolescents aged 11-15 years, on a broad variety of health determinants and health behaviours. RESULTS: A number of methodological challenges have stemmed from the growth of the HBSC-study, in particular given that the study has a focus on monitoring trends. Some of those challenges are considered. When analysing trends, researchers must be able to assess whether a change in prevalence is an expression of an actual change in the observed outcome, whether it is a result of methodological artefacts, or whether it is due to changes in the conceptualization of the outcome by the respondents. CONCLUSION: The article present recommendations to take a number of the considerations into account. The considerations imply methodological challenges, which are core issues in undertaking trend analyses."
21994088,0,a,"Human aggression/impulsivity-related traits have a complex background that is greatly influenced by genetic and non-genetic factors. The relationship between aggression and anxiety is regulated by highly conserved brain regions including amygdala, which controls neural circuits triggering defensive, aggressive, or avoidant behavioral models. The dysfunction of neural circuits responsible for emotional control was shown to represent an etiological factor of violent behavior. In addition to the amygdala, these circuits also involve the anterior cingulated cortex and regions of the prefrontal cortex. Excessive reactivity in the amygdala coupled with inadequate prefrontal regulation serves to increase the likelihood of aggressive behavior. Developmental alterations in prefrontal-subcortical circuitry as well as neuromodulatory and hormonal abnormality appear to play a role. Imbalance in testosterone/serotonin and testosterone/cortisol ratios (e.g., increased testosterone levels and reduced cortisol levels) increases the propensity toward aggression because of reduced activation of the neural circuitry of impulse control and self-regulation. Serotonin facilitates prefrontal inhibition, and thus insufficient serotonergic activity can enhance aggression. Genetic predisposition to aggression appears to be deeply affected by the polymorphic genetic variants of the serotoninergic system that influences serotonin levels in the central and peripheral nervous system, biological effects of this hormone, and rate of serotonin production, synaptic release and degradation. Among these variants, functional polymorphisms in the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) may be of particular importance due to the relationship between these polymorphic variants and anatomical changes in the limbic system of aggressive people. Furthermore, functional variants of MAOA and 5-HTT are capable of mediating the influence of environmental factors on aggression-related traits. In this review, we consider genetic determinants of human aggression, with special emphasis on genes involved in serotonin and dopamine metabolism and function."
15053395,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To establish the relationship between seroprevalence for antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi and its relationship with biotic and abiotic factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between August 2000 and September 2001. The study population consisted of a simple random sample of 390 volunteers residing in Palmar de Bravo, Puebla, Mexico. Sample and data collection procedures included assaying antibodies against T. cruzi with validated assays, and searching for domestic reservoirs and triatomine bugs. The relationship between biotic and abiotic factors with seropositivity was assessed. Statistical analysis was conducted using Kappa values for diagnostic tests; statistical significance was assessed with 2 x 2 tables, chi-squared test with Yates' correction, Fisher exact test, and odds ratios. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection in humans was 4%; in domestic reservoirs (horses, pigs, and dogs) only 10% of canine reservoirs were positive. Vector species recognized were T. borberi and T. pallidipennis, with a Dispersion Area Index and a Colonization Index of 55% and 40%, respectively. The most important risk factors associated with positive serology were altitude (>2,150 and <2,180 meters above sea level), presence of triatomines, age, time of residence, and participation in a social assistance program. CONCLUSIONS: T. cruzi infection was identified in human beings, vectors, and possibly in domestic reservoirs, in communities located over 2,000 meters above sea level."
18789776,1,a,"North Korea has survived the breakdown of the communist bloc and has been immune to the democratization process of the 1990s. In spite of national famines and economic collapse, the totalitarian regime in Pyongyang maintains a firm grip on its power. Reliable information on the population's biosocial welfare is scarce. Using height and weight data of 5991 North Korean pre-school children measured in 2002, we investigate determinants of height-for-age z-score (HAZ), weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) and weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) as an indicator for child health. We find a statistically significant impact of the age of the child and of the mother, as well as the sex of the child on HAZ and WAZ. In contrast, social status and wealth proxies at the individual and household level are not statistically significant possibly because of errors in these variables. We do not find a consistent effect for geographic regions or for rural-urban residents either. Yet, urban provinces seem to be better-off. Most importantly, we find that children living in families who benefit from food aid of the United Nations are healthier in terms of HAZ, WAZ and WHZ than those depending on the government. Hence, further delivery of United Nations food aid is likely to mitigate the effects of the ongoing food crisis in North Korea."
17960295,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Alcohol misuse in college students represents a significant public health problem. Toward improving the understanding of determinants of collegiate alcohol misuse, the current study examined several dimensions of impulsivity in relation to hazardous drinking in college students. METHOD: A one-way, two-group, cross-sectional design was used to compare hazardous drinkers (HZD) with social drinkers (SOC). HZD drinkers were required to score 6 or more on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT); SOC drinkers were required to score 1-5 on the AUDIT. The sample comprised 93 participants (56% HZD; 76% male) who were recruited from a medium-sized public university. Participants were assessed under neutral conditions using the Eysenck Impulsivity Questionnaire (EIQ), Delay Discounting Task (DDT), and Stanford Time Perspective Inventory (STPI). RESULTS: Consistent with predictions, HZD participants exhibited significantly greater impulsivity on the EIQ-Impulsivity subscale (p < .001), the STPI-Present Hedonism subscale (p < .01), and the STPIFuture subscale (p < .01); however, no differences were evident on the DDT (p > .40). The HZD group also scored marginally higher than the SOC group on the EIQ-Venturesomeness subscale (p < .10). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that greater impulsivity is associated with alcohol misuse in college students, most prominently in the area of propensity toward risk-taking and nonplanning (EIQ-Impulsivity subscale). The correspondence between these findings and previous studies, methodological considerations, and the need for prospective studies on impulsivity and alcohol misuse in college students are discussed."
31640619,0,a,"BACKGROUND: No reliable and comprehensive study has been published on the incidence and epidemiological profile of meningitis in Iran from 2008 to 2014, before pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and pentavalent vaccine (DTPw-Hep B-Hib (PRP-T) vaccine (pentavac) (adsorbed)) introduction. The present study aimed to portray the epidemiological profile of meningitis in Iran from 2008 to 2014. METHODS: Data on meningitis cases aged from 1 day to 110 years were extracted from national notifiable diseases surveillance system from March 2008 to December 2014 in Iran. A total number of 48,006 cases of suspected meningitis were identified and 1468 cases of which met the criteria for diagnosis-confirmed meningitis. Of 1468 cases, 1352 patients were included in the study. RESULTS: The great number of cases reported from urban areas. Moreover, males were more predominant than females (58.51% vs. 33.81%) in total. The estimated annual incidence rate of meningitis varied from 0.28/100000 in 2008 to 0.09/100000 in 2014. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis were the most leading pathogens causing bacterial meningitis, accounted for 266(23.44%), 145(12.78%), 95(8.37%) of cases, respectively. Each of the three bacterial species showed a descending trend. The majority of infected subjects are children under five years. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the decreasing trend of meningitis and high percentage of cultures with negative results, according to World Health Organization recommendation PCV introduction into routine immunization is evident. Implementing an enhanced surveillance system to provide high quality data on epidemiological profile of meningitis in Iran is necessary."
15271082,1,a,"Behavioural interactions are often analysed in terms of their costs and benefits to the actors [Hamilton, (1964) J. Theor. Biol.7 1-16; Gadagkar, (1993) Trends Ecol. Evol.8 232-234; Foster et al., (2001) Ann. Zool. Fenn.38 229-238]. Using the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, we wish to distinguish between two possible determinants of interaction behaviour between conspecifics, namely kin-directed behaviour that reflects genetic distance between individuals, or, alternatively, interactions guided by a functional distance between individuals, specifically, with respect to disease susceptibility. We find no relationship between contact rate of individuals and the genetic distance of their respective colonies. Interestingly, we do find a significant negative correlation between contact rate and the distance between the two colonies in susceptibility to a spectrum of parasite strains. This cannot be explained by either of the a priori alternatives so we propose two further testable hypotheses to explain our results."
16217003,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Despite its effectiveness in reducing mortality, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are low, especially among low-income and minority groups; however, physician recommendation can increase screening rates. METHODS: We performed a multilevel analysis of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data linked to Medicare claims and the Area Resource File to identify determinants of racial and socioeconomic disparities in CRC screening among 9985 Medicare Parts A and B beneficiaries with a usual physician. Recent CRC screening was defined as receipt of either a home fecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy at recommended intervals. RESULTS: Unadjusted rates of screening were 48% for white and 39% for black beneficiaries (P<.001). Racial differences in CRC screening receipt were eliminated after adjustment for socioeconomic status as measured by income and education. Socioeconomic status disparities decreased but remained significant after adjustment for personal and health system factors. Awareness of CRC (adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 2.29-3.33) and having a primary care generalist (vs another specialist) as one's usual physician (adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.53) were associated with higher odds of screening, controlling for other factors. The odds of screening were also higher among those whose usual physician was rated more highly on information-giving skills. CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in CRC screening rates among Medicare beneficiaries with a usual physician are explained by differences in socioeconomic status. Beneficiaries with a primary care generalist as their usual physician had higher rates of CRC screening receipt. Increased efforts to make Medicare beneficiaries aware of the benefits of CRC screening may capitalize on the associations found in this study between CRC knowledge, physician information giving, and timely screening."
19531164,1,a,"In spite of vast global improvements in living standards, health, and well-being, the persistence of absolute poverty and its attendant maladies remains an unsettling fact of life for billions around the world and constitutes the primary cause for the failure of developing states to improve the health of their peoples. While economic development in developing countries is necessary to provide for underlying determinants of health--most prominently, poverty reduction and the building of comprehensive primary health systems--inequalities in power within the international economic order and the spread of neoliberal development policy limit the ability of developing states to develop economically and realize public goods for health. With neoliberal development policies impacting entire societies, the collective right to development, as compared with an individual rights-based approach to development, offers a framework by which to restructure this system to realize social determinants of health. The right to development, working through a vector of rights, can address social determinants of health, obligating states and the international community to support public health systems while reducing inequities in health through poverty-reducing economic growth. At an international level, where the ability of states to develop economically and to realize public goods through public health systems is constrained by international financial institutions, the implementation of the right to development enables a restructuring of international institutions and foreign-aid programs, allowing states to enter development debates with a right to cooperation from other states, not simply a cry for charity."
12822687,1,a,"Four pigeons were exposed to a token-based self-control procedure with stimulus lights serving as token reinforcers. Smaller-reinforcer choices produced one token immediately; larger-reinforcer choices produced three tokens following a delay. Each token could be exchanged for 2-s access to food during a signaled exchange period each trial. The main variables of interest were the exchange delays (delays from the choice to the exchange stimulus) and the food delays (also timed from the choice), which were varied separately and together across blocks of sessions. When exchange delays and food delays were shorter following smaller-reinforcer choices, strong preference for the smaller reinforcer was observed. When exchange delays and food delays were equal for both options, strong preference for the larger reinforcer was observed. When food delays were equal for both options but exchange delays were shorter for smaller-reinforcer choices, preference for the larger reinforcer generally was less extreme than under conditions in which both exchange and food delays were equal. When exchange delays were equal for both options but food delays were shorter for smaller-reinforcer choices, preference for the smaller reinforcer generally was less extreme than under conditions in which both exchange and food delays favored smaller-reinforcer choices. On the whole, the results were consistent with prior research on token-based self-control procedures in showing that choices are governed by reinforcer immediacy when exchange and food delays are unequal and by reinforcer amount when exchange and food delays are equal. Further, by decoupling the exchange delays from food delays, the results tentatively support a role for the exchange stimulus as a conditioned reinforcer."
29650382,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge-to-action gaps influence therapeutic decisions in atrial fibrillation (AF). Physician-related factors are common, but the least studied. We evaluated the prevalence and determinants of physician-related factors and knowledge-to-action gaps among physicians involved in the management of AF patients. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, participants from 6 South American countries recruited during an educational program answered questions regarding 16 case scenarios of patients with AF and completed experiments assessing 3 outcome measures: therapeutic inertia, herding, and errors in risk stratification knowledge translated into action (ERSKTA) based on commonly used stratification tools (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age >/=75 years (double), Diabetes mellitus, previous Stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism (double), Vascular disease, Age 65-74 years, and female gender (score of 0 for males and 1 for female) (CHA2DS2-VASc) and Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age >/=75 years, Diabetes mellitus, and previous Stroke/transient ischemic attack (double) (CHADS2)). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine factors associated with the outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 149 physicians were invited to participate, of which 88 (59.1%) completed the online assessment tool. Cardiology was the most frequent specialty (69.3%). Therapeutic inertia was present in 53 participants (60.2%), herding in 66 (75.0%), and ERSKTA in 46 (52.3%). Therapeutic inertia was inversely associated with willingness to take financial risks (odds ratio [OR] .72, 95% confidence interval [CI] .59-.89 per point in the financial risk propensity score), herding was associated with aversion to ambiguity in the medical domain (OR 5.35, 95% CI 1.40-20.46), and ERSKTA was associated with the willingness to take risks (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.15-2.50, per point in score). CONCLUSIONS: Among physicians involved in stroke prevention in AF, individual risk preferences and aversion to ambiguity lead to therapeutic inertia, herding, and errors in risk stratification and subsequent use of oral anticoagulants. Educational interventions, including formal training in risk management and decision-making are needed."
18075003,1,a,"We study the effects of several variables on the prereproductive mortality pattern in the isolated and rural population of La Alpujarra, located on the western Mediterranean coast (southeast Spain), in the first half of the 20th century. The study is a retrospective analysis from a total sample of 2,200 deliveries, 2,085 of which were born alive and 171 of which did not survive to the 20th birthday. The potential influences of birthdate of children, twinning, firstborn, parental inbreeding, and sex on Alpujarran mortality were analyzed through logistic regression. Parity, family size, and birth interval effects were estimated through the difference between observed and expected mortality rates. In every case four age groups of mortality were considered because of the large influence of child growth: neonatal (less than 1 month of life), postneonatal infant (between 1 month and 1 year old), childhood (1-5 years old), and youth (5-20 years old). The Alpujarran prereproductive mortality pattern can be summarized as the result of three main risk factors: biodemographic, biomechanical, and social and health determinants. In general, every factor showed a decreased effect as children grew. The most significant determinants were birthdate of children, which is more related to increased mother's awareness of child care than to health improvement, and family size associated with decreasing alimentary resources as the sibling number increased. Male mortality was higher than female mortality in children older than 1 year but not for infant mortality, possibly as a result of a reproductive behavior favorable to males. Although firstborn status and twinning appeared associated with high mortality, maternal age and birth interval were related to low risk, but these influences always ceased after the first month of life. Parental inbreeding did not show any effect on infant, childhood, or youth mortality."
18788702,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between the knowledge, social support, self-efficacy, appropriate environment, perceived barriers, and perceived benefits of physical activity and levels of physical activity. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A cross-sectional survey with multi-stage sampling was performed in a sample of 642 midlife women aged 40-59 years from Kalasin Province between June and July 2006. Physical activity was measured by interviewing and classified as active and inactive according to the national guidelines. They were also interviewed for general characteristics, factors of interest, and problems and needs for promoting physical activity. RESULTS: Forty seven percent of active physical activity was found in the midlife women. The women with moderate level of physical activity knowledge were more likely to be active than those with a low level of the knowledge (aOR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1, 2.6). The women who perceived high benefits of physical activity were more likely to be active than those with the moderate perceiving (aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.3, 2.4). CONCLUSION: These findings provided two determinants of the physical activity in rural midlife Thai women for planning the physical activity program."
31234807,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The connection between choice, control and health is well established in the literature on the social determinants of health, which includes choice and control of vital health and social services. However, even in the context of universal health and social care schemes, the ability to exercise choice and control can be distributed unequally. This paper uses the case of the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) to examine these issues. The NDIS is a major policy reform based on an international trend towards personalisation in social care. It aims to increase choice and control over services and supports for people who have or acquire a permanent disability, thereby boosting citizen empowerment and improving health and social outcomes. METHODS: The research is a structured review of empirical evidence on the administration and outcomes of the NDIS to identify how social factors constrain or enable the ability of individuals to exercise choice within personalised care schemes. RESULTS: We show how social determinants of health at the individual level can collide with the complexity of policy delivery systems to entrench health inequalities. CONCLUSION: Many social policy reforms internationally focus on improving empowerment through enabling choice and control. However, if administrative systems do not take account of existing structural inequities, then such schemes are likely to entrench or grow social inequality. Our research indicates that more attention must be given to the design of policy delivery systems for personalisation schemes to ensure health equity."
15326465,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the major risk factors of overweight and obesity in prepubertal children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: In all, 32 primary schools in Kiel (248 000 inhabitants), northwest Germany. SUBJECTS: A total of 2631 5-7-y-old German children and their parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight status, socio-economic status (SES), parental overweight, dietary intake, activity, inactivity and further determinants (birth weight, breast feeding, nutritional status of siblings) of the children. RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight (>/=90th BMI percentile of reference) was 9.2% in boys and 11.2% in girls, respectively. Considered univariately, family-, environment- and development-related determinants showed some relations to overweight and obesity. In multivariate analyses parental overweight, a low SES as well as a high birth weight were the strongest independent risk factors of overweight and obesity in children. Additionally, there were sex-specific risk factors: parental smoking and single households were risk factors in boys, whereas a low activity was associated with obesity in girls. Birth weight was associated with obesity, but not with overweight. The prevalence of obesity reached 29.2% in boys and 33.4% in girls with all the three main risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight families of low SES have the highest risk of overweight and obese children. Future prevention programmes must also take into account sex-specific risk factors."
18593800,1,a,"The 5-year incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its determinants, in a sample of men and women from Greece, was evaluated. From May 2001 to December 2002, 1514 men and 1528 women (>18 years old) without any clinical evidence of CVD, living in the Attica area, Greece, were enrolled in the ATTICA study. In 2006, a group of experts performed the 5-year follow-up (941 of the 3042 (31%) participants were lost to follow-up). Development of CVD (coronary heart disease, acute coronary syndromes, stroke, or other CVD) during the follow-up period was defined according to WHO-ICD-10 criteria. The 5-year incidence of CVD was 11.0% in men and 6.1% in women (p<0.001); the case fatality rate was 1.6%. Multi-adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that increased age (odds ratio per year=1.09, p=0.04), waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio=5.07, p=0.02), hypertension (odds ratio=4.53, p=0.001), diabetes (odds ratio=4.53, p=0.001) and C-reactive protein levels (odds ratio per 1 mg/dl=1.31, p=0.02) were the most significant baseline bio-clinical predictors of CVD. Furthermore, an increased education level and greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet (among 35-65-year-old individuals) were associated with a lower CVD incidence (odds ratio per 3 years of school difference=0.83, p<0.001 and odds ratio per 1/55 units in diet score=0.94, p<0.001), irrespective of various potential confounders. In conclusion, aging, central fat, hypertension and diabetes, inflammation process, low social status and abstinence from a Mediterranean diet seem to predict CVD events within a 5-year period."
14974014,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Depression is the fourth most important disease in the estimation of the burden of disease Murray 1996 and is a common problem with prevalence rates estimated to be as high as 8% in young people. Depression in young people is associated with poor academic performance, social dysfunction, substance abuse, suicide attempts, and completed suicide (NHMRC 1997). This has precipitated the development of programmes aimed at preventing the onset of depression. This review evaluates evidence for the effectiveness of these prevention programmes. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether psychological and/or educational interventions (both universal and targeted) are effective in reducing risk of depressive disorder by reducing depressive symptoms immediately after intervention or by preventing the onset of depressive disorder in children and adolescents over the next one to three years. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group trials register (August 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to December Week 3 2002), EMBASE (1980 to January Week 2 2003), PsychInfo (1886 to January Week 2 2003) and ERIC (1985 to December 2002) were searched. In addition, conference abstracts, the reference lists of included studies, and other reviews were searched and experts in the field were contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Each identified study was assessed for possible inclusion by two independent reviewers based on the methods sections. The determinants for inclusion were that the trial include a psychological and/or educational prevention programme for young people aged 5 to 19 years-old, who did not meet DSM or ICD criteria for depression and/or did not fall into the clinical range on standardised, validated, and reliable rating scales of depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The methodological quality of the included trials was assessed by two independent reviewers according to a list of pre-determined criteria, which were based on quality ratings devised by Moncrieff and colleagues (Moncrieff 2001). Outcome data was extracted and entered into Revman 4.2. Means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes and number of events for dichotomous outcomes were extracted where available. For trials where the required data were not reported or could not be calculated, further details were requested from first authors. If no further details were provided, the trial was included in the review and described, but not included in the meta-analysis. Results were presented for each type of intervention: targeted or universal interventions; and educational or psychological interventions and if data were provided, by gender. Where possible data were combined in meta-analyses to give a treatment effect across all trials. Sensitivity analysis were conducted on studies rated as ""adequate"" or ""high"" quality, that is with a score over 22, based on the scale by Moncrieff et al (Moncrieff 2001). The presence of publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. MAIN RESULTS: Studies were divided into those that compared intervention with an active comparison or placebo (i.e. a control condition that resembles the intervention being investigated but which lacks the elements thought to be active in preventing depression) and those that used a ""wait-list"" or no intervention comparison group. Only two studies fell into the former category and neither showed effectiveness although one study was inadequately powered to show a difference and in the other the ""placebo"" contained active therapeutic elements, reducing the ability to demonstrate a difference from intervention. Psychological interventions were effective compared with non-intervention immediately after the programmes were delivered with a significant reduction in scores on depression rating scales for targeted (standardised mean difference (SMD) of -0.26 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -0.40 to -0.13 ) but not universal interventions (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.48, 0.06), with a significant effect maintained on pooling data (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.36, -0.15). While small effect sizes were reported, these were associated with a significant reduction in depressive episodes. The overall risk difference after intervention translates to ""numbers needed to treat"" (NNT) of 10. The most effective study is the targeted programme by Clarke (Clarke 2001) where the initial effect size of -0.46 is associated with an initial risk difference of -0.22 and NNT 5. There was no evidence of effectiveness for educational interventions. Reports of effectiveness for boys and girls were contradictory. The quality of many studies was poor, and only two studies made allocation concealment explicit. Sensitivity analysis of only high quality studies did not alter the results significantly. The only analysis in which there was significant statistical heterogeneity was the sub-group analysis by gender where there was variability in the response to different programmes for both girls and boys. For the most part funnel plots indicate findings are robust for short term effects with no publication bias evident. There are too few studies to comment on whether there is publication bias for studies reporting long-term (12-36 month) follow-up. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Although there is insufficient evidence to warrant the introduction of depression prevention programmes currently, results to date indicate that further study would be worthwhile. There is a need to compare interventions with a placebo or some sort of active comparison so that study participants do not know whether they are in the intervention group or not, to investigate the impact of booster sessions to see if effectiveness immediately after intervention can be prolonged, ideally for a year or longer, and to consider practical implementation of prevention programmes when choosing target populations. Until now most studies have focussed on psychological interventions. The potential effectiveness of educational interventions has not been fully investigated. Given the gender differences in prevalence, and the change in these that occurs in adolescence with a disproportionate increase in prevalence rates for girls, it is likely that girls and boys will respond differently to interventions. Although differences have been reported in studies in this review the findings are contradictory and a more definitive delineation of gender specific responses to interventions would be helpful."
18385622,1,a,"AIM: The prediction of stroke outcome in the elderly can be rather difficult, due to the potential interference into disability and handicap development of several clinical modifiers, such as comorbidity, medical complications, neuropsychological impairment proper to the aging brain and social issues. These factors can strongly affect old patient response to rehabilitation and need to be taken into account, along with ageing per se, to optimize health resource efficiency for the care of disability due to stroke. In this study, we tried to identify outcome determinants of stroke rehabilitation specific for the elderly. METHODS: A total of 359 first-stroke patients aged 75 years, admitted for active rehabilitation treatment to hospital rehabilitation wards, were enrolled into a multicenter cohort (prospective) study. They all underwent a comprehensive medical rehabilitation program. We considered as primary outcomes the frequency of home discharge and the extent of functional recovery, assessed by Functional Independence Scale (FIM) and expressed as the Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score (MRFS) efficacy. Each measure of outcome was related to age, as well as other potential clinical and functional confounders, according to a multivariate model. For each dependent variable, two models were developed, using either FIM total score or FIM domains scores at admission among predictors. RESULTS: FIM total score increased from 55.8+/-24 to 75.3+/-30 (P<0.0001), with a mean MRFS efficacy of 0.33+/-0.25. Most patients (79.9%) were discharged home. Age turned out as independently and inversely related to MRFS, explaining at the most 3.6% of its variance, although FIM at admission was its most powerful predictor. Home discharge was not related to age, but to social issues, such as living in family before admission, and cognition. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that rehabilitation can be effective in elderly stroke patients, in improving function as well as in favorably affecting discharge destination. In fact, age per se predicts the outcome at a lesser extent than other clinical covariates, such as functional and cognitive status at admission and social situation."
15641886,1,a,"In the present research, the authors examined the effect of procedural fairness and rewarding leadership style on an important variable for employees: self-esteem. The authors predicted that procedural fairness would positively influence people's reported self-esteem if the leader adopted a style of rewarding behavior for a job well done. Results from a scenario experiment, a laboratory experiment, and an organizational survey indeed show that procedural fairness and rewarding leadership style interacted to influence followers' self-esteem, such that the positive relationship between procedural fairness and self-esteem was more pronounced when the leadership style was high in rewarding behavior. Implications in terms of integrating the leadership and procedural fairness literature are discussed."
19596423,0,a,"The frequency of health care use is crucial for adolescent well-being and health systems. The present study was the first to test a set of variables in a representative sample of Greek adolescents in order to identify factors that predict health care use and contribute to improving health service planning. Questionnaires were administered to a random sample of adolescents (N=1 194) aged 11-18 years and their parents (N=973) in 2003. Data from 894 participants with full data were analyzed. Parents' education, adolescents' chronic health needs, physical well-being and emotional/behavioural problems as well as parent-child relationship were independent predictors of health care use, although some factors, such as gender, age, type of residence, family affluence, social support and parental health status that previous research identified as predictors were not confirmed. Beyond the need of health care, other factors also play an important role in the utilization of health services by adolescents and their families."
17132545,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study assesses neuropsychological and psychosocial determinants of judgements of personality change (PC) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from 87 participants with TBI analysed using hierarchical binary regression. METHODS: Interview of participants assessed, injury severity (post-traumatic amnesia), degree of cognitive impairment (IQ and memory), presence of orbitofrontal and/or medial temporal damage (olfaction) and emotional reactions (anger, depression and anxiety questionnaires). Separate interview of relatives assessed their own response to the injury (emotional reactions and critical comments from the Expressed Emotion index) and their judgements of participants' behavioural change. RESULTS: As expected, memory loss and impaired olfaction predicted relatives' PC judgements. However, the most striking and novel result was that social-emotional factors (participants' and relatives' reactions) predicted PC judgements best. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the need (a) for future studies measuring social behaviours (e.g. impulsivity and emotional perception) (b) to explore the differing determinants of relatives' and participants' PC judgements and (c) to develop and to tailor clinical responses to the various psychosocial determinants of PC."
19344503,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Few research projects have analyzed how social determinants of health impact cities in North Africa. The sustained growth in these countries has nevertheless proven to exacerbate health disparities and create many social and economic inequalities. This strategic analysis examines selected social determinants of health in a major urban centre of Tunisia, identifies the most influential stakeholders able to influence equity/inequity, and reviews the accomplishments and need for action to foster health equity. METHODS: This analysis was performed through a literature review and participatory research methods that included focus groups discussions and interview with key informants. RESULTS: Access to health care, changes in lifestyles, housing issues and gender-related inequities are prime, socially-determined elements that affect health in Ariana. CONCLUSION: Recognition of emerging health issues is needed along with improved inter and intrasectoral coordination among stakeholders. The community-participatory approach used in this paper proved to be a useful scoping technique for this setting. A similar methodology could be used by other researchers as a first step toward health equity action at a city level."
17658397,1,a,"Psoriasis, a papulosquamous skin disease, was originally thought of as a disorder primarily of epidermal keratinocytes, but is now recognised as one of the commonest immune-mediated disorders. Tumour necrosis factor alpha, dendritic cells, and T-cells all contribute substantially to its pathogenesis. In early-onset psoriasis (beginning before age 40 years), carriage of HLA-Cw6 and environmental triggers, such as beta-haemolytic streptococcal infections, are major determinants of disease expression. Moreover, at least nine chromosomal psoriasis susceptibility loci have been identified. Several clinical phenotypes of psoriasis are recognised, with chronic plaque (psoriasis vulgaris) accounting for 90% of cases. Comorbidities of psoriasis are attracting interest, and include impairment of quality of life and associated depressive illness, cardiovascular disease, and a seronegative arthritis known as psoriatic arthritis. A more complete understanding of underlying pathomechanisms is leading to new treatments, which will be discussed in the second part of this Series."
18372874,1,a,"Scotland has recently embarked on a new phase of policy and infrastructure development for improving population health and reducing health inequalities that broadly conforms to the Ottawa Charter and WHO's strategic framework for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. The new phase is characterised by an integrated, cross-government approach to improving health with strengthened political and Scottish Executive leadership and investment since devolution. A comprehensive policy framework for improving young people's health and reducing inequalities has been developed across education, health, environment and social justice. It builds on an earlier phase of relative stability and continuity in the health promotion infrastructure with policy focused on CVD and cancer prevention and tackling the behavioural risk factors (smoking, alcohol, diet, physical activity) as well as sexual health and mental health and wellbeing. These national strategies are currently being implemented across Scotland. They combine promotion, prevention, treatment and protection goals and target both population-level and high-risk groups. Crosscutting government objectives and headline targets for addressing poverty, disadvantage and health inequalities now supplement the NHS health improvement targets on smoking, alcohol, physical activity, teenage pregnancy and child immunization. Within the health service, prevention efforts are largely concerned with primary care development (anticipatory care) and health system reform to maximize their impact on reducing health inequalities. Efforts to tackle the social determinants of health and reduce inequalities in health outcomes are beginning to be connected and mainstreamed across local government with Community Planning Partnerships as the main vehicle. National level mechanisms for integrated funding, planning and performance reporting to deliver shared priority outcomes have yet to be developed. The development of health improvement strategies has been founded upon a rich source of population health data to monitor changes and improvements, epidemiological studies and evaluation work. The key issues have been to find ways of intervening to accelerate the rate of improvement and to stem the growing health inequalities. A further challenge is to ensure that the lessons from reviews and evaluations of past programmes and strategies are not lost, but help to guide improvements in the complex delivery system and to inform future policy direction. Within the health service, prevention efforts are largely concerned with primary care development and health system reform. Efforts to reduce inequalities in health outcomes are beginning to be connected and mainstreamed across local government."
28241960,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is an important public health problem globally. Algorithms incorporating the assessment of clinical biomarkers together with several established traditional risk factors can help clinicians to predict CHD and support clinical decision making with respect to interventions. Decision tree (DT) is a data mining model for extracting hidden knowledge from large databases. We aimed to establish a predictive model for coronary heart disease using a decision tree algorithm. METHODS: Here we used a dataset of 2346 individuals including 1159 healthy participants and 1187 participant who had undergone coronary angiography (405 participants with negative angiography and 782 participants with positive angiography). We entered 10 variables of a total 12 variables into the DT algorithm (including age, sex, FBG, TG, hs-CRP, TC, HDL, LDL, SBP and DBP). RESULTS: Our model could identify the associated risk factors of CHD with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of 96%, 87%, 94% and respectively. Serum hs-CRP levels was at top of the tree in our model, following by FBG, gender and age. CONCLUSION: Our model appears to be an accurate, specific and sensitive model for identifying the presence of CHD, but will require validation in prospective studies."
23849293,0,a,"Closing the Gap in a Generation, the final report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) proposed that inequities in power, money and resources were responsible for much of the inequalities in health within and between countries. A toxic combination of poor policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements and bad governance led to inequalities in the conditions of daily life: the circumstances in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. Our message is that there needs to be a cross-government commitment to action on social determinants of health. With this commitment, the knowledge synthesised in our report suggests that there is much that can be done at the practical level."
21171532,0,a,"Social work practice in health is shaped by underlying paradigms.To effectively target health inequities, practitioners need to consider appropriate paradigms. In this exploration of how six health paradigms shape theory and practice, the two health paradigms that most attended to health inequalities are social determinants of health and political economy. The article undertakes a critical review of the social determinants of health paradigm and the political economy paradigm regarding how they might shape social work theory and practice targeting health inequities."
16529597,1,a,"The older population is the single largest demographic group at disproportionate risk of inadequate diet and malnutrition. Ageing is associated with a decline in a number of physiological functions that can impact nutritional status, including reduced lean body mass and a resultant decrease in basal metabolic rate, decreased gastric secretion of digestive juices and changes in the oral cavity, sensory function deficits, changes in fluid and electrolyte regulation and chronic illness. Medication, hospitalization and other social determinants also can contribute to nutritional inadequacy. The nutritional status of older people is an important determinant of quality of life, morbidity and mortality. This review critically examines the factors that contribute to the development of poor nutritional status in older people and considers the consequences of malnutrition."
16566822,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Because of the rapid aging population, the demand for residential care exceeds availability. This paper presents the results of a study that focuses on the demand of elderly people for residential care and determinants (elderly people's personal characteristics, needs and resources) that are associated with this demand. Furthermore, the accuracy of the waiting list as a reflection of this demand has been examined. METHODS: 67 elderly people waiting for admission into a home for the elderly, are subjected to semi-structured interviews. The data are analyzed by using multivariate statistics. RESULTS: Elderly people who indicate that they would refuse an offer of admission into a home for the elderly feel healthier (p = 0.02), have greater self-care agency (p = 0.02) and perceive less necessity of admission (p < 0.01), compared to those who would accept such an offer. Especially the inability to manage everyday activities and the lack of a social network are highly associated with the elderly people's demand for residential care. Furthermore, it is evident that waiting lists for homes for the elderly do not accurately reflect the demand for residential care, since 35% of the elderly people on a waiting list did not actually experience an immediate demand for residential care and stated that they would not accept an offer of admission. Quite a lot of respondents just registered out of a sense of precaution; a strategic decision dictated by current shortages in care provision and a vulnerable health status. CONCLUSION: The results contribute to the understanding of waiting lists and the demand for residential care. It became apparent that not everybody who asks for admission into a home for the elderly, really needed it. The importance of elderly people's resources like social networks and the ability to manage everyday activities in relation to the demand for care became clear. These findings are important because they indicate that resources also play a role in predicting elderly people's demand and as a result can guide the development and the (re)design of adequate health care services."
14717564,1,a,"This paper aims at articulating a conceptual framework for monitoring equity in health and healthcare. The focus is on four main questions: What is health equity? What is monitoring? What are the essential components of a system for monitoring health equity? and Why monitor health equity? Monitoring equity in health and healthcare requires comparing indicators of health and its social determinants among social groups with different levels of underlying social advantage, i.e. groups who occupy different positions in a social hierarchy. A framework is presented for formulating the key questions, defining the social groups to be compared, and selecting the health indicators and measures of disparity that are fundamental to monitoring health equity. Although monitoring health equity is a scientific endeavour, its fundamental objective is guided by values; technical challenges should be addressed as part of a broader strategy to confront the political obstacles to greater equity."
11398960,1,a,"Until there is an effective vaccine, changing sexual behavior (e.g., use of condoms or fewer partners) is still the only course of action that can slow the spread of HIV for most Africans. But exactly which factors influence behavior change and how are still debated. This article examines the notion that as the HIV/AIDS epidemic strengthens and spreads through communities in Africa, and mortality mounts, behaviors that prevent transmission should be changing. We focus on men in three countries--Uganda, Kenya, and Zambia--examining determinants of their behavior change, and analyze the relative importance of knowing someone who has died of AIDS as compared with other factors such as age, education level, knowledge of HIV/AIDS, economic status, and marital status. Data from three DHS surveys in Uganda (1995), Zambia (1996), and Kenya (1998) are fitted to a model predicting behavior change. Results from this cross-sectional, multinational study suggest that married and working men aged 20-40 are significantly more likely to have changed their behavior. Personal experience of AIDS is a significant predictor of behavior change in Uganda and Zambia, and is marginally significant in Kenya. One implication in the context of the epidemic is that behavior change is partly determined by the high level of mortality experienced by African communities. A second implication is that higher levels of disclosure, or lower levels of denial of AIDS as a cause of death, may help individuals change their behavior."
30253343,0,a,"Montana, a large and rural U.S. state, has a motor vehicle fatality rate almost double the national average. For young adults, the alcohol-related motor vehicle fatality rate in the state is almost three times the national average. Yet little research has explored the underlying reasons that young people in rural areas drink and drive. Drawing from the theory of triadic influence (TTI) and a series of qualitative focus group discussions, the current study examined how aspects of the landscape and culture of rural America promote and hinder drinking and driving among young people. In 2015 and 2016, 72 young adults (36 females) aged 18-25 years old (mean age = 20.2) participated in 11 semi-structured focus groups in 8 rural counties in Montana. Discussions were transcribed, and two reviewers independently coded text segments. Themes were identified and an inductive explanatory model was created. The results demonstrated that aspects of the social context (e.g., peer pressure and parental modeling), rural cultural values (e.g., independence, stoicism, and social cohesion), and the legal and physical environment (e.g., minimal police presence, sparse population, and no alternative transportation) promoted drinking and driving. The results also identified salient protective factors in each of these domains. Our findings demonstrate the importance of examining underlying distal determinants of drinking and driving. Furthermore, they suggest that future research and interventions should consider the complex ways in which cultural values and environmental factors intersect to shape the risky health behaviors of rural populations."
25807916,0,a,"Specialized seed predators in tropical forests may avoid seasonal food scarcity and interspecific feeding competition but may need to diversify their daily diet to limit ingestion of any given toxin. Seed predators may, therefore, adopt foraging strategies that favor dietary diversity and resource monitoring, rather than efficient energy intake, as suggested by optimal foraging theory. We tested whether fine-scale space use by a small-group-living seed predator-the bald-faced saki monkey (Pithecia irrorata)-reflected optimization of short-term foraging efficiency, maximization of daily dietary diversity, and/or responses to the threat of territorial encroachment by neighboring groups. Food patches across home ranges of five adjacent saki groups were widely spread, but areas with higher densities of stems or food species were not allocated greater feeding time. Foraging patterns-specifically, relatively long daily travel paths that bypassed available fruiting trees and relatively short feeding bouts in undepleted food patches-suggest a strategy that maximizes dietary diversification, rather than ""optimal"" foraging. Travel distance was unrelated to the proportion of seeds in the diet. Moreover, while taxonomically diverse, the daily diets of our study groups were no more species-rich than randomly derived diets based on co-occurring available food species. Sakis preferentially used overlapping areas of their HRs, within which adjacent groups shared many food trees, yet the density of food plants or food species in these areas was no greater than in other HR areas. The high likelihood of depletion by neighboring groups of otherwise enduring food sources may encourage monitoring of peripheral food patches in overlap areas, even if at the expense of immediate energy intake, suggesting that between-group competition is a key driver of fine-scale home range use in sakis."
28278009,0,a,"Despite significant health benefits of regular physical activity, over 60 percent of college women do not meet recommended physical activity guidelines to promote their health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a comprehensive construct including physical and psychosocial health functioning. The major purpose of this study was to examine the influences of individual (e.g., self-efficacy, enjoyment), social (e.g., family and friend support), and physical environmental factors (e.g., crime safety) on college women's physical activity and HRQoL. Participants were 235 (Mean age = 21.0 years) college women from a public research university located in the southwest region of the United States. They completed validated surveys assessing their perceptions of physical activity, HRQoL, and social ecological factors during the spring semester of 2012. The findings of three multiple linear regressions, entering individual factors first, followed by social and physical environmental factors, revealed that self-efficacy and crime safety were significantly related to physical activity. For HRQoL-physical functioning, significant factors were self-efficacy, enjoyment, and crime safety. Enjoyment was the only factor related to HRQoL-psychosocial functioning. These findings indicated that physical activity professionals need to foster safe environments, enhance self-efficacy, and provide enjoyable activities to promote college women's physical activity and HRQoL."
30427882,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the social, economic and demographic factors that determine low birth weight in the two Kassena Nankana districts of the Upper East region of Ghana. METHODS: Cross-sectional data was collected from January 2009 to December 2011 using the Navrongo Health and Demographic Surveillance System which monitors routine health and demographic outcomes in the study area. Data on foetal characteristics such as birth weight, and sex and maternal age, parity, maternal education, marital status, ethnicity, religious affiliation and socio-economic characteristics were collected and described. Tests of means, proportions and Chi-squares are employed in bivariate analysis, and adjusted logistic regression models fitted to control for potential confounding variables. All tests were two-sided and test of significance was set at p-value of < 0.05. RESULTS: There were 8,263 live births (44.9% females) with an overall average birth weight of 2.85 kg (2.9 kg for males and 2.8 kg for females). The average maternal age was 28 years, median parity 2, maternal literacy rate was about 70% and 83% of mothers were married. The prevalence of low birth weight was 13.8% 95%CI [13.10, 14.6] and more in female babies than in males (15.5% vs 12.2%; p<0.0001). Determinants of low birth-weight after controlling for confounding factors were sex of neonate (OR = 1.32, 95%CI [1.14,1.52]; p<0.0001), maternal age (p = 0.004), and mothers who are not married (OR = 1.44 [1.19, 1.74]; p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Female neonates in this population were likely to present with low birth weight and maternal factors such as younger age, lower socio-economic status and single parenthood were major determinants of low birth weight. Effective and adequate antenatal care should therefore target women with these risk factors."
14742058,1,a,"Medical education has historically relied on the rational choice model as a vehicle for promoting health behavior change, and has largely overlooked the powerful relationships between social class and health behaviors. The rational choice model, which assumes that people can choose to pursue behaviors that are needed for their health, has some clinical utility, especially in some circumstances, but it runs the risk of missing key sources of influence and of blaming the victim. The biopsychosocial model provides an alternative basis for teaching about health behavior change. Health behavior needs to be understood in a broad social context, in which social class is recognized as playing a large part in shaping many people's health behaviors through multiple pathways, including limited opportunities for self-fulfillment, financial constraints, health beliefs, self-efficacy, stress, and social support. In addition to highlighting the limitations of the rational choice model, we illustrate how to integrate the socio-cultural context into teaching about behavior change. Specific curricular suggestions include exercises for: (1) increasing students' awareness of their own biases regarding unhealthy behaviors and individual responsibility for change; (2) enhancing knowledge of social factors that impact health; (3) building advocacy skills; (4) learning from patients; and (5) practicing counseling skills through role-plays."
18022299,1,a,"This research explored the relationships between race/ethnicity and area factors affecting access to health care in the United States. The study represents an advance on previous research in this field because, in addition to including data on rurality, it incorporates additional contextual covariates describing aspects of health care accessibility. Individual-level data were obtained from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The county of residence reported by BRFSS respondents was used to link BRFSS data with county-level measures of health care access from the 2004 Area Resource File (ARF). Analyses of mammography were limited to women aged 40 years with known county of residence (n=91,492). Analyses of Pap testing were limited to women aged 18 years with no history of hysterectomy and known county of residence (n=97,820). In addition to individual-level covariates such as race, Hispanic ethnicity, health insurance coverage and routine physical exam in the previous year. We examined county-level covariates (residence in health professional shortage area, urban/rural continuum, racial/ethnic composition, and number of health centers/clinics, mammography screening centers, primary care physicians, and obstetrician-gynecologists per 100,000 female population or per 1000 square miles) as predictors of cancer screening. Both individual-level and contextual covariates are associated with the use of breast and cervical cancer screening. In the current study, covariates associated with health care access, such as health insurance coverage, household income, Black race, and percentage of county female population who were non-Hispanic Black, were important determinants of screening use. In multivariate analysis, we found significant interactions between individual-level covariates and contextual covariates. Among women who reside in areas with lower primary care physician supply, rural women are less likely than urban women to have had a recent Pap test. Black women were more likely than White women to have had a recent Pap test. Women with a non-rural county of residence were more likely to have had a recent mammogram than rural women. A significant interaction was also found between individual-level race and number of health centers or clinics per 100,000 population (p-value=0.0187). In counties with 2 or more health centers or clinics per 100,000 female population, Black women were more likely than White women to have had a recent mammogram. A significant interaction was also observed between the percentage of county female population who were Hispanic and the percentage who were non-Hispanic Black."
27352474,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To address the mouth as a site of structural inequalities looking through the lens of Aboriginal Australian experience. RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a critical review of published literature relevant to our objective. Criteria for selection included articles on: the social context of oral and general health inequalities for Aboriginal Australians; Aboriginal perceptions and meanings of the mouth and experiences of oral health care and the role of the current political-economic climate in promoting or compromising oral health for Aboriginal Australians. RESULTS: Evidence suggests oral health is important for Aboriginal Australians yet constrained by challenges beyond their control as individuals, including accessing dental services. Competing demands on limited budgets often led to oral health dropping off the radar unless there was an emergency. CONCLUSIONS: Structural (social, political and economic) factors often inhibited Aboriginal people making optimum health choices to prevent oral disease and access services for treatment. Factors included cost of services, limited education about oral health, intense advertising of sugary drinks and discrimination from service providers. Yet the literature indicates individuals, rather than structural factors, are held responsible and blamed for the poor state of their oral health. The current neoliberal climate focuses on individual responsibility for health and wellbeing often ignoring the social context. To avoid the mouth becoming an ongoing site for structural inequality, critically reviewing oral health policies and practices for whether they promote or compromise Aboriginal Australians' oral health is a step towards accountability-related oral health outcomes."
28818240,0,a,"Adolescence and young adulthood, a period essential for determining exposures over the life-course, is an ideal time to intervene to lower cancer risk. This demographic group can be viewed as both the target audience and generator of messages for cancer prevention, such as skin cancer, obesity-, tobacco-, and human papillomavirus-related cancers. The purpose of this paper is to encourage innovative health communications that target youth; youth behavior; and the structural, environmental, and social determinants of youth behavior as critical areas of focus for cancer prevention and disparities reduction. The authors describe the rationale, processes, products, and early impacts of an award-winning youth diabetes prevention communication campaign model (The Bigger Picture) that harnesses spoken-word messages in school-based and social media presentations. The campaign supports minority adolescent and young adult artists to create content that aligns with values held closely by youth-values likely to resonate and affect change, such as defiance against authority, inclusion, and social justice. This campaign can be leveraged to prevent obesity, which is a cancer risk factor. Then, the authors propose concrete ways that The Bigger Picture's pedagogical model could be adapted for broader cancer prevention messaging for youth of color and youth stakeholders regarding tobacco-related cancers, skin cancers, and human papillomavirus-related cancers. The goal is to demonstrate how a youth-generated and youth-targeted prevention campaign can: (1) reframe conversations about cancer prevention, (2) increase awareness that cancer prevention is about social justice and health equity, and (3) catalyze action to change social norms and confront the social and environmental drivers of cancer disparities."
17347035,1,a,"BACKGROUND: In complying with required life style changes Heart Failure (HF) patients often depend on their partners. However providing care may cause burden and affect the health of these partners. The aim of this study was to investigate determinants of caregiver burden in order to identify caregivers who are at risk. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, caregiver burden and potential determinants were measured in partners of HF patients. Demographic and clinical data were assessed in HF patients, partners completed questionnaires on caregiver burden (the Caregiver Reaction Assessment, CRA), caregiving tasks performed, physical and mental health status and quality of the marital relationship. RESULTS: In total 357 partners (75% female, mean age 67 years) participated. The physical health status of HF patients was only significantly associated with two domains of caregiver burden, 'disruption of daily schedule' (p<0.01) and 'loss of physical strength' (p<0.01). No associations were found with age, co-morbidity and LVEF. All domains of the CRA were mainly associated with the partner's own mental health (p<0.01) and with providing personal care to HF patients (p<0.01). Gender differences were only found with regard to the domain of 'feeling a lack of family support'. CONCLUSION: The assessment of caregiver burden should focus on the mental strength of partners. Furthermore when assistance in personal care is needed, additional support, either informal or professional, may be indicated."
23752449,0,a,"We aimed to compare self-reported adherence to the physical activity recommendation with accelerometry in older adults and to identify determinants of misperception. The sample included 138 adults age 65-75 yr old participating in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. Participants completed a lifestyle questionnaire and wore an accelerometer for one week. More than half (56.8%) of the participants reported to adhere to the physical activity recommendation (in 5-min bouts), however, based on accelerometry, this percentage was only 24.6%. Of those who reported to adhere, 65.3% did not do so based on accelerometry. The misperceivers were older (p < .009), more often female (p = .007), had a poorer walking performance (p = .02), reported a lower social support (p = .04), and tended to have a lower self-efficacy (p = .09) compared with those who correctly perceived their adherence to the recommendation. These results suggest that misperception of adherence to the physical activity recommendation is highly prevalent among specific subgroups of older adults."
14746119,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to examine individual determinants of use of publicly funded home-care nursing and housework assistance by Canadians 18 years and older from 1994 to 1999. Andersen and Newman's Behavioural Model of Health Services Use guided the selection of variables, analyses, and interpretation of the findings. Descriptive, correlation, and multiple logistic regression analyses were completed in each of the first 3 cross-sectional cycles of Statistics Canada's National Population Health Surveys. The determinants of use of housework assistance were older age, female, living alone, lower income, activity restriction, needing help with housework, not hospitalized in the previous year, and having at least 1 chronic condition. The determinants for home nursing tended to be the opposite of those for housework assistance. Between 1994 and 1999, use of housework assistance appeared to decrease and use of nursing services appeared to remain relatively stable. The findings underscore the need to target these 2 discrete subgroups of home-care users and ensure that funding is directed at support services as well as nursing services."
16533103,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively identify attitudinal and psychosocial determinants of early prenatal care among Black women of low socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: Focus group discussions were conducted among Black women who attended community clinics for prenatal care. RESULTS: Early initiators of prenatal care, compared with late initiators, had positive attitudes toward pregnancy, were knowledgeable about pregnancy signs/symptoms, and thought prenatal care was important. All participants indicated strong social support during pregnancy. Late initiators, particularly multiparous women, perceived clinic staff to be insensitive. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide valuable insight into overcoming barriers to early initiation of prenatal care among low SES Black women."
28406328,0,a,"Objective Previous studies have reported discrepancy effects of education and income on cardiovascular diseases. This systematic review and meta-analysis was therefore conducted which aimed to summarize effects of education and income on cardiovascular diseases. Methods Studies were identified from Medline and Scopus until July 2016. Cohorts were eligible if they assessed associations between education/income and cardiovascular diseases, had at least one outcome including coronary artery diseases, cardiovascular events, strokes and cardiovascular deaths. A multivariate meta-analysis was applied to pool risk effects of these social determinants. Results Among 72 included cohorts, 39, 19, and 14 were studied in Europe, USA, and Asia. Pooled risk ratios of low and medium versus high education were 1.36 (95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.66) and 1.21 (1.06-1.40) for coronary artery diseases, 1.50 (1.17-1.92) and 1.27 (1.09-1.48) for cardiovascular events, 1.23 (1.06-1.43) and 1.17 (1.01-1.35) for strokes, and 1.39 (1.26-1.54) and 1.21 (1.12-1.30) for cardiovascular deaths. The effects of education on all cardiovascular diseases were still present in US and Europe settings, except in Asia this was present only for cardiovascular deaths. Effects of low and medium income versus high on these corresponding cardiovascular diseases were 1.49 (1.16-1.91) and 1.27 (1.10-1.47) for coronary artery diseases, 1.17 (0.96-1.44) and 1.05 (0.98-1.13) for cardiovascular events, 1.30 (0.99-1.72) and 1.24 (1.00-1.53) for strokes, and 1.76 (1.45-2.14) and 1.34 (1.17-1.54) for cardiovascular deaths. Conclusion Social determinants are risk factors of cardiovascular diseases in developed countries, although high heterogeneity in pooling. Data in Asia countries are still needed to update pooling."
20352332,0,a,This study examines how aspects of coalition functioning predict a coalition's ability to promote high-quality implementation of evidence-based programs (EBPs). The study involved 62 Communities That Care (CTC) coalitions in Pennsylvania measured annually from 2003 to 2007. Findings indicate that the communities with higher levels of poverty and longer existing coalitions are related to lower support for high-quality EBP implementation. Several aspects of coalition functioning-including higher levels of funding; leadership strength; board efficiency; strong internal and external relationships; and fidelity to the CTC model-significantly predicted support for high-quality EBP implementation. Earlier measurements of coalition functioning (2003-2004 and 2005-2006) predicted EBP implementation (2007) more strongly than concurrent coalition assessments (2007). The discussion focuses on how coalitions and technical assistance providers can improve coalition support for the implementation of EBPs.
27933235,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Thailand's Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) has improved healthcare access and utilization since its initial introduction in 2002. However, a substantial proportion of beneficiaries has utilized care outside the UCS boundaries. Because low utilization may be an indication of a policy gap between people's health needs and the services available to them, we investigated the patterns of health-seeking behavior and their social/contextual determinants among UCS beneficiaries in the year 2013. RESULTS: The study findings from the outpatient analysis showed that the use of designated facilities for care was significantly higher in low-income, unemployed, and chronic status groups. The findings from the inpatient analysis showed that the use of designated facilities for care was significantly higher in the low-income, older, and female groups. Particularly, for the low-income group, we found that they (1) had greater health care needs, (2) received a larger number of services from designated facilities, and (3) paid the least for both inpatient and outpatient services. CONCLUSIONS: This pro-poor impact indicated that the UCS could adequately respond to beneficiaries' needs in terms of vertical equity. However, we also found that a considerable proportion of beneficiaries utilized out-of-network services, which implied a lack of universal access to policy services from a horizontal equity point of view. Thus, the policy should continue expanding and diversifying its service benefits to strengthen horizontal equity. Particularly, private sector involvement for those who are employed as well as the increased unmet health needs of those in rural areas may be important policy priorities for that. Lastly, methodological issues such as severity adjustment and a detailed categorization of health-seeking behaviors need to be further considered for a better understanding of the policy impact."
29914119,0,a,"The interoceanic highway (IOH) in Madre de Dios, Peru has driven dramatic change in the Peruvian Amazon basin. We conducted a mixed methods study to examine the impact of these changes on the subjective well-being (SWB) of four communities on the IOH. Themes that emerged qualitatively included changing health threats, environmental degradation, and the impact of increased migration. To achieve a higher level of SWB, respondents emphasized the need for higher incomes, opportunities to learn new skills, and a better education for their children. Potential threats to SWB included marital problems and poorer health. Quantitative analyses suggested that social support and a sense of security impacted reported SWB scores based on life satisfaction, and the impact of income on life satisfaction was mediated by food security. Although long-term residents felt that specific determinants of SWB had both increased (food variety, transport and access to work) and decreased (access to natural resources and hunting), the majority reported that their lives had improved overall. Health had been affected by the IOH in both negative ways (increased dengue and road accidents) and positive ways (improved access to health services). Our results suggest that the rapidly-changing communities near the IOH link well-being to health, income, community, and the environment."
31146718,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The burden of childhood and adult obesity disproportionally affects Hispanic and African-American populations in the US, and these groups as well as populations with lower income and education levels are disproportionately affected by environmental pollution. Pregnancy is a critical developmental period where maternal exposures may have significant impacts on infant and childhood growth as well as the future health of the mother. We initiated the ""Maternal And Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors (MADRES)"" cohort study to address critical gaps in understanding the increased risk for childhood obesity and maternal obesity outcomes among minority and low-income women in urban Los Angeles. METHODS: The MADRES cohort is specifically examining whether pre- and postpartum environmental exposures, in addition to exposures to psychosocial and built environment stressors, lead to excessive gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention in women and to perturbed infant growth trajectories and increased childhood obesity risk through altered psychological, behavioral and/or metabolic responses. The ongoing MADRES study is a prospective pregnancy cohort of 1000 predominantly lower-income, Hispanic women in Los Angeles, CA. Enrollment in the MADRES cohort is initiated prior to 30 weeks gestation from partner community health clinics in Los Angeles. Cohort participants are followed through their pregnancies, at birth, and during the infant's first year of life through a series of in-person visits with interviewer-administered questionnaires, anthropometric measurements and biospecimen collection as well as telephone interviews conducted with the mother. DISCUSSION: In this paper, we outline the study rationale and data collection protocol for the MADRES cohort, and we present a profile of demographic, health and exposure characteristics for 291 participants who have delivered their infants, out of 523 participants enrolled in the study from November 2015 to October 2018 from four community health clinics in Los Angeles. Results from the MADRES cohort could provide a powerful rationale for regulation of targeted chemical environmental components, better transportation and urban design policies, and clinical recommendations for stress-coping strategies and behavior to reduce lifelong obesity risk."
17855458,1,a,"This article reviews the Canadian literature on health issues for homeless/street youth couched in terms of the broad determinants of health. A description of the target population is presented, followed by a discussion of the health risks associated with living in marginal and precarious situations ;on the street'. In particular, the potential consequences of engaging in the risky and often dangerous activities (e.g. substance abuse and high-risk sex) associated with the street lifestyle are discussed. Key conclusions drawn from the relevant literature are taken into consideration in a final section that includes a discussion of the policy implications of this work."
24074213,0,a,"Food prices and food affordability are important determinants of food choices, obesity and non-communicable diseases. As governments around the world consider policies to promote the consumption of healthier foods, data on the relative price and affordability of foods, with a particular focus on the difference between 'less healthy' and 'healthy' foods and diets, are urgently needed. This paper briefly reviews past and current approaches to monitoring food prices, and identifies key issues affecting the development of practical tools and methods for food price data collection, analysis and reporting. A step-wise monitoring framework, including measurement indicators, is proposed. 'Minimal' data collection will assess the differential price of 'healthy' and 'less healthy' foods; 'expanded' monitoring will assess the differential price of 'healthy' and 'less healthy' diets; and the 'optimal' approach will also monitor food affordability, by taking into account household income. The monitoring of the price and affordability of 'healthy' and 'less healthy' foods and diets globally will provide robust data and benchmarks to inform economic and fiscal policy responses. Given the range of methodological, cultural and logistical challenges in this area, it is imperative that all aspects of the proposed monitoring framework are tested rigorously before implementation."
16629693,1,a,"Intrauterine growth retardation and preterm birth are more frequent in African-American women and women of lower socio-economic status, but the reasons for these disparities are not fully understood. The physical and social environments in which these women live may contribute to these disparities. We conducted a multilevel study to explore whether conditions of mothers' neighbourhood of residence contribute to adverse birth outcomes independent of individual-level determinants. We analysed data from 105 111 births in 1015 census tracts in Louisiana during 1997-98, merging it with data from other existing sources on neighbourhood socio-economic status, neighbourhood physical deterioration, and neighbourhood density of retail outlets selling tobacco, alcohol and foods. After controlling for individual-level sociodemographic factors, tract-level median household income was positively associated with both birthweight-for-gestational-age and gestational age at birth. Neighbourhood physical deterioration was associated with these birth outcomes in ecological analyses but only inconsistently associated with them after controlling for individual-level factors. Neither gestational age nor birthweight-for-gestational-age was associated with the neighbourhood density of alcohol outlets, tobacco outlets, fast-food restaurants or grocery supermarkets. We conclude that measures of neighbourhood economic conditions are associated with both fetal growth and the length of gestation independent of individual-level factors, but that readily available measures of neighbourhood retail outlets are not. Additional studies are needed to better understand the nature of environmental influences on birth outcomes."
20864722,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) with sexual orientation among lesbians and bisexual women and compared the predictors of HRQOL between the 2 groups. METHODS: We used multivariate logistic regression to analyze Washington State Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System population-based data (2003 to 2007) in a sample of 1496 lesbians and bisexual women and examined determinants of HRQOL among lesbians and bisexual women. RESULTS: For lesbians and bisexual women, frequent mental distress and poor general health were associated with poverty and lack of exercise; poor general health was associated with obesity and mental distress. Bisexual women showed a higher likelihood of frequent mental distress and poor general health than did lesbians. The odds of mental distress were higher for bisexual women living in urban areas as compared with nonurban areas. Lesbians had an elevated risk of poor general health and mental distress during midlife. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the standard practice of collapsing sexual minority women into a single group, lesbian and bisexual women in this study emerge as distinct groups that merit specific attention. Bisexual women are at elevated risk for poor HRQOL."
21303787,0,a,"This article explores the dearth of coverage of the social determinants of health by the Canadian mainstream media. It is argued that this neglect is primarily a reflection of political and economic societal structures that has been associated with increasing corporate control of the mainstream media. Applying a critical political economy lens, it is argued that the barriers to having the Canadian mainstream media report on the social determinants of health are so numerous that it may indeed be 'time to call it a day' in regard to having them assist in the dissemination of social determinants of health findings. Recognizing this reality should spur the development of alternative means of communicating with the public in order to develop a citizens' movement to create health-promoting public policy. Recent dissemination efforts related to the Social Determinants of Health: The Canadian Facts provide an example of how this might be accomplished."
21267367,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Only a limited proportion of patients with psychiatric disorders attend the healthcare facilities, and that too when the condition becomes severe. Treatment from unqualified medical practitioners and faith healers is a common practice, and is attributable to the delay in proper treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to understand the pathway of care adopted by psychiatric patients and its relationship with the socio-demographic determinants in the study population. The subjects were selected from urban specialty psychiatric hospitals and interviewed using a pre-tested, semi-structured interview schedule. The data was analyzed using SPSS v10.0 software. The Chi square test, T test, and Kruskall Wallis Test were used, as needed. RESULTS: A total of 295 patients (203 males) were included in this study. The majority of the patients (45%) were suffering from Bipolar affective disorders (45%), followed by schizophrenia (36%). The majority, 203 (68%), were from the rural area, with 94 patients being illiterate. The mean distance traveled for treatment was 249 km. The majority of these (69%) had first contacted faith healers and a qualified psychiatrist was the first contacted person for only 9.2% of the patients. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of psychiatric patients do not attend any health facility due to a lack of awareness about treatment services, the distance, and due to the fear of the stigma associated with treatment. The psychiatric patients first seek the help of various sources prior to attending a psychiatric health facility. The pathway adopted by these patients need to be kept in mind at the time of preparation of the mental health program."
23475806,0,a,"Healthier eating is a global challenge for chronic disease control. Food and Health Research in Europe (FAHRE) surveyed research structures and programmes in 32 countries, and reviewed research needs and gaps across nine themes. Food processing and safety research, nutrition and molecular research, and disease-based clinical research are strong; but research is weak on determinants of disease and healthier eating through policies and changing behaviours. Biomedical and commercial research for patents contrast with social research for the public interest. More funding and capacity support should go to social research in the food and health sector."
22682665,0,a,"Sleep is a biological imperative associated with cardiometabolic disease risk. As such, a thorough discussion of the sociocultural and demographic determinants of sleep is warranted, if not overdue. This paper begins with a brief review of the laboratory and epidemiologic evidence linking sleep deficiency, which includes insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality, with increased risk of chronic cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Identification of the determinants of sleep deficiency is the critical next step to understanding the role sleep plays in human variation in health and disease. Therefore, the majority of this paper describes the different biopsychosocial determinants of sleep, including age, gender, psychosocial factors (depression, stress and loneliness), socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity. In addition, because sleep duration is partly determined by behavior, it will be shaped by cultural values, beliefs and practices. Therefore, possible cultural differences that may impact sleep are discussed. If certain cultural, ethnic or social groups are more likely to experience sleep deficiency, then these differences in sleep could increase their risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Furthermore, if the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of sleep deficiency in certain populations can be identified, interventions could be developed to target these mechanisms, reduce sleep differences and potentially reduce cardiometabolic disease risk."
16848898,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Although there has been concern about the levels of carbon monoxide exposure, particularly among older people, little is known about COHb levels and their determinants in the general population. We examined these issues in a study of older British men. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 4252 men aged 60-79 years selected from one socially representative general practice in each of 24 British towns and who attended for examination between 1998 and 2000. Blood samples were measured for COHb and information on social, household and individual factors assessed by questionnaire. Analyses were based on 3603 men measured in or close to (< 10 miles) their place of residence. RESULTS: The COHb distribution was positively skewed. Geometric mean COHb level was 0.46% and the median 0.50%; 9.2% of men had a COHb level of 2.5% or more and 0.1% of subjects had a level of 7.5% or more. Factors which were independently related to mean COHb level included season (highest in autumn and winter), region (highest in Northern England), gas cooking (slight increase) and central heating (slight decrease) and active smoking, the strongest determinant. Mean COHb levels were more than ten times greater in men smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day (3.29%) compared with non-smokers (0.32%); almost all subjects with COHb levels of 2.5% and above were smokers (93%). Pipe and cigar smoking was associated with more modest increases in COHb level. Passive cigarette smoking exposure had no independent association with COHb after adjustment for other factors. Active smoking accounted for 41% of variance in COHb level and all factors together for 47%. CONCLUSION: An appreciable proportion of men have COHb levels of 2.5% or more at which symptomatic effects may occur, though very high levels are uncommon. The results confirm that smoking (particularly cigarette smoking) is the dominant influence on COHb levels."
29353889,0,a,"Infectious diseases are a major problem for developing countries. Controlling and eradicating these diseases have remained a challenge because of the multitudes of social and environmental factors involved. However, a multi-sectoral and collective effort in dealing with these diseases has been shown to result in positive outcomes. This paper looks at the current situation of Malaria in Nepal and a population that is at high risk. It explains the impact that social and environmental determinants have on this target population. This review then critically examines the various possible public health interventions that could potentially help in the control of malaria in this high risk population, drawing from evidences and experiences reported from other countries with suggestions for adapting these interventions to the Nepali environment."
16704332,1,a,"Over the past few decades, there has been increasing interest in the study of social impairment in schizophrenia. However, the concept of social functioning has been poorly defined in the literature. This article highlights the global and multi-factorial nature of social functioning and reviews the theoretical determinants of social dysfunction in schizophrenia. Emphasis is placed on outlining the social cognitive deficits that may occur. The study of social cognition appears particularly promising in elucidating our understanding of the development of social impairment in schizophrenia and has the potential to improve current psychosocial interventions. However, continued advances depend upon the existence of reliable and well-validated measures of social functioning and social cognition. A selection of measures are reviewed in this article in an attempt to highlight the importance of assessing multiple aspects of social functioning in schizophrenia and to assist researchers in the selection of appropriate measures. Future efforts should be directed towards the continued validation of social functioning and social cognitive measures and their adaptation for use in at-risk and early psychosis populations."
19938924,1,a,"Alcohol intoxication is a risk factor for being a perpetrator or victim of sexual coercion. Environmental factors (e.g., misperception of social cues), as well as dispositional factors (e.g., personality, gender), are believed to play an important role in linking alcohol consumption and sexual coercion. Sixty-three participants, chosen on the basis of being high or low on scales of hypermasculinity (men) or hyperfemininity (women), were randomly assigned to either an alcohol or nonalcohol condition. After viewing a video of an ambiguous heterosexual interaction, participants responded to questions assessing their accuracy of recall of cues from the interaction, positive bias in their recall of cues, and expectancies regarding 1) the future sexual behavior of the characters in the video and 2) their own conduct if they were in a similar situation. Alcohol was negatively related to accuracy in recall and positively related to the belief that the characters in the video would engage in sexual intercourse (both volitionally and forced). Gender was also important as women were less accurate in recalling cues and intoxicated women evinced a positive bias for cue recall. Traits of hypermasculinity and hyperfemininity were not robust predictors. Hypermasculine men did, however, endorse a substantially higher likelihood that they would have sexual intercourse if in a similar situation. Findings are placed in the context of potential preventive interventions."
26515249,0,a,"Health impact assessment (HIA) aims to incorporate people's health and wellbeing as a key feature in policy-making. Many authors believe that HIA might be systematically integrated into all decision-making processes as a way to achieve that goal. To that end, there is need to overcome a number of challenges, including the fact that Andalusia (Spain) has made HIA compulsory by law, the need for awareness of all public sectors whose decisions might have substantial impacts on health and for a methodology that would enable a comprehensive approach to health determinants and inequalities, and the training of both the public health staff and professional sectors responsible for its application. In Andalusia, a law provides mandatory and binding health impact reports for most authorisation procedures in different areas: from sectoral plans to urban planning schemes, and especially projects subject to environmental assessment. Implementation of this law has required its integration into authorisation procedures, the training of interdisciplinary working groups in public health, the preparation of technical guidelines, and the organisation of dissemination and training seminars for developers."
23296994,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: In affluent countries habitual physical activity (PA) levels are low while participation of middle-aged people in road running events is increasing. We compared PA determinants of runners aged 50+ to those of a general population sample of similar age in Switzerland. METHOD: Cross-sectional study comparing 580 road running event participants to 1,067 general population subjects. Binary logistic regression was used to predict group membership and multinomial logistic regression to describe relationships between regular PA levels, health and socio-economic status, adjusted for age, marital status and sex. RESULTS: There was better health status, higher socio-economic position, less obesity and less depression in the runners than in the general population. People in self-reported ""poor / very poor"" and ""good"" health categories were less likely than the ""excellent/very good"" category to engage in vigorous regular PA compared to moderate regular PA. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the association of PA with better health and higher socio-economic status in people aged 50+ but do not allow conclusions on causality. Further research and managerial effort should be expanded to develop programmes for the inactive population. New and existing prevention programmes should be undertaken to increase the awareness of target audiences. Popular road running events should be seen as having important public health potential and should be fostered."
19573229,1,a,"BACKGROUND: In the past decade in activities aiming at return-to-work (RTW), there has been a growing awareness to change the focus from sickness and work disability to recovery and work ability. To date, this process in occupational health care (OHC) has mainly been directed towards employees. However, within the working population there are two vulnerable groups: temporary agency workers and unemployed workers, since they have no workplace/employer to return to, when sick-listed. For this group there is a need for tailored RTW strategies and interventions. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the structured and stepwise process of development, implementation and evaluation of a theory- and practise-based participatory RTW program for temporary agency workers and unemployed workers, sick-listed due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). This program is based on the already developed and cost-effective RTW program for employees, sick-listed due to low back pain. METHODS: The Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol was used to develop a tailor-made RTW program for temporary agency workers and unemployed workers, sick-listed due to MSD. The Attitude-Social influence-self-Efficacy (ASE) model was used as a theoretical framework for determinants of behaviour regarding RTW of the sick-listed worker and development of the intervention. To ensure participation and facilitate successful adoption and implementation, important stakeholders were involved in all steps of program development and implementation. Results of semi-structured interviews and 'fine-tuning' meetings were used to design the final participatory RTW program. RESULTS: A structured stepwise RTW program was developed, aimed at making a consensus-based RTW implementation plan. The new program starts with identifying obstacles for RTW, followed by a brainstorm session in which the sick-listed worker and the labour expert of the Social Security Agency (SSA) formulate solutions/possibilities for suitable (therapeutic) work. This process is guided by an independent RTW coordinator to achieve consensus. Based on the resulting RTW implementation plan, to create an actual RTW perspective, a vocational rehabilitation agency is assigned to find a matching (therapeutic) workplace. The cost-effectiveness of this participatory RTW program will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. CONCLUSION: IM is a promising tool for the development of tailor-made OHC interventions for the vulnerable working population."
17472062,1,a,"Health is an axiological category, which does not possess measurable matter parameters. The problem of health is sometimes raised in families, social circles and institutions. Due to the fact that students of special pedagogy have contacts with school children with health deficits, they have to be fully aware of the fact how significant predicator health is in their own development. The target of this study was to show the output of the research aimed at seeking an answer to the following question: What level of knowledge about health and its determinants in their own perception is presented by the students on the grounds of the educational specialty they have chosen? The research comprised 84 students of 1st, 3rd and 5th years of the faculty of special pedagogy (different specialties) aged from 18 to 24. The research material was collected by an interview questionnaire elaborated by themselves and categorized conversation (""a ladder"") concerning three of the following basic questions: 1) the amount of general knowledge about health they possessed; 2) the amount of their knowledge of factors conditioning a human's state of health; 3) the amount of the awareness of the importance of one's care for his or her own health and for that of others. The output received in the research shows a mean degree of satisfaction of special pedagogy students with the level of their knowledge concerning health. Their statements connected with their self-assessment of that level should make one reflect upon the subject in question."
12200101,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This study examined factors that discriminate between parents who regularly inspect their children for ticks and those who do not do so. METHODS: Knowledge, cognitive and emotional attitudes, social influences, and self-efficacy expectations were assessed in 230 parents living in high endemic regions. RESULTS: Regression analysis showed that moral norms, emotional attitude, anticipated regret, role models, and stress self-efficacy were positively associated with inspection behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Health education programs not only need to stimulate parental knowledge and discuss the health effects of tick bite prevention, they also need to stress the emotional benefits of tick bite prevention for children and parents and induce positive norms toward inspecting others. Furthermore, they need to stimulate openness about inspection behaviors, since the modeling examples of partners, relatives, and grandparents and the behavior of friends discriminate between inspecting and noninspecting parents. Finally, education programs should clearly indicate how tick inspection works, how the need for it should be communicated to the children, and how to take enough time to do it."
28130026,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Sex workers are disproportionately affected by HIV compared with the general population. Most studies of HIV risk among sex workers have focused on individual-level risk factors, with few studies assessing potential structural determinants of HIV risk. In this Article, we examine whether criminal laws around sex work are associated with HIV prevalence among female sex workers. METHOD: We estimate cross-sectional, ecological regression models with data from 27 European countries on HIV prevalence among sex workers from the European Centre for Disease Control; sex-work legislation from the US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and country-specific legal documents; the rule of law and gross-domestic product per capita, adjusted for purchasing power, from the World Bank; and the prevalence of injecting drug use among sex workers. Although data from two countries include male sex workers, the numbers are so small that the findings here essentially pertain to prevalence in female sex workers. FINDINGS: Countries that have legalised some aspects of sex work (n=17) have significantly lower HIV prevalence among sex workers than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work (n=10; beta=-2.09, 95% CI -0.80 to -3.37; p=0.003), even after controlling for the level of economic development (beta=-1.86; p=0.038) and the proportion of sex workers who are injecting drug users (-1.93; p=0.026). We found that the relation between sex work policy and HIV among sex workers might be partly moderated by the effectiveness and fairness of enforcement, suggesting legalisation of some aspects of sex work could reduce HIV among sex workers to the greatest extent in countries where enforcement is fair and effective. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the legalisation of some aspects of sex work might help reduce HIV prevalence in this high-risk group, particularly in countries where the judiciary is effective and fair.

28414829,0,a,"This text looks at the difference between sociology in medicine (collaborator of health institutions) and the sociology of medicine (independent of health institutions). If consistent, sociology in medicine should become a sociology of medicine. As an example, it is shown how the study of the social determinants of health and illness begins by assuming non-problematically the ontological reality of health and illness, but ends up problematizing the very concept of health-disease, demonstrating that the study of health determinants also requires the study of the determinants of the social construction of disease. The urgent necessity of objectifying collective health itself is argued. By applying sociological tools we can examine the so-called objective factors in the determination of health and disease, the socially constructed nature of these categories of knowledge, and the struggles and power relations that determine whether or not such categories are viable."
21903277,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Social anxiety is characterized by the experience of stress, discomfort and fear in social situations, and is associated with substantial personal and societal burden. Two questionnaires exist that assess the aspects of social anxiety, i.e. social interaction anxiety (SIAS) and social phobia (SPS). There is no agreement in literature on the dimensionality of social anxiety. Further, the length of a questionnaire may negatively affect response rates and participation at follow-up occasions. AIM: To explore the structure of social anxiety in the general population, and to examine psychosocial and sociodemographic correlates. Our second aim was to construct abbreviated versions of SIAS and SPS that can be easily used and with minimal burden. METHOD: A total of 1598 adults from the general Dutch population completed a survey asking information on social anxiety, mood and demographics. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses as well as reliability analysis with item-total statistics were performed. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a 3-factor structure for social phobia, and a 2-factor structure for the SIAS, with the second factor containing both reversely scored items. The abbreviated versions of SPS (11 items) and SIAS (10 items) show excellent discriminant and construct validity (Cronbach's alpha=.90 and .92), while specificity analysis showed that gender, marital status and educational level (SIAS(10): p<.0005; SPS(11): p<.0005) are important determinants of social anxiety. CONCLUSION: In the general population, social interaction anxiety and social phobia are two aspects of a higher-order factor of social anxiety. Social anxiety is validly captured by the short versions of SPS and SIAS, reducing the questionnaire burden for participants in epidemiological and biobehavioral research."
22983810,0,a,"Socioeconomic disadvantage can be harmful for mother's health and can influence child's health long term. The aim of this study is to analyse social inequalities between pregnant women from four INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente) cohorts. The analysis included 2,607 pregnant women recruited between 2004 and 2008 from four INMA cohorts. Data on maternal characteristics were collected through two questionnaires completed in the first and third trimester of pregnancy. The relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and maternal health, dietary intake, lifestyle habits and self-care related variables was modelled using logistic regression analysis. 33.5 % of women had a university level of education and 47 % had high occupational class. Women with higher SES reported healthier habits, fewer complications during pregnancy, better weight gain control and attended more prenatal appointments than women with lower SES. The risk of sedentary behaviour and passive smoking was higher among women with a lower level of education (OR = 1.7, 95 % CI 1.3-2.2 and OR = 1.6, 95 % CI 1.2-2.3, respectively) and with less skilled occupations (OR = 1.7, 95 % CI 1.4-2.0 and OR = 1.2, 95 % CI 1.0-1.5, respectively). Although both SES indicators-occupation and education-act as social determinants of diet, occupation was a more powerful determinant than education. For other lifestyle and self-caring variables, education was a more powerful predictor than occupation. Social inequalities were observed in health, habits and self-care during pregnancy. Proper care during pregnancy requires the control of common clinical variables and the knowledge of socioeconomic conditions of the pregnant women."
20656515,0,a,"This study was conducted to investigate life satisfaction and employment status after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and to explain the associations between life satisfaction and demographic, disease-related, psychological, and personality characteristics. Subjects with SAH (n = 141) living at home 2-4 years after the SAH responded to a mailed questionnaire. Outcomes were life satisfaction, as measured with the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire 9 (LiSat-9), and employment status. Determinants in multiple regression analysis were demographic and SAH characteristics, subjective complaints (eg, mood disorder, fatigue, cognitive complaints), and personality characteristics (eg, neuroticism, passive coping style). Of the 141 subjects, 64 (46.7%) had a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of V (good outcome) at discharge. Mean subject age was 51.4 +/- 12.3 years, and mean time after SAH was 36.1 +/- 7.9 months. Of the 88 subjects who were working at the time of the SAH, 54 (61.4%) returned to work, but only 31 (35.2%) resumed their work completely. The subjects were least satisfied with their vocational situation (51.9% satisfied) and sexual life (51.7%) and were most satisfied with their relationships (75.2%-88.7%) and self-care ability (88.6%). Age (beta value = 0.17), return to work after SAH (0.19), disability at hospital discharge (0.25), worsened mood (-0.37), and passive coping (-0.25) together accounted for 47.2% of the life satisfaction scores. Our data indicate that return to work is a major issue for individuals who survive an SAH. Not returning to work, disability, depression, and passive coping are associated with reduced life satisfaction. Thus, vocational reintegration after SAH merits more attention during rehabilitation."
25079288,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The Health System Responsiveness Questionnaire is an instrument designed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000 to assess the experience of patients when interacting with the health care system. This investigation aimed to adapt a Mental Health System Responsiveness Questionnaire (MHSRQ) based on the WHO concept and evaluate its validity and reliability to the mental health care system in Iran. DESIGN: In accordance with the WHO health system responsiveness questionnaire and the findings of a qualitative study, a Farsi version of the MHSRQ was tailored to suit the mental health system in Iran. This version was tested in a cross-sectional study at nine public mental health clinics in Tehran. A sample of 500 mental health services patients was recruited and subsequently completed the questionnaire. Item missing rate was used to check the feasibility while the reliability of the scale was determined by assessing the Cronbach's alpha and item total correlations. The factor structure of the questionnaire was investigated by performing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). RESULTS: The results showed a satisfactory feasibility since the item missing value was lower than 5.2%. With the exception of access domain, reliability of different domains of the questionnaire was within a desirable range. The factor loading showed an acceptable unidimentionality of the scale despite the fact that three items related to access did not perform well. The CFA also indicated good fit indices for the model (CFI=0.99, GFI=0.97, IFI=0.99, AGFI=0.97). CONCLUSIONS: In general, the findings suggest that the Farsi version of the MHSRQ is a feasible, reliable, and valid measure of the mental health system responsiveness in Iran. Changes to the questions related to the access domain should be considered in order to improve the psychometric properties of the measure."
19514604,1,a,"INTRODUCTION: Several studies show that nursing is, by its very nature, an occupation exposed to a high degree of stress. The main aims of the present research were to analyze the presence and to identify occupational stress factors and assess stress levels among nurses in clinical/hospital settings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research was conducted as a cross-sectional study. The sample included nurses (n=205) employed in different settings, who were also control groups to each other. Expanded Nursing Stress Scale and an additional questionnaire created for the purpose of this investigation were used as research instruments. RESULTS: The results show that stressful situations, in the psychological occupational environment are the greatest stress factors regardless of the workplace: in regard to sociodemographic determinants, married nurses have significantly higher average values as compared to unmarried ones (p<0.05), and the values statistically significantly lower in nurses under 30 years of age, with less than 10 years of work experience (p<0.01). Workload is a potential stress factor from the physical environment, whereas average values of this stress factor highly statistically differ in regard to the workplace (p<0.01). Nurses working in settings without support from their superiors and engaged in inter-professional conflicts, especially between nurses and physicians, face a great problem. CONCLUSION: It is important to promote conditions of work (work space, providing new equipment), organization of work, as well as social relationships, which is in accordance with the recommendations of ICN."
20676544,0,a,"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infections have occurred for thousands of years. However, knowledge about their pathogenesis is recent. The virus is endemic in several regions around the world. In Brazil, it is present in all states at varying prevalence rates and it has been estimated that around 2.5 million Brazilians are infected. Genetic and immunological parameters of the host are the most important determinants of the clinical manifestations associated with infection. These can be divided into three categories: neoplastic, inflammatory and infectious. HTLV-associated myelopathy (HAM/TSP) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) were the first diseases to be related to this retrovirus. More recently, countless other diseases have been correlated with the virus. The objective of this review is to provide an update on epidemiological, pathophysiologic, therapeutic and, primarily, diagnostic knowledge about HTLV, in order to encourage etiologic suspicion of HTLV in all its diverse clinical manifestations, which are currently rarely associated with this agent."
31452595,0,a,"In dialogue with mainly western literature on determinants of religious mobility and the evidence on the transformative role of mass education in developing settings, we examine the relationship of educational attainment with religious reaffiliation and disaffiliation in the context of rural and small-town sub-Saharan Africa. Adapting western scholarship to the realities of that context, where most people do not complete primary school, we conceptualize both basic education and religious belonging as parts and expressions of profound societal transformations in the sub-continent. We use data from a survey of women aged 18-50 conducted in a predominantly Christian area in Mozambique to test this relationship from both the lifetime and dynamic perspectives. We find a strong positive association between educational level and the probability of church switching, with modest variations by denominational destination of and main reasons for reaffiliation. Disaffiliation is negatively related to schooling level. These findings are situated within a broader discourse on religion, development, and social change in the sub-Sahara."
11119174,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, sociodemographic determinants, and depression correlates of intimate partner abuse among an ethnically diverse population of women patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone survey in English and Spanish of a random sample of women patients aged 18 to 46 years. SETTING: Three public hospital primary care clinics (general internal medicine, family medicine, and obstetrics/gynecology) in San Francisco, Calif. PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed 734 (74%) of the 992 eligible participants. Thirty-one percent were non-Latina white, 31% African American, and 36% Latina. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using questions adapted from the Abuse Assessment Screen, we determined recent and lifetime history of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. Overall, 15% reported recent abuse by an intimate partner (in the preceding 12 months); lifetime prevalence was 51%. Recent abuse was more common among women aged 18 to 29 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 3.7), non-Latinas (adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.9), and unmarried women (adjusted OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.7). The prevalence of abuse did not differ by education, employment, or medical insurance status of the women. Compared with women with no history of abuse, a greater proportion of recently abused women reported symptoms of depression (adjusted OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.2 to 5.5). CONCLUSIONS: Because a substantial proportion of women patients in primary care settings are abused, screening for partner abuse and depression is indicated. In contrast to other studies, lower socioeconomic status was not associated with partner abuse history."
10894258,1,a,"CONTEXT: If the national health objective of reducing unintended pregnancy is to be met, a better understanding is needed of barriers to women's acquisition and use of contraceptives. METHODS: A sample of 311 Missouri women who were seeking pregnancy tests in public health department clinics in 1997 and who said their potential pregnancy was unintended were asked about potential barriers to family planning. Factors affecting contraceptive use among these women were examined by frequency of use, insurance status, education and race. RESULTS: In general, the women mostly disagreed that particular factors were potential barriers to contraceptive use. For only one item--worry over the potential side effects of the hormonal injectable contraceptive--did a majority agree or strongly agree that it was a barrier to method use in the previous six months. Women who used a contraceptive infrequently were more likely than frequent users to identify 33 factors in nine areas as being potential barriers to contraceptive use. These ranged from factors involving access to services and condom-specific issues to cost-related concerns, social norms, pregnancy denial, embarrassment over discussing or obtaining birth control, worry about side effects and experience with forced sex, among others. Perceived barriers differed somewhat by insurance status in the areas of access, embarrassment, side effects and forced sex. For example, women with no insurance coverage reported a higher level of agreement that transportation problems had hindered their access to a clinic than did women with private insurance. Level of education affected agreement only in the area of side effects, with more-educated women expressing greater concern about side effects than less-educated women. The respondent's race affected agreement in six areas: access, social norms, pregnancy denial, embarrassment, forced sex and other miscellaneous concerns, such as condom use and relationship issues. CONCLUSION: Better education and improved access to and delivery of services might address several factors affecting contraceptive use that are associated with unintended pregnancy. Some barriers, however, such as those related to self-efficacy, self-esteem and fatalistic attitudes about pregnancy, would be much harder for family planning providers to resolve."
26354215,0,a,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Inequity in the use of health care services is an important factor affecting the maternal and child survival. In southern Odisha, India, the health indicators remained below compared to the State and national average. This study identifies various equity issues at individual and community levels that influence women's choice affecting the utilization of maternal health services in a district in southern Odisha. METHODS: A qualitative study was carried out in Gajam district, rural region of south Odisha. Ten in-depth interviews were carried out till data saturation with women having less than one year child and 10 focus group discussions with the average eight women in each group having less than five year old child, community and health care providers separately. A total of 120 respondents were included in the study using in-depth interview and focus group discussions. RESULTS: The important determinants in utilization of health care services by women emerging from the study were transportation and financial constraints. In addition, it was found that divergent aetiological concepts and low perceived hospital benefits of the women and community were equally important determinants. Further, community had different perceptions and interpretations of danger signs influencing the risk approach and health care seeking behaviour. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that to increase the utilization of health care services, the grass root health workers should be made aware of specific social determinants of risk, perceptions and preferences. m0 ore attention should be given to the transportation system, and its operational feasibility. The husband of the women and the elders of the family should be considered as an important unit of interjection. A more individualized antenatal consultation could be provided by taking into account women's perception of risk and their explanatory models."
31235080,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a serious health problem and is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to determine the status of these two diseases in the rural population of Kurdistan province, west of Iran. METHODS: In this cross sectional study, 10,496 villagers of Kurdistan province during the period from March 2011 to February 2017 were selected through randomized systematic sampling. Required information was collected using pre-made check list and the examinations were performed. The data were analyzed with SPSS v22 software using chi-square test. RESULTS: In the present study, the mean age of the population was 46.0+/-14.13y/o and 49.2% people were male and 50.8% were female. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 22.1% and for type 2 diabetes the prevalence was 19.6%. Hypertension was significantly higher in women (p<0.001). There was a significant difference between the two sexes in terms of waist circumference, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. There was a significant difference between age groups with hypertension, waist circumference, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome (p<0.001) and a significant relationship between educational status with hypertention, waist circumference, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome (p<0.001). The results also showed that the relationships between age group and gender with BMI was significant (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of diabetes in the rural population of Kordestan province is moderate but it has a high prevalence in metabolic syndrome. Educational and healthcare interventions seem to be necessary to reduce these prevalences, especially among women and in older ages."
12800890,1,a,"The authors examine the prevalence and patterns of perceived discrimination in the U.S. health care system and examine social status variables as determinants, using data from the Commonwealth Fund's Minority Health Survey. The primary social status groups of interest are age, race, ethnicity, social class, sex, and health status. Each social status category placed respondents at greater risk of perceiving discrimination based on the corresponding source of discrimination. That is, younger respondents were more likely to perceive age discrimination than were older respondents. African Americans and Hispanics perceived more race discrimination than whites. Low-income individuals experienced class discrimination, women experienced sex discrimination, and individuals who reported being in poor health were more likely to perceive discrimination based on health or disability status."
27760532,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Millions of children travel to school every day in India, yet little is known about this journey. We examined the distribution and determinants of school travel in Hyderabad, India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design. School travel questionnaires were used to collect data from children aged 11-14 years, attending private, semi-private and government funded schools in Hyderabad. We used Google Earth to estimate the distance from home to school for each child and modelled the relationship between distance to school and mode of travel, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Forty five of the 48 eligible schools that were selected agreed to participate, providing a total sample of 5842 children. The response rate was 99 %. Most children walked (57 %) or cycled (6 %) to school but 36 % used motorised transport (mostly bus). The proportion using motorised transport was higher in children attending private schools (41 %) than in those attending government schools (24 %). Most (90 %) children lived within 5km of school and 36 % lived within 1km. Greater distance to school was strongly associated with the use of motorised transport. Children living close to school were much more likely to walk or cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Most children in Hyderabad walk (57 %) or cycle (6 %) to school. If these levels are to be maintained, there is an urgent need to ensure that walking and cycling are safe and pleasant. Social policies that decrease distances to school could have a large impact on road traffic injuries, air pollution, and physical activity levels."
31574897,0,a,"This study was designed to examine national trends and evaluate social determinants of health that were associated with the provision of dental services in emergency rooms in the United States between 2007 and 2014. A pooled cross-sectional database of emergency department (ED) visits combined the 2007-2014 waves of the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. A total of 3,761,958 ED visits with dental conditions were extracted and the principal diagnosis was identified. A series of modified Poisson regression models were used to assess the relationship between patient sociodemographic factors and hospital characteristics, and the likelihood of visiting the ED for a nontraumatic dental reason. Unadjusted descriptive results indicated that there was no apparent increase in the percentage of patients who visited an ED with nontraumatic dental conditions (NTDCs) between 2007 and 2014. The greatest users of EDs for NTDCs were among those who were uninsured and Medicaid beneficiaries relative to persons privately insured. ED visitors were more likely to reside in lower socioeconomic areas (when compared with visitors in the top quartile of the income distribution). Patients in all other age groups were more likely to seek care in an ED for NTDCs relative to those 65 years of age or older. Multiple strategies are required to reduce the use of EDs for routine dental care. This approach will require an interprofessional dialogue and solutions that reduce barriers to receiving dental care."
17371603,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Subjective risk factor perception is an important component of the motivation to change unhealthy life styles. While prior studies assessed cardiovascular risk factor knowledge, little is known about determinants of the individual perception of stroke risk. METHODS: Survey by mailed questionnaire among 1483 participants of a prior public stroke campaign in Germany. Participants had been informed about their individual stroke risk based on the Framingham stroke risk score. Stroke risk factor knowledge, perception of lifetime stroke risk and risk factor status were included in the questionnaire, and the determinants of good risk factor knowledge and high stroke risk perception were identified using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Overall stroke risk factor knowledge was good with 67-96% of the participants recognizing established risk factors. The two exceptions were diabetes (recognized by 49%) and myocardial infarction (57%). Knowledge of a specific factor was superior among those affected by it. 13% of all participants considered themselves of having a high stroke risk, 55% indicated a moderate risk. All major risk factors contributed significantly to the perception of being at high stroke risk, but the effects of age, sex and education were non-significant. Poor self-rated health was additionally associated with high individual stroke risk perception. CONCLUSION: Stroke risk factor knowledge was high in this study. The self perception of an increased stroke risk was associated with established risk factors as well as low perception of general health."
11971047,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the quality of life in patients with cervical dystonia, although pain and depression are relatively common. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that an individual's ability to cope with the disease will modify the association of intrinsic, extrinsic, and disease related factors with quality of life. METHODS: Patients with cervical dystonia diagnosed by a movement disorder specialist were recruited from seven European countries. Data on quality of life (SF-36), measures of coping, and intrinsic, extrinsic, and disease related factors were collected by a self completed postal questionnaire. RESULTS: 289 patients (101 men and 188 women), mean age 55 years, completed the questionnaire. Both physical and mental quality of life scores were predicted by self esteem and self deprecation, educational level, employment status, social support, response to botulinum toxin, disease severity, social participation, stigma, acceptance of illness, anxiety, and depression. In multivariable analyses, the strongest predictors were anxiety and depression. Severe depression was associated with a 19.1 point decrement in the physical summary score (95% confidence interval, -31.7 to -6.6; p = 0.003); however, disease duration and severity remained predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Care for patients with cervical dystonia must not only focus on reducing the severity of the dystonia but also on the psychological wellbeing of the patient. Interventions aimed at treating depression or anxiety, especially of a cognitive nature, may have a large impact on improving quality of life."
29851971,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The relative influence of prematurity vs. maternal social factors (socioeconomic status and education level) on academic performance has rarely been examined. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of prematurity and maternal social factors on academic performance from 3rd through 8th grade. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants born in 1998 at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The study sample included 58 extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, 23<28 weeks), 171 preterm (>/=28<34 weeks), 228 late preterm (>/=34<37 weeks), and 967 term ((>/=37<42 weeks) infants. Neonatal and maternal variables were collected including maternal insurance status (proxy measure for socioeconomic status) and education level. The primary outcomes were literacy and mathematics achievement-test scores from 3rd through 8th grade. Linear mixed models were used to identify significant predictors of academic performance. All two-way interactions between grade level, gestational-age (GA) groups, and social factors were tested for statistical significance. RESULTS: Prematurity, social factors, gender, race, gravidity, and Apgar score at one minute were critical determinants of academic performance. Favorable social factors were associated with a significant increase in both literacy and mathematic scores, while prematurity was associated with a significant decrease in mathematic scores. Examination of GA categories and social factors interaction suggested that the impact of social factors on test scores was similar for all GA groups. Furthermore, the impact of social factors varied from grade to grade for literacy, while the influence of either GA groups or social factors was constant across grades for mathematics. For example, an ELGAN with favorable social factors had a predicted literacy score 104.1 (P <.001), 98.2 (P <.001), and 76.4 (P <.01) points higher than an otherwise similar disadvantaged term infant at grades 3, 5, and 8, respectively. The difference in their predicted mathematic scores was 33.4 points for all grades (P <.05). CONCLUSION: While there were significant deficits in academic performance for ELGANs compared to PT, LPT, and term infants, the deficit could be offset by higher SES and better-educated mothers. These favorable social factors were critical to a child's academic achievement. The role of socioeconomic factors should be incorporated in discussions on outcome with families of preterm infants."
12573077,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: With the aim of diagnosing the nutritional status and nutritional social-economic determinants in children aged 0-59 months, 2194 children were studied in the three Health Districts of the city of Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained through a random sampling survey performed in the city's vaccination centres. Variables collected were maternal schooling, family income, dwelling's connection to safe water, dwelling's sewage connection, birthweight and the anthropometric indicators height/age (H/A; for stunting), weight/height (W/H; for wasting) and weight/age (W/A; for underweight). Undernutrition risk factors were identified with the help of logistic regression models for the age ranges 0-12 and 13-36 months. RESULTS: Stunting and underweight levels were found to be above those of the NCHS reference, although, in general, at levels better than those frequently found in Third World countries. Low birthweight prevalence in the city was 9%, also above common levels in more developed countries. Undernutrition risks were, in general, higher for the younger age range. The variables family income, maternal schooling, water connection and birthweight could be characterized as important undernutrition risk factors, being most noticeable the effects of family income and birthweight both for the '0-12 months' and for the 'above 13 months' age ranges. CONCLUSIONS: Although the city's problems are mostly concentrated on chronic undernutrition, more attention should be given to children's birthweight deficits, which appear to have effects on children's growth that extend for years after birth."
11866324,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Recent major epidemiological studies have adopted increasingly multidimensional approaches to assessment. Several of these have included some assessment of perceived need for mental health care. The Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, conducted in 1997, included a particularly detailed examination of this construct, with an instrument with demonstrated reliability and validity. METHODS: A clustered probability sample of 10641 Australians responded to the field questionnaire for this survey, including questions on perceived need either where there had been service utilization, or where a disorder was detected by administration of sections of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The confidentialized unit record file generated from the survey was analysed for determinants of perceived need. RESULTS: Perceived need is increased in females, in people in the middle years of adulthood, and in those who have affective disorders or co-morbidity. Effects of diagnosis and disability can account for most of the differences in gender specific rates. With correction for these effects through regression, there is less perceived need for social interventions and possibly more for counselling in females; disability is confirmed as strongly positively associated with perceived need, as are the presence of affective disorders or co-morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study underscore the imperative for mental health services to be attentive and responsive to consumer perceived need. The substantial majority of people who are significantly disabled by mental health problems are among those who see themselves as having such needs."
19766946,1,a,"PURPOSE: To empirically quantify the role of peer social networks in explaining smoking behavior among adolescents. We follow adolescents over time to examine whether the role of adolescent peers persists in affecting individual behaviors as adolescents transition into adulthood. METHODS: Using longitudinal data of a nationally representative sample of adolescents we use a multivariate structural model with school-level fixed effects to account for the problems of contextual effects, correlated effects, and peer selections to purge the potential biases from the estimates of peer influence. Our peer group measures are drawn not only from the nomination of close friends but also from classmates. Smoking prevalence among the peer groups were constructed using the peers' own reports of their cigarette consumption. RESULTS: Controlling for parent level characteristics and other demographic parameters, we find that a 10% increase in the proportion of classmates who smoke will increase the likelihood of smoking by more than 3%. Also, an increase in smoking rates among an individual's close friends by 10% will increase the likelihood of smoking by 5%. We find evidence to show that the influence of close friends from adolescence years continue to have an impact on smoking propensities even when a transition into adulthood is made. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the literature reporting that peer effects are important determinants of smoking even after controlling for potential biases in the data and that these effects persist into adulthood. Effective policy aimed at reducing smoking rates among adolescents would consider these long-lasting peer effects."
10741579,1,a,"To identify the determinants of self-medication and antibiotics abuse by parents treating their children aged between 2 and 18 over the previous year, an investigation was conducted in Hefei City, China in April, 1995. A total of 1596 students from a kindergarten, a primary school and a high school were included in the study, and 1459 completed questionnaires were collected (the response rate: 91.4%). The results showed the rate of parental self-medication for their children in the sample was 59.4%. It increased with children's age; about 51% of children had received parental self-medication on six or more occasions during the 1-year period and 32.8% on four to five occasions; there were associations between parental self-prescribers and sources of medicine and severity of disease. The rate of antibiotics abuse was 35.7%. Logistic regression analysis showed that there were significant associations between self-medication and payment of the mother's medical fees by employers, severity of diseases as well as the mother's educational level."
20576004,0,a,"The objective of this study was to analyse interventions for the prevention of overweight and obesity in children under 5 years of age. We carried out a systematic review focusing exclusively on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources include Medline, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINHAL, PsychInfo and Web of Science. Data were extracted from seventeen articles describing seven RCTs identified through electronic search, screening of references in systematic reviews, own files and contact with authors. RCTs were assessed with the Jadad scale. Four trials were carried out in preschool settings, one with an exclusive educational component, two with an exclusive physical activity component and one with both. Two trials were family-based, with education and counselling for parents and children. The remaining trial was carried out in maternity hospitals, with a training intervention on breastfeeding. None of the interventions had an effect in preventing overweight and obesity. The failure to show an effect may be due to the choice of outcomes, the quality of the RCTs, the suboptimal implementation of the interventions, the lack of focus on social and environmental determinants. More rigorous research is needed on interventions and on social and environmental factors that could impact on lifestyle."
30497509,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Adolescence is the period between 10 and 19 years with peculiar physical, social, psychological and reproductive health characteristics. Rates of adolescent pregnancy are increasing in developing countries, with higher occurrences of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. The few studies conducted on adolescent pregnancy in Africa present inconsistent and inconclusive findings on the distribution of the problems. Also, there was no meta-analysis study conducted in this area in Africa. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the prevalence and sociodemographic determinant factors of adolescent pregnancy using the available published and unpublished studies carried out in African countries. Also, subgroup analysis was conducted by different demographic, geopolitical and administrative regions. METHODS: This study used a systematic review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies in Africa. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was strictly followed. All studies in MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and African Journals Online databases were searched using relevant search terms. Data were extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool for prevalence studies. STATA 14 software was used to perform the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity and publication bias was assessed using the I(2) statistics and Egger's test, respectively. Forest plots were used to present the pooled prevalence and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of meta-analysis using the random effect model. RESULT: This review included 52 studies, 254,350 study participants. A total of 24 countries from East, West, Central, North and Southern African sub-regions were included. The overall pooled prevalence of adolescent pregnancy in Africa was 18.8% (95%CI: 16.7, 20.9) and 19.3% (95%CI, 16.9, 21.6) in the Sub-Saharan African region. The prevalence was highest in East Africa (21.5%) and lowest in Northern Africa (9.2%). Factors associated with adolescent pregnancy include rural residence (OR: 2.04), ever married (OR: 20.67), not attending school (OR: 2.49), no maternal education (OR: 1.88), no father's education (OR: 1.65), and lack of parent to adolescent communication on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues (OR: 2.88). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, nearly one-fifth of adolescents become pregnant in Africa. Several sociodemographic factors like residence, marital status, educational status of adolescents, their mother's and father's, and parent to adolescent SRH communication were associated with adolescent pregnancy. Interventions that target these factors are important in reducing adolescent pregnancy."
12191540,1,a,"An explanatory framework, referred to as the attitude/social influence/self-efficacy-model (ASE-model), was utilised to explain future self-reported adherence of adolescents to daily inhaled prophylactic asthma medication. The objective was to investigate the long-term influence of these earlier reported cognitive variables and other psychological and medical determinants on self-reported adherence 1 year later. Data were collected, via a questionnaire, from 86 adolescents with asthma (aged 11 through 18 years) recruited from outpatient clinics. Adherence was assessed by asking the patients to give themselves a report mark for adherence. The results of the multiple regression analyses showed that the three major ASE-variables were predictors of self-reported adherence to a moderate degree (R(2)=0.21). Previous self-reported adherence was found to be the best predictor of self-reported adherence to prophylactic asthma medication 1 year later (R(2)=0.45). The results of this study could be useful in the development of interventions to enhance adherence to asthma medication. In future, such interventions should focus on feelings of shame about having asthma and promoting healthy habits, such as adherence to medication."
24101166,0,a,"BACKGROUND: As mortality is more and more concentrated at old age, it becomes critical to identify the determinants of old age mortality. It has counter-intuitively been found that mortality rates at all ages are higher during short-term increases in economic growth. Work-stress is found to be a contributing factor to this association, but cannot explain the association for the older, retired population. METHODS: Historical figures of gross domestic product (Angus Maddison) were compared with mortality rates (Human Mortality Database) of middle aged (40-44 years) and older people (70-74 years) in 19 developed countries for the period 1950-2008. Regressions were performed on the de-trended data, accounting for autocorrelation and aggregated using random effects models. RESULTS: Most countries show pro-cyclical associations between the economy and mortality, especially with regard to male mortality rates. On average, for every 1% increase in gross domestic product, mortality increases with 0.36% for 70-year-old to 74-year-old men (p<0.001) and 0.38% for 40-year-old to 44-year-old men (p<0.001). The effect for women is 0.18% for 70-year-olds to 74-year-olds (p=0.012) and 0.15% for 40-year-olds to 44-year-olds (p=0.118). CONCLUSIONS: In developed countries, mortality rates increase during upward cycles in the economy, and decrease during downward cycles. This effect is similar for the older and middle-aged population. Traditional explanations as work-stress and traffic accidents cannot explain our findings. Lower levels of social support and informal care by the working population during good economic times can play an important role, but this remains to be formally investigated."
28079622,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors have been shown to predict a poor disease course in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but whether this applies to job stress is currently unknown. We assessed the prevalence of job stress and its correlates in a large cohort of patients with IBD. METHODS: We included all adult, professionally active patients enrolled between 2006 and 2015 in the Swiss IBD Cohort. Job stress was measured through the self-report effort-reward imbalance ratio and overcommitment (OC) to work questionnaires. We used multiple linear regressions to assess association with sociodemographic, lifestyle, psychosocial, and disease-related factors. RESULTS: Altogether 1656 patients completed the questionnaires (905 Crohn's disease and 751 ulcerative colitis/IBD unclassified). Only 91 (5.7%) of patients had an effort-reward imbalance ratio >1. Effort-reward imbalance and OC scores were higher in full-time versus part-time employees (coef = 0.050, P = 0.002; coef = 0.906, P < 0.001) and among those absent from the workplace in the previous 3 months (coef = 0.049, P = 0.010; coef = 1.062, P < 0.001). Higher OC scores were associated with sex (women vs. men: coef = 0.568, P = 0.014), being in a relationship (coef = 0.805, P = 0.001), higher level of occupation (director vs. trainee: coef = 1.447, P < 0.001), and extraintestinal manifestations (coef = 0.623, P = 0.005). Patients hospitalized in the previous 12 months had lower OC scores (coef = 0.560, P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The average level of job stress seems to be remarkably low in patients with IBD from Switzerland. The clinician should turn attention especially to women, full-time employees with a high level of education, and patients with extraintestinal manifestations to identify those with the most vulnerability to suffer from job stress."
15969760,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength and predisposition to increased risk of fracture, with consequent increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It is therefore an important public health problem. International and Canadian associations have issued clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of OP. In this study, we identified potential predictors of bone mineral density (BMD) testing and OP treatment, which include place of residence. METHODS: Our study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Quebec Health Insurance Board. The studied population consisted of all individuals 65 years and older for whom a physician claimed a consultation for a low velocity vertebral, hip, wrist, or humerus fracture in 1999 and 2000. Individuals were considered to have undergone BMD testing if there was a claim for such a procedure within two years following a fracture. They were considered to have received an OP treatment if there was at least one claim to Quebec's health insurance plan (RAMQ) for OP treatment within one year following a fracture. We performed descriptive analyses and logistic regressions by gender. Predictors included age, site of fracture, social status, comorbidity index, prior BMD testing, prior OP treatment, long-term glucocorticoid use, and physical distance to BMD device. RESULTS: The cohort, 77% of which was female, consisted of 25,852 individuals with fragility fractures. BMD testing and OP treatment rates were low and gender dependent (BMD: men 4.6%; women 13.1%; OP treatment: men 9.9%; women 29.7%). There was an obvious regional variation, particularly in BMD testing, ranging from 0 to 16%. Logistic regressions demonstrate that individuals living in long term care facilities received less BMD testing. Patients who had suffered from vertebral fractures, or who had received prior OP treatment or BMD testing, regardless of gender, subsequently received more BMD testing and OP treatments. Furthermore, increasing the distance between a patient's residence and BMD facility precluded likelihood of BMD testing. CONCLUSION: BMD testing rate was extremely low but not completely explained by reduced physical access; gender, age, social status, prior BMD testing and OP treatment were all important predictors for future BMD testing and OP treatment."
31421656,0,a,"There is disproportionate risk for violence conditioned on inequities due to race, socioeconomic status, gender, and where people live. Consequently, some communities are more vulnerable to violence and its repercussions than other communities. This study aims to share indicators that might be useful for violence prevention researchers interested in measuring structural or social determinants that position communities for differential risk of experiencing violence. An existing database of indicators identified in a previous review was reassessed for measures of factors that shape community structures and conditions, which place people at risk for violence. Indicators of 86 community constructs are reported. These indicators may help to advance the field by offering innovative metrics that can be used to investigate further the structural and social determinants that serve as root causes of inequities in violence risk."
12511058,1,a,"The current highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), i.e., triple combination treatment including a protease inhibitor, allows for long-term suppression of HIV-replication. The intake guidelines, however, are very strict and, like many other HIV positive patients, drug users have problems in achieving good therapy compliance. As a result, the effectiveness of the medication therapy is seriously jeopardized. This qualitative study, involving in-depth interviews with 27 ""hard drug"" users in Amsterdam, seeks to provide better insights into the extent of adherence to HAART. In addition, factors that impede or facilitate adherence have been listed in order to develop and improve strategies. The study shows that almost half of the ""hard drug"" users interviewed do not adhere to the therapy. A large number of determinants for adherence were identified at the level of medication, the individual, and the environment. Many of these determinants can be influenced, which means that they can provide clues for the effective implementation of measures that may enhance effectiveness of treatment."
12948575,1,a,"Over 10% of current births in all countries of the world are delivered by caesarean section. Single-dose ampicillin or cefazolin administered after cord clamping has been proven to be effective for the prevention of post-caesarean infections as indicated in many randomised trials and reviews in the Cochrane Library. This study aimed to determine three determinants of behavioural intention using the theory of planned behaviour: attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived controls. Intentions were examined for five aspects of the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, namely whether or not antibiotics were used, used in all caesarean sections, after rather than before cord clamping, whether ampicillin/cefazolin or broader-spectrum antibiotics were used, and whether single or multiple doses were given. Fifty obstetricians selected from university, regional, and general hospitals in southern Thailand, were surveyed using a questionnaire and in-depth interview. Their intentions to use a single dose and to use in all cases were low, and this was related to negative attitudes and reference groups who did not approve of the single dose. The negative attitude was based on scepticism concerning the applicability of well-equipped trials from the developed world and fear of consequences of post-caesarean infections. Norms carried over from residency training had more long-term influence in their practice than newer information from books or journals. Perceived external controls on their practice were less predictive of intentions. Intentions were only partly predictive of behaviour. Changing attitudes, introducing evidence-based information into residency training and strengthening control systems in the hospital are essential to improve intentions."
31696080,0,a,"Background: Overuse and underuse of health care services are progressively recognized in all health systems around the world. There is evidence of overuse and underuse of health care services in Iran. In this study, it was aimed to summarize the evidence of overuse and underuse of health care services in the Iranian health care system. Methods: This study will be conducted in 5 steps using a sequential explanatory multimethod design, literature review, systematic review, qualitative interview, expert panel, and policy Delphi method. This study was approved by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (ethical confirmation number: IR.TBZMED.REC.1396.908). Conclusion: There is a strong evidence of worldwide overuse and underuse of health care services. Designing context-based prevention strategies by conducting comprehensive and systematic studies will improve the appropriate use of routine services and help patients, physicians, and providers make evidence-based decisions."
21299725,0,a,"The evidence for the individual, social and economic benefits of mental health promotion is now well established. The indication is that a broader public health approach that addresses social and environmental factors related to mental health and well-being is required. Mainstream mental health services, however, continue to operate in relative isolation, allocating the greatest proportion of funding and resources to the treatment of mental illness and disorder. Relevant to health promotion, this paper explores the bidirectional link between physical and mental health and the social determinants of mental health. The growing interest in the positive aspects of health and well-being which focuses on wellness rather than illness is also discussed. One example of how mental health nurses can adopt principles of positive mental health to education, practice and research is presented. The author proposes that as the largest professional group in health care, nurses must become more actively involved in initiatives that reorientate practices and services away from an illness culture towards the adoption of wider mental health promotion principles."
19183131,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This study assesses racial/ethnic disparities in negative social consequences of drinking and alcohol dependence symptoms among white, black, and Hispanic Americans. We examine whether and how disparities relate to heavy alcohol consumption and pattern, and the extent to which social disadvantage (poverty, unfair treatment, and racial/ethnic stigma) accounts for observed disparities. METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2005 U.S. National Alcohol Survey, a nationally representative telephone-based survey of adults ages 18 and older (N = 6,919). Given large racial/ethnic differences in abstinence rates, core analyses were restricted to current drinkers (N = 4,080). Logistic regression was used to assess disparities in alcohol-related problems at 3 levels of heavy drinking, measured using a composite variable incorporating frequency of heavy episodic drinking, frequency of drunkenness, and maximum amount consumed in a single day. A mediational approach was used to assess the role of social disadvantage. RESULTS: African American and Hispanic drinkers were significantly more likely than white drinkers to report social consequences of drinking and alcohol dependence symptoms. Even after adjusting for differences in heavy drinking and demographic characteristics, disparities in problems remained. The racial/ethnic gap in alcohol problems was greatest among those reporting little or no heavy drinking, and gradually diminished to nonsignificance at the highest level of heavy drinking. Social disadvantage, particularly in the form of racial/ethnic stigma, appeared to contribute to racial/ethnic differences in problems. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in alcohol-related problems, public health efforts must do more than reduce heavy drinking. Future research should address the possibility of drink size underestimation, identify the particular types of problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities, and investigate social and cultural determinants of such problems."
26432012,0,a,"BACKGROUND: School preparedness for bioevents, such as emerging infectious diseases, bioterrorism, and pandemics, is imperative, but historically has been low. METHODS: The Missouri Association of School Nurses members were sent an online survey during the 2013-2014 school year to assess current bioevent readiness. There were 15 and 35 indicators of school disaster and bioevent preparedness, respectively. Multivariate linear regressions were conducted to delineate factors associated with higher school disaster and bioevent preparedness scores. RESULTS: In total, 133 school nurses participated, with a 33.6% response rate. On average, schools had fewer than half of the disaster or bioevent indicators. Disaster and bioevent preparedness scores ranged from 1-12.5 (mean, 6.0) and 5-25 (mean, 13.8), respectively. The least frequently reported plan components included bioterrorism-specific psychological needs addressed (1.5%, n = 2), having a foodservice biosecurity plan (8.3%, n = 11), and having a liberal sick leave policy for bioevents (22.6%, n = 30). Determinants of better bioevent preparedness include perception that the school is well prepared for a pandemic (P = .001) or natural disaster (P < .05), nurse being on the disaster planning committee (P = .001), and school being a closed point of dispensing (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Schools are underprepared for biological events and are not on track to meet state and national biological preparedness goals."
17126972,1,a,"This paper reviews the nexus between poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa using a sustainable livelihood framework. Much of the literature on HIV and AIDS has generated an almost universal consensus that the AIDS epidemic is having an immense impact on the economies of hard-hit countries, hurting not only individuals, families and firms, but also significantly slowing economic growth and worsening poverty. International evidence has concentrated on the pathways through which HIV/AIDS undermines livelihoods and raises vulnerability to future collapse of livelihoods. Yet, little attention has been paid to the role that social relations and livelihood strategies can play in bringing about risky social interaction that raises the chance of contracting HIV. Using the sustainable livelihood and social relation approaches, this article demonstrates that although AIDS is not simply a disease of the poor, determinants of the epidemic go far beyond individual volition and that some dimensions of being poor increase risk and vulnerability to HIV."
21562996,0,a,"HIV infection may result in stressful situations such as disclosure to others and could be a mediator between seropositivity status and psychiatric illness, depression, or anxiety. Several results have shown that anxiolytic use (mainly benzodiazepines [BDZ]) is highly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals, but few studies have highlighted to what extent this use could be associated with HIV disclosure. A national cross-sectional survey representative of people living with HIV and AIDS in France enrolled 2932 individuals in 102 French HIV hospital departments. Face-to-face interviews and self-administered questions collected information about patients' experience with HIV and HIV care, including use of psychotropic drugs, social support, stigma, and disclosure of HIV status. We identified factors associated with regular BDZ use (i.e., more than once a week) using a weighted logistic regression model. Regular BDZ use and anxiety symptoms were reported by 16% and 29% of the patients, respectively. After multiple adjustment for known correlates of BDZ use and anxiety symptoms, individuals who had disclosed their HIV status to relatives or friends were found to be more likely (OR [95% CI] = 1.78 [1.02-3.09]) to regularly use BDZ. These results show both to what extent disclosure to others continues to be a stressful step in the course of HIV infection and that disclosure is something that could be identified by BDZ use. They also highlight the need for appropriate case management and psychiatric care to help patients manage the consequences of disclosure."
16195472,1,a,"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of psychological distress (PD) and its determinants in under-privileged women in the outskirts of Beirut, Lebanon. A cross-sectional survey of 1,869 ever-married women aged 15-59 was carried out. PD levels were determined using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (Appendix). Health status, living conditions, social support, and physical symptoms as reported by women were recorded. Logistic regression was used to test the independent effect of each variable on PD. 46.6% of women had PD. Psychologically distressed women had more children, less education, lower income, less social support, an uncomfortable relationship with their husband, participated in the labor force and were more likely to reside in a predominantly Moslem community. Reporting a health or living problem were significant predictors of PD. The presence of limb, back and stomach pain, and headache were associated with PD. Compared to similar populations in other countries, our sample had a high prevalence of mental distress."
17721671,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Psychoeducational groups are a common component of interventions in schizophrenia. AIMS: To explore patients' views about wanted and unwanted effects of group psychoeducation. METHOD: Subjective feedback of 103 participants of a psychoeducational intervention as well as data from two specific focus groups-one with ""enthusiastic"" and one with ""critical"" participants-were analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Participants emphasized the importance of information received and of exchanging information with others suffering from the same disorder. Positive effects on coping, activation and social interaction were reported. Perceived overemphasis on illness related information produced defensive reactions, whereas the integration of quality of life topics was appreciated. A pleasant group atmosphere and clinical stability were suggested as important determinants of success. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative analyzses of participants' views help to understand the potentials of a psychoeducational intervention in schizophrenia."
30533042,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) are highly effective in managing Type 2 diabetes if taken appropriately. This study assessed adherence to OHAs among patients with Type 2 diabetes and explored factors associated with adherence behaviour. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Mixed methods were used comprising a cross-sectional study using the Arabic version of the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale followed by semi-structured interviews using the Theoretical Domain Framework to explore key determinants of adherence. RESULTS: The cross-sectional study included 395 patients of whom 40% achieved a high level of OHA adherence. Lower adherence was associated with younger age (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.084; 95% CI 1.056 to 1.112), higher numbers of non-OHAs (OR 0.848; 95% CI 0.728 to 0.986) and higher HbA1c levels (OR 0.808; 95% CI 0.691 to 0.943). Semi structured interviews based on the Theoretical Domain Framework were completed with 20 patients and identified a wide range of factors potentially associated with OHA adherence, particularly behavioural related factors (e.g. scheduling medication intake, ability to develop a habitual behaviour), social influences (e.g. acting as a role model, the effect of family support), and gaps in knowledge about diabetes and its management with OHAs. CONCLUSIONS: This unique mixed-methods study has highlighted possible reasons for the low levels of OHA adherence in this patient population. Whilst the theoretically-derived determinants of behaviour illustrate the complexities associated with OHA adherence, they also provide a robust underpinning for future intervention(s) development to improve adherence and maximise patient health outcomes."
16403215,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination rates among adults 65 years and older or less than 65 years with high risk medical conditions are still below Healthy People 2010 recommended levels of 90%. This study was designed to: 1) assess self-reported pneumococcal vaccination rates following health center level interventions to increase adult vaccination rates; and 2) determine factors associated with vaccination. METHODS: Tailored interventions to increase immunizations were implemented at two inner-city health centers. We surveyed 375 patients 50 years of age and older. Multivariate logistic regression examines the predictors of 1) self-reported pneumococcal vaccination and 2) combined self-reported influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. Both of these models were stratified by age group (50-64 years and 65 years and older). RESULTS: Pneumococcal vaccination rates were 45% by self-report, 55% by medical record review, 69% for patients 65 years old and older, 32% for patients 50-64 years; they did not differ by race. Receipt of the previous season's influenza vaccine was significantly related to pneumococcal vaccination among both younger and older patients. Receiving both the pneumococcal vaccine and the most recent influenza vaccine compared with receiving neither, among younger patients was related to unemployment, more frequent physician visits, and belief that those who do not receive the flu shot are more susceptible to the flu. For older patients, receipt of both vaccines was related to nonsmoking status, believing that friends/family think the patient should be vaccinated, seeing posters advertising flu shot clinics, and belief that those who do not receive the flu shot are more susceptible to the flu. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that improving overall pneumococcal vaccination rates among eligible adults, has the potential to eliminate racial disparities. Interventions delivering vaccination messages specific to older and younger adult groups may be the best strategy for improving adult vaccination rates."
19678974,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess anaemia prevalence and correlated social and biological determinants among pregnant women in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (oPt). DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey conducted among pregnant women attending/accessing UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) health centres in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in September and October 2006. SETTING: Fifty-five UNRWA health centres in the oPt (eighteen in the Gaza Strip and thirty-seven in the West Bank). SUBJECTS: A random sample of 1740 pregnant women. RESULTS: Overall anaemia prevalence was 38.6 % (95 % CI 36.3, 40.9 %). A substantial difference in anaemia prevalence was observed between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank (44.9 % v. 31.1 %, respectively), as well as a significant increase in anaemia prevalence in the Gaza Strip compared with an Agency-wide survey conducted in 2004 (44.9 % v. 35.7 %, respectively). Anaemia prevalence was found to increase with age, parity and trimester of gestation. CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia still appears to be a public health problem among pregnant women in spite of UNRWA interventions. The West Bank shows prevalence rates similar to those observed in neighbouring countries, while the Gaza Strip has higher rates. Prevalence rates of anaemia among pregnant Palestinian women are more than two times higher than those observed in Europe."
15259048,1,a,"We estimate the determinants of utilisation of physician and hospital services in Belgium using a one- and two-part panel count data model, and a one- and two-part pooled count data model. We conclude that the two-part panel count data model is most appropriate as it controls for unobserved heterogeneity and allows for a two-part decision-making process. The estimates of the determinants of utilisation of health care are then used to calculate indices of horizontal inequity. We find that inequity for general practitioner and hospital services is stable across time and in favour of low-income individuals, in the sense that, overall, they consume more than one would expect on the basis of their need, albeit the indices for hospital care are not significant. Horizontal equity applies to specialist care in all years, but from 1999 onwards, some evidence (although not statistically significant) of pro-rich inequity is found."
16228697,1,a,"The aim of this was to examine rates and determinants of depressive symptomatology in the immediate postpartum period among Hispanic women in the United States. A total of 3952 Hispanic women who had delivered infants (parturients) were interviewed in postpartum wards in Miami, New York City and San Francisco. Symptoms of depression were regressed onto a series of social, psychological, and socioeconomic variables. Results showed that 42.6% of participants were probable cases of depression (CES-D > or = 16). Depression was negatively associated with perceived level of social support (adjusted OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.53-0.67) and health insurance coverage (adjusted OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.95), but not with the degree of acculturation or immigration status. It was found that depressive symptoms are common among Hispanic parturients. Pregnant Hispanic women should be carefully monitored for signs of depression and appropriate preventive measures are needed."
22773486,0,a,"The objective of this study was to understand the strengths and limitations of the process of nursing work at a health center in terms of recognizing the health needs of the population. The methodological framework used was social research in the qualitative perspective, with discourse analysis based on hermeneutics-dialectics and founded on the Theory of Praxis Interpretation of Community Health Nursing. The data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews, and the working processes of the teams were examined according to the Analyzing Flowchart of the Model of a Health Care Service. In conclusion, there are limitations in the daily working process of the nursing team regarding the recognition of the health needs of the population. Coping with these needs consisted of the identification of complications, relegating the social determinants of the poor life conditions associated with the health-disease process to a secondary concern."
28664253,0,a,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pervasive disparities in T2DM among minority adults are well-documented, and scholars have recently focused on the role of social determinants of health (SDOH) in disparities. Yet, no research has summarized what is known about racial/ethnic disparities in youth-onset T2DM. This review summarizes the current literature on racial/ethnic disparities in youth-onset T2DM, discusses SDOH that are common among youth with T2DM, and introduces a conceptual model on the possible role of SDOH in youth-onset T2DM disparities. RECENT FINDINGS: Minority youth have disparities in the onset of T2DM, quality of life, and family burden. Low family income and parental education and high youth stress are common negative SDOH among families of youth with T2DM. No studies have examined the role of SDOH in racial/ethnic disparities in youth-onset T2DM. Future research should examine whether SDOH contribute to disparities in T2DM prevalence and psychosocial outcomes among minority youth."
12046994,1,a,"Whereas satisfaction is one of the most important outcomes in palliative care settings, there have been no systematic studies investigating the effects of family- and organization-related variables on family satisfaction with care. To clarify factors contributing to family satisfaction with inpatient palliative care services, a cross-sectional mailed survey was performed. A 60-item questionnaire was mailed to 1026 bereaved subjects who had lost family members at one of 37 palliative care units in Japan to evaluate their sociodemographic characteristics and satisfaction levels with care. An institution survey was performed to collect organization-related variables. Caregiver satisfaction was rated on the Satisfaction scale for Family members receiving Inpatient Palliative Care (Sat-Fam-IPC). A total of 640 responses were analysed (response rate = 62%). The responses to overall satisfaction were 'satisfied' in 41 % and 'very satisfied' in 47%. The mean total score of the Sat-Fam-IPC was 82.4 +/- 13.2 on the 0-100 scale. The mean subscale scores were: 85.8 +/- 14.5 (Nursing Care), 81.5 +/- 18.4 (Symptom Palliation), 85.0 +/- 13.8 (Facility), 83.3 +/- 16.6 (Information), 83.1 +/- 17.3 (Availability), 78.3 +/- 18.9 (Family Care), and 79.8 +/- 17.3 (Cost). Significant determinants of family satisfaction identified were: nursing system, the number of nurses at night and presence of attending medical social workers (Nursing Care), patient age and the number of physicians (Symptom Palliation), floor space per bed (Facility), duration of admission and presence of attending medical social workers (Availability), patient age, family age, gender and occupational status (Family Care), patient age and the extra charge for a private room (Cost). In conclusion, informal caregivers are generally satisfied with inpatient palliative care services provided by members of the Japanese Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Units. The levels of satisfaction are influenced by various family- and organization-related variables."
30188344,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors are key determinants of health after upper extremity injuries. However, a systematic review is needed to understand which psychosocial factors are most consistently associated with disability and how the language, conceptualization, and types of measures used to assess disability impact these associations in upper extremity injuries. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What factors are most consistently associated with disability after upper extremity injuries in adults? (2) What are the trends in types of outcome measures and conceptualization of disability in patients' upper extremity injuries? METHODS: We searched multiple electronic databases (PubMED, OVIDSP, PsycInfo, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Science) between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2016, using terms related to the ""upper extremity"", ""outcome measurement"", and ""impairment, psychological, social or symptomatic"" variables. We included all studies involving adult patients with any musculoskeletal injury and excluded those that did not use patient-reported outcome measures. We identified and screened 9339 studies. Of these, we retained 41 studies that involved conditions ranging from fractures to soft tissue injuries in various regions of the arm. We conducted quality assessment using a 10-item validated checklist and a five-tier strength of evidence assessment. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria and registered the review before performing our search (PROSPERO: CRD42017054048). None of the authors received any funding to perform this work. RESULTS: Disability after upper extremity injury was most consistently associated with depression (21 cohorts), catastrophic thinking (13 cohorts), anxiety (11 cohorts), pain self-efficacy (eight cohorts), and pain interference (seven cohorts). Social and demographic factors were also associated with disability. Measures of impairment such as ROM and injury severity were least associated with disability. There has been a gradual increase in use of region or condition-specific patient-reported outcome measures and measures of psychological, social, and symptomatic factors over a period since the introduction of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) around 2000. Approximately 17% of studies (n = 454 of 2628) had instances of unclear, conflicting, or inappropriate terminology and 11% of studies (n = 257 of 2628) involved misrepresentations of outcome measures related to disability. CONCLUSIONS: Psychologic and social factors are most consistently associated with disability than factors related to impairment. Further research involving the assessment of depression, anxiety, and coping strategies in cohorts with specific injuries may support decision-making regarding the provision of emotional support and psychologic therapies during recovery. Using the WHO ICF framework to conceptualize disability is key in increasing strength of evidence and allowing accurate comparisons of research in this field. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study."
25209450,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The number of requests to pre-hospital emergency medical services (PEMS) has increased in Europe over the last 20 years, but epidemiology of PEMS interventions has little be investigated. The aim of this analysis was to describe time trends of PEMS activity in a region of western Switzerland. METHODS: Use of data routinely and prospectively collected for PEMS intervention in the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland, from 2001 to 2010. This Swiss Canton comprises approximately 10% of the whole Swiss population. RESULTS: We observed a 40% increase in the number of requests to PEMS between 2001 and 2010. The overall rate of requests was 35/1000 inhabitants for ambulance services and 10/1000 for medical interventions (SMUR), with the highest rate among people aged >/= 80. Most frequent reasons for the intervention were related to medical problems, predominantly unconsciousness, chest pain respiratory distress, or cardiac arrest, whereas severe trauma interventions decreased over time. Overall, 89% were alive after 48 h. The survival rate after 48 h increased regularly for cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: Routine prospective data collection of prehospital emergency interventions and monitoring of activity was feasible over time. The results we found add to the understanding of determinants of PEMS use and need to be considered to plan use of emergency health services in the near future. More comprehensive analysis of the quality of services and patient safety supported by indicators are also required, which might help to develop prehospital emergency services and new processes of care."
31143637,0,a,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes, account for 72% of all global deaths, with 78% of all NCDs taking place in low- and middle-income countries. Among these four main groups of NCDs, CVDs are taking the highest death toll at 17.9 million or 44% of all NCD mortality. This paper suggests that the complex interplay of NCD risk factors and their underlying social and commercial determinants requires active cooperation with the private sector to bring about policy change, pool resources and generate innovative solutions by capitalizing on each partner's strengths. However, such partnerships can only be successful if safeguards are in place to define the rules of engagement, align incentives to achieve shared public health objectives and manage potential conflicts of interest."
10677678,1,a,"The production, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials are processes of vital economic importance for any advanced and technologically complex society. Although the production and distribution of hazardous materials is associated with economic development, there is a significant potential danger to the natural and social environment in the event of their accidental release, a fact that prompts for the development and implementation of methods and techniques that aim to improve hazardous materials risk management decisions. The objective of this paper is to present a unified framework for developing a Decision Support System (DSS) for supporting a vital function of risk management, namely the management of emergency response operations. The proposed framework recognizes the peculiarities of the hazardous materials decision-making environment which is characterized by: (i) multiple stakeholders, i.e., persons and organizations involved in and affected by hazardous materials risk management decisions; (ii) lack of a formal management structure for monitoring and controlling in a unified manner all Emergency Response Resources; (iii) lack of clear distinction and fragmentation of responsibilities of the actors involved in risk management operations; and (iv) dynamic/real-time decisions, i.e., risk determinants change over time. The proposed framework was used in order to develop a DSS for managing emergency response operations for large scale industrial accidents in Western Attica, Greece."
19288207,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Work-related health research has traditionally focused on identifying risks rather than determinants of good health. Our knowledge of variation in ill health is thus greater than our understanding of such variations in good health. PURPOSE: In this study, the associations between work-environment exposures and good health are examined. We are especially interested in contrasting our indices of ill health with a narrow measure of good health. Moreover, the salutary effect of sense of coherence (SOC) is explored, focusing particularly on its moderating role. METHOD: Data stem from the panel of Swedish level of living surveys for 1991 and 2000. The analysis is based on a sample of 2,334 employed men and women. Logistic regressions are used. RESULTS: Assessed work-environment factors are to a large extent related, in a mirrored way, to good health and ill health. The models' fit are, however, generally better for the latter. Our findings also indicate that SOC has a protective role for individuals exposed to work risks such as stress and high physical demands. CONCLUSION: To improve our understanding of what promotes good health, research needs to focus on salutary factors. One such salutary factor explored in this paper is sense of coherence."
31263589,0,a,"Background: Sub-Saharan Africa has among the highest prevalence of teenage pregnancy in the world. Teenage mothers and their children are at risk to a host of medical, social and economic challenges. Adolescent pregnancy is a significant cost to the mother and newborn child, and also to their family and the wider society. Despite measures taken by some sub-Saharan nations to tackle the issue of adolescent pregnancy, the phenomenon remains a public health concern that is widespread throughout the region. Currently, there are few studies that examine the predictors of teenage pregnancy in the sub-Saharan region. The objective of the present study was to systematically review predictors of pregnancy among young people in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: A literature search was conducted using Medline, CINAHL and EMBASE electronic databases. Following duplicate removal, abstract and full-text screening, 15 studies were ultimately included in the final review. Narrative synthesis was used to synthesise the qualitative and quantitative findings. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses. Results: Twenty-seven predictors of teenage pregnancy were identified and grouped into six themes (Partner and peer-related predictors; Sexual health knowledge, attitude and behaviour-related predictors; Parenting and family-related predictors; Economic, environmental and cultural predictors; Personal predictors; and Quality of healthcare services predictors). The most obvious predictors included sexual coercion and pressure from male partners, low or incorrect use of contraceptives, and poor parenting or low parental communication and support. Conclusion: This review emphasises that the large prevalence of adolescent pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa is attributable to multiple predictors that our study was able to group into six themes. Policy changes and programmes must be implemented in sub-Saharan Africa to address these determinants in order to reduce adolescent pregnancy within the region."
14618606,1,a,"The clinical disciplines have witnessed a rapidly growing literature on the conceptualization and measurement of coping and on the role of coping in confronting stressful life circumstances and maintaining adaptive functioning. This literature has spawned a diversity of concepts and contrasting perspectives on the determinants and effects of coping. To address this complexity, we comment on dispositional and contextual perspectives on the coping process, describe the domains of coping styles and coping skills, and review some measures of these constructs. Next, we present a conceptual framework that integrates key aspects of these constructs and use the framework to guide a selective review of the linkages between personal and social resources, coping skills, and adaptive functioning. We then consider applications of the framework to clinical practice."
18202085,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Parenting and parent-child relationships influence children's emotional and social development and evidence exists that they may be life-course determinants of health. This study tests the hypothesis that adverse parenting in the early years predicts poor health in mid-childhood. METHODS: A prospective study using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. Health data on over 8000 children (60% of those recruited) were available for analysis at 6.9 and 7.7 years. EXPOSURES: self-reported maternal hostility, resentment and hitting/shouting in early childhood. OUTCOMES: maternal report of child's health in general and number of health problems when the child was 6.9 and 7.7 years, adjusting for socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: Sub-optimal parenting, as measured here, was observed among 62, 80 and 83% of families for hostility, resentment and hitting/shouting, respectively. Resentment was more common among older mothers in owner-occupied housing. Resentment and hostility predicted health at both ages independently of socioeconomic circumstances. 'Hitting/shouting' was weakly predictive of number of health problems. A greater proportion of variance was explained by parenting variables than by socio-economic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Parenting and parent-child relationships in the early years predict health in mid-childhood in a way consistent with a causal role. If further studies replicate this finding, policies to improve parenting could be expected to have a modest beneficial impact on health as well as emotional and social development. As some aspects of sub-optimal parenting show reverse social class distribution, initiatives targeted at those living in social deprivation may not achieve the optimum impact on health."
15098428,1,a,"Despite significant debate about the efficacy, ideology, and ethics of the method, condom social marketing (CSM) has become the dominant approach to AIDS education in many sub-Saharan African countries. However, critics have charged that social marketing (SM) distracts from the structural determinants of health-related behavior and excludes genuine community participation. This article argues that the diffusion of SM techniques in Africa is not driven by demonstrated efficacy but is attributable to the promotion of privatization and free markets in the structural adjustment era across the region. The CSM experience in a central Mozambican community reveals the dangers of using the method at the expense of community dialogue and participation to confront the AIDS epidemic. The advertising campaign developed to sell condoms has clashed with Pentecostal and Independent Churches, now a majority of the population, that have expanded rapidly across the region spreading a contrasting message about sexuality and risky behavior."
25147780,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Patients, who survived from shotgun injuries, often have some retained lead pellets in their bodies. Several cases of lead toxicity have been reported regarding these patients. OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to compare the serum lead level in patients who have retained lead pellets in their bodies with the control group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, we gathered the serum lead levels of 25 patients with some retained lead pellets in their bodies due to shotgun and 25 volunteers without similar lead exposure and compared them in view of the age, gender, and living place. RESULTS: While the mean serum lead level in both groups was lower than the standard level (i.e. 40 microg/dL) , the mean +/- SD of serum lead level were 29 +/- 12.8 microg/dL and 25.3 +/- 6.4 microg/dL in the case and control groups, respectively without any significant difference (P = 0. 30) . However, a positive relationship was seen between serum lead level, and the number of retained lead pellets (r = 0.447, P = 0. 025) . CONCLUSIONS: Although extensive surgery to remove the lead pellets is not recommended in patients injured with shotguns, those with many retained lead pellets in their bodies should be considered at risk for lead poisoning and monitored carefully."
14695364,1,a,"Utilization of health services is a complex behavioral phenomenon. Empirical studies of preventive and curative services have often found that use of health services is related to the availability, quality and cost of services, as well as to social structure, health beliefs and personal characteristics of the users. In this paper an attempt is made to examine the factors associated with the use of maternal health care services in Bangladesh on the basis of data from a survey of maternal morbidity in Bangladesh, conducted by the Bangladesh Institute of Research for Promotion of Essential and Reproductive Health and Technologies (BIRPERHT). The results from both the bivariate and multivariate analyses confirmed the importance of mother's education in explaining the utilization of health care services. Female education retains a net effect on maternal health service use, independent of other women's background characteristics, household's socioeconomic status and access to healthcare services. The strong influence of mother's education on the utilization of health care services is consistent with findings from other studies. Women whose husbands are involved in business/services also positively influenced the utilization of modern health care services. However, the study results are inconclusive with respect to the influence of other predisposing and enabling factors, such as women's age, number of previous pregnancies and access to health facilities. Multivariate logistic regression estimates do not show any significant impact of these factors on the use of maternal health care. The influence of severity of disease condition in explaining the utilization of maternal health care appears to be significant. Multivariate analysis indicate that women having had a life-threatening condition are little over two times more likely to seek care from a doctor or nurse to treat their maternal morbidities."
10686574,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the individual and social determinants of rural nurses' willingness to care for people with AIDS (PWAs). Willingness to care was viewed as a function of nurses' personal attitudes about AIDS care and PWAs; the influence of normative (significant others), comparative (the nursing profession), and generalized (the rural community) reference group norms on these attitudes; and how much importance respondents placed on membership in these reference groups. Responses to a mailed questionnaire from 615 rural nurses were analyzed. Individual determinants were nurses' feelings of preparedness and favorable attitudes about their personal safety when administering care. Social determinants were the degree of upset of respondents' significant others about their caring for AIDS patients and favorable attitudes of the respondents about professional and social concerns related to AIDS."
24057589,0,a,"Natural processes do not always function perfectly. In breastfeeding, problems are encountered in up to 80% of mother-infant dyads. Altogether, in Western societies, the difficulties reduce the breastfeeding rate within the first months drastically. To deal with the problems of breastfeeding efficiently requires a profound understanding of its physiology, as well as of its psychological and social determinants. This review focuses on the current knowledge of breastfeeding physiology, only touching the psychosocial factors, which are included in the promotion strategies. Subsequently, it scrutinizes definitions, incidences, prevention, and treatment of breastfeeding problems faced most frequently by nursing mothers and their consultants. Not all measures used in counseling mothers and not all treatments for the most common medical problems withstand a careful evaluation on the basis of current scientific data. However, applying proven prevention strategies will significantly improve the well being of mothers and their infants, and may contribute to an affective attitude that increases the success, frequency, and duration of breastfeeding."
19207602,1,a,"Healthcare policy reforms enacted through the 1990s explicitly endorsed expanded community care and enhanced equitable access to care. We examine end-of-life home-care service utilization during this time period. We are interested in trends in and predictors of utilization influencing receipt of service or total service use. This is a population-based, retrospective study of home-care utilization by adults 50 years of age and older in British Columbia, Canada, who died in the last 6 months of each year from 1991 to 2000 (n = 98,327). Data were drawn from the British Columbia Linked Health Data resource; we examined both receipt and extent of care, using logistic and standard regression models. Independent variables included year of death, age, gender, area of residence and income quintile. Year of death was not significantly associated with receipt of home care in general. However, the odds of receiving home support services declined significantly over time, while annual home support hours increased. In contrast, receipt of home nursing increased, while annual home nursing visits did not change. Social factors frequently emerged as significant predictors of both receipt and extent of care. However, we found only limited evidence for interactions between these factors and year of death acting as determinants of receipt or extent of service. Results suggest that end-of-life home care services did not expand, but instead were reallocated and intensified over the 1990s. As well, there was little evidence to suggest enhanced equity in access to care."
16910806,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Family caregivers caring for a patient with terminal cancer may experience significant psychological distress. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the family caregivers' psychological distress is influenced by the patients' performance status while taking into account individual characteristics of caregivers and their unmet needs. METHODS: Two hundred twelve family caregivers were assigned to three cohorts according to the patient's performance status, as measured by the Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group Functional Scale (ECOGS). Interview information was collected on the services and care provided, as well as on the caregivers' characteristics and level of psychological distress. RESULTS: Family caregivers' psychosocial distress is strongly associated with the patients' terminal disease progress and declined functioning. The level of psychological distress varies from 25.2 to 33.5 (p = 0.0008) between the groups. Moreover, the percentage of caregivers with a high level of psychological distress varies from 41% to 62%, while this percentage is estimated at 19.2% in general population. A high distress index was significantly associated with the caregiver's burden, the patient's young age, the patient's symptoms, the caregiver's young age and gender, a poor perception of his/her health and dissatisfaction with emotional and tangible support. CONCLUSIONS: Family caregivers of patients in the advanced stages of cancer experience a high level of psychological distress, which increases significantly as the patient loses autonomy. Health care policies and programs need to be revisited in order to take the reality of these patients and their families into account."
26891515,0,a,"Changes in lifestyles and ageing have been associated with growing rates of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (CRF). Dyslipidemia is one ofthe CRF associated with numbers of cardiovascular diseases. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the profile and degree of derangements of plasma lipids among 300 (176 females and 124 males) elderly individuals aged >/= 60 years in Morogoro, Tanzania. The calorimetric enzymatic methods and the Friedewal's equation were used for determination of cholesterols and triglycerides (TG). Social and demographic characteristics were gathered by structured questionnaires. The logistic regression models were used to identify the determinants of abnormal serum lipids level. Mean Total Cholesterols (TC) and Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterols (LDL-C) in females exceeded significantly that of males. Mean TC, LDL-C as well as TG (mg/dL) declined significantly with age while mean High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterols (HDL-C) also declined but only slightly. Elderly females were two times more likely to have elevated TC (OR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.04-4.28: P = 0.05) and LDL-C (OR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.17- 3.97: P = 0.019) and three times to have lowered HDL-C (OR = 3; 95% CI: 1.97-5.30: P < 0.001) than males. Urban residents were about two times more likely to have elevated LDL-C (OR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.04-3.25: P = 0.047) than their rural counterparts. Body Mass Index of >/= 30 kg/m2 was also associated with elevated LDL-C (OR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.05-3.42: P = 0.045) and lowered HDL-C (OR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.3-3.65: P = 0.004), respectively. The present study has established the profile and level of derangements of serum lipids among the elderly of Morogoro region in Tanzania. It appears that, female sex and BMI of >/= 30 kg/m2 are significant factors for elevated TC, LDL-C and lowered HDL-C while urban life is a significant factor for elevated LDL-C."
11035460,1,a,"The paper aims to improve our understanding about the prevalence and determinants of child abuse in rural Bangladesh. Data from the 1995 sample survey of 4643 children aged 10-15 y in 150 villages were used. Findings revealed that 21% of the children were in the labour force although the Bangladeshi laws prohibited child labour. The prevalence of child abuse and exploitation was widespread in Bangladeshi villages as 2.3% of all children were physically abused, 2% were financially exploited, 1.7% were forced to involve in inappropriate activities, and 3% were forced to work for long hours. The prevalence of physical assault was much higher among younger children although the probability of other types of abuse was higher among older children. Boys were more exposed than girls to abuse of any kind. Poverty was also significantly associated with child abuse. Multivariate analysis suggested that the out-of-school children and the children of illiterate, landless and unskilled labourers were more likely to be abused than others when age and sex of children were controlled. The paper concludes that raising public awareness against child abuse and promoting preventive measures should be adopted to reduce child abuse in Bangladesh."
11520404,1,a,"Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in industrialised societies. Its incidence is greatly increased among the socially disadvantaged, but the reasons for this excess are unclear and have been relatively unexplored. We hypothesise two distinct sets of causal pathways and mechanisms that may explain social disparities in preterm birth. The first set involves chronic and acute psychosocial stressors, psychological distress caused by those stressors, increased secretion of placental corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), changes in sexual behaviours or enhanced susceptibility to bacterial vaginosis and chorioamnionitis, cigarette smoking or cocaine use, and decidual vasculopathy. The second hypothesised pathway is a gene-environment interaction based on a highly prevalent mutation in the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), combined with low folate intake from the diet and from prenatal vitamin supplements, consequent hyperhomocysteinemia, and decidual vasculopathy. We propose to test these hypothesised pathways and mechanisms in a nested case-control study within a prospectively recruited and followed cohort of pregnant women with singleton pregnancies who deliver at one of four Montreal hospitals that serve an ethnically and socio-economically diverse population. Following recruitment during the late first or early second trimester, participating women are seen at 24-26 weeks, when a research nurse obtains a detailed medical and obstetric history; administers several scales to assess chronic and acute stressors and psychological function; obtains blood samples for CRH, red blood cell and plasma folate, homocysteine, and DNA for the MTHFR mutation; and performs a digital and speculum examination to measure cervical length and vaginal pH and to obtain swabs for bacterial vaginosis and fetal fibronectin. After delivery, each case (delivery at < 37 completed weeks following spontaneous onset of labour or prelabour rupture of membranes) and two controls are selected for placental pathological examination, hair analysis of cotinine, cocaine, and benzoylecgonine, and analysis of stored blood and vaginal specimens. Statistical analysis will be based on multiple logistic regression and structural equation modelling, with sequential construction of models of potential aetiological determinants and covariates to test the hypothesised causal pathways and mechanisms. The research we propose should improve understanding of the factors and processes that mediate social disparities in preterm birth. This improved understanding should help not only in developing strategies to reduce the disparities but also in suggesting preventive interventions applicable across the entire socio-economic spectrum."
26904512,0,a,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections. Main virulence determinants of K. pneumoniae are pili, capsular polysaccharide, lipopolysaccharide, and siderophores. The histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) is a pleiotropic regulator found in several gram-negative pathogens. It has functions both as an architectural component of the nucleoid and as a global regulator of gene expression. We generated a Deltahns mutant and evaluated the role of the H-NS nucleoid protein on the virulence features of K. pneumoniae. A Deltahns mutant down-regulated the mrkA pilin gene and biofilm formation was affected. In contrast, capsule expression was derepressed in the absence of H-NS conferring a hypermucoviscous phenotype. Moreover, H-NS deficiency affected the K. pneumoniae adherence to epithelial cells such as A549 and HeLa cells. In infection experiments using RAW264.7 and THP-1 differentiated macrophages, the Deltahns mutant was less phagocytized than the wild-type strain. This phenotype was likely due to the low adherence to these phagocytic cells. Taken together, our data indicate that H-NS nucleoid protein is a crucial regulator of both T3P and CPS of K. pneumoniae."
12237986,1,a,"PURPOSE: To develop a model of psychosocial and environmental influences on physical activity and psychophysiological health outcomes in women. DESIGN: A structural equation model was evaluated. Variables included 13 predictors (perceived benefits to exercise, self-efficacy, goal setting, restructuring plans, relapse prevention, social support, work hassles, community hassles, family hassles, age, race, income, and education), two mediator variables assessing physical activity (performance, physical activity level), and three health outcome variables (body size, vigor, and fatigue). METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 198, self-described sedentary women aged 30-60 years completed several paper-and-pencil tests, after which they were assessed physiologically by means of performance on a 1-mile walk, BMI, and percentage of body fat measurements. RESULTS: Overall, the model showed good fit. Self-efficacy, age, race, and income correlated with physical performance, and restructuring plans, relapse prevention, and age related to physical activity level. Performance was inversely correlated with body size, and physical activity level was directly related to perceived vigor. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that psychosocial determinants are important factors in understanding physical activity and psychophysiological health, and thus they should be incorporated into intervention programs focused on increasing physical activity and improving health outcomes in women."
19149396,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Most immigrants to Canada now come from Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean and Africa, where cultures and languages often differ significantly from the Canadian context. Subgroups of immigrants experience disparities in health. Inability to communicate in an official language in Canada may be a marker of risk for poor health due to both pre- and post-migration factors. We aimed to study the relationship between language proficiency and self-reported health. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the first two surveys of the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (2001, 2003), a population-based cohort study of new immigrants to Canada. Specifically, we used logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between self-reported health and language proficiency by sex, controlling for a range of health determinants at 6 months (wave 1) and 2 years (wave 2) after arrival. RESULTS: After controlling for covariates (age, sex, education, region of birth, immigrant class, job satisfaction, access to health care), analysis of the wave 1 survey showed that poor proficiency in English or French is significantly related to the self-reported poor health (OR=2.0, p<0.01). And this relationship was consistent in the wave 2 survey (OR=1.9, p<0.01). We also found that this statistically significant association between poor language proficiency and self-reported health holds only for women (wave 1 survey OR=2.6, p <0.01, wave 2 survey OR=2.2, p<0.01), not for men. CONCLUSION: The association between poor language proficiency and poor self-reported health, and particularly its significantly greater impact on women, has implications for language training, health care and social services, and health information."
18777671,1,a,"There exists a lot of research on the reservation wages of the unemployed as a determinant of unemployment duration. Little is known about the reservation wages of those who are not in the labor force but might be potential labor force returnees, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries. The main objective of this article is to assess what can be learned from the subjective reservation wages of DI beneficiaries. Using the New Beneficiary Data System (NBDS), the article assesses the magnitudes of reservation wages compared to the last wage earned and the benefit amount, as well as the determinants of reservation wages in a regression framework. The NBDS is unique in that it provides the reservation wages and the work history of DI beneficiaries before and after joining the DI rolls. The article has several noteworthy results and policy implications: *Data show that a significant portion of beneficiaries report being likely to accept a job if offered one. Based on the NBDS, 13 percent of DI beneficiaries who did not work since joining the rolls in 1981-1982 reported in 1991 that they would be willing to work if offered a job and provided their reservation wages. *DI beneficiaries do not appear to price themselves out of the labor market. Half of them would want a wage that is 80 percent or less of the last wage earned before receiving DI. It is estimated that approximately 7 percent of long-term DI beneficiaries may potentially return-to-work if they search for jobs and have a wage offer distribution with a mean at 80 percent of their last wage. *The nonlabor income in addition to the benefit is positively and significantly associated with the reservation wage, while the benefit amount per se is not. However, this result needs to be treated with caution given that nonlabor income is endogenous to the model. *Heterogeneity exists between persons still under the DI program and those that have moved to the Old-Age program. The subsamples of persons who have shifted to the Old-Age program and those who are still under the DI program have median reservation wage to the last wage ratios of 0.69 and 0.93, respectively. A significantly lower reservation wage for persons who have moved to the Old-Age program was also found in a regression framework. This heterogeneity between the two groups may result in part from the different program characteristics both groups face, for instance, in terms of benefit termination and Medicare eligibility rules. *Subjective reservation wage data can be useful to study populations that are out of the labor force. This article is innovative in that it focuses on a group of persons who are typically considered as being out of the labor force, and therefore are not asked reservation wages in general household surveys such as the Current Population Survey. It would be of great interest to collect more reservation wage data for DI beneficiaries in a longitudinal data set to expand this analysis, for instance, to assess conclusively the effects of changing program characteristics on reservation wages and return-to-work outcomes as beneficiaries transition to the Old-Age program or as new return-to-work programs are put in place."
30825760,0,a,"Health is not only a result of biological conditions, but of psychological, economic, and social circumstances. Both proximal factors, which impact daily life, and distal factors, which are further removed from everyday life, can influence a person's wellbeing. However, traditionally these distal factors have been overlooked in public discourse and government policy. OBJECTIVE: In the present study we examined whether measures of country-level safety predict the health of their residents. Additionally, we examined whether socioeconomic status (SES; approximated by income) interacts with other proximal factors to predict health. METHODS: Participants were 81,415 individuals residing in 58 countries. Multilevel modeling was used to determine the influence of distal and proximal factors on health. RESULTS: Findings indicated that both country-level safety and SES predict health regardless of the country of residence. Additionally, SES interacted with other proximal variables (e.g., life satisfaction and access to food) to predict health. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to everyday living conditions, health is contingent upon circumstances that do not directly impact daily life. This indicates that preventive measures are needed to secure the health of individuals impacted not only by negative proximal factors, but negative distal factors as well. In light of these findings, more translational research is needed to highlight the importance of the biopsychosocial model of health to both policymakers and the public. In this article, we suggest two research avenues relating to country-level safety that could provide specific recommendations for policy change."
24272979,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Risk factors for postnatal depression (PND), one of the most pervasive complications of child bearing, are poorly understood in Africa. A recent systematic review of 31 studies found that the strongest predictors are social and economic disadvantage and gender-based factors; only six of these studies were community based, and almost all were in South Asia. METHODS: Cohort study nested within 4 weekly surveillance of all women of reproductive age to identify pregnancies and collect data on births and deaths in the Kintampo Health Research Centre study area of Ghana. Women were screened for depression during pregnancy and after birth using the Patient Health Questionnaire to ascertain DSM-IV major or minor depression. Information was collected on determinants relating to the mother, birth, and baby, which were examined using logistic regression; effect sizes reported as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Thirteen thousand nine hundred and twenty nine women were screened both during pregnancy and after birth, of whom 13,360 (95.9%) had complete data on potential determinants. Two hundred and fifty five (3.8%, 95% CI: 3.5%, 4.1%) had PND. Antenatal depression (AND) was the strongest determinant accounting for 34.4% of PND cases. Other determinants were season of delivery, peripartum/postpartum complications, newborn ill health, still birth, or neonatal death. Common determinants were observed for onset and persistent depression. CONCLUSIONS: Although most AND resolves in this setting, more than a third of women with PND also had AND. Adverse birth- and baby-related outcomes are the other main determinants. We recommend that programs detect and treat depression during pregnancy and provide support to women with adverse birth outcomes."
11264268,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of self-rated health to a measure of physical status, based on a professional rating of the individual's health from a strictly physical point of view. METHODS: A random selection of 407 people over the age of 20 from the north-western catchment area of greater Stockholm were invited in 1995 to a physical examination, including a self-report questionnaire with questions about self-rated health, lifestyle, psychosocial factors and quality of life. A measure of physical health on a 5-point graded scale was constructed using the information from the records of the physical examination as a base. RESULTS: Self-rated health and the professional ratings of health coincided in approximately 60% of the cases. There were a relatively large number of cases where the ratings were contradictory. The correlation between the scales was 0.45. Comparison between the two ratings with respect to association with potential determinants showed that physical factors naturally explained most of the variances in physical health, whereas social and mental well-being and somatic conditions (women) were the most important explanatory variables for self-rated health. Irrespective of whether they had ""favourable"" or ""unfavourable"" health, those with ""poor"" self-rated health also had perceived lower social and mental well-being, less appreciation, more somatic conditions (women) and worse coping abilities (men). CONCLUSIONS: With mental, psychosocial and social problems becoming more pronounced in sickness patterns for primary care patients, self-rated health could be a helpful device, especially when time resources for consultations are short. This measure could also give a more global view of the patient's situation when effectivity and rationality can be a threat to a holistic view of the patient."
24569382,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Size at birth has taken on renewed significance due to its now well-established association with many health and health-related outcomes in both the immediate perinatal period and across the entire life course. Optimizing fetal growth to improve both neonatal survival and population health is the focus of much research and policy development, although most efforts have concentrated on either the period of pregnancy itself or the period immediately preceding it. METHODS: Intergenerational data linked to the Aberdeen Children of the 1950s (ACONF) study were used to examine the influence of grandparental and parental life course biological and social variables on the distribution of offspring size at birth. Guided stepwise multivariable methods and a graphical approach were used to assess the relative importance of these temporally ordered and highly correlated life course measures. RESULTS: Both distal and proximal grandparental and parental life course biological and social factors predicted offspring size at birth. Inequalities in size at birth, according to adult maternal socioeconomic indicators, were found to be largely generated by the continuity of the social environment across generations, and the inequalities in maternal early life growth were predicted by the adult grandparental social environment during the mother's early life. Mother's own size at birth predicted her offspring's intrauterine growth, independent of her adult biological and social characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: A mother's childhood social environment and her early growth are both important predictors of her offspring's size at birth. Population strategies aimed at optimizing size at birth require broader social and intergenerational considerations, in addition to focusing on the health of mothers in the immediate pregnancy period."
20011672,1,a,"Although it is widely assumed that work careers begin after the completion of schooling, most enrolled high school students are also workers. Teenage workers are heavily concentrated in the low wage service sector, but they are also found as supplemental part-time workers in many occupations, including clerical, retail sales, and blue collar employment. Gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic origins are important determinants of the types of jobs that teenage students hold. Students from advantaged socioeconomic origins and students with above average grades are more likely to work in ""good jobs,"" defined by lower hours of work per week and higher status."
16228697,1,a,"The aim of this was to examine rates and determinants of depressive symptomatology in the immediate postpartum period among Hispanic women in the United States. A total of 3952 Hispanic women who had delivered infants (parturients) were interviewed in postpartum wards in Miami, New York City and San Francisco. Symptoms of depression were regressed onto a series of social, psychological, and socioeconomic variables. Results showed that 42.6% of participants were probable cases of depression (CES-D > or = 16). Depression was negatively associated with perceived level of social support (adjusted OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.53-0.67) and health insurance coverage (adjusted OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.95), but not with the degree of acculturation or immigration status. It was found that depressive symptoms are common among Hispanic parturients. Pregnant Hispanic women should be carefully monitored for signs of depression and appropriate preventive measures are needed."
31679346,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Mental disorders contribute significantly to the burden of diseases in Iran. Therefore, the current study aims to assess the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and their associated factors among youth in Kermanshah province of Iran. METHODS: The current study is a part of the first phase of Ravansar Cohort (a part of the PERSIAN Youth Cohort) including 2991 participants aged 15 to 34 from Ravansar district in western Iran. Enrollment and data collection for this phase were performed from end April 2015 to early April 2017. The data were gathered using structured interviews and national and international standard questionnaires. Data analysis was carried out using multinomial logistic regression and chi-square test. RESULTS: The prevalence of any psychiatric disorder among the selected population was 31.3%. Major depressive disorder (MDD) (21.6%), followed by generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (6.4%) and dysthymia (1.9%) were the most prevalent disorders among the study individuals. The prevalence of alcohol and opioid/stimulant use disorders was 4.6% and 5.1%, respectively. Moreover, there was significant relationship between location of residence (city or village) and marital status with prevalence of the disorders. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the current study, it can be concluded that the prevalence of mental and psychiatric disorders among the youth in Ravansar district, western Iran is relatively high and needs specific plans and interventions to control it."
16808139,1,a,"Currently, women comprise 17% of the 1.4 million U.S. active military and 20% of the 1.2 million reserve force. Well over three-quarters of these women are enlisted (82%). Enlisted women are young, between the ages of 17 and 29, and one-half are ethnic minorities. Enlisted women are a growing minority within the predominantly male hierarchical military organization. The most junior of these women, in addition to being vastly outnumbered by men, fall along with junior enlisted men at the bottom of the military organizational structure. This unique position may have health consequences. The purpose of this article is to propose research questions within the context of the Marmot and Wilkinson's social determinants of health model. Proposed research questions are provided to address the current gaps in the science related to the contextual health readiness issues of junior enlisted military women."
29224691,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Debate on the burden of musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions in lower and middle income countries is intensifying; yet, little knowledge so far exists on patterns and impacts of such conditions among general or older adult populations in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The objectives of this study are to examine the prevalence, potential predictors, and sequelae of MSK among older adults residing in two low resource informal urban settlements or ""slums"" in Nairobi Kenya. METHODS: Data on older adults aged 60 years and over from two unrelated cross-sectional surveys on the older slum populations are used: a 2006/7 survey on the social, health, and overall well-being of older people (sample N = 831), and a 2016 survey on realities and impacts of long-term care and social protection for older adults (sample n = 1026). Uni and multivariate regressions on the 2006/7 data are employed to examine relationships of back pain and symptoms of arthritis with sex, age, wealth, unemployment, diagnoses of hypertension, and diabetes; and with indicators of subjective well-being and functional ability. Descriptive frequencies and chi-squared tests of association are used on 2016 data to identify the overall prevalence and locations of activity limiting MSK pain, and sex differences in these. RESULTS: Prevalence of past month back pain and past 2 week symptoms of arthritis was 44% and 42.6%, respectively. Respective prevalence of past month activity limiting back pain and joint pain was 13.9% and 22.7%. A total of 42.6% of slum residents with a current health problem report MSK as the most severe problem. In multivariate regressions, female sex, unemployment, and diagnosis of hypertension are predictive of back pain and symptoms of arthritis. Both conditions are associated with raised odds of having lower quality of life, poorer life satisfaction, and depressive symptoms, and with mobility impairments and self-care difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: MSK conditions are salient, and a likely key cause of impaired subjective well-being and functioning among older slum populations in SSA. Further research on determinants and consequences of such conditions in older slum populations is required to inform debate on responses to MSK as part of efforts to reorient SSA health systems to aging and to improve slum health."
29974820,0,a,"AIMS: Scientific knowledge about risk factors for work disability in terms of long-term sickness absence and disability pension following lumbar spine decompression surgery remains insufficient. This study aimed to investigate the associations between socio-demographic, work-related, and medical characteristics with subsequent long-term sickness absence (>90 days) and disability pension for individuals who underwent lumbar spine decompression surgery. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of all individuals aged 19-60 years with diagnosed dorsopathies, who underwent lumbar spine decompression surgery 2008-10 in Sweden ( n=7373) was performed. Univariate and multivariate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals regarding long-term sickness absence and disability pension with a 3-year follow-up period were estimated by Cox proportional regression. RESULTS: Low educational level, being a non-European immigrant and preoperative sickness absence were risk factors for both long-term sickness absence and disability pension (hazard ratios: 1.2-3.8). Female sex was a risk factor for long-term sickness absence (hazard ratios: 1.3) whereas age >44 years and being a Nordic immigrant were risk factors for disability pension (hazard ratios: 1.9-2.6). Medical factors as common mental disorders, other mental disorders, prescribed psychiatric medication and somatic comorbidity were risk factors for both long-term sickness absence and disability pension (hazard ratios: 1.2-3.4). A simultaneous lumbar fusion surgery and high preoperative pain severity were risk factors for long-term sickness absence (hazard ratios 1.2-1.8). CONCLUSIONS: To prevent long-term work disability after lumbar spine decompression surgery, specific focus is required on older and female patients, those with mental or somatic comorbidities, high levels of preoperative pain or sickness absence, with a simultaneous lumbar fusion surgery, a low educational level or a non-European immigrant background."
14761816,1,a,"Culture determines the different ways that patients understand cancer, the ways they explain it, and their attitudes towards it. These factors affect the patient's emotional response to the disease and health behaviour in terms of prevention and treatment. In this paper we review the explanatory models for cancer in several cultural groups. These models range from metaphysical to interpersonal and physical. Cultural explanations of health and health behaviour could detract from social and economic factors that might be more important as determinants of these behaviours."
19968876,1,a,"BACKGROUND: A large proportion of people living with hip or knee pain do not consult health care professionals. Pain severity is often believed to be the main reason for help seeking in this population; however the evidence for this is contradictory. This study explores the importance of several potential risk factors on help seeking across different practitioner groups, among adults living with chronic hip or knee pain in a large community sample. METHODS: Health care utilization, defined as having seen a family doctor (GP) during the past 12 months; or an allied health professional (AHP) or alternative therapist during the past 3 months, was assessed in a community based sample aged 35 or over and reporting pain in hip or knee. Adjusted odds ratios were determined for social deprivation, rurality, pain severity, mobility, anxiety/depression, co-morbidities, and body mass index. RESULTS: Of 1119 persons reporting hip or knee pain, 52% had pain in both sites. Twenty-five percent of them had seen a doctor only, 3% an AHP only, and 4% an alternative therapist only. Thirteen percent had seen more than one category of health care professionals, and 55% had not seen any health care professional. In the multivariate model, factors associated with consulting a GP were mobility problems (OR 2.62 (1.64-4.17)), urban living (OR 2.40 (1.14-5.04) and pain severity (1.28 (1.13-1.44)). There was also some evidence that obesity was associated with increased consultation (OR 1.72 (1.00-2.93)). Factors were similar for consultation with a combination of several health care professionals. In contrast, seeing an alternative therapist was negatively associated with pain severity, anxiety and mobility problems (adjusting for age and sex). CONCLUSION: Disability appears to be a more important determinant of help-seeking than pain severity or anxiety and depression, for adults with chronic pain in hip or knee. The determinants of seeking help from alternative practitioners are different from determinants of consulting GPs, AHPs or a combination of different health care providers."
25264559,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Theory and evidence link social support processes and self-efficacy appraisals in the promotion of adaptation following traumatic events. Dynamic causal processes, however, have not been examined longitudinally or in the context of mass-violence. This study tested whether quantity of social support seeking indirectly reduced distress severity among student survivors of mass university shootings. Hypotheses specified that the indirect effects of social support seeking on distress severity would occur through positively influencing perceived social support and self-efficacy, and that these effects would emerge and become stronger as posttraumatic stress symptom severity increased. DESIGN: Path analysis via Mplus 7.2 was used to test the hypothesized moderated-serial-mediation model (conditional indirect effects). METHODS: The sample (N=1191) consisted of students enrolled at Virginia Tech during the 16 April 2007 shootings. Data were collected via online surveys at two time points, 3-4 months and 1-year post-shootings. RESULTS: Hypotheses were supported, showing that the indirect effects of social support seeking on distress reduction occurred through perceived social support, which in turn influenced self-efficacy. These effects emerged and grew in strength as PTS severity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical implications, including the need to consider contextual determinants of posttraumatic recovery, are discussed."
31754880,0,a,"Recovery is the guiding vision of mental health systems and policy. However, skepticism has emerged about whether the paradigm can achieve its sought goals. We argue that embedding recovery within a quality improvement framework, such as the Triple Aim, would increase leverage for systems change and advance recovery practice. The Triple Aim's goals of improving healthcare outcomes, quality, and costs are pertinent to mental health systems, although action is also needed to address the social determinants of health. Accordingly, we propose the recovery-oriented Triple Aim, which could be used to guide policy development and evaluation of mental health services."
15772506,1,a,"Distance education offers many advantages to students, faculty, and educational institutions. Despite these advantages, distance education classes historically have higher dropout rates than do the courses taught in the traditional, face-to-face setting. Current research includes information related to technology, teaching tips, and resources for these extended learning opportunities. However, information related to student success in distance education is limited and success indicators are poorly defined. Current studies on success indicators often lack a defining framework that provides an opportunity for study replication and strengthens the credibility of study findings. An empirical model developed by Powell et al divides potential determinants of success into three categories. This literature review identifies indicators in each category and indicates a need to revise the current framework to include technology as a fourth category. The revised framework should provide a basis for additional research in this rapidly growing area."
30916821,0,a,"Protected areas are one of the most effective means by which biodiversity is conserved, but are often criticized for either neglecting the importance of local communities or sacrificing conservation objectives for political expedience. In the United States, federal protected areas can be designated via a democratic legislation process or via executive action, which allows for comparison of the ecological and sociopolitical context of these top-down and bottom-up processes. We compared protected areas resulting from congressional designation vs. presidential designation with respect to their ecological context (using measures of biodiversity and climate refugial potential) and sociopolitical context (using measures of local support for conservation and reliance on natural resource-based industries). We found minimal differences between these designation modes for both ecological and sociopolitical variables. These results suggest that presidentially designated protected areas tend to be no more burdensome to local communities and no less valuable for ecological conservation than more widely accepted federal protected areas such as national parks, and they provide new evidence to inform the current debate over national monuments."
29166399,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Regular consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) is associated with weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and dental caries. The UK will introduce a levy on the manufacturers of SSBs in 2018. Details will be negotiated over the next two years. How the UK public views SSB taxes is likely to be an important determinant of the content and success of the final policy. We aimed to capture the views, ideas and concerns of commenters on major UK news websites on SSB taxes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a qualitative analysis of reader comments to online news coverage of one proposal for an SSB tax in the UK. 1645 comments on four articles were included. Three underpinning themes influenced support or opposition to the tax: the balance between individual responsibility and autonomy, and population need; mistrust of the intention of the proposed tax and those promoting it; and variations in the perceived complexity of unhealthy diets and obesity associated with variations in what are considered appropriate interventions. Arguments under each theme were used to justify both support and opposition in different cases. CONCLUSIONS: As the final form of the UK SSB tax is negotiated, effort should be made to address the concerns we identified. Our results suggest these efforts could usefully focus on emphasising the social and environmental determinants of diet and obesity, reinforcing the benefits of the tax to the NHS, and pitching the tax as playing into a variety of different conceptualisations of obesity."
27957304,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy at birth (LEB) is closely associated with the degree of economic and social development in developed and developing countries. This study aimed to examine the socioeconomic factors affecting LEB in Iran from 1985 to 2013. METHODS: Time series analysis was used to examine the effects of key explanatory factors (GDP per capita, number of doctors per 10,000 population, degree of urbanization, food availability, CO2 emission, total fertility rate, inflation rate, and literacy rate) on LEB in Iran from 1985 to 2013. Study data were retrieved from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), Iranian Statistical Center (ISC), and World Bank. Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Banergy, Dolado, and Master (BDM) tests, Engle Granger approach, and an ordinary least-square (OLS) model were used to achieve the aim of the study. Data analysis was performed by Stata V.12 software. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that GDP per capita (p=0.003), number of doctors per 10,000 population (p=0.036), literacy rate (p=0.0001), and food availability (p=0.0001) have a positive and significant statistically effect on LEB. The relationship between total fertility rate and LEB was negative and significant (p=0.023). In addition, the effect of degree urbanization (p=0.811), CO2 emission (p=0.185), and inflation rate (p=0.579) on LEB were not significant. CONCLUSION: GDP per capita, number of doctors per 10,000 population, food availability, literacy rate, and total fertility were identified as the main factors affecting life expectancy in Iran. The study, however, suggests that life expectancy in Iran could be improved if attention is given to factors that reside outside of the health sector."
12660214,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: This article describes Canadian civil servants' awareness of, attitudes toward, and self-reported use of ideas about the determinants of health. METHODS: Federal and provincial civil servants in departments of finance, labor, social services, and health were surveyed. RESULTS: With civil servants in finance departments a notable exception, most Canadian civil servants see the health of populations as a relevant outcome for their sectors. Many (65%) report that ideas about the determinants of health have already influenced policymaking in their sector, but most (83%) say they need more information about the health consequences of the policy alternatives their departments face. CONCLUSIONS: Civil servants should consider developing accountability structures for health and researchers should consider producing and transferring more policy-relevant research."
17062544,1,a,"A variety of cognitive and behavioral self-management skills have been posited as protective in terms of adolescent substance use. This study examined whether these skills measured in the 7th grade served a protective function in 9th grade substance use across ethnically diverse samples of adolescents. Participants consisted of Black (n = 461) and Hispanic (n = 320) urban youth and White suburban youth (n = 757). Structural equation modeling indicated that a second order Self-Management Skills latent factor consisting of first order latent factors of Decision-Making, Self-Regulation, and Self-Reinforcement skills was protective for adolescent substance use across racial/ethnic subgroups. However, Self-Management Skills were more strongly protective for suburban White youth and less protective for urban minority youth. These findings are consistent with previous research showing that predictive power of risk and protective factors derived from psychosocial theories varies widely across racial/ethnic subgroups of youth and is weaker among racial/ethnic minority youth compared to White youth. An important next step is to broaden the focus of etiology research from individual-level determinants to studying adolescent substance use behavior in the context of the cultural background and primary social settings of young people, such as family, school, and community environments."
27493932,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder that has a great impact on people's lives. Patients with epilepsy are at increased risk for poor Quality of Life (QoL). The objective of this study was to evaluate the QoL of epileptic patients in comparison to healthy persons. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 52 epileptic patients from Golbu region in Neyshabur (a city in northeast of Iran). Using Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scale, the data were collected between April and Jun 2012. Every patient were compared with two healthy persons. Epileptic and healthy persons were similar for age, sex and local residence. Pearson's correlation coefficient and t-independent test applied for data analysis through SPSS v. 16 software. RESULTS: Of 52 epileptic patients, 24 were female (46.2%) and 28 were male (53.8%). The mean+/-SD age of epileptic patients was 40.92+/-20.33yr (Rang: 15-86yr). The total mean score of SF- 36 in patient group was 55.88 and in healthy group 68.52and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Among the different subscales of SF-36 in epileptic patients, the highest and the lowest mean scores were found for social functioning and general health subscales, respectively. The mean scores in patient group in comparison to healthy group were lower in all subscales of SF-36 and these differences were statistically significant in all domains (except role limitations due to physical problems domain and role limitations due to emotional problems domain). CONCLUSION: The study showed that epilepsy disease has an important role in QoL of patients, thus some interventional programs are necessary to improve their QOL."
16510888,1,a,"Affective factors are likely to play a major role in determining the extent to which offenders are able to engage with, and benefit from, treatment. In this article, it is argued that the relationship between affect and treatment engagement may be understood in three ways: the access the client has to emotional states, the ability to express such states, and the willingness of the client to do this in the therapeutic session. It is suggested that affective determinants of treatment readiness can be understood with reference to models of emotional regulation and that attention to these affective factors in the early stages of treatment is likely to promote engagement, reduce attrition, and consequently improve treatment outcomes for violent offenders."
28221739,0,a,"Every aspect of society is dependent upon the health of its members. Health is essential to an individual's well-being, quality of life, and ability to participate in society. Yet the healthcare industry, even at its optimal level of functioning, cannot improve the health of the population without addressing the root causes of poor health. The health of approximately 46.7 million individuals, most of whom are low-income and racial minorities, is threatened by economic, societal, cultural, environmental, and social conditions. Poor health in any population group affects everyone, leading to higher crime rates, negative economic impacts, decreased residential home values, increased healthcare costs, and other devastating consequences. Despite this fact, efforts to improve health among low-income and minority communities are impeded by inequitable social structures, stereotypes, legal systems, and regulatory schemes that are not designed to take into account the social determinants of health in decision making models and legal interpretation. As a result, a large segment of the population is continually denied the opportunity to live long, productive lives and to exercise their rights under democratic principles. Health, equity, and justice make up the keystone of a functional, thriving society. These principles are unsatisfied when they do not apply equally to all members of society. This Article describes the social and legal roots of poor health and how health inequity, social injustice, and poverty are inextricably linked. For example, it provides an in depth overview of the social determinants of health, including poverty, institutional discrimination and segregation, implicit bias, residential environmental hazards, adverse childhood experiences, and food insecurity. It then discusses how the law is a determinant of health due to court systems that do not evaluate individual circumstances, the enactment of laws that perpetuate poor health, and the lack of primary prevention laws. It demonstrates how addressing these issues requires true adherence to equality principles and making justice and freedom of opportunity accessible to everyone. Finally, it recommends the creation of ""health justice,"" a new jurisprudential and legislative framework for the achievement and delivery of health equity and social justice."
31805907,0,a,"Health inequities are widespread and persistent, and the root causes are social, political and economic as opposed to exclusively behavioural or genetic. A barrier to transformative change is the tendency to frame these inequities as unfair consequences of social structures that result in disadvantage, without also considering how these same structures give unearned advantage, or privilege, to others. Eclipsing privilege in discussions of health equity is a crucial shortcoming, because how one frames the problem sets the range of possible solutions that will follow. If inequity is framed exclusively as a problem facing people who are disadvantaged, then responses will only ever target the needs of these groups without redressing the social structures causing disadvantages. Furthermore, responses will ignore the complicity of the corollary groups who receive unearned and unfair advantage from these same structures. In other words, we are missing the bigger picture. In this conceptualization of health inequity, we have limited the potential for disruptive action to end these enduring patterns.The goal of this article is to advance understanding and action on health inequities and the social determinants of health by introducing a framework for transformative change: the Coin Model of Privilege and Critical Allyship. First, I introduce the model, which explains how social structures produce both unearned advantage and disadvantage. The model embraces an intersectional approach to understand how systems of inequality, such as sexism, racism and ableism, interact with each other to produce complex patterns of privilege and oppression. Second, I describe principles for practicing critical allyship to guide the actions of people in positions of privilege for resisting the unjust structures that produce health inequities. The article is a call to action for all working in health to (1) recognize their positions of privilege, and (2) use this understanding to reorient their approach from saving unfortunate people to working in solidarity and collective action on systems of inequality."
12396543,1,a,"Determinants of sexual activity and intentions for condom use were examined guided by the Attitude, Social influences, and Self-efficacy (ASE) model as a theoretical framework. A total of 561 in and out-of-school youth (15-24 years) in Addis Ababa completed a self-administered questionnaire. A third of them reported sexual intercourse in the past and half of the sexually active used condoms during recent intercourse. Being out-of-school, male, aged 20-24 years, alcohol use and khat (amphetamine-like substance) consumption predicted the likelihood of engagement in sexual activity. Of these variables, however, male sex was more associated with reported condom use during recent sexual intercourse. Self-efficacy, skills, and barriers predicted 23% of the variance in intentions to use condoms. Self-efficacy was also associated with past condom use. Psychosocial constructs predicted more variations in condom use intention for males than for females. In general, self-efficacy was found to be the strongest predictor of the constructs, whereas attitude and social influences were the weakest. The study implies that HIV/AIDS prevention programmes for young people in Ethiopia need to emphasize building assertive communication skills in sexual negotiations and condom use. Minimizing the gender gap in sexual relationships forms the cornerstone for such educational strategies."
15884999,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Rural residents, rural community leaders, rural planners, rural health authorities and community organizations seek to understand the health, quality of life and sustainability of their communities. The aim of this article is to follow the cooperative community-based process of developing and testing a workbook to be used to assess and foster rural communities' health, quality of life and ultimately their sustainability. ISSUE: In a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada funded, 3 phase project, entitled Determinants of Health of Rural Populations and Communities, researchers at Brandon University, University of Manitoba and Concordia University, Canada, partnered various stakeholder groups in an visionary effort to build a framework and indicators for the purpose of assisting rural communities to assess not only their health and wellbeing, but also their sustainability. CONCLUSION: In this on-going project, it is anticipated that the findings related to the health, wellbeing, quality of life and sustainability of rural communities will be integral to policy development by local, provincial and federal organizations and governments well into this century. Moreover it is expected that diverse community-based organizations will be able to use the findings to take action, particularly in an intersectoral manner, the outcome of which will be an improvement of the rural resident and community health."
17531746,1,a,"Despite rhetorical attention there is little programmatic guidance as to how best to ensure that women and men living with HIV have access to sexual and reproductive health services that help them realise their reproductive goals, while ensuring their human rights. A dynamic relationship exists between the manner in which health services and programmes are delivered, and the individuals who seek these services. A review of the literature shows clear gaps and highlights areas of concern not yet sufficiently addressed. The delivery and use of health services and programmes is shaped by the underlying determinants of people's access to and use of these services, the health systems in place at community and country level, and the legal and policy environment these systems operate in. Few governments can provide the full range of services that might be required by their populations. In most places, people access health services from a variety of formal and informal providers, and health-related behaviour is influenced from many directions. The synergistic roles of health systems, law and policy and underlying social determinants in helping or hindering the development and delivery of adequate programmes and services for HIV positive people must be addressed."
11885033,1,a,"The modern concept of public health, the New Public Health, carries a great potential for healthy and therefore less aggressive societies. Its core disciplines are health promotion, environmental health, and health care management based on advanced epidemiological methodologies. The main principles of living together in healthy societies can be summarized as four ethical concepts of the New Public Health essential to violence reduction equity, participation, subsidiarity, and sustainability. The following issues are discussed as violence determinants: the process of urbanization; type of neighborhood and accommodation, and consequent stigmatization; level of education; employment status; socialization of the family; women's status; alcohol and drug consumption; availability of the firearms; religious, ethnic, and racial prejudices; and poverty. Development of the health systems has to contribute to peace, since aggression, violence, and warfare are among the greatest risks for health and the economic welfare. This contribution can be described as follows: 1) full and indiscriminate access to all necessary services, 2) monitoring of their quality, 3) providing special support to vulnerable groups, and 4) constant scientific and public accountability of the evaluation of the epidemiological outcome. Violence can also destroy solidarity and social cohesion of groups, such as family, team, neighborhood, or any other social organization. Durkheim coined the term anomie for a state in which social disruption of the community results in health risks for individuals. Health professionals can make a threefold contribution to peace by 1) analyzing the causal interrelationships of violence phenomena, 2) curbing the determinants of violence according to the professional standards, and 3) training professionals for this increasingly important task. Because tolerance is an essential part of an amended definition of health, monitoring of the early signs of public intolerance is important. The vital interplay between the informed public and efficient administration, however, can only exist in an open society. The link between democracy and health of the people, and between public health and economic welfare is real. The Public Health Collaboration in South Eastern Europe (PH-SEE) evolved just in time to reconnect and strengthen disrupted professional networks in the region as a prerequisite of effective public health action."
30033521,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Parent-delivered therapy interventions for children with cerebral palsy can help achieve a sufficient therapy dose, improve parental mental well-being, and facilitate parent-child relationships creating a more relaxed familial environment. However, parent-delivered interventions may also lead to increased parental stress, guilt if the therapy is not delivered, and time constraints. The primary aim of this review was to gain a deeper understanding of the determinants of effective parent-delivered therapy interventions. METHOD: Searches were conducted in the following databases: Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane. Studies had to meet the following inclusion criteria: descriptions of parent/health care professional/child experiences of parent-delivered therapy interventions for children and young people age 0-18 years with cerebral palsy, published in the English language between January 1989 and May 2017, with qualitative or mixed methods research design. The articles were critically appraised, then synthesized using a meta-ethnographic approach. RESULTS: A literature search identified 17 articles, which met the inclusion criteria. Three main themes were identified: (a) building trusting relationships, (b) enabling the parents to cope, and (c) for parents and health care professionals to see the intervention as a priority. Further synthesis presented three concepts identifying the important aspects of the interventions: empowerment, motivation, and relationships. CONCLUSIONS: The themes and concepts emerging from this qualitative synthesis can be addressed by specific points of action to support parent-delivered therapy interventions. We have summarized these in a checklist for use by intervention developers, health care professionals, and parents."
16448303,1,a,"This study investigated the association between 2 distinct personal coping resources (mastery and sense of coherence) and all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. During follow-up (up to 6 years), 994 deaths were recorded among 20,323 participants, ages 41 to 80 years, in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer Study in the United Kingdom. A strong sense of mastery was associated with lower rates of mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, after adjusting for age, sex, and prevalent chronic physical disease. The association with all-cause mortality was observed for both men and women and remained following further adjustment for cigarette smoking, social class, hostility, neuroticism, and extroversion. Analysis of the joint association between mastery and sense of coherence revealed both personal coping dispositions to be independently associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality. In addition, these data suggested that the association for mastery was specific to cardiovascular mortality, whereas the association for sense of coherence was specific to cancer mortality. These results may aid future study of coping resources as determinants of persistent well-being."
28746501,0,a,"Objective: To discover the generators of disruptions in social support networks and identify the everyday life and projects of life of homeless people. Method: Ethnographic study conducted between 2012 and 2013 in Ribeirao Preto -SP, Brazil. The participants were fifteen homeless people. Data were collected through video-recorded interviews addressing histories of life and a field diary. Data analysis was based on Habermas' Theory of Communicative Action. Results: Results revealed that the participants' families have faced inequalities for many generations and that everyday life is marked by violence and death, poverty and exclusion, disrupted social networks, loneliness, alcohol and drug consumption, and other socially determined diseases. Conclusion: The situation of living on the streets stems from several factors present in the organization of the Brazilian society and social determinants condition the life and health of homeless people."
19171669,1,a,"Despite the proposed ecological and systems-based perspectives of the settings-based approach to health promotion, most initiatives have tended to overlook the fundamental nature of ecosystems. This paper responds to this oversight by proposing an explicit re-integration of ecosystems within the healthy settings approach. We make this case by focusing on water as an integrating unit of analysis. Water, on which all life depends, is not only an integral consideration for the existing healthy settings (schools, hospitals, workplaces) but also highlights the ecosystem context of health and sustainability. A focus on catchments (also know as watersheds and river basins) exemplifies the scaled and upstream/downstream nature of ecosystems and draws into sharp focus the cross-sectoral and transdisciplinary context of the social and environmental determinants of health. We position this work in relation to the converging agendas of health promotion and ecosystem management at the local, regional and global scales--and draw on evidence from international initiatives as diverse as the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Using water as a vehicle for understanding the systemic context for human wellbeing, health promotion and disease prevention draws inevitable attention to key challenges of scale, intersectoral governance and the complementary themes of promoting resilience and preventing vulnerability. We conclude by highlighting the importance of building individual and institutional capacity for this kind of integration--equipping a new generation of researchers, practitioners and decision-makers to be conversant with the language of ecosystems, capable of systemic thought and focused on settings that can promote both health and sustainability."
17128623,1,a,"AIMS: To describe the epidemiology of Suicide in Tuscany according to the triad of time, place and person. METHODS: The 4,764 cases of suicide, defined according to categories E950-E959 of ICD-9 in Tuscany over the period 1988-2002, were obtained from the Tuscan Mortality Register. Mortality indicators were calculated and analyzed. The spatial analysis was carried out by deriving Empirical Bayes Estimates for the 287 municipalities. RESULTS: The crude mortality rate in the 2000-2002 is 7.8 per 100000 population (male: 12.4; female: 3.5). The age-standardized rate in the 2000-2002 is 5.8 per 100,000 population (male: 9.6; female: 2.6). The highest risk for suicide, especially in the case of males, are concentrated in the southern hinterland Tuscany, in a cluster of rural municipalities that represent the old mining district of Tuscany. The SMRs according to residential municipality (population per square kilometre), confirm a greater risk of suicide for males residing in rural communities. CONCLUSIONS: The cluster of excessive mortality from suicide in Southern Tuscany could be the consequence of social determinants, related to the urban and social crisis following agriculture decline and mine closure."
28971692,0,a,"It is important to consider health inequities when exploring the extent to which school food programs may contribute to the stigmatization and social exclusion of families experiencing food insecurity. As part of a broader school-based project, this paper considers evidence derived from a secondary analysis of research in Nova Scotia (NS). In the original research, interviews were conducted with key stakeholders involved in supporting health promotion activities across NS elementary schools. For this article, data were re-examined using tenets of critical discourse analysis to evaluate if school practices were addressing the root social issues by identifying patterns in language and institutional norms. Our findings suggested that further illumination of programs may be needed to ensure that they do not contribute to the stigmatization and social exclusion of families experiencing food insecurity. Nutrition professionals are in a position to engage families experiencing food insecurity in policy action that will shift from a focus on individual determinants towards the social-structural conditions that underlie the complex issue of food insecurity."
19129323,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about public beliefs concerning the treatment of mental disorders in developing countries. AIMS: To assess preferences on sources of help and treatment and the perception of prognosis for schizophrenia and depression. METHOD: A household survey was carried out in 2002 with a probabilistic sample of 1000 individuals, residents of Sao Paulo city, Brazil, with ages ranging from 18-65. Vignettes in colloquial language describing individuals with schizophrenia and depression (according to DSM-IV and ICD-10) were presented, together with a structured questionnaire with questions about the vignette. RESULTS: Results indicated the same general tendencies for schizophrenia and depression. The public considered the help of lay people and psychologists the most useful. Medical professionals are viewed less favorably. The treatments and activities most recommended are psychotherapy and general activities, such as physical activities and attending church services. Medical treatments are seen as more harmful than helpful. The more important determinants were: identification as mental illness, religion, sex and years of school completed. Prognosis with treatment for both disorders is viewed as favorable. CONCLUSIONS: These results may indicate that the public need to receive more information on the full range of treatments options, especially those related to medical treatment."
22868751,0,a,"CONTEXT The substantial changes in adolescent alcohol use prevalence over time suggest that population-level environmental factors are important determinants of use, yet the potential influence of such environmental factors is inadequately understood. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether adolescents in birth cohorts and/or time periods characterized by restrictive social norms toward alcohol were at decreased risk for alcohol use and binge drinking, controlling for individual attitudes (disapproval) toward use. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In 32 annual national surveys of US high school students, a total of 967 562 students contributed outcome data from 1976 through 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Frequency of past-year alcohol use and any instance of binge drinking (>/=5 drinks) in the past 2 weeks, analyzed using multilevel models clustering individuals within periods and birth cohorts. Period- and cohort-specific social norm scores (indicating the proportion disapproving of weekend binge drinking) were modeled as predictors, controlling for individual attitudes and demographic characteristics. RESULTS Individuals who matured in birth cohorts with more restrictive social norms were less likely to use alcohol compared with individuals who matured in cohorts with more permissive norms; each 5% increase in the cohort-specific disapproval was associated with a 12% decrease in the odds of past-year alcohol use (odds ratio = 0.88; 99% CI, 0.87-0.89). The effects of cohort-specific disapproval were notably stronger among white adolescents than nonwhite adolescents. CONCLUSIONS This study documents the importance of considering time-varying population-level risk factors in the study of adolescent alcohol use and indicates that, even after an individual's personal attitudes are accounted for, risk is shaped by cohort effects whereby the norms within the cohort contribute to the risk of adolescent alcohol use."
12501479,1,a,"In an attempt to add to the knowledge about concerns regarding the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a sample of 186 Jewish and Arab adults with no family history of the disease were examined on the basis of sociodemographic and health characteristics, social-cognitive determinants, and knowledge about AD. Nearly 50 percent of the participants reported being very concerned about developing AD. Memory problems and the likelihood of developing the disease emerged as significant predictors of concern about AD. The need to expand the use of theoretically-based models, including social-cognitive determinants, for the study of specific concerns about AD as a basis for the development of educational programs is discussed."
16539965,1,a,"We describe the magnitude and trends of obesity in Spain and of its main determinants, associated both with the increase in energy intake and the reduction of energy expenditure. Such determinants include factors from the individual subjects and from their environment. We also present the main features of the strategy for the Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Obesity, fostered by the Ministry of Health, as well as plans and activities carried out by the Regional Governments, to control this health disorder. We conclude that effective and sustained implementation of these activities is badly needed. It should be made along with the monitoring of obesity and its determinants in the general population. Research in this field should also be strengthened because social determinants of obesity are not known in depth, and the effectiveness of many of the interventions proposed by the national and regional initiatives is not well established yet. Moreover, in the next future, the effectiveness of intervention models applied to control the smoking epidemic must be assessed to examine its usefulness in the control of obesity. An example of this type of interventions is the limitation of the publicity of nutrient-poor and energy-dense foods addressed to children."
30012781,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To test whether social ties play any roles in mitigating depression and anxiety, as well as in fostering mental health among young men living in a poor urban community. SETTING: A cohort of all young men living in an urban slum in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: All men aged 18-29 years (n=824) living in a low-income urban community at the time of the survey. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Unspecified psychological morbidity measured using the General Health Questionnaire, 12-item (GHQ-12), where lower scores suggest better mental status. RESULTS: The GHQ scores (mean=9.2, SD=4.9) suggest a significant psychological morbidity among the respondents. However, each additional friend is associated with a 0.063 SD lower GHQ score (95% CI -0.106 to -0.021). Between centrality measuring the relative importance of the respondent within his social network is also associated with a 0.103 SD lower GHQ score (95% CI -0.155 to -0.051), as are other measures of social network ties. Among other factors, married respondents and recent migrants also report a better mental health status. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the importance of social connection in providing a buffer against stress and anxiety through psychosocial support from one's peers in a resource-constraint urban setting. Our findings also suggest incorporating a social network and community ties in designing mental health policies and interventions."
23008679,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to explore the perception of body weight among students in schools in Jeddah City and identify the main determinants of self-perceived obesity, weight management goals and practices. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected from a sample of Saudi school children of 42 boys' and 42 girls' schools in Jeddah city during the month of April 2000. Personal interviews were conducted to collect data on socio-demographic factors, food choices, perception of body weight, weight management goals and weight management practices, as well as the actual measurement of weight and height. Students were asked about their perception of their body weight [responses included: very underweight (thin), slightly underweight, about right weight, slightly overweight and grossly overweight (obese)]. Proportion, prevalence and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for an attempt to lose weight and weight management practices. RESULTS: The distribution of self-perception of body size was nearly similar to the measured body mass index (BMI) classification except for the overweight students, where 21.3% perceived themselves, as slightly overweight and 5.5% as very overweight although 13.4% were actually overweight and 13.5% were obese by BMI standards. Approximately half the students took at least 3 pieces of fruit or fruit juice servings, and a third ate at least 4 vegetable servings per day. A third of the students managed to lose weight. This coincides with the proportion of those actually overweight and obese. Around 28.0% of the students ate less food, fat or calories, 31.0% took exercise and 17.6% were engaged in vigorous exercise to lose weight or prevent weight gain. Staying for at least 24 hours without food which is a potentially harmful means of weight control was practiced by 10.0% of students. Females were less likely than males to be overweight and obese but more likely to perceive themselves as grossly overweight and more likely to try to lose weight. Factors associated with efforts to lose weight by eating less fat or fewer calories were older age, high social class, being actually obese and perceiving oneself as being obese. Staying for at least 24 hours without eating was mainly practiced by females, older age groups, and the actually obese. Exercise was done mainly by the older age groups, those with educated and highly educated mothers, obese and perceiving oneself as being obese. Vigorous exercise was mainly performed by males, younger age groups, taking < 3 pieces of fruit or fruit juice servings per day, eating < 4 vegetable servings per day, and those perceiving themselves as obese. CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity are prevalent among our youth and not all obese have a correct image of their body size. Highly recommended are intervention programs of education on nutrition starting in childhood through school age to promote and ensure healthy food choices, improve student's awareness of ideal body size and clinical obesity, encourage physical exercise but discourage potentially harmful weight control measures."
31040712,0,a,"Aim: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and one of the most important causes of death among them. This review aimed to investigate the incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer and to identify the risk factors for breast cancer in the world. Materials and methods: A search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases without any time restrictions. The search keywords included the following terms: breast cancer, risk factors, incidence, and mortality and a combination of these terms. Studies published in English that referred to various aspects of breast cancer including epidemiology and risk factors were included in the study. Overall, 142 articles published in English were included in the study. Results: Based on the published studies, the incidence rate of breast cancer varies greatly with race and ethnicity and is higher in developed countries. Results of this study show that mortality rate of breast cancer is higher in less developed regions. The findings of this study demonstrated that various risk factors including demographic, reproductive, hormonal, hereditary, breast related, and lifestyle contribute to the incidence of breast cancer. Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer is rising, so design and implementation of screening programs and the control of risk factors seem essential."
28826295,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Health disparities persist among African Americans (AAs) and Latino adults with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this research was to use PhotoVoice to examine AAs and Latinos' daily experiences of managing diabetes. METHOD: An exploratory, descriptive study using PhotoVoice and focus groups was conducted over a 3-week period: Week 1 orientation session, Week 2 photo taking and returning cameras, and Week 3 focus group to share and discuss photos. RESULTS: Ten AAs and nine Latino adults were enrolled, forming four focus groups. Four categories emerged: (1) daily life living with type 2 diabetes mellitus, (2) negative and positive emotions, (3) supports and barriers, and (4) needs. The social determinants of health influencing diabetes self-care were observed in discussions and photos-this included the built environment to promote a healthy lifestyle, social support, and education. IMPLICATIONS: PhotoVoice promotes culturally congruent care to better understand AA and Latinos' experience living with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
15603114,1,a,"Occupational violence is a worldwide, multifaceted problem affecting all industries, including healthcare. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the experiences of 158 allied health professionals, 135 doctors, and 1229 nurses working in a rural area in eastern Australia. Response rates were 72 percent for allied health professionals and 62 percent for general practitioners (GPs) and nurses. Proportionately more nurses experienced occupational violence than did allied health providers and GPs. During the past 12 months (August 2001 to July 2002), 68 percent of nurses, compared with 47 percent of allied health providers and 48 percent of GPs, reported violence. All three professional groups indicated that the most distressing occupational violence was perpetrated by patients, followed by patients' relatives. The most frequent form of occupational violence was verbal abuse, followed by threatening behavior, physical violence, and obscene behavior. No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of violence was found among the different allied health professional disciplines or fields of nursing. Health services management strategies addressing occupational violence need to be comprehensive and multidisciplinary in scope. Strategies to minimize violence need to focus on resource allocation, cultural change, and perseverance. Systems to monitor violence are a priority. Further research into the determinants of this pattern of violence is required."
31889953,0,a,"Objective: Assess the association between social and economic conditions and homicide rates in young people between 10 and 24 years of age in Mexico in 2017. Methods: This ecological study looked at the social inequalities associated with homicides in the population 10-24-year-old population in 2017 in Mexico, using secondary data sources for deaths by homicide in each Mexican state. Social inequalities in health were studied by measuring absolute and relative inequality gaps. Mortality rates were estimated using Poisson regression models. Results: In 2017, there were 8,094 homicides in the target population, predominantly in men (86.7%). There was high variance in inequality between states. Unemployment in the population over 12 years of age, households composed of people who are not family members, low school attendance rates, and income below the poverty line showed significant association with homicide rates. Conclusions: There is a strong association between social determinants and homicides in the study population. Policies and intersectoral actions should be implemented to help bridge inequality gaps and achieve better living conditions and higher levels of well-being and health for people and their communities."
15595508,1,a,"Research on the social determinants of health has increasingly sought to understand the relative importance of different features of socioeconomic status. Much of the ensuing debate has wavered between education and income, with recent research leaning increasingly toward income. This research has not, however, consistently explored interactions between different features of socioeconomic status and, in trying to understand the independent effects of different components of socioeconomic status, may have missed important features of socioeconomic position. With an eye toward examining how features of socioeconomic status combine and coalesce, this paper examines variation in the income-health association by level of education. Theories derived both from medical sociology and health economics suggest synergistic interactions between income and education, but they are unclear as to the direction and magnitude of these interactions. Results from two large and nationally representative data sets (the 1996-1997 Community Tracking Study and the 1972-2000 General Social Survey) indicate that the positive relationship between income and health varies substantially in both its strength and shape by level of education. Education improves health, and its effects are larger at lower levels of income. Moreover, education reduces the strength and curvature of the income-health relationship. Consequently, those with more education have better health for all levels of income, and fewer income-based disparities exist among the well educated than among the less well educated. The linear ""gradient"" relationship between income and health is, thus, more characteristic of groups with higher levels of education. Additional analyses indicate that these interactions existed in the United States in each of the last three decades. The results are discussed in light of theory regarding the perpetuation of health disparities, as well as current debates regarding the apparent incompatibility of distributive versus aggregative goals in health policy."
19828251,1,a,"Studies on the determinants of pain-related support are needed to enhance couples-based treatments for pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which pain catastrophizing and perceived entitlement to pain-related support (i.e., support entitlement) were associated with perceived and observed social support. Participants were 106 chronic pain couples recruited from the community. They completed surveys as well as an observational discussion task. Greater support entitlement in persons with pain was correlated positively with pain catastrophizing, punishing spouse responses, and observed spousal invalidation but negatively correlated with perceived spousal support, solicitous spouse responses, and observed validation. Catastrophizing was correlated with perceptions of general spousal support but not the other support variables. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that among persons with lower levels of support entitlement, catastrophizing was associated with greater solicitous spouse responses. Among those with a greater entitlement to support, catastrophizing was associated with greater punishing spouse responses and observed invalidation by the spouse. These results suggest that support entitlement plays an important role in couples' supportive interactions about pain. Continued research is needed to determine how a desire for pain-related attention and support and catastrophizing translate into behaviors that affect support provision and receipt."
30086752,0,a,"BACKGROUND: While it is increasingly recognized that social determinants influence the health of patients and populations, little is known about how doctors in the Eastern Mediterranean Region can help their patients with these issues. Our study aimed to identify common social challenges faced by patients in Eastern Mediterranean countries, to assess what doctors are already doing to address these challenges, and to identify barriers and facilitators for addressing the social causes of poor health in Eastern Mediterranean countries with shedding some light on how does this compare to a developed country like Canada. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative research study employing qualitative descriptive methodology. A purposeful sample as well as snowballing technique were used to recruit 18 physicians who were trained in Eastern Mediterranean countries but have since moved to Canada. Recruitment continued until data saturation was reached. A content analysis was carried out after transcribing the interviews. RESULTS: The main social challenges identified in clinical care in Eastern Mediterranean Regions include poverty, illiteracy, domestic violence, and food insecurity. Doctors attempted to help their patients by providing free medical services and free medications, establishing a donation box, and referring to social workers and support services, where available. Cultural constraints, lack of time, and unavailability of referral resources were often cited as important barriers. Our participants stated that Canada is generally better in dealing with the social challenges than their countries of origin. CONCLUSIONS: Most study participants expressed their willingness to help patients in dealing with social challenges, and shared their experiences of tackling such issues, though there were also important barriers reported that would need to be overcome. Participants suggested that better addressing social challenges in clinical care would require educating both health care providers and patients about the importance of discussing the patient's social environment as part of the health care encounter, as well as advocating for broader policy approaches by governments to address the underlying social problems."
12867350,1,a,"Young adults are often in periods of transition, and lifestyle changes such as a decline in physical activity can occur during this period. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between demographic, biologic, lifestyle, social support index, environmental factors, and physical activity in young adults. The participants were 4,152 young adults from 18 to 30 years of age enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). A moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) score was calculated from responses to nine activities and up to four activities not previously listed. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between MVPA and independent variables separately for men and women. Non-Hispanic Blacks were more active than non-Hispanic White or Mexican American men, whereas, among women, non-Hispanic Whites were more active. Education, social support index, and trying to lose weight were positively associated with MVPA, whereas being married was inversely related in both men and women. Among women, those who were unemployed, in better health, had smaller families, had lower body mass indexes (BMIs), and were not from the South had higher MVPA. Men who were in school during the past 12 months were more active than those who were not in school. The results from this study suggest that demographic and social factors are important determinants of physical activity in young adults and should be considered when planning interventions."
11470388,1,a,"A population-based study of 1810 persons, aged 75+, was investigated to evaluate the role of dementia and other chronic diseases as determinants of institutionalization in the elderly. The study population was examined at baseline and after a 3-year interval. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, functional dependence, dementia, cerebrovascular disease and hip fracture were associated with living in an institution at baseline. Additionally, functional dependence, hip fracture and dementia were also associated with moving to an institution during the 3-year follow-up. In a similar analysis, including only nondemented subjects, the Mini-Mental State Examination emerged as one of the strongest determinants. The population attributable risk percentage of institutionalization during the 3-year follow-up due to dementia was 61%. This study confirms that dementia and cognitive impairment are the main contributors to institutionalization in the elderly, independently of their sociodemographic status, social network, or functional status."
16861190,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of contextual and individual factors on self-reported psychological health. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/MEASUREMENTS: The 2000 public health survey in Scania is a cross-sectional postal questionnaire study with a 59% participation rate. A total of 13,715 persons aged 18-80 answered the questionnaire. A multilevel logistic regression model, with individuals at the first level and municipalities/city quarters at the second, was performed. The effect (intra-class correlation, cross-level modification, and odds ratios) of individual and municipality/city quarter factors on self-reported psychological health was analysed. RESULTS: The crude variance between municipalities/city quarters was small but significant. It was particularly affected and lowered by individual civil status, country of origin, economic stress, and social participation. The inclusion of all individual factors age, sex, civil status, country of origin, education, economic stress, and social participation lowered the between municipality variance to not-significant levels, which is the reason why no contextual variables were included in the calculations. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that poor self-reported psychological health is affected mainly by individual characteristics of the population and not by contextual factors at the municipality/city quarter level."
18561037,1,a,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the incidence and outcome of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Switzerland and to test the feasibility of a large cohort study with case identification in the first 24 hours and 6-month follow-up. METHODS: From January to June 2005, we consecutively enrolled and followed up all persons with severe TBI (Abbreviated Injury Score of the head region >3 and Glasgow Coma Scale <9) in the catchment areas of 3 Swiss medical centres with neurosurgical facilities. The primary outcome was the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) after 6 months. Secondary outcomes included survival, Functional Independence Mea - sure (FIM), and health-related quality of life (SF-12) at defined time-points up to 6 months after injury. RESULTS: We recruited 101 participants from a source population of about 2.47 million (ie, about 33% of Swiss population). The incidence of severe TBI was 8.2 per 100,000 person-years. The overall case fatality was 70%: 41 of 101 persons (41%) died at the scene of the accident. 23 of 60 hospitalised participants (38%) died within 48 hours, and 31 (53%) within 6 months. In all hospitalised patients, the median GOSE was 1 (range 1-8) after 6 months, and was 6 (2-8) in 6-month survivors. The median total FIM score was 125 (range 18-126); median-SF-12 component mea - sures were 44 (25-55) for the physical scale and 52 (32-65) for the mental scale. CONCLUSIONS: Severe TBI was associated with high case fatality and considerable morbidity in survivors. We demonstrated the feasibility of a multicentre cohort study in Switzerland with the aim of identifying modifiable determinants of outcome and improving current trauma care."
29433468,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major global public health problem with more than 800,000 incidents worldwide annually. Seventy-five percent of the global suicides occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Pakistan is a LMIC where information on suicidal behavior is limited. The aim of the review is to map available literature on determinants, risk factors and other variables of suicidal behavior in Pakistan. METHOD: This study was based on Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework of scoping review, combining peer reviewed publications with grey literature. Ten databases including Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Cochrane Trials Register (CRG), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), National Library of Medicine Gateway (NLMG), ExcerptaMedica (EMBASE), National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE (PUBMED), PSYCHINFO, Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index (SCI) and Pakmedinet.com were searched from the beginning of their time frames until December 2016 using a combination of key terms. The inclusion criteria included studies of various study designs covering different aspects of suicidal behavior in English language. RESULTS: Six hundred and twenty three articles were initially retrieved from all ten databases. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts for relevance. One hundred and eighteen articles were read in full, out of which 11 were excluded because they did not fit the eligibility criteria. One hundred and ten articles, including two student theses and one report, were included in the final review. Most studies were descriptive in nature, with only three that used a case-control design. Majority of the studies were from urban areas, and addressed determinants rather than risk factors. Gender differences and age were predominantly reported, with more males committing suicide. Suicidal behavior was more common among individuals younger than 30 years of age. The three most common methods for suicides were hanging, poisoning and use of firearms. Mental illness as a risk factor for suicides was mentioned in only three studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review is the first attempt to synthesize available literature on suicidal behavior in Pakistan. The evidence is limited, and calls for more robust analytical research designs, along with a focus on risk factors."
12880519,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the vast scientific literature on the social determinants of health, there is still a debate on the extent to which this relationship remains in old age. The objective of this study was to examine the association between socioeconomic circumstances and health among older adults in a small town in Brazil. METHODS: The study was carried out in Bambui, a town of around 15 000 inhabitants that is located in the state of Minas Gerais, which is in southeastern Brazil. From 1 177 residents aged 65 years or older, 1 074 of them (91.2%) were interviewed and 997 (84.7%) were examined (physical measurements and blood tests). Those in the lowest third of the distribution of total household monthly income, with an income of less than US$ 240 per month, were compared with those who had an income above that level. RESULTS: Lower family income was independently associated with: (1) some lifestyle risk factors (less consumption of fresh fruits or vegetables and less frequent exercise during leisure time in the preceding 30 days), (2) several indicators of worse health status (General Health Questionnaire score, self-rated health, self-rated visual acuity, level of difficulty in walking 300 meters, inability to perform routine activities because of a health problem in the preceding 2 weeks, and seropositivity for Trypanosoma cruzi), (3) a higher number of nonprescribed medications used in the preceding 3 months, and (4) a higher number of hospitalizations in the preceding 12 months. Obesity was more frequent in the higher-income group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not confirm observations in some developed countries of a lack of association between socioeconomic status and health among the aged. Our results showed that a small difference in monthly family income was sufficiently sensitive to identify elderly persons in worse health, even within a community that appears to be uniformly poor."
20587762,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic rheumatological disorder among southern Chinese patients in Hong Kong, with an estimated prevalence of 0.33%-0.35%. The resulting chronic pain, disability, social stress, and isolation contribute to the development of psychiatric symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The authors identify the prevalence and determining factors of psychiatric disorders in patients with RA. METHOD: Consecutive RA patients (N=200) were recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic. Psychiatric disorders were diagnosed by a psychiatrist using the Chinese-bilingual Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, Patient Research Version. Sociodemographic and clinical data and subjective health status and perceived social support data were also collected. Factors associated with the occurrence of psychiatric disorders were studied by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were diagnosed with a current psychiatric disorder (depressive disorders, 14.5%; anxiety disorders, 13.0%; schizophrenia, 0.5%). Major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were the commonest current mood and anxiety disorders, respectively. Independent predictors for a current psychiatric disorder were poverty and perceived poor social support. Limited social interaction, perceived poor social support, high pain intensity, and a family history of psychiatric disorders were independently associated with a current depressive disorder, whereas poverty and perceived poor social support were associated with a current anxiety disorder. CONCLUSION: Depression and anxiety are common in Chinese patients with RA. Patients who lack social support or rely on economic assistance are more prone to the development of psychiatric disorders."
19324728,1,a,"Mammalian societies in which females dominate males are rare, and the factors favouring the evolution of female dominance have yet to be clearly identified. We propose a new hypothesis for the evolution of female dominance and test its predictions with empirical data from the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a well-studied species characterized by female dominance. We suggest that constraints imposed by the development of a feeding apparatus specialized for bone cracking, in combination with the intensive feeding competition characteristic of spotted hyenas, led to the evolution of female dominance. Specifically, we propose that protracted development of the feeding apparatus in young hyenas led to selection for increased aggressiveness in females as a compensatory mechanism for mothers to secure food access for their young after weaning. Our analyses yielded results consistent with this hypothesis. Morphological and behavioural measurements indicate that skull development is indeed protracted in this species; spotted hyenas do not achieve adult skull size or feeding performance capabilities until after sexual maturity. The period between weaning and completed skull development is particularly challenging, as indicated by high mortality. Finally, maternal presence between weaning and full skull maturity, as well as the relative ability of females to aggressively displace conspecifics from food, are important determinants of offspring survival."
22335180,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Humanitarian crises are associated with an increase in mental disorders and psychological distress. Despite the emerging consensus on intervention strategies in humanitarian settings, the field of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in humanitarian settings lacks a consensus-based research agenda. METHODS: From August 2009 to February 2010, we contacted policymakers, academic researchers, and humanitarian aid workers, and conducted nine semistructured focus group discussions with 114 participants in three locations (Peru, Uganda, and Nepal), in both the capitals and remote humanitarian settings. Local stakeholders representing a range of academic expertise (psychiatry, psychology, social work, child protection, and medical anthropology) and organizations (governments, universities, nongovernmental organizations, and U.N. agencies) were asked to identify priority questions for MHPSS research in humanitarian settings, and to discuss factors that hamper and facilitate research. RESULTS: Thematic analyses of transcripts show that participants broadly agreed on prioritized research themes in the following order: (1) the prevalence and burden of mental health and psychosocial difficulties in humanitarian settings, (2) how MHPSS implementation can be improved, (3) evaluation of specific MHPSS interventions, (4) the determinants of mental health and psychological distress, and (5) improved research methods and processes. Rather than differences in research themes across countries, what emerged was a disconnect between different groups of stakeholders regarding research processes: the perceived lack of translation of research findings into actual policy and programs; misunderstanding of research methods by aid workers; different appreciation of the time needed to conduct research; and disputed universality of research constructs. CONCLUSIONS: To advance a collaborative research agenda, actors in this field need to bridge the perceived disconnect between the goals of ""relevance"" and ""excellence."" Research needs to be more sensitive to questions and concerns arising from humanitarian interventions, and practitioners need to take research findings into account in designing interventions."
30624729,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Co-infection of human tuberculosis (TB) and intestinal parasites infections (IPIs) is a public health problem, especially in low- and middle-income countries. There is no data on this issue in Iran. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of IPIs among patients with TB in Iran. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 161 patients with TB and 181 healthy people (non-TB group). Standard parasitological methods including direct slide smear, formalin-ether concentration, trichrome, modified Ziehl-Neelsen and chromotrope 2R staining techniques were used for detection of intestinal protozoa and helminths. Nested-PCR and sequence analysis were used to identify the genotypes of Cryptosporidium and human-infecting species of microsporidia. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 16. RESULTS: The frequency of IPIs in the non-TB group (16.5%) was slightly lower than in patients with TB (21.1%), although statistical significance was not observed (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.43-1.27; P= 0.28). Blastocystis (11.8%) was the most common parasite detected in patients with TB. Infection with multiple parasites in the non-TB group (2.2%) was significantly lower than in patients with TB (7.5%) (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08-0.88; P=0.02). The ova of Taenia spp., Ascaris lumbricoides and Hyamenolepis nana were identified in three patients with TB (1.9%), while only one person (0.5%) in the non-TB group was infected with Enterobius vermicularis. The results of genotyping revealed two C. parvum subtype families (IIa and IId) and three E. bieneusi genotypes (Ebcar4, IH and jLD-1). CONCLUSION: Our results showed a higher prevalence of IPIs in patients with TB in comparison with non-TB subjects. Moreover, our findings suggest a proper health education program for good personal hygiene habits, and also preventative measures to avoid the acquisition of IPIs in patients with TB."
26374502,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Determinants of waterpipe use in adolescents are believed to differ from those for other tobacco products, but there is a lack of studies of possible social, cultural, or psychological aspects of waterpipe use in this population. This study applied a socioecological model to explore waterpipe use, and its relationship to other tobacco use in Swedish adolescents. METHODS: A total of 106 adolescents who attended an urban high-school in northern Sweden responded to an anonymous questionnaire. Prevalence rates for waterpipe use were examined in relation to socio-demographics, peer pressure, sensation seeking behavior, harm perception, environmental factors, and depression. RESULTS: Thirty-three percent reported ever having smoked waterpipe (ever use), with 30% having done so during the last 30 days (current use). Among waterpipe ever users, 60% had ever smoked cigarettes in comparison to 32% of non-waterpipe smokers (95% confidence interval 1.4-7.9). The odds of having ever smoked waterpipe were three times higher among male high school seniors as well as students with lower grades. Waterpipe ever users had three times higher odds of having higher levels of sensation-seeking (95% confidence interval 1.2-9.5) and scored high on the depression scales (95% confidence interval 1.6-6.8) than non-users. The odds of waterpipe ever use were four times higher for those who perceived waterpipe products to have pleasant smell compared to cigarettes (95% confidence interval 1.7-9.8). Waterpipe ever users were twice as likely to have seen waterpipe use on television compared to non-users (95% confidence interval 1.1-5.7). The odds of having friends who smoked regularly was eight times higher for waterpipe ever users than non-users (95% confidence interval 2.1-31.2). CONCLUSION: The current study reports a high use of waterpipe in a select group of students in northern Sweden. The study adds the importance of looking at socioecological determinants of use, including peer pressure and exposure to media marketing, as well as mental health among users."
26347544,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The social context of poverty is consistently linked to Trichomonas vaginalis infection, yet few studies regarding T. vaginalis have been conducted exclusively among low-income individuals. We identified social determinants of health associated with prevalent T. vaginalis infection among homeless and unstably housed adult women. METHODS: Between April and October of 2010, we conducted cross-sectional T. vaginalis screening and behavioural interviews in an existing cohort of San Francisco homeless and unstably housed women. Data were analysed using multivariable logistical regression. RESULTS: Among 245 study participants, the median age was 47 years and 72% were of non-Caucasian race/ethnicity. T. vaginalis prevalence was 12%, compared to 3% in the general population, and 33% of infected individuals reported no gynaecological symptoms. In adjusted analysis, the odds of T. vaginalis infection were lower among persons older than 47 years, the population median (OR=0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.38), and higher among those reporting recent short-term homeless shelter stays (OR=5.36, 95% CI 1.57 to 18.26). Race and income did not reach levels of significance. Sensitivity analyses indicated that testing all women who report recent unprotected sex would identify more infections than testing those who report gynaecological symptoms (20/30 vs 10/30; p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of T. vaginalis is high among homeless and unstably housed adult women, over one-third of infected individuals have no gynaecological symptoms, and correlates of infection differ from those reported in the general population. Targeted screening and treatment among impoverished women reporting recent unprotected sex, particularly young impoverished women and all women experiencing short-term homelessness, may reduce complications related to this treatable infection."
20406452,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of studies considering social disparity in oral health emanating from adolescents in low-income countries. This study aimed to assess socio-demographic disparities in clinical- and self reported oral health status and a number of oral health behaviors. The extent to which oral health related behaviors might account for socio-demographic disparities in oral health status was also examined. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Kilwa district in 2008. One thousand seven hundred and forty five schoolchildren completed an interview and a full mouth clinical examination. Caries experience was recorded using WHO criteria, whilst type of treatment need was categorized using the ART approach. RESULTS: The majority of students were caries free (79.8%) and presented with a low need for dental treatment (89.3%). Compared to their counterparts in opposite groups, rural residents and those from less poor households presented more frequently with caries experience (DMT>0), high need for dental treatment and poor oral hygiene behavior, but were less likely to report poor oral health status. Stepwise logistic regressions revealed that social and behavioral variables varied systematically with caries experience, high need for dental treatment and poor self reported oral health. Socio-demographic disparities in oral health outcomes persisted after adjusting for oral health behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-demographic disparities in oral health outcomes and oral health behaviors do exist. Socio-demographic disparities in oral health outcomes were marginally accounted for by oral health behaviors. Developing policies and programs targeting both social and individual determinants of oral health should be an urgent public health strategy in Tanzania."
17876483,1,a,"More than any other low- and middle-income country, Brazil has the longest research tradition of establishing, maintaining and exploiting birth cohort studies. This research pedigree is highlighted in the present issue of the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research, which contains a series of twelve papers from the Ribeirao Preto and Sao Luis birth cohort studies from the Southeast and Northeast of Brazil, respectively. The topics covered in this raft of reports vary and include predictors of perinatal health and maternal risk factors, early life determinants of cardiovascular risk factors in childhood and adolescence, use of health services, and a description of dietary characteristics of young adults, amongst other topics. There is also a guide to the background, objectives, sampling and protocols employed across these studies, which, together with similar pieces published in past issues of the Brazilian Journal, serve as a very useful starting point, particularly for potential collaborators. In the fervent hope that further follow-up of these cohorts will take place--we provide our own justification for cohort maintenance and extension in this issue--future data collection could include: genetic material, atherosclerosis, ascertained, for instance, by intima-media thickness, and IQ testing in children--scores from which are emerging as potentially important predictors of adult health outcomes up to six decades later."
28334984,0,a,"Background: Guidance on how different disciplines from the natural, behavioural and social sciences can collaborate to resolve complex public health problems is lacking. This article presents a checklist to support researchers and principle investigators to develop and implement interdisciplinary collaborations. Methods: Fourteen individuals, representing 10 disciplines, participated in in-depth interviews to explore the strengths and challenges of working together on an interdisciplinary project to identify the determinants of substance use and gambling disorders, and to make recommendations for future interdisciplinary teams. Data were analysed thematically and a checklist was derived from insights offered by participants during interview and discussion among the authors on the implications of findings. Results: Participants identified 18 scientific, interactional and structural strengths and challenges of interdisciplinary research. These findings were used to develop an 18-item BASICS checklist to support future interdisciplinary collaborations. The five domains of the checklist are: (i) Blueprint, (ii) Attitudes, (iii) Staffing, (iv) Interactions and (v) Core Science. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary work has the potential to advance public health science but the numerous challenges should not be underestimated. Use of a checklist, such as BASICS, when planning and managing projects may help future collaborations to avoid some of the common pitfalls of interdisciplinary research."
10786724,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyse the associations between the food variety score (FVS), dietary diversity score (DDS) and nutritional status of children, and to assess the associations between FVS, DDS and socioeconomic status (SES) on a household level. The study also assessed urban and rural differences in FVS and DDS. DESIGN: Cross-sectional studies in 1994/95, including a simplified food frequency questionnaire on food items used in the household the previous day. A socioeconomic score was generated, based on possessions in the households. Weight and height were measured for all children aged 6-59 months in the households, and anthropometric indices were generated. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Three hundred and twenty-nine urban and 488 rural households with 526 urban and 1789 rural children aged 6-59 months in Koutiala County, Sikasso Region, Mali. RESULTS: Children from urban households with a low FVS or DDS had a doubled risk (OR>2) for being stunted and underweight. Those relations were not found in the rural area. There was an association between SES and both FVS and DDS on the household level in both areas. The FVS and DDS in urban households with the lowest SES were higher than the FVS and DDS among the rural households with the highest SES. CONCLUSIONS: Food variety and dietary diversity seem to be associated with nutritional status (weight/age and height/age) of children in heterogeneous communities, as our data from urban areas showed. In rural areas, however, this association could not be shown. Socioeconomic factors seem to be important determinants for FVS and DDS both in urban and rural areas. FVS and DDS are useful variables in assessing the nutritional situation of households, particular in urban areas."
26900440,0,a,"BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS is one of the diseases which not only makes threats to physical health, but also, due to the negative attitudes of people and the social stigma, affects the emotional and social health of patients. The aim of this study was to identify the psychological, social, and family problems of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Iran. METHODS: In this qualitative study, we used purposive sampling to enroll PLWHA, their families, and physicians and consultants in two cities of Kermanshah and Tehran. Each group of PLWHA, their families, physicians, and consultants participated in two focus group discussions (FGDs), and a total of eight FGDs were conducted. Six interviews were held with all key people, individually. RESULTS: Based on the views and opinions of various groups involved in the study, the main problems of PLWHA were: Ostracism, depression, anxiety, a tendency to get revenge and lack of fear to infect others, frustration, social isolation, relationship problems, and fear due to the social stigma. Their psychological problems included: Marriage problems, family conflict, lack of family support, economic hardships inhibiting marriage, and social rejection of patient's families. Their family problems were: Unemployment, the need for housing, basic needs, homelessness, and lack of social support associations. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the identification and focusing on psychological, social, and family problems of affected people not only is an important factor for disease prevention and control, but also enables patients to have a better response to complications caused by HIV/AIDS."
22446140,0,a,"This paper examines the determinants of recycling behaviour among 200 university students from the perspective of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Data was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling technique. Findings indicate that environmental awareness was significantly related to attitude towards recycling, whilst attitude and social norms had significant impact on recycling behaviour. However, convenience and cost of recycling were not significant reasons for recycling. The study has enhanced the understanding of the determinants of recycling behaviour and has implications for schools and governmental agencies in educating and encouraging positive recycling behaviour. It also confirms the appropriateness of the TPB in examining studies of this nature. Further suggestions for future research are offered."
17705873,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The inappropriate use of emergency room (ER) service by patients with non-urgent health problems is a worldwide problem. Inappropriate ER use makes it difficult to guarantee access for real emergency cases, decreases readiness for care, produces negative spillover effects on the quality of emergency services, and raises overall costs. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a medium-sized city in southern Brazil. The urgency of the presenting complaint was defined according to the Hospital Urgencies Appropriateness Protocol (HUAP). Multivariable Poisson regression was carried out to examine factors associated with inappropriate ER use. RESULTS: The study interviewed 1,647 patients over a consecutive 13-day sampling period. The prevalence of inappropriate ER use was 24.2% (95% CI 22.1-26.3). Inappropriate ER use was inversely associated with age (P = 0.001), longer stay in the waiting room, longer duration of symptoms and morning shift. However, the determinants of inappropriate ER use differed according age groups (P value for interaction = 0.04). Within the younger age-group (15-49 years), inappropriate ER use was higher among females, patients who reported visiting the ER because there was no other place to go, patients reporting that the doctor at the regular place of care refused to attend to them without a prior appointment, and individuals who reported that the PHC clinic which they use is open for shorter periods during the day. Among older patients (50+ years), those with highest level of education, absence of self-reported chronic diseases and lack of social support were more likely to engage in higher inappropriate ER use. CONCLUSION: Efforts should be made to redirect inappropriate ER demand. Besides expanding access to, and improving the quality of primary and secondary care, it is important to mobilize social support for older patients, to enhance the relationship between different levels of care, as well as to develop campaigns to educate the public about the appropriate use of medical services."
18266107,1,a,"This qualitative pilot study explored the mental health needs of visible minority immigrants in St. John's--a small urban center in Atlantic Canada with limited ethnoracial diversity and ethnospecific infrastructure. The study examined the facilitators and barriers to maintaining immigrants' mental health and their perspectives on availability and access to support services and programs that support mental health. Our findings revealed several determinants of the mental health of visible minority immigrants: social support, income, employment, culture, physical environment, coping skills, gender, and availability, accessibility and cultural appropriateness of mental health services. We offer 18 recommendations framed by Health Canada determinants of health that may be of interest to decision-makers in government, health agencies and social services in similar small urban centers."
17920743,1,a,"Increased risk of tuberculosis is widely recognized to be associated with increased poverty, yet there have been few analyses of the social determinants of tuberculosis, particularly in high-burden settings. We conducted a multilevel analysis of self-reported tuberculosis disease in a nationally representative sample of South Africans based on the 1998 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Individual and household-level demographic, behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors were taken from the DHS; data on community-level socioeconomic status (including measures of absolute wealth and income inequality) were derived from the 1996 national census. Of the 13,043 DHS respondents, 0.5% reported having been diagnosed with tuberculosis disease in the past 12 months and 2.8% reported having been diagnosed with tuberculosis disease in their lifetime. In a multivariate model adjusting for demographic and behavioral risk factors, tuberculosis diagnosis was associated with cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and low body mass index, as well as a lower level of personal education, unemployment and lower household wealth. In a model including individual- and household-level risk factors, high levels of community income inequality were independently associated with increased prevalence of tuberculosis (adjusted odds ratio for lifetime tuberculosis comparing the most unequal quintile to the middle quintile of inequality: 2.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.59-3.53). These results provide novel insights into the socioeconomic determinants of tuberculosis in developing country settings, although the mechanisms through which income inequality may affect tuberculosis disease require further investigation."
19402801,1,a,"A brief summary of key presentations at the 15th Annual International Society for Quality of Life conference is presented. Special highlights of this conference were its location (South America) and its aim to present current and potential contributions of the health-related quality of life (QoL) field to equity in healthcare at a clinical and population level, providing crucial inputs for decision-making in a person-centered health conception. Present and future utilization of health-related QoL measures, norms and bank items were introduced by David Cella, who also called for researchers' cooperation, stating that efforts towards a commonly shared language and metric are better than a relentless pursuit of perfection. Other central topics in the search of equity were stigma and poverty. The importance of negative attributes by others in stigma severity perception and low self-reported QoL was demonstrated by Donald Patrick, who suggested interventions for reducing stigma. Poverty impact on children's QoL and the importance of social determinants were demonstrated through a unique, longitudinal Brazilian study. Complementarily, the importance of a biological basis of oncologic symptoms, particularly cytokines, and the impact of their control on health-related QoL were addressed by Charles Cleeland. The meeting stressed the combined importance of social, psychological and biological factors in determining patient-reported outcomes."
19769587,1,a,"Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 has been shown to suppress the growth of a wide range of microbial plant pathogens as well as invertebrate pests such as root nematodes. Hydrogen cyanide, a secondary metabolite produced by the bacterium, has been credited as being one of the determinants of its biocontrol ability. The use of biocontrol agents against social insect pests such as termite Odontotermes obesus has limitations because of behavioural adaptations that include (1) removal of the pathogen when grooming by the termites and (2) isolation of infested members of the colony. In this study, we show that cyanide of bacterial origin may inhibit cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) of the termite respiratory chain and demonstrate that HCN-producing bacteria such as P. fluorescens can actually kill a macroscopic insect pest by cyanide poisoning. This ability of pseudomonad metabolites such as cyanide, which can bring about pest death by blocking respiration through inhibition of CCO rather than infection or predation, can potentially overcome the behavioural adaptations of social insect pests such as termites and represents an attractive option for insect pest management."
25125929,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Female genital mutilation/cutting is a harmful practice which has effect on female's wellbeing. However, the practice has continued to prevail in many cultures. Research on the social determinants of the practice and its continuation are scarce. The objective of this study was to assess whether attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation is predicted by gender role perception among adolescents in Jimma zone. METHODS: This study used data collected in the first round of Jimma Longitudinal Family Survey of Youth. A total of 2084 adolescents were identified from 3700 households and one adolescent were interviewed from each household using structured questionnaire. Data on the socio-demographic characteristics, religiosity, access to electronic media, perception of gender role, attitude towards continuation of Female circumcision was collected. Descriptive and multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze the data using SPSS for windows version 16.0. Statically tests were performed at the level of significance of 5%. RESULTS: Of the 2084 adolescents, 1146 (55.0%) were aged 12-14 years, 1025 (49.2%) females and 749 (35.9%) from rural areas. The majority, 1289 (61.9%) were Muslims and 1351 (64.8%) Oromo. Five hundred seventy three (28.1%) of the male youth did not agree to the importance of marrying a circumcised girl. However, 149 (13.8%) and 258 (12.7%) agreed that it is very important and important, to marry a circumcised girl, respectively. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, perception of gender role, sex, place of residence, highest education in the household and religion remained to be important predictors of attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation after adjustment for age and ethnicity. Adolescents who had low gender role perception were 1.4 times more likely to have a positive attitude towards the continuation of the female genital mutilation (OR: 95%CI, 1.41: 1.02-1.94). Female adolescents were 36% less likely to support (P<0.01) the continuation of FGM compared to their male counter parts (OR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.49, 0.83). Compared to urban youth, those who live in semi urban and rural areas were 1.46 and 1.52 times more likely to have a positive attitude towards the continuation of the FGM practice, respectively (P<0.05). Similarly the Probability of having positive attitude towards the continuation of the FGM practice decreased steadily as the highest educational level in the household increased. CONCLUSION: One-fifth of the youth support the continuation of the practice. Low gender roles perception, being from the rural areas, household's lower level of education and being Muslim were strong predictors of the attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation. Improving perception of adolescents towards gender roles through effective behavior change communication, and involving religious leaders in the campaign against the practice of female genital mutilation is recommended as a useful strategy to ban the practice."
24304425,0,a,"The relationship between history of childhood sexual abuse and psychopathology in adult life is well established. However, understanding of the mechanisms by which abuse exerts its effects is limited. To our knowledge, this is the first study which investigates the relationship between a wide range of sexual abuse characteristics (i.e. age at onset, frequency of assaults, number of perpetrators and their relationship to the victim) and the severity of psychopathological disorders in a large sample of adult child sexual abuse (CSA) survivors who attended a specialist Psychotherapy Service for CSA survivors. CSA survivors in our study experienced severe sexual assault(s) in their early years and presented with severe pathology which could suggest a strong causal link. However, none of the examined trauma characteristics significantly predicted severity of psychopathology. This may suggest that for severely disordered, treatment-seeking CSA survivors post-abuse psychopathology could be caused by other factors. The study adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that CSA effects may be dependent on factors which are not necessarily related to the nature of sexual abuse. The study findings will help improve clinicians' insight into the determinants of psychopathology."
15112009,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine factors predictive of the score on the visual analogue scale (VAS) of the EQ-5D questionnaire. METHODS: The responses of 1159 residents of a socially and ethnically diverse suburb of Cape Town, South Africa, to the EQ-5D questionnaire were analysed using forward stepwise multiple regression. The variables entered included ethnic group, religious affiliation (Christian or Muslim), income level, unemployment, recent illness or disability and each level of the five EQ-5D domains. FINDINGS: The model developed accounted for an adjusted r(2) of 0.234 and included 11 variables. In addition to the EQ-5D domains, the presence of a disability, an income of less than 420 US dollars per month, unemployment and age in years were significant predictors of VAS score. CONCLUSION: The substantial contribution of health state to the VAS indicates that it is a valid measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across population groups. However, the subjects with lower social status reported a worse HRQoL than their health state alone warranted and this variable might need to be taken into account if the VAS is to be used to compare health states across populations. This paper provides empirical evidence of how HRQoL is perceived by different socioeconomic, cultural, ethnic and religious communities within a developing country."
15791922,1,a,"Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder affecting girls, caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. There are no population-based data on the extent and determinants of health service use in this disorder. The population-based registry, the Australian Rett Syndrome database, was the source of phenotype data. This also contains data from mutation screening and X-inactivation studies. Data on retrospective (n = 152) and prospective (n = 162) health service use were collected in 2000 from a questionnaire and a calendar study, respectively. Health service use was highest in younger cases (P = .001) and lowest in cases with milder phenotypes (P < .001). Random X-inactivation was associated with service use (P = .02). Maternal education, phenotype, and individual mutations were determinants of health service use. The use of a retrospective and prospective data set enabled accurate assessment of service use in Rett syndrome. Both genetic and sociodemographic determinants of health service use were identified, with important implications for the optimal and equitable management of children with Rett syndrome."
19231726,1,a,"Interventions implemented by governments are very frequently related to the determinants of health. Health impact assessment (HIA) is used as a predictive tool to include health in nonhealth policymaking. This paper defines HIA, describes its methods, procedures and applications, and discusses opportunities and challenges associated with HIA. Doing a HIA implies studying the intervention, profiling the target population, and estimating its impacts on health by means of combining quantitative and qualitative evidence. HIA has been used in different kinds of policies (transports, urban regeneration, culture, energy development etc.), at different levels (local, national, European) and in many countries. Despite its scarce use in Spain, HIA allows to consider health in sectorial policymaking, taking into account social inequalities in health, so that healthier public policies can be designed. On the other hand, HIA is a tool under methodological development which use is hindered due to the existing narrow biomedical perspective on the determinants of health, and to the difficulties in working in public policy-making with multisectorial and participative perspectives."
15571115,1,a,"The authors used a standardized questionnaire to survey 201 international and 193 German students at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, to determine differences in health practices between the 2 groups and to identify targets for health-promoting interventions. Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that long-term female international students (those whose duration of residency in Germany was more than 2 years) had lower levels of physical activity and alcohol consumption than their German counterparts and higher rates of smoking independently associated with international citizenship. Short-term international female students were less likely than German students to receive social support. Among men, long-term international student status was associated with daily smoking and inconsistent seat belt use, whereas short-term student status was associated with a lower rate of seat belt use, a higher level of perceived stress, and a healthier diet, compared with domestic students. Findings from the study could give rise to health-promotion activities for international students at German universities; additional studies at other European universities are necessary before making further recommendations."
27091286,0,a,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess quality of life (QOL) and its determinants in Iranian postmenopausal women. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted using cluster sampling design. The samples consisted of postmenopausal women aged 40-60 years with total household in Rasht city (north Iran) as the sample frame. Quality of life was assessed by Menopause-Specific QOL (MENQOL) Questionnaire. Mean domain scores and factors related to the higher score of each domain were determined. RESULTS: Findings showed that the mean scores for each domain were: vasomotor: 2.14 +/- 1.49; psycho-social: 1.56 +/- 0.85; physical: 1.91 +/- 0.52 and sexual: 1.37 +/- 1.05. Comparing the median of the studied domains, physical domain had the worst score in menopausal women. Pain in joint and muscle, one item of physical domain, had the highest score. The univariate analysis demonstrated that women aged 60-65 (p < 0.0001), women with postmenopausal stage 5 or more years (p < 0.0001), married women (p < 0.05), women holding higher education degree (p < 0.05), employed women (p < 0.05), women with a body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m(2) (p < 0.05) and women who do physical activity (p < 0.05) showed better QOL. Based on Logistic Regression model, the predictive factors of normal QOL in menopause status were: age, husband education, score of Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and BMI. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that menopause-related symptoms had negative impact on QOL. Confirmation by further research is needed."
11048582,1,a,"Aiming to analyze the mild to moderate growth retardation associate factors in children at school age, a case control study was conducted with 153 pairs of seven and eight years old children from public schools of the outskirts of the city. The cases were defined as children with a height for age(H/A) between -1 and -2 Z score, according to NCHS/WHO standards, and matched with a H/A +/- 0.5 Z-score children of same age, gender, school, classroom and class time, as controls. The height was measured at school according to WHO rules by trained professionals, and household visits were carried out to obtain environmental and socio-economic data. Initially the data was analyzed by the univariate conditional method and then, the statistically significant variables were included in a model of multivariate logistic regression analysis. As a result, the risk factors remaining at the end of the multivariate analyses, by Odds Ratio and it's 95% Confidence Interval were respectively:--mother's height: for each decrease of one standard deviation the OR increased 1.84(CI: 1.35 to 2.49); inadequate feeding pattern: OR = 2.12; CI: 1.17 to 3.83, very low socio-economic level: OR = 9.2; CI: 3.35 to 25.13, low birth weight: OR = 2.59; CI: 1.44 to 4.63 and smoking during pregnancy: OR = 1.75; CI: 0.98 to 3.12. These results highlight the environment as a determinant factor for growth performance during the first years of the child's life. Despite this, the significant OR for Mother's height allows the assumption that besides the environment, the parent's height has to be considered as one of the determinants of height deficit, even for the low socioeconomic level."
12038742,1,a,"The authors describe the use of a stress process model by the East Side Village Health Worker Partnership (ESVHWP), a project of the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center, as a framework for understanding social determinants of health. Specifically, the authors describe the development by the ESVHWP Steering Committee of a context-specific stress process model for east side Detroit residents. The authors examine data from in-depth interviews to illuminate actions taken by community members to reduce stressors or minimize their impact on health. Finally, the authors describe the use of this context-specific stress process model and data gathered regarding actions to address community stressors to inform the development of interventions by the ESVHWP to reduce stressors or strengthen the conditioning factors that reduce the impact of stress on health. On the basis of these results, the authors discuss opportunities and challenges for partnership approaches to addressing social determinants of health in urban communities."
31798898,0,a,"Objective: Investigating demographic and socioeconomic factors as intersecting rather than as separate dimensions may improve our understanding of the heterogeneous distribution of type 2 diabetes in the population. However, this complexity has scarcely been investigated and we still do not know the accuracy of these factors for predicting type 2 diabetes. Improved understanding of the demographic and socioeconomic disparities predicting type 2 diabetes risk in the population would contribute to more precise and effective public health interventions. Research design and methods: We analyzed the risk of type 2 diabetes among 4 334 030 individuals aged 40-84 years who by 2010 had resided in Sweden for at least 5 years. We stratified the study population into 120 strata defined by categories of age, gender, income, education, and immigration status. We calculated measures of absolute risk (prevalence) and relative risk (prevalence ratio), and quantified the discriminatory accuracy of the information for predicting type 2 diabetes in the population. Results: The distribution of type 2 diabetes risk in the population was highly heterogeneous. For instance, immigrated men aged 70-79 years with low educational achievement and low income had a risk around 32 times higher than native women aged 40-49 years with high income and high educational achievement (ie, 17.6% vs 0.5%). The discriminatory accuracy of the information was acceptable. Conclusion: A more detailed, intersectional mapping of socioeconomic and demographic distribution of type 2 diabetes can assist in public health management aiming to reduce the prevalence of the disease."
31765027,0,a,"This study describes how incarcerated people understand: (a) Adverse experiences, mental health, and substance use disorders as determinants of incarceration, (b) the role of gender in impacting this understanding, and (c) strategies to prevent incarceration. Ecosocial theory provides a theoretical framework. Open-ended interviews were conducted (December 2016-January 2017) with recently incarcerated adults in Massachusetts state prisons. Participants described determinants of incarceration and incarceration prevention strategies. Interviews were coded thematically using inductive and deductive approaches. Thirty participants, evenly split by gender, reported themes across four levels: Society (lacking basic needs, discrimination), community (neighborhood factors), interpersonal (trauma), and individual (social isolation, mental health, substance use). However, there were variations in themes by gender. Proposed prevention strategies included early access to quality individualized cross-system services. In conclusion, findings highlight how investing in social and community building services could prevent incarceration. Policies can support these services by redirecting funding."
23179742,0,a,"PURPOSE: To examine the frequency, distribution and determinants of a change in recovery expectations following non-life threatening acute orthopaedic trauma to Victorian workers. It is proposed that interventions to modify recovery expectations may reduce the burden associated with injury. However, it is not known whether recovery expectations change over time or the factors that are associated with change. METHODS: A prospective inception cohort study was carried out in which participants were recruited following presentation to hospital for treatment of their injury and followed for 6 months post-injury. Baseline data was obtained by survey and medical record review. Binary logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with a change in recovery expectations between week 2 and week 12 post-injury. RESULTS: The cohort comprised injured workers (n = 145) who had sustained nonlife threatening acute orthopaedic trauma. Factors associated with an improvement in recovery expectations or recovery timeframe included more years of education and higher social functioning. Participants whose injury involved a perception of responsibility by a third party were 7.18 (95 % CI 1.86-27.68) times more likely to change their recovery expectations to more negative expectations and less likely to change to an earlier recovery timeframe. Participants with more severe injuries were more likely to change their recovery timeframe to a longer timeframe. CONCLUSION: Change in recovery expectations provide some information on injured workers who may benefit from targeted interventions to improve or maintain recovery expectations. The post-injury time-point at which recovery expectations are measured is important if recovery expectations are to inform long-term outcomes."
28605549,0,a,"Social, ecological, and climatic factors interact creating a heterogeneous matrix that determines the spatiotemporal distribution of mosquitoes and human risks of exposure to the diseases they transmit. We explore linkages between the social and institutional processes behind residential abandonment, urban ecology, and the interactions of socio-ecological processes with abiotic drivers of mosquito production. Specifically, we test the relative roles of infrastructure degradation and vegetation for explaining the presence of Aedes albopictus Skuse 1894 to better predict spatial heterogeneity in mosquito exposure risk within urban environments. We further examine how precipitation interacts with these socially underpinned biophysical variables. We use a hierarchical statistical modeling approach to assess how environmental and climatic conditions over 3 years influence mosquito ecology across a socioeconomic gradient in Baltimore, MD. We show that decaying infrastructure and vegetation are important determinants of Ae. albopictus infestation. We demonstrate that both precipitation and vegetation influence mosquito production in ways that are mediated by the level of infrastructural decay on a given block. Mosquitoes were more common on blocks with greater abandonment, but when precipitation was low, mosquitoes were more likely to be found in higher-income neighborhoods with managed container habitat. Likewise, although increased vegetation was a negative predictor of mosquito infestation, more vegetation on blocks with high abandonment was associated with the largest mosquito populations. These findings indicate that fine spatial scale modeling of mosquito habitat within urban areas is needed to more accurately target vector control."
10899475,1,a,"PURPOSE: To identify risk and protective factors for initiation of sexual intercourse before age 16 years at the level of the individual, family, and school. METHODS: A longitudinal study based on a cohort of 1020 people born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972/73 and followed up to age 21 years. Demographic characteristics of the sample were similar to the New Zealand population of that age, except that a smaller proportion (3%) were Maori or Pacific Island Polynesian. Information on individual, family and school factors was collected by interview with parents at ages 3, 5, 7 and 9 years and then by postal questionnaire two-yearly up to 15 years. Subjects were assessed two-yearly from age 3 years and interviewed about their behaviours and ambitions at ages 11, 13, and 15 years. Questions about age at first intercourse were asked by computer at age 21 years. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model associations with age of first intercourse less than 16 years. RESULTS: Data on age at first intercourse were available for 926/1020 (91%) of surviving members of the cohort assembled at age 3 years. Overall 27.5% of males and 31.7% of females reported sexual intercourse before age 16 years. In multivariate analyses the independent predictors for early sexual initiation for males were: not having outside home interests at age 13 years, no religious activity at age 11 years, not being attached to school at age 15 years, a low reading score, and a diagnosis of conduct disorder in early adolescence. For females, independent predictors were: socioeconomic status in the middle range, mother having her first child before age 20 years, IQ in the middle range, not being attached to school, being in trouble at school, planning to leave school early, cigarette smoking and higher self-esteem score. CONCLUSIONS: Individual and school factors appear to be more important than family composition or socioeconomic status in the decision to have sexual intercourse before age 16 years. The lowering of age at first intercourse may be partly a cohort effect related to high rates of teenage childbearing in the mothers' generation, and to changes in social acceptability of early sexual behaviour."
18477747,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This paper analyses gender inequalities in health status and in social determinants of health among the elderly in western Europe. METHODS: Data came from the first wave of the ""Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe"" (2004). For the purposes of this study a subsample of community-residing people aged 65-85 years with no paid work was selected (4218 men and 5007 women). Multiple logistic regression models separated by sex and adjusted for age and country were fitted. RESULTS: Women were more likely to report poor health status, limitations in mobility and poor mental health. Whereas in both sexes educational attainment was associated with the three health indicators, household income was only related to poor self-rated health among women. The relationship between living arrangements and health differed by gender and was primarily associated with poor mental health. In both sexes, not living with their partner but living with other people and being the household head was related to poor mental health status (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.14; 95% CI 1.11 to 4.14 for men and aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.72 for women). In addition, women living with their partner and other(s) and those living alone were more likely to report poor mental health status (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.41 and aOR 1.58; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Health inequalities persist among the elderly. Women have poorer health status than men and in both sexes the risk of poor health status increases among those with low educational attainment. Living arrangements are primarily associated with poor mental health status with patterns that differ by gender."
30294398,0,a,"Background: Rehabilitation tailored to older adults' needs might improve their functional performance and quality of life, as well as increase social participation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of medical rehabilitation services among older Poles in relation to socio-economic and health-related determinants. Materials and methods: Data regarding medical rehabilitation were obtained from the nationwide, multidisciplinary PolSenior project (2007-2012) conducted on representative sample of 4813 respondents (48.3% women) aged 65+ years. Socio-economic status, physical functioning, falls, chronic pain, and formal disability occurrence, as well as self-rated health were accounted for. Results: One in six respondents (18.9% women vs. 15.8% men, p < 0.005) underwent medical rehabilitation during 12 months prior to the survey. Respondents mostly received electrotherapy or light radiation therapy (61.3%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that women aged 80+ years and men aged 90+ years had a significantly lower chance of using rehabilitation services compared to the youngest study participants (65-69 y.o.). City dwellers used rehabilitation services nearly twice as frequently as rural dwellers. Respondents with university education level were most likely to take part in these services. Dependence in IADL decreased participation in medical rehabilitation, while formal disability and chronic pain promoted utilization of rehabilitation services. Conclusions: Younger age, city dwelling, higher education, functional independence, formal disability certificate, and chronic pain increased participation in medical rehabilitation. Such results of the study should be considered in planning actions towards reducing health inequalities at the national level and promoting health and well-being among older adults."
29143960,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Among children with epilepsy, to develop and evaluate a model to predict emergency department (ED) use, an indicator of poor disease control and/or poor access to care. METHODS: We used electronic health record data from 2013 to predict ED use in 2014 at 2 centers, benchmarking predictive performance against machine learning algorithms. We evaluated algorithms by calculating the expected yearly ED visits among the 5% highest risk individuals. We estimated the breakeven cost per patient per year for an intervention that reduced ED visits by 10%. We estimated uncertainty via cross-validation and bootstrapping. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed multiple potential predictors of ED use (demographics, social determinants of health, comorbidities, insurance, disease severity, and prior health care utilization). A 3-variable model (prior ED use, insurance, number of antiepileptic drugs [AEDs]) performed as well as the best machine learning algorithm at one center (N = 2730; ED visits among top 5% highest risk, 3-variable model, mean = 2.9, interquartile range [IQR] = 2.7-3.1 vs Random Forest, mean = 2.9, IQR = 2.7-3.1), and superior at the second (N = 784; mean = 2.5, IQR = 2.2-2.9 vs mean = 1.9, IQR = 1.6-2.5). The per-patient-per-year breakeven point using this model to identify high-risk individuals was $958 (95% confidence interval [CI] = $568-$1390) at one center and $1086 (95% CI = $886-$1320) at the second. SIGNIFICANCE: Prior ED use, insurance status, and number of AEDs, taken together, predict future ED use for children with epilepsy. Our estimates suggest a program targeting high-risk children with epilepsy that reduced ED visits by 10% could spend approximately $1000 per patient per year and break even. Further work is indicated to develop and evaluate such programs."
16740677,1,a,"Adoption of potentially effective preventive interventions often fails. This study aimed to identify factors that determine why midwifery practices decide to use a smoking cessation protocol, using a comprehensive model of both organizational and psychosocial factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among representatives of all 446 Dutch midwifery practices, of whom 251 (56%) responded. The results show that adoption of the protocol was facilitated by the presence of practice assistants and impeded by a large proportion of clients of foreign ethnic origin. The most successful information channel was the midwives' professional association. A consistent positive attitude (perceiving a lot of advantages, few disadvantages and a low level of ambivalence) and positive social norms toward using the protocol, a perceived large proportion of midwives who use the protocol and knowledge about the protocol significantly increased the likelihood of adoption. The decision to use the protocol was better explained by personal awareness and motivation factors than by organizational factors."
27348099,0,a,"Spaces that encourage better health are increasingly seen as key to reducing the burden of chronic disease: many larger Canadian public health departments now include built environment (BE) teams, which work with municipalities and land use planners to promote and/or require the development of health-encouraging spaces. In many public health agencies, it is environmental health practitioners who have assumed the new healthy BE role, but at what cost to existing mandates? We argue that reinventing roles to increase BE capacities within environmental health practice would reinforce health protection mandates while building capacity in chronic disease prevention. Significant expansion into the design of healthier built environments may require some reallocation of resources. However, we anticipate that healthier built environments will reduce threats to health and so lessen the need for conventional health protection, while encouraging activities and behaviours that lead to greater population wellness."
31777854,0,a,"Objectives: The development of teeth is affected by genetic and environmental factors. Amoxicillin is a widely prescribed semi-synthetic antibiotic. Its most frequent side effects are gastrointestinal disorders and hypersensitivity reactions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect produced by amoxicillin administration on dental enamel and dentin in Wistar rats. Materials and Methods: Twelve pregnant adult Wistar rats were equally divided into four different groups. Negative controls were prescribed with a saline solution. Positive controls were prescribed with tetracycline (130 mg/kg). The other two groups were treated with amoxicillin doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg (every 8 hours), respectively. The treatments were daily administered by oral gavage from the 13th gestation day to the end of gestation. After birth, the offspring also received the same treatment as their mothers from day one to day twelve. After 24 hours, the newborns were sacrificed, the jaws were dissected, and the first molar teeth were collected. The samples were fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution and were histomorphologically and histopathologically observed to determine enamel and dentin abnormalities. Results: The mean ameloblastic layer thickness, enamel thickness, odontoblastic layer thickness, and dentin thickness were significantly different in the tetracycline group and the amoxicillin 50 and 100 mg/kg groups compared to the control group. Also, dentin hypomineralization and vacuolization of the odontoblastic layer were observed in the tetracycline- and amoxicillin-treated groups. Conclusion: This study showed that amoxicillin interferes with amelogenesis and dentinogenesis and reduces enamel and dentin thickness."
26815750,1,a,"INTRODUCTION: Due to remarkable improvements in emergency and intensive care medicine in the recent past, the mortality rate for severely injured patients is decreasing. Outcome research therefore should no longer focus only on questions of survival, but also on aspects of the quality of life after severe trauma. This study examined the long-term effect of different sociodemographic, economic, trauma, and hospital-related factors on the health-related quality of life (SF-36) of severely injured patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A written questionnaire was sent to 121 trauma patients who received treatment in two hospitals in Cologne/Northrhine-Westfalia between 1996 and 2001. The inclusion criteria were more than one injury and a sum of abbreviated injury score of the two worst injuries >/= 6. The response rate after using the total-design-method was 77.6% (n = 90). RESULTS: Severely injured patients showed significant reductions for all subscales of the SF-36, on average 4 years after discharge on average, in comparison to a German norm population. Specifically, aspects of the physical-component scale were dramatically reduced. Linear regressions controlling for time after discharge suggested that higher age, lower socioeconomic status, living together with a partner, and the severity of trauma and injury of extremities were significant predictors for a reduced quality of life, while satisfaction with the hospital stay had a positive effect. DISCUSSION: All in all, it is important to identify trauma- patients who will suffer a reduced quality of life. In so doing, it will be possible to take into account the specific circumstances of their recovery during medical treatment, care, and rehabilitation."
12613711,1,a,"Mothers and children constitute the majority of the population and can be considered vulnerable populations. Their health is essential for personal, community, and country development. The ultimate goal of Mother and Child Health (MCH) teaching in schools of public health is to improve the health of women and children. This can be achieved by preparing professionals in the foundations of MCH either as practitioners, policy makers, or researchers. The content of MCH teaching should answer the local needs and include international and global aspects, considering the multifactorial determinants of health. Courses can be integrated into the MPH program or constitute a track within the MPH. Teaching methods should be interactive, including classroom activity and fieldwork. Faculty should be multidisciplinary."
12556926,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To compare functional, emotional, and academic status of adolescents who had been extremely low birth weight (ELBW) with those who were full term. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six adolescents who were born in 1983 to 1984 at less than 801 g birth weight were compared with 26 adolescents born at term. Adolescent-perceived status was assessed using the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-SR) and the Self-Perception Profile. Parents' perceptions were assessed using BASC Parent Report, Family Impact Questionnaire, and Functional Status Measure. Health status was obtained through written requests to primary care providers and parent interviews. Academic and attendance information was obtained through school records. RESULTS: Compared to the term adolescents, the ELBW group had significantly lower function related to health status, increased need for special education, and tended to score lower on academic performance measures. However, ELBW adolescents' perceptions regarding their scholastic, athletic, or social competencies did not differ from the term group or national normative data. Parents of ELBWs reported lower adaptive skills, but no other behavioral differences from the term group. CONCLUSION: ELBW survivors and their parents perceived outcome at adolescence positively in spite of evident limitations. Mechanisms that ELBW families use to cope may be important determinants for successful, long-term outcome."
12144151,1,a,"This paper explores the content, prevalence, and determinants of husbands' involvement in two aspects of their wives' maternal health: (1) providing advice and care during pregnancy and (2) attending birth. Using primarily women's reports of their spouses' involvement taken from qualitative and survey data from a sample of rural Guatemalan households, I find that husband participation is relatively high compared to some expectations and that the dynamics of male involvement differ between the two aspects. The analysis of receiving advice or care from husbands during pregnancy, an analysis done only among women who experienced a complication during pregnancy, suggests that the type of prenatal care sought and the quality of the familial and marital relationships are important factors. On the other hand, husbands' attendance at birth seems driven more by men's availability and access to birth. Together, the data show that ""male involvement"" is not a singular behavior and point to ways to conceptualize its complexity."
16174145,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To test the role of social determinants-including race, education, income, and demographic factors-of child mental health services use, defined as having had a visit to a mental health professional for depression, attention-deficit, or for any reason. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Child/Young Adult supplement, a nationally representative sample of 7-14-year-old children born to women who were 14-22 years old at the start of data collection, in 1979. African Americans and Latinos were over-sampled, and population weights are available to make nationally representative inferences. STUDY DESIGN: Indicators of mental health service use were regressed on social and economic determinants, family structure variables, and insurance variables, controlling for need as captured by several different symptom scales. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Girls are much less likely to obtain needed treatment for externalizing behavior disorders than are boys, and are somewhat less likely to obtain needed treatment for depression than boys. Middle children are less likely to obtain needed treatment for any mental health problem than are oldest, youngest, or only children. The presence of the father inhibits the likelihood that the child will receive treatment, particularly for depression. African Americans and Latinos are less likely than white children to receive treatment. In contrast to these rich results for the social and demographic determinants of children's specialty mental health utilization, the economic and insurance variables (including maternal education and income) seem to hold little predictive power. CONCLUSIONS: These results argue for interventions to sensitize parents-especially fathers-to the need to pay attention to the mental health needs of their children, in particular girls and middle children. The analysis also suggests that the literature on intrahousehold decision making and on the gender dimensions of investment in children is worth extending to mental health treatment decisions."
30509511,0,a,"Beyond vitamin D (VD) effect on bone homeostasis, numerous physiological functions in human health have been described for this versatile prohormone. In 2016, 95% of the world's population lived in areas where annual mean ambient particulate matter (<2.5mum) levels exceeded the World Health Organization guideline value (Shaddick et al., 2018). On the other hand, industries disperse thousands of chemicals continually into the environment. Further, considerable fraction of populations are exposed to tobacco smoke. All of these may disrupt biochemical pathways and cause detrimental consequences, such as VD deficiency (VDD). In spite of the remarkable number of studies conducted on the role of some of the above mentioned exposures on VDD, the literature suffers from two main shortcomings: (1) an overview of the impacts of environmental exposures on the levels of main VD metabolites, and (2) credible engaged mechanisms in VDD because of those exposures. To summarize explanations for these unclear topics, we conducted the present review, using relevant keywords in the PubMed database, to investigate the adverse effects of exposure to air pollution, some environmental chemicals, and smoking on the VD metabolism, and incorporate relevant potential pathways disrupting VD endocrine system (VDES) leading to VDD. Air pollution may lead to the reduction of VD cutaneous production either directly by blocking ultraviolet B photons or indirectly by decreasing outdoor activity. Heavy metals may reduce VD serum levels by increasing renal tubular dysfunction, as well as downregulating the transcription of cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidases (CYPs). Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may inhibit the activity and expression of CYPs, and indirectly cause VDD through weight gain and dysregulation of thyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone, and calcium homeostasis. Smoking through several pathways decreases serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D levels, VD intake from diet, and the cutaneous production of VD through skin aging. In summary, disturbance in the cutaneous production of cholecalciferol, decreased intestinal intake of VD, the modulation of genes involved in VD homeostasis, and decreased local production of calcitriol in target tissues are the most likely mechanisms that involve in decreasing the serum VD levels."
15234641,1,a,"PURPOSE: To determine the rates of patient adherence to key evidence-based therapies at 6 months after hospital discharge for an acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: In this nonrandomized, prospective, multinational, multicenter study, adherence to aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 6 months after discharge for myocardial infarction or unstable angina was assessed in 21,408 patients aged 18 years or older. Patients were enrolled at 104 tertiary and community hospitals representing a broad range of care facilities and practice settings (e.g., teaching vs. nonteaching). RESULTS: Of 13,830 patients, discontinuation of therapy was observed at 6-month follow-up in 8% of those taking aspirin on discharge, 12% of those taking beta-blockers, 20% of those taking ACE inhibitors, and 13% of those taking statins. In a multivariate analysis, adherence to beta-blocker therapy was higher in patients with a myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 1.47), hypertension (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.54), ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.61), or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.45). Aspirin adherence was higher among patients cared for by cardiologists (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.19 to 1.75; P <0.001) than among those cared for by nonspecialists. Male sex and prior heart failure were associated with improved adherence to ACE inhibitor therapy. Hypertension was associated with poorer adherence to statin therapy (OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.99; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Among patients prescribed key evidence-based medications at discharge, 8% to 20% were no longer taking their medication after 6 months. The reasons for noncompliance are complex, and may be elucidated by future studies of medical and social determinants."
14999160,1,a,"Women's mental health during pregnancy has important implications not only for the well-being of the mother, but also for the development, health, and well-being of her unborn child. A growing body of empirical evidence from population-based studies suggests that two indicators of women's mental health during pregnancy--psychosocial stress and social support--may exert a significant influence on fetal development and infant birth outcomes, such as birth weight and length of gestation, even after controlling for the effects of established sociodemographic, obstetric, and behavioral risk factors. This paper describes the role of three major biological systems involved in the physiology of pregnancy and stress physiology: neuroendocrine, immune/inflammatory, and cardiovascular systems. These systems have been hypothesized to mediate the effects of maternal mental health on fetal developmental and health outcomes, and a central role has been proposed for placental corticotropin-releasing hormone in this process. However, not all women reporting high prenatal stress and/or low social support proceed to develop adverse birth outcomes, raising the question of the determinants of susceptibility/vulnerability in the context of high stress and/or low social support. In this context, the role of race/ethnicity and genetic predisposition are discussed as two promising avenues of further investigation."
31706274,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) is a multidimensional concept that is affected by various factors. According to the literature, social capital is one of the key determinants of QoL that improves the living conditions of the entire community. This study aimed to investigate the association between social capital and QoL in pregnant women. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 240 pregnant women with a mean age of 27.98 years who were referred to healthcare centers in Qazvin, Iran. A two-stage random sampling method was used to select the health centers and participants. Social capital, QoL, demographic and obstetric characteristics were assessed. RESULTS: The mean scores of social capital, physical and mental dimensions of quality of life were 67.43, 70.2 and 71.88 respectively. All dimensions of social capital except for family and friends' connection and tolerance of diversity had positive significant correlations with the physical and mental health dimensions of quality of life (r = 0.17 to 0.28 p < 0.05). A univariate regression model revealed that social capital had a significant association with both the physical health (B = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19-0.61, p < 0.001) and mental health (B = 0 .44, 95% CI: 0.18-0.58, p < 0.001) dimensions of pregnant women's quality of life. In the adjusted model, each unit increase of social capital increased pregnant women's QoL in both the physical health and mental health dimensions. CONCLUSION: Social capital has a significant association with women's QoL during pregnancy. Therefore, QoL during pregnancy could be improved by considering physical, psychological and social components of their healthcare."
24898593,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The Public Health Agency of Canada developed the Chronic Disease Indicator Framework (the Framework) with the goal of systematizing and enhancing chronic disease surveillance in Canada by providing the basis for consistent and reliable information on chronic diseases and their determinants. METHODS: Available national and international health indicators, frameworks and national health databases were reviewed to identify potential indicators. To make sure that a comprehensive and balanced set of indicators relevant to chronic disease prevention was included, a conceptual model with ""core domains"" for grouping eligible indicators was developed. Specific selection criteria were applied to identify key measures. Extensive consultations with a broad range of government partners, non-governmental organizations and public health practitioners were conducted to reach consensus and refine and validate the Framework. RESULTS: The Framework contains 41 indicators organized in a model comprised of 6 core domains: social and environmental determinants, early life / childhood risk and protective factors, behavioural risk and protective factors, risk conditions, disease prevention practices, and health outcomes/status. Also planned is an annual release of updated data on the proposed set of indicators, including national estimates, breakdowns by demographic and socioeconomic variables, and time trends. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the evidence related to chronic diseases and theirdeterminants is key to interpreting trends and crucial to the development of public health interventions. The Framework and its related products have the potential of becoming an indispensable tool for evidence-informed decision making in Canada."
31362763,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The psychosocial consequences of obesity are important but often underrated. The Attitudes Toward Obese Persons (ATOP) and Beliefs About Obese Persons (BAOP) scales used to measure weight-related bias have little psychometric information, especially in East Asian contexts. The objective of this study was to use rigorous statistical methods to demonstrate the psychometric properties of these two instruments in Hong Kong and Taiwanese college students. METHODS: A convenience sample of 707 students was recruited from the universities in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Several competing confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted to confirm the factorial structure of the ATOP and BAOP. The best fit models for the ATOP and BAOP were chosen for the examination of the measurement invariance across subcultures. We then compared configurable models with or without loading and/or intercept constrained before correlating the latent constructs between the best models for the ATOP and BAOP. RESULTS: The comparison in multiple CFAs found that the model with one factor and two correlated-wording-method factors outperformed the other models for both the ATOP and BOAP. However, the internal consistency was suboptimal (ATOP: alpha = .56 to .80; BTOP: alpha = .57 to .65) and the measurement invariance was somewhat unsupported among the Hong Kong and Taiwan samples. Moreover, after controlling wording effects, the latent construct of the ATOP was moderately associated with that of BAOP (r = .356; p < .001). CONCLUSION: Chinese versions of the ATOP and BAOP can be treated as a unidimensional factor for use in Hong Kong and Taiwan university students. However, further refinements of both instruments may be needed before using them to capture the social attitudes and beliefs toward obesity individuals, which is expected to advance our understanding of weight-related bias in East Asian contexts."
31970097,0,a,"Background: Medical tourism is a type of service sector in which there is direct interaction between healthcare practitioners and patient-customers, leading to several challenges due to cultural and social background differences. We aimed to investigate the determinants of delivering a culturally-oriented service in medical tourism sector. Methods: Adopting an exploratory qualitative approach, interviews were conducted through a semi-structured procedure with authorities across various medical sectors in South Korea in winter 2017. Participants were all involved in and aware of the medical tourism sector, both academically and clinically. The interview transcripts were coded through a systematic thematic analysis. Results: In order to focus on non-clinical service in medical tourism sector, and a system of cultural competence delivery, three main themes were identified: 1) The personal characteristics of doctors; 2) External supports to be provided by the associated organisations; and finally, 3) Skilfulness, which implies the culturally-oriented interaction with foreign patients. Conclusion: Several strategies are suggested to address the non-clinical challenges and conflicts in doctor-patient interaction in the sector of medical tourism. It is likely that providing a culturally-oriented service in this sector demands for a comprehensive planning, and several strategies for implementation in order to support and train a team of skilful doctors with non-clinical characteristics. These finding will likely have insights for those organisations searching to improve their performance in the medical tourism sector."
19252200,1,a,"Despite the Canadian record of concern with the social determinants of health (SDOH), actual public health activities consistent with such an approach are sporadic at best. Canadian research and advocacy activities in the service of strengthening the SDOH are so divorced from everyday public policy activity, media discourse and public awareness as to metaphorically suggest that SDOH researchers and advocates exist in a Phantom Zone of irrelevance. Why this might be the case and means of escaping from such irrelevance are presented. Implications for jurisdictions where the situation appears to be even worse-such as the USA-and for those where the situation may be somewhat better are also presented."
20510469,0,a,"The increase in life expectancy (LE) observed in Western societies, has resulted in a steep rise of older population. This stresses the importance of the research on aging, to better adequate health and social care organization and improve the quality of life (QoL). The aim of the EPEPP-1 (abbreviated from the Portuguese name: Estudo do Perfil de Envelhecimento da Populacao Portuguesa) study was to characterize the socio-demographic components of the elderly Portuguese population in order to disclose factors that could play a role in the aging process and in the elderly QoL. This observational descriptive study, was performed in 2672 individuals older than 54 years taking into account gender and the residence area (rural vs. urban). A questionnaire about social network (marital status, living alone, the hours spent alone, confidents), and social status (education, occupation) was applied. Social network score revealed significant age and gender trends, women and older people performing worst, but with no difference according to residence area. Almost a third was unmarried and spent eight or more hours per day alone, and a fifth lived alone. Social status revealed that being older female and resident in a rural area quoted worst in the prevalence of illiteracy and undifferentiated occupation. The authors concluded that social isolation, illiteracy and undifferentiated occupation are prevalent in Portuguese older population. Identification of further determinants of isolation, adjustment of procedures to be included in social networks and development of actions directed to education are important fields of intervention influencing the elderly QoL."
25858180,0,a,"Background The relationship between well-being and mental ill health is complex; people may experience very low levels of well-being even in the absence of overt mental health problems. Aims This study tested the hypothesis that anxiety, depression and well-being have different causal determinants and psychological mediating mechanisms. Method The influence of causal and mediating factors on anxiety, depression and well-being were investigated in a cross-sectional online questionnaire survey hosted on a UK national broadcasting website. Results Multivariate conditional independence analysis of data from 27 397 participants revealed different association pathways for the two constructs. Anxiety and depression were associated with negative life events mediated by rumination; low levels of subjective well-being were associated with material deprivation and social isolation, mediated by adaptive coping style. Conclusions Our findings support the 'two continua' model of the relationship between psychological well-being and mental health problems, with implications for both treatment and prevention."
16300663,1,a,"Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a multifactorial problem, which affects men of all ages and in all demographics. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence of prostatitis is approximately 2-10% among unselected men in North America, Europe and Asia. This data clearly indicates that chronic prostatitis constitutes an important problem in international health care. Nevertheless, the aetiology and pathogenesis of chronic prostatitis have yet to be clearly delineated, despite the numerous efforts which have been made, with regard to both basic and clinical research. In fact, factors other than leucocytes and bacteria have been shown to contribute to the symptoms typically associated with prostatitis. Studies of the epidemiology and determinants of prostatitis risk factors may also provide clues to the general aetiology of prostatitis. Other epidemiological data appears to indicate that certain as-yet-unknown factors might be associated with an increased tendency towards the development of chronic prostatitis. However, findings from most studies are considered to represent only preliminary data, because of the small sample sizes or lack of generalizability inherent to most of the studies. The identification and characterization of these relevant risk factors might accelerate or augment the development of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these syndromes."
22677974,0,a,"Despite efforts to increase HIV testing in the African region, the proportion of men who report ever having been tested for HIV remains low. Research has focused on individual level determinants of women's testing however little is known about factors associated with men's testing behavior. This analysis investigates community influences on HIV testing among men ages 15-54, using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from Chad, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Multilevel models were fitted in each country for the outcome of ever receiving an HIV test. After controlling for individual and household level factors, community level factors of demographics, economics, and behavior and knowledge remain significantly associated with HIV testing among men. The results of this analysis highlight the need to recognize the impact of community influences on men's HIV test seeking behavior, and to harness these community factors in the design of programs aimed at encouraging the uptake of HIV testing among men in Africa."
11151349,1,a,"Work behavior among older men approaching or following retirement has received considerable research attention over the past two decades, but research on older women's work behavior is still in its incipient stage. Based on data from the 1982 New Beneficiary Survey (NBS) and the 1991 New Beneficiary Follow-up (NBF), this study analyzes the extent and determinants of employment among women who received their first Social Security benefits between 1980 and 1981. More than one fourth of the women continued to work or rejoined the labor force following their first Social Security benefit receipt. Financial need was found to be the primary reason for and the most significant determinant of women's continuing work or (re)entry into the labor force. But the level of education, health, spouse's work status, and previous work history were also found to be significant determinants of the likelihood and duration of their employment following Social Security receipt."
30720625,0,a,"CONTEXT: Despite a growing consensus in public health to address health inequities and leverage social determinants of health (SDoH), the level of public health practitioners' readiness to become the agents of change in promoting health equity and shaping SDoH is not well researched. OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) the level of public health agency employees' perceived desirability for impacting health equity and SDoH, and (2) the impact of employee characteristics such as a (PH WINS) public health degree and awareness of health in all policies on such desirability. METHODS: Data from the 2017 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey were used in examining the sense of desirability among agency employees for affecting health equity and SDoH in the agency jurisdictions. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of health agency employees believed that their agencies should be very involved in affecting health equity in their jurisdictions. Fairly smaller proportions of employees believed in the desirability of affecting SDoH, and the proportions who believed that the agency should be very involved in affecting specific SDoH were 17.8% for affecting the quality of transportation, 18.5% for affecting the economy, 22.2% for quality of housing, 22.4% for quality of the built environment, 25.4% for K-12 education system, and 34.5% for impacting the quality of social support systems. Agency employees without a public health degree had significantly lower odds (P < .05) of believing that the agency should be very involved in affecting health equity. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing efforts to reduce health inequities and leverage SDoH for improved population health, gaps exist in the public health workforce's perceived desirability for their agencies to be involved in such efforts. These gaps exist among employees regardless of their demographic characteristics, length of tenure, or agency setting. Policy and practice initiatives aimed to improve health equity might benefit from our findings positing a need for education regarding SDoH and health equity. Our study findings imply the need for interventions for improving alignment between employee beliefs and organizational priorities for an effective transformation to Public Health 3.0. Fostering cross-sector partnerships with a focus on Health in All Policies (HiAP), SDoH, and health equity must be a high priority for public health agencies, which can be formalized through organizational strategic plans."
20589143,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a growing public health problem in Uganda and Africa as a whole. We conducted a study to determine the prevalence and identify factors associated withy hypertension among residents of the rural district of Rukungiri, Uganda. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was used to conduct this study. Between January and February 2006, a random sample of consenting district residents, aged 20 years or older were enrolled to participate in this study. Trained research assistants administered a standardized questionnaire and performed the physical measurements. The questionnaire collected data on demographics, social economic and exposure history to various potential risk factors for hypertension. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) equal or greater than 140mmHg and/or diastolic BP equal or greater than 90mmHg, and/or being on regular anti-hypertensive therapy. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with hypertension. RESULTS: Of the 842 study participants, 252 were hypertensive. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 30.5%, with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 26.6 - 34.3%. Factors found to be associated with hypertension included: past alcohol use, Odds Ratio (OR)=2.28, [1.42 - 3.64], present alcohol use OR=1.64 [1.12 - 2.43], being overweight OR=1.95 [1.37 - 2.79], obesity OR=5.07 [2.79 - 9.21], female sex OR=1.44 [1.03 - 2.06], having attained tertiary education OR=1.91 [1.03 - 3.56], and older age OR=1.42 [1.27 - 1.59]). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hypertension in this rural Ugandan district is relatively high. The findings confirm the growing concern about hypertension as a public health problem in Uganda. More studies are however required to determine the distribution and determinants of hypertension in other parts of the country."
19390298,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Most studies of successful aging have used restricted definitions based on the absence of disability and identified a small number of predictors. The authors aimed to examine whether a broad multidimensional definition of successful aging has good construct validity and identified a wider range of predictors that are relevant for multifaceted interventions. METHODS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal data analyses were performed on 1,281 community-living Chinese elderly of 65 years and above in the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study cohort. Successful aging was measured in multiple dimensions of functioning and wellness: cognitive and affective status, physical health, social functioning and engagement and life satisfaction, and a summary composite measure created across dimensions to form a dichotomous variable. Potential determinants included sociodemographic, psychosocial, behavioral variables. RESULTS: Successful aging was determined in 28.6% of respondents and in multivariate models was significantly (p <0.05) associated with age (OR = 0.90), female gender (OR = 1.37), > or =6 years of education (OR = 2.31), better housing (OR = 1.41), religious or spiritual beliefs (OR = 1.64), physical activities and exercise (OR = 1.90), and low or no nutritional risk (OR = 2.16). CONCLUSION: In contrast to findings based on more restricted biomedical definitions of successful aging, a multidimensional definition of successful aging identified more variables including demographic status, psychosocial support, spirituality, and nutrition as salient determinants."
26546016,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To examine socioeconomic and health system determinants of wealth-related inequalities in neonatal mortality rates (NMR) across 48 low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2012. Absolute and relative inequalities for NMR and coverage of antenatal care, facility-based delivery, and Caesarean delivery were measured using the Slope Index of Inequality and Relative Index of Inequality, respectively. Meta-regression was used to assess whether variation in the magnitude of NMR inequalities was associated with inequalities in coverage of maternal health services, and whether country-level economic and health system factors were associated with mean NMR and socioeconomic inequality in NMR. RESULTS: Of the three maternal health service indicators examined, the magnitude of socioeconomic inequality in NMR was most strongly related to inequalities in antenatal care. NMR inequality was greatest in countries with higher out-of-pocket health expenditures, more doctors per capita, and a higher adolescent fertility rate. Determinants of lower mean NMR (e.g., higher government health expenditures and a greater number of nurses/midwives per capita) differed from factors associated with lower NMR inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the financial burden of maternal health services and achieving universal coverage of antenatal care may contribute to a reduction in socioeconomic differences in NMR. Further investigation of the mechanisms contributing to these cross-national associations seems warranted."
17580127,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to clarify the knowledge and attitudes of Chinese university students regarding living organ donation and analyze the determinants impacting their decisions. METHODS: A questionnaire was delivered to college students chosen by random assignment. The data was analyzed by Statistics Package for Social Science (SPSS) software. RESULTS: Of 434 participants, 49.8% indicated they would be willing to be living organ donors, 58.4% believed living organ donation could ease the organ shortage, 48.2% thought that the recovery rate of recipients of living organ donors transplants was equal to or even better than deceased donation, 62.4% designated relatives as their most probable recipients, 48.0% argued that partial compensation was an effective method to increase live organ donation, and 53.7% wished to donate through transplantation centers. According to univariate analysis, attitudes regarding the value of life, relationship between body integrity and health as well as body integrity and conventional culture were factors that impacted on an individual's decision. Students' knowledge of the value of living organ transplantation and their economic background were considered to be determinants of individual willingness. Furthermore, the operation's impact on quality of life and postoperative complications were additional concerns. Multivariate analysis indicated that other factors influencing students' willingness to donate included attitudes toward the relationship between body integrity and health, beliefs regarding body integrity and conventional culture, value of living donor organ transplantation, economic background of students, and anxiety about the impact on postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous students were willing to participate in living organ donation. At the same time, social education and advertisements for living organ donation were far from adequate, having little or no influence on the decision-making process."
18243207,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Although mission statements are one of the most popular management instruments, little is known about the nature and direction of the presumed relationship between mission statements and organizational performance. In particular, empirical insights into the degree of mission statement use by individual organizational members are insufficient. OBJECTIVES: We address the observed knowledge gap by (a) measuring the level of mission statement use (e.g., explaining the mission statement, making linkages to extant programs or practices, communicating enthusiasm, and adapting the mission statement to the personal work situation) by individual organizational members, and (b) identifying the antecedents that influence mission statement use. DESIGN: Questionnaires were used to collect data from a sample of 510 nurses from three Flemish hospitals. Mission statement use was measured by means of Fairhurst's Management of Meaning Scale. Antecedents of mission statement use were derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior and the mission statement literature. RESULTS: The findings indicate that mission statement use is low on average. Attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and formal involvement in mission statement communication proved to be significant determinants of mission statement use and accounted for 43% of the variance. The results of the conducted regression analyses indicate that nurses (a) who have a positive attitude towards the mission statement, (b) who perceive pressure from superiors and colleagues to use the mission statement, (c) who feel they are in control of performing such behavior, and (d) who are formally involved in the mission statement communication processes are more likely to use the mission statement. Furthermore, the results indicated that demographic characteristics are not associated with mission statement use. CONCLUSIONS: To effectively increase mission statement use, investments should focus on redesigning a work environment that stresses the importance of the organizational mission statement and provides detailed information on the ways that individual organizational members can contribute in realizing the mission statement."
27987566,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, overweight and obesity are known as posing serious health risks. Successful methods for weight reduction have remained elusive. This multicenter non-randomised trial aimed to identify parameters and determinants of long-term weight reduction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 143/159 overweight and obese children and adolescents (90 %) completed the prospective multicenter trial (age 13.9+/-2.4 years, BMI 31.2+/-5.4kg/m(2), BMI-SDS 2.51+/-0.57). During a 6-week rehabilitation period the patients participated in a structured treatment and teaching program (STTP). Following in-patient treatment the children and adolescents were monitored over a period of 24 months (physical examination, measurements of BMI, BMI-SDS, body composition, carotid intima-media thickness, laboratory parameters, blood pressure, standardized questionnaires to assess socio-demographic and socio-economic parameters, eating behavior, well-being, quality of life, intelligence, intrafamilial conflicts, self-efficacy, resilience, sense of coherence, stress management, social support, actual body shape). RESULTS: 66% of the children and adolescents had abnormal laboratory parameters as well as higher blood pressure and/or an increased carotid intima-media thickness. The mean carotid intima-media thickness was 0.53+/-0.09mm (range 0.40 to 0.80); 15% of the patients showed normal range values (< 0.45mm), 40% a slightly elevated (>/= 0.45 to </= 0.50mm) and 45% an elevated (> 0.50mm) thickness. After the inpatient treatment lasting 40.4+/-4.1 (range 28 to 49) days, children and adolescents reached a mean weight reduction of 5.52+/-3.94 (0.4 to 13.3) kg (p<0.01) that was accompanied by a reduction in body fat mass. Using multivariate analyses, the most important psychological factors associated with long-term weight reduction were identified (R-square=0.53): well-being (beta=-0.543), resilience (beta=0.434), and sense of coherence (beta=0.315). CONCLUSION: The different parameters (i. e., well-being, resilience, sense of coherence) have demonstrated their utility, and strategies should be developed allowing an adaption of these into the STTPs."
25620821,0,a,"Demographic change and policy changes in social care provision can affect the type of social care support received by older people, whether through informal, formal state or formal paid-for sources. This paper analyses the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing data (wave 4) in order to examine the relationship between demographic and socio-economic characteristics, and the receipt of support from different sources by older people who report difficulty with daily activities. The research outlines three key results with implications for the future organisation of social care for older people. Firstly, the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) an older person reports having difficulty with, followed by the number of activities of daily living (ADLs) are the strongest determinants of receiving support from any source. Secondly, there are significant gender differences in the factors associated with receiving support from different sources; for example, physical health is a strong determinant of informal support receipt by men, while mental health status is a strong determinant of informal support receipt by women. Finally, the research shows that different kinds of impediments in everyday life are associated with receiving support from different sources. This 'link' between particular types of difficulties and support receipt from particular sources raises questions about the way social care provision can or should be organised in the future."
16539970,1,a,"The main aim of screening is to identify people with an increased probability to benefit from preventive interventions, generally from secondary prevention but also from primary prevention activities. The goal is to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment in order to modify positively the prognosis (the former case), or to recognize people exposed to risk factors which increase the incidence rate of disease, and then to prevent the disease (the latter case). Good intentions are not enough to achieve good results in terms of effectiveness, safety, efficiency or equity. It is necessary to have a systematic assessment of the consequences of screening, particularly on the impact on peoples health and on the health services. Due to the diversity of types of screenings that are done, it is very difficult to estimate the net impact caused by their implementation. Moreover, the changes in the health of a population depend on many factors other than health service interventions. Thus, it is very important to determine the effectiveness and safety of the screening methods that are most frequently applied. Unfortunately, assessment of the benefits and the harm potentially caused by preventive interventions has not been done often. In Spain only a few partial assessments have been published, and they focus on the activities and the processes themselves rather than the final outcomes. Given that screening activities are carried out in health care services, and that the populations screened are mostly healthy people, the ethical issues have great importance when health policies are designed and implemented. Thus, it is recommended that screenings activities be analyzed applying the ethical principles of autonomy, benefit, safety and justice. If any screening program cannot reasonably satisfy these principles then they should be removed from the list of public health activities that are financed by public resources. In the same sense, all screening procedures offered to the population must be subjected to a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness, safety, efficiency and equity in terms of how the procedure would be applied. Lastly, to achieve an effective implementation of the principle of autonomy as well the desired goal of empowering the population to exercise some control over their determinants of health, it is recommended to explore new ways of achieving active citizen participation to establish preventive priorities and to assess the impact of screening interventions."
30388399,0,a,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive biomarker of chronic low-grade inflammation and is associated with multiple complex diseases. The genetic determinants of chronic inflammation remain largely unknown, and the causal role of CRP in several clinical outcomes is debated. We performed two genome-wide association studies (GWASs), on HapMap and 1000 Genomes imputed data, of circulating amounts of CRP by using data from 88 studies comprising 204,402 European individuals. Additionally, we performed in silico functional analyses and Mendelian randomization analyses with several clinical outcomes. The GWAS meta-analyses of CRP revealed 58 distinct genetic loci (p < 5 x 10(-8)). After adjustment for body mass index in the regression analysis, the associations at all except three loci remained. The lead variants at the distinct loci explained up to 7.0% of the variance in circulating amounts of CRP. We identified 66 gene sets that were organized in two substantially correlated clusters, one mainly composed of immune pathways and the other characterized by metabolic pathways in the liver. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed a causal protective effect of CRP on schizophrenia and a risk-increasing effect on bipolar disorder. Our findings provide further insights into the biology of inflammation and could lead to interventions for treating inflammation and its clinical consequences."
31446636,0,a,"Poor recovery among older adults with hip fractures can occur despite successful surgical repair and rehabilitation, suggesting other factors might play a role in recovery, such as social factors. The aim of this scoping review was to provide an overview of the literature on the role of social factors in older adult's recovery after hip fracture. This review followed the York Framework and its modifications and recent reporting guidelines. Two independent researchers searched main medical databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO and the Cochrane libraries) from inception to June 2017, for studies investigating social factors and recovery post hip fracture. Studies were excluded if they were qualitative, perspective papers or if participants were < 65 years or they were not living in the community. We screened 2,503 unique abstracts in total and 19 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Social factors investigated in the included studies were social support, socioeconomic factors and living arrangement. We classified outcomes in the studies into three subgroups: physical functional recovery, mortality and other outcomes (pain, hospital length of stay and quality of life). We found evidence that social support and socioeconomic factors (e.g. socioeconomic status) were significantly associated with an increase in functional recovery, a decrease in mortality and other outcomes, but conflicting evidence was found for the effect of one's living arrangement. Only two included studies were randomised controlled trials. To conclude, social factors, such as social support and socioeconomic status, affect physical functional recovery and mortality in older adults with hip fractures. However, this is an under researched area that lacks rigorously designed studies and would benefit from more studies with rigorous designs."
30077153,0,a,"This study reports on the chemical composition of rainwater collected at three ground sites with varying degrees of pollution in Ahvaz, Iran, between January 2014 and February 2015. A total of 24 rainwater samples were analyzed for pH and concentrations of trace elements (Fe, Al, Pb, and Cd) and major ions (Na(+), NH4(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), HCO3(-), NO3(-), Cl(-) and SO4(2-)). Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify sources of the measured species. The equivalent concentration of the components followed the order of Ca(2+) > SO4(2-) > HCO3(-) > NH4(+) > Cl(-) > Na(+) > NO3(-) > Mg(2+). The average pH of the rainwater samples was 6, and only three events exhibited acidic conditions below a pH of 5.6. The lowest and the highest average pH values were observed in the high traffic area (5.96) and industrial area (6.54), respectively. The highest and lowest Ca(2+) levels were observed in the industrial and high traffic areas, respectively. Na(+), Mg(2+), and SO4(2-) exhibited their highest and lowest concentrations in the industrial and high traffic areas, respectively. 70.36% of the total variance was due to anthropogenic species (Ca(2+), SO4(2-), Mg(2+), NO3(-), Cl(-)), soil particles (Cl(-), Na(+), and HCO3(-)), and biomass burning (NH4(+), pH). The results of this study show that local anthropogenic sources and Middle Eastern Dust (MED) storms affect the rainwater chemistry strongly, which the latter stems from the Arabian Peninsula, Kuwait, Iraq, and some parts of Iran."
16140897,1,a,"Whether the determinants of linear growth can have independent effects beyond the critical infancy period has been questioned. This research uses uniquely suited data from >2000 youths from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Study in the Philippines to examine the association between diet and height in the postinfancy period. Anthropometric, diet, and other data were collected bimonthly from 0 to 2 y, and at the mean ages of 8, 11.5, 15.5, and 18.5 y. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to quantify the mean effects of diet diversity and energy intake on height across increments demarcated by the postinfancy data (2-8.5, 8.5-11.5, 11.5-15.5, and 15.5-18.5 y). We examined whether the effects differed by socioeconomic status (SES) and age. Effects with P < 0.05 were considered significant. Each additional unit of diet variety (range 0-8 U) was associated with a significant 0.33-cm increase in height in boys. Each additional 100 kcal (4186 kJ) was associated with significant increases in height of 0.05 cm in boys, and 0.02 cm in girls. Significant interactions (P < 0.15) with SES showed that each 100 kcal increase in energy intake was associated with a 0.08-cm increase in height at low SES with no difference at high SES. In both boys and girls, the effects of energy intake decreased with age, as shown by a significant age interaction (P < 0.15). The methods used incorporate the longitudinal nature of the data to offer a unique examination of the association between diet and height in the postinfancy period."
25414864,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Internet is one of the technologies of the modern era that is being extensively used around the world. It is believed that excessive Internet use can be pathological and addictive. Though, academic use of the Internet is primarily intended for learning and research, students are one of the groups at risk of Internet addiction. OBJECTIVES: Due to the expanding use of Internet among the university students, this study was conducted to examine the Internet addiction and its predictors among Guilan University of Medical Sciences students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 583 students during the first semester of 2012. A two-stage stratified random sampling was conducted and a two-part instrument was used for data collection. The first part of the instrument was consisted of questions about demographic characteristics and the second part was the Young's Internet addiction inventory. Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis testes, Spearman correlation coefficient and ranked logistic regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: About 5.7% of the students were moderately dependent to the Internet, while 44.1% were at risk for Internet addiction. Significant relationships were observed between the Internet addiction with age (P < 0.001), gender (P < 0.001), marital status (P < 0.001), major (P = 0.016), Grade point average (P = 0.017), semester of studying (P = 0.009) and student residence place (P = 0.014). However, no significant relationship was observed between the internet addiction score and level of discipline, parental job status and education level or the students' accommodation. CONCLUSION: About half of the participants in this study were at risk of Internet addiction. This finding can be a warning sign for the authorities in universities to pay more attention to this issue. A wide range of education along with empowering programs may be needed to inform the university students about the advantages and disadvantages of internet and the correct manner of using it."
30328020,0,a,"Given that there is a lack of instruments assessing internet-related addictions among Chinese population, this study aimed to validate the Chinese version of the nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scales- Short Form (IGDS-SF9), Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS), and Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale (SABAS) among Hong Kong university students. Participants aged between 17 and 30 years participated in the present study (n = 307; 32.4% males; mean [SD] age = 21.64 [8.11]). All the participants completed the IGDS-SF9, BSMAS, SABAS, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were used to examine the factorial structures and the unidimensionality for IGDS-SF9, BSMAS, and SABAS. CFAs demonstrated that the three scales were all unidimensional with satisfactory fit indices: comparative fit index = 0.969 to 0.992. In addition, the IGDS-SF9 and BSMAS were slightly modified based on the modification index in CFA. The Chinese IGDS-SF9, BSMAS, and SABAS are valid instruments to assess the addiction levels of internet-related activities for Hong Kong university students."
30205278,0,a,"We explore race differences in how individuals experience mass incarceration, as well as in mass incarceration's impacts on measures of well-being that are recognized as major social determinants of health. We draw on baseline data from a sample of 302 men and women recently released from prison/jail or placed directly onto probation in New Haven, Connecticut (CT) for drug related offenses and followed at 6-month intervals for two years (2011-2014). We describe race differences in experiences of mass incarceration and in its impacts on well-being; and we conduct mediation analyses to analyze relationships among race, mass incarceration, and well-being. Blacks reported fewer adult convictions than whites, but an average of 2.5 more adult incarcerations. Blacks were more likely to have been incarcerated as a juvenile, spent time in a juvenile facility and in an adult facility as a juvenile, been on parole, and experienced multiple forms of surveillance. Whites were more likely to report being caught by the police doing something illegal but let go. Blacks were more likely to report any impact of incarceration on education, and dropping out of school, leaving a job, leaving their longest job, and becoming estranged from a family member due to incarceration. Whites were more likely to avoid getting needed health or social services for fear of arrest. Overall, Blacks reported a larger number of impacts of criminal justice involvement on well-being than whites. Number of adult incarcerations and of surveillance types, and being incarcerated as a juvenile, each mediated the relationship among race, mass incarceration, and well-being. Though more research is necessary, experiences of mass incarceration appear to vary by race and these differences, in turn, have implications for interventions aimed at addressing the impacts of mass incarceration on health and well-being."
12073280,1,a,"1. The social function needs of persons with schizophrenia are similar to those of all individuals and include typical social roles, integration and contacts, and intimacy and sexual function. 2. Social function is essential to QOL, and aspects of social function are determinants of mental health and mental health outcomes. 3. Although intimacy and sexual function is found to be an important aspect of social function and QOL, health care workers neglect to discuss these issues with patients with schizophrenia. 4. Education, support, counseling, adequate transportation, safe environments, and treatment plans that include appropriate activities are important treatment interventions."
16442195,1,a,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of cognitive functioning, psychopathology, and severity of extrapyramidal side effects on community outcome in a group of Greek outpatients with schizophrenia. Participants were 40 outpatients with schizophrenia (25 men). Social adjustment was assessed with the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Severity of symptoms of schizophrenia was measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS), and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS). Finally, a battery of neuropsychological tests was administered in order to assess the following cognitive domains: executive functioning/set shifting, executive functioning/inhibition, fluency, verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, attention, visuospatial ability, and psychomotor speed/visual scanning. Total scores on the QLS were significantly correlated with negative symptoms, parkinsonism, and performance on the fluency tasks. Interpersonal relations subscale was significantly related with negative symptoms and fluency. No significant relationship was found between the Instrumental Role Functioning subscale and the PANSS, ESRS, or any cognitive domain. Scores on the Intrapsychic Foundation subscale were significantly correlated with negative symptoms and fluency. Finally, scores on the Common Objects and Activities subscale were significantly related with severity of negative symptoms, parkinsonism and visual memory. Our findings suggest that severity of negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, especially performance on fluency tasks and visual memory, as well as parkinsonism, are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia."
17915325,1,a,"The Observation Scale for Aggressive Behavior (OSAB) has been developed to evaluate inpatient treatment programs designed to reduce aggressive behavior in Dutch forensic psychiatric patients with an antisocial personality disorder, who are ""placed at the disposal of the government"". The scale should have the sensitivity to measure changes in the possible determinants of aggressive behavior, such as limited control of displayed negative emotions (irritation, anger or rage) and a general deficiency of social skills. In developing the OSAB 40 items were selected from a pool of 82 and distributed among the following a priori scales: Irritation/anger, Anxiety/gloominess, Aggressive behavior, Antecedent (to aggressive behavior), Sanction (for aggressive behavior) and Social behavior. The internal consistency of these subscales was good, the inter-rater reliability was moderate to good, and the test-retest reliability over a two to three week period was moderate to good. The correlation between the subscales Irritation/anger, Anxiety/gloominess, Aggressive behavior, Antecedent, Sanction was substantial and significant, but the anticipated negative correlation between these subscales and the Social behavior subscale could not be shown. Relationships between the corresponding subscales of the OSAB and the FIOS, used to calculate concurrent validity, yielded relatively high correlations. The validity of the various OSAB subscales could be further supported by significant correlations with the PCL-R and by significant but weak correlations with corresponding subscales of the self-report questionnaires. The Observation Scale for Aggressive Behavior (OSAB) seems to measure aggressive behavior in Dutch forensic psychiatric inpatients with an antisocial personality disorder reliably and validly. Contrary to expectations, a negative relationship was not found between aggressive and social behavior in either the OSAB or FIOS, which were used for calculating concurrent validity."
19142700,1,a,"Primate socioecological studies have attempted to derive general frameworks using the average behavioural traits of species or genera to place them into categories. However, with the accumulation of primate studies, it is timely to place more emphasis on understanding within-species variation in social structure. In this review we have four objectives. First, we examine within-species variation in the potential determinants of social structure, including diet, demography, predation and infanticide, and document considerable variation. Second, we present case studies of within-species variation in social structure to illustrate the potential magnitude of this variation. For example, there are cases within a single interbreeding population where multi-male, uni-male, fission-fusion and monogamous groups are found. Third, by examining widespread primate lineages that occur in a variety of habitats, we note that there are differences in the magnitude of variation in social structures across different lineages and as a result we consider phylogenetic constraints on phenotypic variation in social structure. Finally, we reflect on the implications of extensive variation in social structure. We suggest that primate social structure will represent a combination of adaptation to present-day environment and phylogenetic inertia. To advance our understanding of the relative contribution of phylogeny versus ecology we propose two approaches. One approach is to compare groups in the same interbreeding population that inhabit different ecological conditions. Any differences that are found can be attributed to ecological differences, since phylogeny should not play a role within a single population. The second approach is to study distantly related species that have similar social structures to illustrate how similar ecological pressures might be operating to select for parallel social structures."
30515652,0,a,"Achieving health equity requires addressing social determinants of health. Promoting health equity as it relates to cancer control is one of six priorities of the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP). This article describes recent activities implemented by three NCCCP awardees (North-west Portland Area Indian Health Board, Kansas, Michigan) and the CDC-funded National Behavior Health Network (NBHN), whose aim is to reduce health disparities among those with mental health and/or substance disorders. North-west Portland administered tribal surveys to help better understand tribal cancer-related risk factors, health behaviors, provide baseline data to support their cancer plan, and obtain resources for targeted interventions. Kansas established a health equity workgroup with a vision of addressing health equity through implementation and uptake of activities among all Kansans. Michigan provided trainings in health equity and social justice and developed health equity learning labs. As a result of the successful implementation of the NBHN's Community of Practice, individuals currently living with mental illness and/or substance disorders have had increased access to tobacco cessation and other cancer support services. These efforts and key opportunities for public health practitioners and their partners to increase engagement in cancer health equity are summarized in this article."
16380367,1,a,"This paper reports on an exploratory study of nursing home bankruptcy. From state and industry data regarding nearly 1,000 California facilities, it was possible to identify 155 homes in five chains (multi-facility organizations) that were operating in bankruptcy in 2000. When compared with facilities in non-bankrupt chains, while the bankrupt chain facilities had significantly worse financial liquidity, higher administrative costs, and higher payables to related parties, they also had more Medicare residents, fewer Medicaid residents, better solvency, and were located in less competitive county markets and in areas with higher Medicaid reimbursement rates. These findings indicate that, rather than facility characteristics and local market factors, strategic decisions taken at the corporate (chain) level are the major determinants of nursing facility bankruptcy status."
10990337,1,a,"This cross-sectional study analyses determinants of condom-use behaviour among patients attending dedicated STD clinics in South Africa. A structured interviewer-administered survey was conducted among 1473 patients. Patients' beliefs and attitudes towards condom use in general, as well as their personal condom-use behaviour were measured. Their perceptions, regarding the social influence of their partners and friends on their condom use, and of their self-efficacy in using condoms, while infected with an STD were also measured. Condom use, as a dependent variable, was examined and patients were placed in a pre-contemplation stage if they had never used a condom, contemplation if they had seriously thought of using a condom, some action stage if they sometimes used a condom and regular action stage if they used a condom every time. The relationships between the stages of change, as dependent variables, and the independent variables were investigated for both those patients with steady partners and those with outside partners. This was performed by stepwise multiple regression analyses. The variables that significantly explained stages of change were similar for patients with steady partners and those with outside partners. In both partner groups communication was the variable most strongly associated with the use of condoms. General self-efficacy in condom use, self-efficacy in condom use with a partner and attitudes towards the use of condoms played a role in determining patients' different stages of change."
24354817,0,a,"Evidence suggests national- and community-level interventions are not reaching women living at the economic and social margins of society in Pakistan. We conducted a 10-month qualitative study (May 2010-February 2011) in a village in Punjab, Pakistan. Data were collected using 94 in-depth interviews, 11 focus group discussions, 134 observational sessions, and 5 maternal death case studies. Despite awareness of birth complications and treatment options, poverty and dependence on richer, higher-caste people for cash transfers or loans prevented women from accessing required care. There is a need to end the invisibility of low-caste groups in Pakistani health care policy. Technical improvements in maternal health care services should be supported to counter social and economic marginalization so progress can be made toward Millennium Development Goal 5 in Pakistan."
12137318,1,a,"The present paper aims at describing the most relevant background data on geomorphological, economic, ethnohistoric, demographic and linguistic features of the island of Vis. As an introduction to future holistic anthropological research on the island, it seeks to identify both internal and external impulses of change and/or continuity of the island population structure within a wider socio-cultural and historical context. The ethnohistorical and demographic data indicate a higher degree of isolation throughout history as compared to other islands in the region and a continuous depopulation trend during the last century. The analysis of the existing linguistic data on two main settlements shows a certain amount of intradialectal micro-differentiation, which is mainly due to various social and non-linguistic reasons."
17472062,1,a,"Health is an axiological category, which does not possess measurable matter parameters. The problem of health is sometimes raised in families, social circles and institutions. Due to the fact that students of special pedagogy have contacts with school children with health deficits, they have to be fully aware of the fact how significant predicator health is in their own development. The target of this study was to show the output of the research aimed at seeking an answer to the following question: What level of knowledge about health and its determinants in their own perception is presented by the students on the grounds of the educational specialty they have chosen? The research comprised 84 students of 1st, 3rd and 5th years of the faculty of special pedagogy (different specialties) aged from 18 to 24. The research material was collected by an interview questionnaire elaborated by themselves and categorized conversation (""a ladder"") concerning three of the following basic questions: 1) the amount of general knowledge about health they possessed; 2) the amount of their knowledge of factors conditioning a human's state of health; 3) the amount of the awareness of the importance of one's care for his or her own health and for that of others. The output received in the research shows a mean degree of satisfaction of special pedagogy students with the level of their knowledge concerning health. Their statements connected with their self-assessment of that level should make one reflect upon the subject in question."
21713523,0,a,"If a few risk factors had predictive power for all-cause mortality in different geographical-cultural areas, then preventive efforts might be concentrated on these. Thirteen potential risk factors were measured in 6,554 men aged 40-59 around 1960 in Northern, Southern and Eastern European areas of the Seven Countries Study. In 40 years 85.3% of men died in the pooled areas (87.9, 81.8 and 87.9% in Northern, Southern and Eastern Europe, respectively). Six risk factors were significant predictors of events in all three areas: directly for age, smoking habits, mean blood pressure, heart rate and ECG abnormalities; inversely for forced expiratory volume. In a pooled model also father and mother life status, socio-economic status, and arm circumference (the last one in an inverse way) had significant coefficients that were not heterogeneous across areas (except for socio-economic status). Serum cholesterol was around significance. ROC curves had values of 0.833, 0.806 and 0.819 respectively in Northern, Southern and Eastern Europe, and 0.827 in the pooled areas. Correlation coefficients between observed and expected cases in deciles of estimated risk were between 0.98 and 0.99. Survivors after 40 years in the lower half of the estimated risk were 10.7, 23.6 and 13.3% in Northern, Southern and Eastern Europe, respectively. Under- or over-estimate of cross-applying risk functions did not exceed 15%. All-cause mortality and survival in middle aged men during 40 years were strongly associated with a few, mainly cardiovascular, risk factors, whose predictive power was similar in different cultures across Europe."
31814463,0,a,"Purpose: By using the eligibility determination process of the Swiss accident insurance (Suva) as a case in point, we aimed to examine current challenges and the need for a goal-oriented ICF-based approach in disability evaluation as experienced by different stakeholder groups.Materials and methods: Descriptive qualitative design involving semi-structured expert interviews with five main stakeholder groups of the eligibility determination process (i.e., Suva insurance officers, Suva insurance physicians, treating physicians, lawyers and judges). Interviews were thematically analyzed and their results reflected upon in focus groups with selected interview participants.Results: Forty-three interviews and three focus groups were conducted. Participants pointed to challenges related to standardization, transparency, objectivity, efficiency and contextual factors. An ICF-based standard documenting claimant-job mismatches and their determinants was deemed promising for ensuring comprehensible and valid eligibility decisions, systematic and uniform reporting and a goal-oriented eligibility determination process. Concerns primarily addressed a potential pseudo-accuracy when using the standard for eligibility decisions.Conclusions: Implementing a goal-oriented ICF-based standard may help to approach current challenges in disability evaluation. Our findings support the development of such a standard for Suva's eligibility determination, but also point at the importance of involving key stakeholders to ensure its applicability and cross-disciplinary acceptance.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPoor standardization and transparency as well as objectivity and efficiency issues represent key challenges in disability evaluation, as experienced by the different stakeholder groups involved in an eligibility determination process.A standardized ICF-based approach focusing on the documentation of claimant-job mismatches and their determinants is promising for improving transparency, validity and comparability of eligibility decisions.With its focus on claimants' ability to participate at work such an ICF-based standard has the potential to ensure a goal-oriented planning of assessments and interventions in the eligibility determination process.Our study provides specific targets for optimizing eligibility determination in disability evaluation but also for ensuring a customized and effective return to work after sustaining an injury."
27178191,0,a,"This symposium of the Journal of Bioethical Inquiry illustrates structural competency: how clinical practitioners can intervene on social and institutional determinants of health. It will require training clinicians to see and act on structural barriers to health, to adapt imaginative structural approaches from fields outside of medicine, and to collaborate with disciplines and institutions outside of medicine. Case studies of effective work on all of these levels are presented in this volume. The contributors exemplify structural competency from many angles, from the implications of epigenetics for environmental intervention in personalized medicine to the ways clinicians can act on fundamental causes of disease, address abuses of power in clinical training, racially desegregate cities to reduce health disparities, address the systemic causes of torture by police, and implement harm-reduction programs for addiction in the face of punitive drug laws. Together, these contributors demonstrate the unique roles that clinicians can play in breaking systemic barriers to health and the benefit to the U.S. healthcare system of adopting innovations from outside of the United States and outside of clinical medicine."
25320672,0,a,"Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are both drivers and manifestations of poverty and social inequality. Increased advocacy efforts since the mid-2000s have led to ambitious new control and elimination targets set for 2020 by the World Health Organisation. While these global aspirations represent significant policy momentum, there are multifaceted challenges in controlling infectious diseases in resource-poor local contexts that need to be acknowledged, understood and engaged. However a number of recent publications have emphasised the ""neglected"" status of applied social science research on NTDs. In light of the 2020 targets, this paper explores the social science/NTD literature and unpacks some of the ways in which social inquiry can help support effective and sustainable interventions. Five priority areas are discussed, including on policy processes, health systems capacity, compliance and resistance to interventions, education and behaviour change, and community participation. The paper shows that despite the multifaceted value of having anthropological and sociological perspectives integrated into NTD programmes, contemporary efforts underutilise this potential. This is reflective of the dominance of top-down information flows and technocratic approaches in global health. To counter this tendency, social research needs to be more than an afterthought; integrating social inquiry into the planning, monitoring and evaluating process will help ensure that flexibility and adaptability to local realities are built into interventions. More emphasis on social science perspectives can also help link NTD control to broader social determinants of health, especially important given the major social and economic inequalities that continue to underpin transmission in endemic countries."
19286838,1,a,"BACKGROUND: We used case-control design to compare utilization of health and social services between older decedents and survivors, and to identify the respective impact of age and closeness of death on the utilization of services. METHODS: Data were derived from multiple national registers. The sample consisted of 56,001 persons, who died during years 1998-2000 at the age of > or = 70, and their pairs matched on age, gender and municipality of residence, who were alive at least 2 years after their counterpart's death. Data include use of hospitals, long-term care and home care. Decedents' utilization within 2 years before death and survivors' utilization in the same period of time was assessed in three age groups (70-79, 80-89 and > or = 90 years) and by gender. RESULTS: Decedents used hospital and long-term care more than their surviving counterparts, but the time patterns were different. In hospital care the differences between decedents and survivors rose in the last months of the study period, whereas in long-term care there were clear differences during the whole 2-year period. The differences were smaller in the oldest age group than in younger age groups. CONCLUSION: Closeness of death is an important predictor of health and social service use in old age, but its influence varies between age groups. Not only the changing age structure, but also the higher average age at death affects the future need for services."
30066237,0,a,"This paper examines inequality and polarization in self-assessed health, contributing towards the limited research existing on health economics. We use data from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) to investigate the relationship between health inequality and polarization across 27 European countries in two periods: 2006-2009 and 2013-2015. As our key variable is of an ordinal nature, we employ median based measures. Our empirical results suggest that Greece is the country with the highest level of health polarization in both periods, whereas Ireland has the lowest one when we consider countries where the median category is ""very good"", coinciding with the findings obtained in the inequality index. Estonia, Hungary and Lithuania have the highest degree of health polarization in both periods while Malta, The Netherlands and Spain are the countries with the lowest when we focus on those countries whose median category is ""good"" health."
14686137,1,a,"Although relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient."
15868185,1,a,"The mechanism of final cessation of the reproductive life span has not been solved yet. It is generally assumed that the most important factor is ovarian follicular reserve. In ovaries at intrauterine period, a major factor that determines the number of the primordial follicle is the mitotic ability as well as the number of primordial germ cells, which migrate to gonadal ridge. The telomere length is one factor that determines the number of mitosis of the cell. The differences between the telomere lengths of same aged healthy women reflect the difference of the telomeres of the primordial germ cells at the intrauterine period. Women with long telomeres supposedly have had their primordial germ cells at the beginning of life with long telomeres. So, these cells should have had more mitotic division and more follicle numbers in the ovaries than the short ones. The aim of this study was to analyse the relation of the reproductive life span and telomere length. The telomere lengths of 37 women volunteers aged 50 years were measured by fiber FISH technique. A positive correlation was found between reproductive life span and the telomere length."
31123588,0,a,"Background: The purpose of this study is to explain the experiences of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) about medication adherence. Method: A qualitative content analysis study was conducted at the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism Research and Training Center of Firoozgar Academic Hospital, affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, Iran during April-June 2017. Twenty-six semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with diabetic patients and their families. The participants were asked about their experiences of medication adherence. After the first round of the interviews, content analysis of data started and continued up to the data saturation. Results: Four main themes including perceived barriers (with 6 subthemes including inadequate knowledge, situational influences, inadequate perceived threat about diabetes, treatment characteristics, personality traits and medication cost), perceived social support (with 3 subthemes including family, doctor and community supports), medication beliefs (with 3 subthemes including belief in the effectiveness of treatment, belief in the more effectiveness of complementary therapies than medication use and prioritizing the use of the pills instead of the insulin injection) and cues to action (with 2 subthemes including internal and external cues to action) emerged as the experiences of the participants in terms of anti-diabetic medications adherence which should be considered in developing medication adherence interventions for the patients with T2DM. Conclusion: The patients with T2DM had more barriers for regular drugs consumption. They had incorrect beliefs about anti-diabetic drugs. In addition, they were in need of abroad support community, surroundings and also health professionals. Health systems should consider medication adherence training to be added to the treatment protocols of the diabetic patients."
17826170,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Depression is an important public-health problem, and one of the leading causes of disease burden worldwide. Depression is often comorbid with other chronic diseases and can worsen their associated health outcomes. Few studies have explored the effect of depression, alone or as a comorbidity, on overall health status. METHODS: The WHO World Health Survey (WHS) studied adults aged 18 years and older to obtain data for health, health-related outcomes, and their determinants. Prevalence of depression in respondents based on ICD-10 criteria was estimated. Prevalence values for four chronic physical diseases--angina, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes--were also estimated using algorithms derived via a Diagnostic Item Probability Study. Mean health scores were constructed using factor analysis and compared across different disease states and demographic variables. The relation of these disease states to mean health scores was determined through regression modelling. FINDINGS: Observations were available for 245 404 participants from 60 countries in all regions of the world. Overall, 1-year prevalence for ICD-10 depressive episode alone was 3.2% (95% CI 3.0-3.5); for angina 4.5% (4.3-4.8); for arthritis 4.1% (3.8-4.3); for asthma 3.3% (2.9-3.6); and for diabetes 2.0% (1.8-2.2). An average of between 9.3% and 23.0% of participants with one or more chronic physical disease had comorbid depression. This result was significantly higher than the likelihood of having depression in the absence of a chronic physical disease (p<0.0001). After adjustment for socioeconomic factors and health conditions, depression had the largest effect on worsening mean health scores compared with the other chronic conditions. Consistently across countries and different demographic characteristics, respondents with depression comorbid with one or more chronic diseases had the worst health scores of all the disease states. INTERPRETATION: Depression produces the greatest decrement in health compared with the chronic diseases angina, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes. The comorbid state of depression incrementally worsens health compared with depression alone, with any of the chronic diseases alone, and with any combination of chronic diseases without depression. These results indicate the urgency of addressing depression as a public-health priority to reduce disease burden and disability, and to improve the overall health of populations."
16137331,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This study focuses on determinants of a healthy work environment in two departments in a Swedish university hospital. The study is based on previously conducted longitudinal studies at the hospital (1994-2001), concerning working conditions and health outcomes among health care personnel in conjunction with downsizing processes. Overall, there was a general negative trend in relation to mental health, as well as long-term sick leave during the study period. The two departments chosen for the current study differed from the general hospital trend in that they showed stable health development. The aim of the study was to identify and analyse experiential determinants of healthy working conditions. METHODS: Thematic open-ended interviews were carried out with seventeen managers and key informants, representing different groups of co-workers in the two departments. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and an inductive content analysis was made. RESULTS: In the two studied departments the respondents perceived that it was advantageous to belong to a small department, and to work in cooperation-oriented care. The management approaches described by both managers and co-workers could be interpreted as transformational, due to a strain of visionary, delegating, motivating, confirmative, supportive attitudes and a strongly expressed solution-oriented attitude. The daily work included integrated learning activities. The existing organisational conditions, approaches and attitudes promoted tendencies towards a work climate characterised by trust, team spirit and professionalism. In the description of the themes organisational conditions, approaches and climate, two core determinants, work-pride and confidence, for healthy working conditions were interpreted. Our core determinants augment the well-established concepts: manageability, comprehensiveness and meaningfulness. These favourable conditions seem to function as a buffer against the general negative effects of downsizing observed elsewhere in the hospital, and in the literature. CONCLUSION: Research illuminating health-promoting aspects is rather unusual. This study could be seen as explorative. The themes and core dimensions we found could be used as a basis for further intervention studies in similar health-care settings. The result could also be used in future health promotion studies in larger populations. One of the first steps in such a strategy is to formulate relevant questions, and we consider that this study contributes to this."
11092151,1,a,"This study was designed to examine the attitudes of student athletes toward the use of painkilling drugs. A total of 563 student athletes at two Division One NCAA universities were surveyed in this study. Twenty-nine percent of the student athletes (n = 165) reported that they felt there is nothing wrong with using painkilling drugs on the day of competition (when injured) to cope with pain. These student athletes reported that they would use painkilling drugs to mask injury in order to continue to participate in their sport. Student athletes' perceptions of societal norms and expectations related to competition, and the degree of control student athletes perceive that they have when deciding to use painkillers, may be important determinants governing the extent to which they may be at risk for abusing these substances. Research on planned behavior and reasoned action against suggests that salient beliefs affect intentions and subsequent behaviors, either through attitudes or subjective norms, or the degree of (perceived) control that an individual feels he/she has over the behavior [1, 2]. This theoretical model was used as a guiding framework for analyzing the attitudes of college athletes toward painkilling drugs. Recommendations are included in this article for coaches, educators, team physicians, team trainers, and administrators who are concerned about controlling the use and abuse of painkilling drugs by student athletes."
17473623,1,a,"This study aimed to establish the determinants of health-related quality of life in a rural and an urban sample of Xhosa-speaking people with disability. The sample was a convenience sample and was identified through a 'snowballing' process initiated by enumerators who were all members of Disabled People South Africa. The Xhosa version of the EQ-5D was utilized and the visual analogue scale which ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) was used as the dependent measure. The sample consisted of 244 rural and 61 urban respondents, demonstrating a preponderance of physical disabilities. The urban sample reported more problems in each of the descriptor domains. The visual analogue scale score showed a bimodal distribution. The results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that the presence of pain detracted most from health-related quality of life (-20%), followed by anxiety and depression (-10%), and difficulty with performance of usual activities (-10%). Rural participants, with the same impairment level, reported 8% poorer health-related quality of life. The mean visual analogue scale scores were low (in the 60s), and would indicate that the majority of people living with disability do not necessarily adapt to their functional limitations and continue to experience diminished health-related quality of life. The bimodal distribution, however, did indicate that some respondents enjoyed good health-related quality of life. There is a need to manage symptoms, particularly pain and depression, as these have a severe negative impact on health-related quality of life. The rural setting seemed to contribute to a worse perceived health-related quality of life. This effect needs to be factored in when evaluating programmes."
31446632,0,a,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: Problematic alcohol consumption (PAC) affects one-third of homeless Australians, and it is expected that the rates will increase as the population ages. However, current policy does not recognise the importance of this problem. The aim of this narrative review was to examine the social determinants and other risk factors contributing to PAC in homeless Australians, the barriers to receiving help and possible solutions for the Australian context. METHODS: PubMed and PsycINFO databases and Australian government websites were examined for the keywords ""alcohol"" and ""homeless,"" and pertinent articles were selected for inclusion and for citation tracking of further relevant articles. RESULTS: The causes of PAC in homeless Australians are multifactorial, and multidirectional, and include risk factors such as low socio-economic status, mental illness and having experienced trauma. There is significant stigma associated with both homelessness and PAC, which further isolates this group. Current policies to address PAC in the homeless are inadequate; however, there are a range of possible programs to reduce PAC in this group, and international harm reduction strategies have also shown success in improving outcomes for this group. CONCLUSION: There are numerous social risk factors that influence the development of PAC in the homeless. The introduction of harm reduction strategies, programs to enhance motivation and personal skills, as well as better mental health treatment, would all fill important gaps in services for homeless Australians with PAC. SO WHAT?: Health professionals can be advised that there are many social determinants that influence PAC in homeless Australians. There are important structural barriers to providing this marginalised group with the services they require; however, there is scope for the introduction of new programs, including harm reduction strategies, to meet the fundamental needs of this group."
29635335,0,a,"Background: The French Chronic Kidney Disease-Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (CKD-REIN) cohort study was designed to investigate the determinants of prognosis and care of patients referred to nephrologists with moderate and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). We examined their baseline risk profile and experience. Methods: We collected bioclinical and patient-reported information from 3033 outpatients with CKD and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) of 15-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 treated at 40 nationally representative public and private facilities. Results: The patients' median age was 69 (60-76) years, 65% were men, their mean eGFR was 33 mL/min/1.73 m2, 43% had diabetes, 24% had a history of acute kidney injury (AKI) and 57% had uncontrolled blood pressure (BP; >140/90 mmHg). Men had worse risk profiles than women and were more likely to be past or current smokers (73% versus 34%) and have cardiovascular disease (59% versus 42%), albuminuria >30 mg/mmol (or proteinuria > 50) (40% versus 30%) (all P < 0.001) and a higher median risk of end-stage renal disease within 5 years, predicted by the kidney failure risk equation {12% [interquartile range (IQR) 3-37%] versus 9% [3-31%], P = 0.008}. During the previous year, 60% of patients reported one-to-two nephrologist visits and four or more general practitioner visits; only 25% saw a dietician and 75% were prescribed five or more medications daily. Physical and mental quality of life (QoL) were poor, with scores <50/100. Conclusions: The CKD-REIN study highlights high-risk profiles of cohort members and identifies several priorities, including improving BP control and dietary counselling and increasing doctors' awareness of AKI, polypharmacy and QoL. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03381950."
19946998,1,a,"The oral health of disadvantaged social groups is worse at all the ages than that of the favored groups. If tooth decay prevalence decreases, this disease is still unequally distributed: 20% of the children, those with the weakest socio-economic statute (SES), concentrate 60% of the decays. Edentulism strikes significantly more people with weak SES. The inequalities of oral health reflect those of general health. Evidence of the inequalities in oral health is exposed even in the developed countries. Different models of intervention are presented: risk groups identification and targeting by specific programs; oral health community approach which includes socio-economic and public health measures aiming all the population; insurance approach to be combined with the preceding ones."
18703376,1,a,"The population health perspective recognizes a broad range of characteristics that are thought to be important determinants of health. In Canada, 12 such determinants of health are recognized, which range from lifestyle practices and the use of health care services to social and physical environments. While the list of social determinants is quite exhaustive, few studies have examined the relative importance of these determinants. The intent of this paper is to examine the relative importance of a range of social determinants of health in predicting four health outcomes of interest using data from a neighbourhood-level cross-sectional health survey conducted in Hamilton, Ontario. The results show that key social determinants of health vary by health outcome. The significance of the findings is discussed in terms of policy relevance and future research."
28484352,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death. The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases was reported to be 3,500 per 100,000. And it is predicted that these numbers will increase in the near future. By removing the main factors responsible for non-communicable diseases, cardiovascular disease can be prevented by 80%. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the population attributable fraction for cardiovascular diseases' risk factors in Iran, USA and Spain. METHODS: This study was a comparative study and the population consisted of Iran, USA and Spain. The required information was collected from printed and electronic documentations and articles published in reliable databases, in the period 2007-2015. RESULTS: The cardiovascular diseases' Population Attributable Risk or Fraction for blood pressure was calculated to be 11.37%, 54% and 60%, diabetes 7.32%, 13% and 18%, and high cholesterol 6.85%, 13% and 20%, for Iran, USA and Spain respectively. Among risk factors, blood pressure was the most relevant factor to cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: The risk factor for high blood pressure had a more population attributable fraction than other physiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. Hence, by implementing comprehensive health policies, educating healthy lifestyle, screening and finding related cases as well as conducting health promotion programs, these diseases can be prevented."
15330403,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Although patients with bipolar disorder have been shown to benefit from psychosocial interventions, the proportion that utilizes these interventions is unknown. We set out to clarify the determinants of psychosocial service utilization in adults with bipolar disorder. METHOD: We investigated psychosocial service utilization among the first 500 patients admitted to the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD). RESULTS: In the 3 months prior to enrollment in STEP-BD, a majority of the patients (54%) were engaged in at least one psychosocial service modality in addition to pharmacotherapy. In order of decreasing frequency, these were therapy with a psychologist, self-help group, therapy with a social worker, and therapy with another type of provider. Bipolar patients with personality disorders (80% vs 20%, p = 0.0002), alcohol/drug abuse disorders (76% vs 24%, p = 0.0022), and anxiety disorders (60% vs 40%, p = 0.0043) received more psychosocial services than those without. Poorer global functioning also increased the likelihood of receiving services, whereas being married decreased service utilization. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial service utilization by outpatients with bipolar disorder is strongly linked to greater severity/complexity of illness. Potential moderators, such as insurance status and availability of care, should be examined in future studies."
31859950,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to analyze the relationship between visceral leishmaniasis mortality and social determinants of health (SDH). METHODS: This was an ecological study of all leishmaniasis-related deaths in Brazil, from 2001 to 2015. We analyzed 49 indicators of human development and social vulnerability. The association was tested using the classical and spatial regression model. RESULTS: Mortality was associated with indicators that expressed low human development and high social vulnerability: lack of garbage collection, low schooling, unemployment rate, low per capita income, and income inequality (Gini index). CONCLUSIONS: There was an association between high mortality by leishmaniasis and low SDH."
12023313,1,a,"Tuberous sclerosis is one of the few established medical causes of autism spectrum disorder and is a unique neurogenetic model for testing theories about the brain basis of the syndrome. We conducted a retrospective case study of the neuro-epileptic risk factors predisposing to autism spectrum disorder in individuals with tuberous sclerosis to test current neurobiological theories of autism spectrum disorder. We found that an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis was associated with the presence of cortical tubers in the temporal but not other lobes of the brain. Indeed, the presence of tubers in the temporal lobes appeared to be a necessary but not sufficient risk factor for the development of an autism spectrum disorder. However, contrary to the predictions of some theories, the location of tubers in specific regions of the temporal lobe, such as the superior temporal gyrus or the right temporal lobe, did not determine which individuals with temporal lobe tubers developed an autism spectrum disorder. Instead, outcome was associated with various indices of epileptic activity including evidence of temporal lobe epileptiform discharges on EEG, the age to onset of seizures in the first 3 years of life and a history of infantile spasms. The results indicated that individuals with tuberous sclerosis are at very high risk of developing an autism spectrum disorder when temporal lobe tubers are present and associated with temporal lobe epileptiform discharges and early-onset, persistent spasm-like seizures. These risk markers constitute useful clinical indicators of prognosis, but further research is required to identify the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for their association with outcome. Most especially, it will be important to test whether, as the findings suggest, there is a critical early stage of brain maturation during which temporal lobe epilepsy perturbs the development of brain systems that underpin 'social intelligence' and possibly other cognitive skills, thereby inducing an autism spectrum disorder."
20198904,1,a,"Drug use is a complex behavior with multidimensional determinants, including social, psychological, cultural, economic, and biological factors. Blood borne viral infections including hepatitis C virus are transmitted when an uninfected intravenous drug user (IVDU) uses injection equipment, especially syringes, that have previously been used by an infected person. The transmission can also result from sharing other injection equipment such as 'cookers' and 'cottons'. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse have declined substantially since the introduction of needle exchange. Infection with hepatitis C may spontaneously resolve during the acute stage and never progress to chronic infection, or the infection may become chronic without medical complications, or the infection may become chronic with progressive medical complications. Regular testing for infection is an important strategy for secondary prevention of chronic hepatitis C infection. Care for hepatitis C is a vital component of a comprehensive health program for persons using illicit drugs. Such care includes screening for transmission risk behavior, prevention counseling and education, testing for HCV antibody and RNA. IDUs found to have chronic HCV infection should be assessed for the presence and degree of liver disease and evaluated for treatment for HCV Hepatitis C care also requires providing access to treatment for substance use and abuse. Therapy with opioid agonists, including methadone maintenance treatment, has been shown to diminish and often eliminate opioid use and reduce transmission of infection. Approval of buprenorphine makes office-based pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction possible. When considering treatment for hepatitis C, particular attention must be paid to mental health conditions. As a group, IDUs exhibit higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders than the general population. IFN-based regimens for hepatitis C are often complicated by neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including depression, insomnia, and irritability. Strong linkages with mental health services, whether on-site or within the community, are a vital component of comprehensive health programs for IDUs and are particularly important during treatment for hepatitis C. Past episodes of depression or other psychiatric disorders are not absolute contraindications for the treatment for HCV infection. Some authors recommend prophylactic antidepressant therapy before initiating treatment for HCV in patients thought to be at a high risk of depression."
15189215,1,a,"Mating systems are important determinants of genetic structure in cooperative groups, and their effects can influence profoundly the interactions of group members. The primitively eusocial wasp, Ropalidia revolutionalis, has an interesting genetic and social structure that makes it an excellent model system for examining the evolution of more complex societies. In particular, its colonies sometimes have multiple queens, a key characteristic of more advanced wasp societies. In this study, we have characterized the mating system of the social wasp Ropalidia revolutionalis to understand better its colony genetic structure. R. revolutionalis females nearly always mate singly and they are unrelated to their mates. However, different females in the same colony do mate with males, on average, who are related as cousins. Single mating will help to maintain high relatedness, which should be important for continued cooperation in multiple queen societies, but it creates potential conflicts in single queen colonies over the production of males as well as over the timing of male production. We have also characterized the population structure of R. revolutionalis from Townsville, in tropical north Queensland, to Brisbane in the subtropics. Even at such a large scale, the population is remarkably unstructured with an average F(ST) of 0.0546. There is weak isolation by distance, and evidence for subtle differentiation between a southern region with no dry season, which extends as far north as Rockhampton, and a northern region with a severe to moderate dry season. This may reflect historical effects of extreme aridity on the population structure."
18156100,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Sex (referring to the strict biological sense) and gender (referring to the sociocultural dimension) are major determinants of health and disease. OBJECTIVE: This review examines similarities and differences between the sexes in the prevalence of osteoporosis and fractures, bone- and fall-related risk factors for incident fractures, and the possibilities of fracture prevention, as well as gender differences in the perception of osteoporosis. METHODS: We reviewed recent English-language publications on sex and gender differences in the context of osteoporosis and fracture risk. We refer to several reviews that provide extensive reference lists on the topics discussed. RESULTS: The incidence of fractures is higher in boys than in girls. The burden of fractures in adults increases with age, and it starts earlier and is higher in adult women than in adult men. With life expectancy increasing, the annual number of fractures is likely to increase substantially. Fractures in adults contribute to increased mortality (more in men than in women), increased morbidity (equal in men and women), and high costs (greater for women than for men). Adult men experience fewer fractures than women do. Men build larger bones with better microarchitecture while they are growing and thereafter have less increase in bone remodeling. Furthermore, they develop bone loss at a later age. Compared with their female counterparts, fewer older men are hypogonadic, and life expectancy is shorter for men than for women. There are multiple reasons for the differences in the incidences of fractures between men and women, related to the many factors associated with both bone and falls that influence fracture risk from the molecular and cellular level to the organ level. Sex hormones play a central and essential role in the physiology of bone by direct and indirect mechanisms (eg, by interfering with the growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 axis). Case-finding strategies to identify patients at highest risk for fractures, including bone densitometry and clinical risk factors, are much better documented at the population level in women than in men. Drug therapies that reduce the risk of a broad spectrum of fractures, even in the short term, are more clearly demonstrated in randomized controlled studies in women than in men. Drug therapy is more widely available for women with osteoporosis,but it is rarely given to men with osteoporosis. Differences in the perception of osteoporosis between men and women are even less well documented. CONCLUSIONS: In general, osteoporosis is underdiagnosed and undertreated in women but even more so in men, and is related to limits in the patient's and the physician's awareness at all clinical stages, from case finding to compliance with and persistence of therapy. Furthermore, the lay perception of a healthy lifestyle, the level of social isolation, networking within the health care system, and opportunities for screening appear to contribute to gender differences in participating in osteoporosis prevention and therapy. These aspects of health care deserve further attention and research."
17176242,1,a,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: Food insecurity, now listed among the social determinants of health, compromises the health and well-being of affected Australians. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of food insecurity within an urban population of social disadvantage in readiness for a local health promotion response. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey conducted in three disadvantaged locations of south-western Sydney. Prevalence of food insecurity was assessed using both the 16-item US Household Food Security Survey Module and the single-item question previously used in national Australian health surveys. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between food insecurity and socio-demographic characteristics of the households. RESULTS: The 16-item US tool yielded a significantly higher food insecurity prevalence (21.9%, 95% CI 20.0-23.8) than the single-item Australian tool (15.8%, 95% CI 14.1-17.5). Compared with the former, the single-item Australian tool has high specificity (96%) yet low sensitivity (56.9%). In our three sites, food insecurity was strongly and independently associated with household capacity to save money (AOR=5.05). Local fruit and vegetable production (83.8%), nutrition education (83.9%), transport to food outlets (81.5%) and better public transport overall (76.3%) were most highly rated by 'food insecure' households as useful future strategies. CONCLUSION: The higher sensitivity of the US 16-item food security survey module relative to the single-item Australian tool indicates its potential for use in future Australian surveys of food insecurity."
27143540,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: to present a critical reflection upon the current and different interpretative models of the Social Determinants of Health and inequalities hindering access and the right to health. METHOD: theoretical study using critical hermeneutics to acquire reconstructive understanding based on a dialectical relationship between the explanation and understanding of interpretative models of the social determinants of health and inequalities. RESULTS: interpretative models concerning the topic under study are classified. Three generations of interpretative models of the social determinants of health were identified and historically contextualized. The third and current generation presents a historical synthesis of the previous generations, including: neo-materialist theory, psychosocial theory, the theory of social capital, cultural-behavioral theory and the life course theory. CONCLUSION: From dialectical reflection and social criticism emerge a discussion concerning the complementarity of the models of the social determinants of health and the need for a more comprehensive conception of the determinants to guide inter-sector actions to eradicate inequalities that hinder access to health."
24627748,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) on antiretroviral therapy has appreciably increased. However, psychosocial challenges pose a great threat to their health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The aim of this study was to determine psychosocial factors influencing health-related quality of life of PLHA on antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling to select 226 PLHA at District hospital. Demographic information was collected using a semistructured questionnaire. HRQOL was assessed using WHOQOL-HIV Bref. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, CAGE scale, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were used. One-way ANOVA was applied. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in mean quality of life score with respect to level of anxiety in the physical (P < 0.001), psychological (P < 0.001), level of independence (P < 0.001), social relationships (P = 0.047), environment (P < 0.001), and spirituality domain (P < 0.001). Significant difference in mean quality of life score was observed with respect to level of depression in physical (P = 0.003), psychological (P = 0.036), level of independence (P = 0.017), social relationships (P = 0.019), and spirituality (P = 0.001). Friend support was positively associated with HRQOL in physical (P < 0.001), psychological (P < 0.001), level of independence (P = 0.013), social relationships (P < 0.001), environment (0.001), and spirituality domain (0.026). Family support was positively associated with HRQOL in physical (P = 0.001), psychological (P = 0.001), level of independence (P = 0.040), social relationships (P = 0.008), environment (0.001), and spirituality domain (0.026). A significant difference was observed with respect to affiliation to social organization in social relationships domain (P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial challenges including anxiety, depression, and social support impact upon all domains of HRQOL of PLHA."
12197201,1,a,"Spain has been a crossroads, for confrontation and peaceful living-together. The problems arising from immigration as a mass phenomenon are characteristic of the present times. Variables which define the immigration phenomenon are the attraction to the economically developed countries with an active labour market, while it is inversely related to the distance from the departure countries. The phenomenon is also modified by positive influences as the common language, and by negative factors as the political or social instability. The aging of the populations in developed countries, and the need of labour market, stimulate the immigration phenomenon, which may affect to 2.3% of the population. The reproductive capacity of the population depends not only on biological determinants but also on the heterogeneous culture of immigration, because immigrants are candidates to become stable members of society. There is a logic of discrimination of those which are different. Thus, we need a legislation to establish their rights and duties, as well as an integration policy to favour the cultural diversity."
29356347,0,a,"The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for 6 months and continued breastfeeding for at least 2 years. Social support has been widely recognized to influence breastfeeding practices. However, existing scales do not measure exclusive breastfeeding social support (EBFSS), rather they assess social support for any breastfeeding. Further, they are tailored towards high-income settings. Therefore, our objectives were to develop and validate a tool to measure EBFSS in low-income settings. To develop the scale, local and international breastfeeding experts were consulted on modifications to the Hughes' Breastfeeding Social Support Scale. It was then implemented in an observational cohort in Gulu, Uganda, at 1 (n = 238) and 3 (n = 237) months post-partum (NCT02925429). We performed polychoric and polyserial correlations to remove redundant items and exploratory factor analysis at 1 month post-partum to determine the latent factor structure of EBFSS. We further applied confirmatory factor analysis to assess dimensionality of the scale at 3 months post-partum. We then conducted tests of predictive, convergent, and discriminant validity against EBF, self-efficacy, general social support, and depression. The modification of the Hughes' scale resulted in 18 items, which were reduced to 16 after examining variances and factor loadings. Three dimensions of support emerged: Instrumental, Emotional, and Informational, with alpha coefficients of 0.79, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. Predictive, convergent, and discriminant validity of the resultant EBFSS scale was supported. The EBFSS scale is valid and reliable for measuring EBFSS in northern Uganda and may be of use in other low-income settings to assess determinants of EBF."
12856126,1,a,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To describe the clinical, psychological and social factors affecting diabetes knowledge of veterans with established Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of 284 insulin-treated veterans with stable Type 2 diabetes. All subjects completed the University of Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Centre Knowledge Test, the Diabetes Care Profile, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Diabetes Family Behaviour Checklist. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to develop a model for the diabetes knowledge score based upon clinical and psychosocial variables. RESULTS: One hundred eighty subjects were evaluated in a derivation set. The mean age +/- SD was 65.4+/-9.6 years, 94% were men, and 36% were members of a minority group. Performance on the diabetes knowledge test was poor (64.9+/-15.3% correct). Self-perceived understanding of all management objectives explained only 6% of the variance in the knowledge scores. Multivariate analysis showed that age, years of schooling, duration of treatment, cognitive function, sex, and level of depression were independent determinants of the knowledge score. When the model was applied to 104 subjects in a validation set, there was a strong correlation between observed and predicted scores (r=0.537; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Stable, insulin-treated veterans have major deficiencies in diabetes knowledge that could impair their ability to provide self-care. A multivariate model comprised of demographic variables and psychosocial profiling can identify patients who have limited diabetes knowledge and be used to assess individual barriers to ongoing diabetes education."
23680228,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Studies that have looked at the effect of polio eradication efforts in India on routine immunization programs have provided mixed findings. One polio eradication project, funded by US Agency for International Development (USAID) and carried out by the CORE Group Polio Project (CGPP) in the state of Uttar Pradesh of India, has included the strengthening of routine immunization systems as a core part of its polio eradication strategy. This paper explores the performance of routine immunization services in the CGPP intervention areas concurrent with intensive polio eradication activities. The paper also explores determinants of routine immunization performance such as caretaker characteristics and CGPP activities to strengthen routine immunization services. METHODS: We conduct secondary data analysis of the latest project household immunization survey in 2011 and compare these findings to reports of past surveys in the CGPP program area and at the Uttar Pradesh state level (as measured by children's receipt of DPT vaccinations). This is done to judge if there is any evidence that routine immunization services are being disrupted. We also model characteristics of survey respondents and respondents' exposure to CGPP, communication activities against their children's receipt of key vaccinations in order to identify determinants of routine immunization coverage. RESULTS: Routine immunization coverage has increased between the first survey (2005 for state level estimates, 2008 for the CGPP program) and the latest (2011 for both state level and CGPP areas), as measured by children's receipt of DPT vaccination. This increase occurred concurrent with polio eradication efforts intensive enough to result in interruption of transmission. In addition, a mothers' exposure to specific communication materials, her religion and education were associated with whether or not her children receive one or more doses of DPT. CONCLUSIONS: A limitation of the analysis is the absence of a controlled comparison. It is possible routine immunization coverage would have increased even more in the absence of polio eradication efforts. At the same time, however, there is no evidence that routine immunization services were disrupted by polio eradication efforts. Targeted health communications are helpful in improving routine immunization performance. Strategies to address other determinants of routine immunization, such as religion and education, are also needed to maximize coverage."
30836713,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Social campaigns focusing on health are commonly used within an attempt to change behavior. To date, there has not been a targeted analysis of societies' general perception about social campaigns. The aim of this study is to assess citizens' opinions on the effectiveness of health-related social campaigns. METHODS: The data set used in the analysis was obtained from Poland's nationwide ""Social Diagnosis"" study. The determinants of public opinion were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression. The independent variables included socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, social participation, and the use of digital media. RESULTS: The logistic regression model was developed using 23,593 cases. Opinions about the effectiveness of campaigns depended on all the predictors included in the socio-demographic cluster, smoking, self-declared excessive alcohol consumption, physical activity, the use of mobile phones, and watching TV. A significant impact was found in all but one variable related to social participation. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis revealed that opinions about social campaigns present in the media ""landscape"" are influenced by many factors. Interestingly, persons exhibiting unhealthy behaviors are more resistant to health-related campaigns and surprisingly the need to make use of healthcare resources is not accompanied by an acceptance of the interventions."
30226792,0,a,"Growing evidence suggests that the seeds of relationship decay can be detected via implicit partner evaluations even when explicit evaluations fail to do so. However, little is known about the concrete daily relational processes that explain why these gut feelings are such important determinants of relationships' long-term outcomes. The present integrative multimethod research yielded a novel finding: that participants with more positive implicit partner evaluations exhibited more constructive nonverbal (but not verbal) behavior toward their partner in a videotaped dyadic interaction. In turn, this behavior was associated with greater satisfaction with the conversation and with the relationship in the following 8-day diary portion of the study. These findings represent a significant step forward in understanding the crucial role of automatic processes in romantic relationships. Together, they provide novel evidence that relationship success appears to be highly dependent on how people spontaneously behave in their relationship, which may be ultimately rooted in their implicit partner evaluations."
29615022,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the issue of job satisfaction of nurses with master of nursing degrees may help develop organisational changes necessary for better functioning of health care institutions. This study aimed to evaluate the level of job satisfaction among holders of Masters of Nursing degrees employed at health care institutions and to ascertain its determinants. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was carried out in randomly selected health care institutions in Poland using the Misener Nurse Practitioner Job Satisfaction Survey and an original survey questionnaire with two open-ended questions. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and summary statistics. RESULTS: The participants gave highest satisfaction ratings to their relationships with direct superiors and other nurses, as well as their social contacts at work. The lowest ratings were given to the pension scheme and factors connected with remuneration. A highly statistically significant relationship was found between the job classification and the level of professional satisfaction (p < 0.001). Qualitative analysis of responses to the two open-ended questions supported Herzberg's Two-Factor theory: internal factors promoted satisfaction, whilst external ones caused dissatisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Managers of nurses should strengthen the areas that contribute to higher employee satisfaction, particularly interpersonal relationships, by commendation and recognition of work effects."
23286930,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Minority ethnic groups are often assumed to exchange higher levels of informal support than the majority population, despite evidence that controlling for socioeconomic and health inequalities eliminates differences. Using a unique data set from England and Wales, we examined instrumental support across ethnic groups in mid and later life. METHOD: Employing data from the Home Office Citizenship Survey 2005 (N = 14,081), we investigated ethnic group differences in instrumental support among people aged 55 and older in England and Wales (n = 4,710). Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate the determinants of support given and received, guided by the Andersen-Newman behavioral model. RESULTS: Compared with the White British group, the Indian group reported significantly higher odds (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-4.7) of receiving instrumental support from household members but significantly lower odds of giving support to relatives outside the household (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9). Three other ethnic groups (Pakistani and Bangladeshi, Mixed, Other) reported significantly lower odds in unadjusted findings, but when adjusted, ethnic group differences were no longer significant. DISCUSSION: Our analyses suggest few ethnic group differences in instrumental support once need and enabling factors were taken into account. Such findings are contrary to the belief that minority groups exchange more informal support and therefore have less need for formal services. The Andersen-Newman model is useful for guiding the analysis of support both given and received."
29741703,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between overall level and source-specific work-related stressors on medication errors rate. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study examined the relationship between overall levels of stress, 25 source-specific work-related stressors and medication error rate based on documented incident reports in Saudi Arabia (SA) hospital, using secondary databases. SETTING: King Abdulaziz Hospital in Al-Ahsa, Eastern Region, SA. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and sixty-nine healthcare professionals (HCPs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for HCPs documented incident report medication errors and self-reported sources of Job Stress Survey. RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression analysis identified source-specific work-related stress as significantly associated with HCPs who made at least one medication error per month (P < 0.05), including disruption to home life, pressure to meet deadlines, difficulties with colleagues, excessive workload, income over 10 000 riyals and compulsory night/weekend call duties either some or all of the time. Although not statistically significant, HCPs who reported overall stress were two times more likely to make at least one medication error per month than non-stressed HCPs (OR: 1.95, P = 0.081). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to use documented incident reports for medication errors rather than self-report to evaluate the level of stress-related medication errors in SA HCPs. Job demands, such as social stressors (home life disruption, difficulties with colleagues), time pressures, structural determinants (compulsory night/weekend call duties) and higher income, were significantly associated with medication errors whereas overall stress revealed a 2-fold higher trend."
23683369,0,a,"Health inequities are a common problem for all countries and are the result of not only adverse social conditions but also poor public policies. Today chronic diseases represent the most relevant threats and are a current challenge. Parasitic infections, a leading cause of child morbidity affecting low-income populations, can be transmitted because of an unhealthy environment. Notwithstanding, scarce data have been published on the epidemiological profile of intestinal parasitoses in asymptomatic children living in shantytowns. Vulnerable populations settled in slums are growing in Argentina, particularly in Buenos Aires city. Consequently, this work intended to screen healthy carriers of enteric parasites and determine the epidemiologic profile in asymptomatic children residing in one of those communities, to explore risk factors associated with the transmission of parasites, and to initiate a basic health education campaign to promote healthy behavior in the community. Fecal samples (n = 138) were analyzed by conventional parasitological methods and a survey gathered data on symptoms, family composition, and environmental and hygiene-related variables. High prevalence of feco-orally-transmitted parasitoses (83.3%) and polyparasitism were remarkable findings. The main environmental health determinants were those related to excreta disposal and water provision. Health promotion actions were performed through the diffusion of a set of posters with iconic images and brief messages for health education. Results suggest the need for an environmental sanitation policy to complement health promotion actions. It is essential to spread the results of investigations that address inequities and social determinants of health in order to integrate data with local political processes and alert on acceptable actions for developing appropriate interventions."
18366252,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies."
18846895,1,a,"Children and youth with cerebral palsy (CP) experience difficulties in their ability to move, problem solve, socialize, and communicate, associated with limitations in activities in all environments. They are at risk for lower participation in social and leisure activities critical in fostering friendships, developing interests, and promoting well-being. Little is known about involvement in leisure activities and their determinants. This systematic review aims to describe participation in leisure activities by children with CP and identify personal and environmental factors that influence participation. The following databases were reviewed--CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane, Web of Science, OT-seeker, and REHABDATA--using the keywords participation, cerebral palsy, leisure, and recreation. The literature to date suggests that children with physical disabilities are less involved in leisure activities than their peers; activities are more passive, home based, and lack variety. Several factors influence participation in leisure activities, including age, gender, activity limitations, family preferences and coping, motivation, and environmental resources and supports."
16172560,1,a,"Community health centers in the United States, first launched as a federal initiative in 1965, were rooted in models from South Africa, the American civil rights struggle, and a national commitment to address poverty. The first 2 centers, one serving a rural population in the Mississippi Delta and another a public housing project in Boston, incorporated such core principles as provision of primary care to a defined area or population; public health interventions addressing social determinants of health; emphasis on community participation; community empowerment leading to control of the new institutions; epidemiologic methods to identify problems and guide decisions; new combinations of clinical and public health personnel; and reduction of disparities in health and healthcare of the poor and minorities. The continuing relevance of these principles in today's greatly expanded health center network is reviewed."
24046215,0,a,"Asthma is an important public health problem in urban Latin America. This study aimed to analyze the role of socioeconomic and environmental factors as potential determinants of asthma symptoms prevalence in children from Latin American (LA) urban centers. We selected 31 LA urban centers with complete data, and an ecological analysis was performed. According to our theoretical framework, the explanatory variables were classified in three levels: distal, intermediate, and proximate. The association between variables in the three levels and prevalence of asthma symptoms was examined by bivariate and multivariate linear regression analysis weighed by sample size. In a second stage, we fitted several linear regression models introducing sequentially the variables according to the predefined hierarchy. In the final hierarchical model Gini Index, crowding, sanitation, variation in infant mortality rates and homicide rates, explained great part of the variance in asthma prevalence between centers (R(2) = 75.0 %). We found a strong association between socioeconomic and environmental variables and prevalence of asthma symptoms in LA urban children, and according to our hierarchical framework and the results found we suggest that social inequalities (measured by the Gini Index) is a central determinant to explain high prevalence of asthma in LA."
28604227,0,a,"BACKGROUND:: Nurses have always been known as an advocate for the rights of patients. The recognition of what is perceived as the violation of patients' rights can help nurses to understand patients' concerns and priorities. Thus, it helps nurses play their supportive roles more effectively. OBJECTIVE:: The aim of this study was to explore different dimensions of the violation of patients' rights. RESEARCH DESIGN:: Data were collected utilizing unstructured interviews and field notes. Data analysis was conducted using the qualitative content analysis approach. Prolonged engagement, maximum variation sampling, and member check were among the factors which enriched the research. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT:: The sample consisted of 18 patients and 11 members of their families. They were purposively selected from two hospitals in Tehran during 2009-2012. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:: The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of the university and hospitals. FINDING:: The patients' rights were violated in a variety of ways. There were three main dimensions to this issue: (a) care recession including deprivation of the caregiver's presence and the delay/lack of needed responses; (b) receiving mechanical care including superficiality, lack of emotion, and failure to understand the situation; and (c) being disrespected including humility and aggression. CONCLUSION:: The patients and their families consider any shortcomings in relation to the patient and the quality of care as the violation of the rights. The findings of the study imply sensitizing managers toward providing appropriate conditions as well as educating nurses to observe patients' rights. It is suggested that the processes leading to the violation of patients' rights be discovered and prevented in the future."
18198004,1,a,"This paper examines factors that may predispose unmarried and unemployed out-of-school youth to risky sexual behaviour. Data for analysis were derived from the Behaviour Surveillance Survey carried out in Kenya in late 2002. A total of 6129 male and female unmarried and unemployed out-of-school youth in the age range 15-24 years were successfully interviewed. However, for this paper only a sample of 3961 comprising sexually experienced youth in the 12 months preceding the survey was used. Methods of analysis included descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression. Results for males indicate that factors associated with low and high risk were whether they had fathered a child, district of residence and frequency of alcohol use, while current age and age at first sexual debut stood out for those with low risk alone. For females the district of residence and age of partner at sexual debut were the factors that predisposed them to low-risk sexual behaviour, while for high risk the district of residence, current age and ever being pregnant were significant. The results indicate that for these youth, contextual and probably social factors appear to be the main determinants of risky sexual behaviour for both males and females. The findings also support those of other studies that link risky sexual behaviour among youth, especially males, to alcohol consumption. Programmes for intervention therefore need to focus on these aspects. There is also a need for studies that can look at district-specific factors for more focused interventions."
18018956,1,a,"In this paper we present a conceptual model focusing on activity performance and social participation of individuals in the period prior to their first acute episodes of psychosis. The model was developed using the constructivist grounded theory method. Data from interviews and documents was collected from 25 primary participants. Interviews were also conducted with 15 members of the participants' support networks and six experts in the field of early psychosis and rehabilitation. The model illustrates how the core constructs of activity performance and social participation are set against the natural context and influenced by shifts in three determinants: faltering personal capacities, negotiating for success and risk factors. The model suggests rehabilitation and recovery practices in early intervention work."
16481310,1,a,"Research on the social determinants of health has demonstrated robust correlations between several social factors, health status, and life expectancy. Some of these factors could be modified through policy intervention. National-level public policies explicitly based on population health research are in various stages of development in many Western countries, but in spite of evident need, seemingly not at all in the United States. Because research shows such a strong association between education and good health, we offer evidence to show that at least two pressing problems in American society, namely the uneven distribution of educational attainment and health disparities linked to socioeconomic position, may be ameliorated through policy initiatives that link quality early childhood care, child development programs, and parental training in a seamless continuum with strengthened K-12 education."
24648835,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CONFIRM THE FOLLOWING CORE HYPOTHESIS: a Community of Practice's use of a Web 2.0 platform for communication between primary and hospital care leads to improved primary care and fewer hospital referrals. This core hypothesis will be corroborated by testing a further five partial hypotheses that complete the main hypothesis being estimated. METHODS: An ad-hoc questionnaire was designed and sent to a sample group of 357 professionals from the Badalona-Sant Adria de Besos Primary Care Service in Catalonia, Spain, which includes nine primary care centres and three specialist care centres. The study sample was formed by 159 respondents. The partial least squares methodology was used to estimate the model of the causal relationship and the proposed hypotheses. RESULTS: It was found that when healthcare staff used social networks and information and communication technologies professionally, and the more contact hours they have with patients, the more a Web 2.0 platform was likely to be used for communication between primary and hospital care professionals. Such use led to improved primary care and fewer hospital referrals according to the opinions of health professionals on its use. CONCLUSIONS: The research suggests that the efficiency of medical practice is explained by the intensity of Web 2.0 platform use for communication between primary and specialist care professionals. Public policies promoting the use of information and communication technologies in communities of practice should go beyond the technological dimension and consider other professional, organisational and social determinants."
25391014,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: In the situation of rapid population ageing, it is necessary to encourage the older people to work longer. This requires a recognition of health conditions that cause the decision to continue working in retirement age. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine differences in health status and health security between working and non-working retirees involved in the program of social participation in healthcare reform. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Of 406 participants of the program of social participation in healthcare reform, 161 non-working retirees and 21 working retirees were involved to analysis. Eight indicators of health status and eight components of health security were adopted. RESULTS: Our findings showed the weak relationship between health and the working continue in retirement age. The considerable differences between the groups were reported only for physical well-being; the working retirees felt better. They continued work despite the fact that most of them perceived their health poorly and almost all suffered from chronic diseases. The working in retirement age was related with financial and social benefits to a greater extent. The working retirees rarely reported financial problems, the medical expanses was less onerous for them, they had the great opportunity to use the private physician services, and they more often perceived social support. The negative effect of working in retirement age, however, was related with the lack of time to rest, more negative assessment of existing healthcare system and less satisfaction with health information received from family doctor. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding would indicate that health status influences the work in retirement age to a limited extend. Financial motivation and social factors seems to be the main determinants of working continue. The recommendations for future more extensive research were presented in detail."
20576799,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Asian American youth are one of the fastest growing populations in the United States. This present study examined intrapersonal and interpersonal determinants of smoking status among Asian American adolescents. METHODS: Using data from the 2006 National Youth Tobacco Survey, 1,368 Asian American adolescents in Grades 6 through 12 were selected. RESULTS: Findings revealed that one eighth (12%) experimented with cigarettes, 3% smoked occasionally, and 2% smoked regularly. High school students reported higher rates for experimental, occasional, and regular smoking than middle school students. More male than female youth reported the three types of smoking status. Multivariate analyses showed that, compared with nonsmoking, age, weekly income, family members' smoking, refusal of cigarettes from best friends predicted experimental smoking; and positive images of smoking, perception of safety of smoking for only 1 year, awareness of the harmful effects of secondhand smoking, refusal to smoke, and absence from school predicted occasional smoking. Age interacted with refusal to smoke in predicting occasional smoking. Male gender, awareness of the harmful effects of secondhand smoking, refusal to smoke, absence from school, and receptivity to tobacco marketing were determinants of regular smoking. DISCUSSION: This study uniquely examined how the impacts of multiple intrapersonal and interpersonal predictors differed by various stages of smoking in a nationally representative sample of Asian American adolescents. Our findings underscore that smoking treatment and prevention programs should consider predictors of risk for different stages of adolescent smoking."
15797980,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic illness with an unpredictable and variable course, profoundly affects the quality of life (QOL). General health questionnaires are used to assess QOL in SLE, but a disease-specific instrument could offer enhanced responsiveness and content validity. We detail the steps we took to develop and validate a new SLE-specific QOL instrument, SLEQOL. METHODS: Rheumatology professionals nominated items that they felt were important determinants of QOL of SLE patients. One hundred SLE patients were asked to assess the importance and frequency of occurrence of these items and to suggest those that had not been listed. Item reduction was performed using Rasch model and factor analyses to create a new questionnaire in English. This final questionnaire was administered to a cohort of 275 patients to study its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Fifty-one items covering a wide range of QOL concerns were identified. The patients' responses led to the elimination of 11. The new questionnaire of 40 items was found to have Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 and to consist of eight domains covering physical, mental and social QOL issues. It has good test-retest reliability, poor to fair cross-sectional correlation with the SF-36, with poor correlation with lupus activity or damage indices. The SLEQOL was more responsive to change than the SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new 40-item SLEQOL in English and showed that it is valid for use in SLE patients in Singapore. It offers better content validity and responsiveness to change than the SF-36."
28445214,0,a,"Medical schools are increasingly called to include social responsibility in their mandates. As such, they are focusing their attention on the social determinants of health (SDOH) as key drivers in the health of the patients and communities they serve. However, underlying this emphasis on the SDOH is the assumption that teaching medical students about the SDOH will lead future physicians to take action to help achieve health equity. There is little evidence to support this belief. In many ways, the current approach to the SDOH within medical education positions them as ""facts to be known"" rather than as ""conditions to be challenged and changed."" Educators talk about poverty but not oppression, race but not racism, sex but not sexism, and homosexuality but not homophobia. The current approach to the SDOH may constrain or even incapacitate the ability of medical education to achieve the very goals it lauds, and in fact perpetuate inequity. In this article, the authors explore how ""critical consciousness"" and a recentering of the SDOH around justice and inequity can be used to deepen collective understanding of power, privilege, and the inequities embedded in social relationships in order to foster an active commitment to social justice among medical trainees. Rather than calling for minor curricular modifications, the authors argue that major structural and cultural transformations within medical education need to occur to make educational institutions truly socially responsible."
16234425,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Recent research has corroborated the notion that seasonality in suicide is more heterogeneous and less consistent than postulated by former scholars. This work investigates the smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland between the late 19th and the end of the 20th century. It includes analyses by region and by suicide method. METHODS: Monthly suicide frequencies in Switzerland are available for the period 1876-2000. Data on canton/region are available for the periods 1901-1920 and 1969-2000, and data on suicide method for the periods 1881-1920 and 1969-2000. Analyses focusing on the overall change rely on data aggregated by quinquennia. The Edwards' test and the peak-low ratio were used in univariate analyses of seasonality. Putative determinants of the peak-low ratio were examined using regression analysis with cantonal data. RESULTS: The decrease of seasonal effects in suicide applies to a period of more than 100 years in Switzerland. Big differences of seasonal effects have existed all the time with regard to specific methods and to specific regions. No seasonality was apparent in poisoning, and in Geneva and Basle City, respectively. However, the seasonal effects have been most impressive in drowning and hanging suicides, and in rural Catholic regions. In regression analysis, the decline in suicide seasonality is associated with the decline in the agricultural work force. CONCLUSIONS: The smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland has been a continuous long term process, which probably started by the end of 19th century. Seasonal effects in suicide will probably fade away in most regions of Switzerland and in most suicide methods. This process is in parallel with the disappearance of the traditional rural society."
31565728,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite an increasing, yet still limited amount of research on social determinants of oral health, the influences of neighborhood characteristics remain understudied, especially within the context of immigration. Acculturation is multidimensional, and its influences on the oral health of immigrants vary across age and ethnic groups. This study investigated the relationship between neighborhood cohesion and oral health problems among older Chinese American immigrants, and whether and to what extent acculturation indicators moderate the relationship between such cohesion and oral health. METHODS: The research design and working sample included 3,157 older Chinese American immigrants aged 60 years or older from the baseline of the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago. Neighborhood cohesion was measured by a six-item scale. Oral health problems were measured by the presence or absence of such problems. Acculturation included residence in ethnic enclaves, length of stay, and behavioral acculturation. Stepwise logistic regression models with interaction terms (Neighborhood cohesion x Acculturation) were conducted to examine the association between neighborhood cohesion and oral health problems, accounting for sociodemographics, health conditions, and health behaviors. RESULTS: Individuals experiencing higher levels of neighborhood cohesion reported a lower likelihood of having oral health problems. The protective effect of neighborhood cohesion against having oral health problems was stronger when individuals resided in ethnic enclaves such as Chinatown. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: To promote optimal oral health, interventions need to account for individuals' perceptions and levels of integration into their neighborhoods and communities."
31692975,0,a,"We study the impact of the Zimbabwe Harmonized Social Cash Transfer (HSCT) on household food security after 12 months of implementation. We investigate determinants of food security as measured by a well-known food security scale - the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) - and as measured by value of household food consumption composed of own-production, market purchases and gifts received. We find that several dimensions of household vulnerability correlate more strongly with the food security measure than with food consumption. Labor constraints, which is a key vulnerability criterion used by the HSCT to target households, is an important predictor of the food security score but not food consumption, and its effect on food security is even larger during the lean season. Impact analysis shows that the program has had statistically significant impacts on Food Security and Diet Diversity scores but null to low impacts on food consumption. However aggregate food consumption hides dynamic activity taking place within the household where the cash is used to obtain more food from the market and rely less on food received as gifts. The cash in turn gives beneficiaries greater choice in their food basket, which improves diet diversity."
30519533,0,a,"The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has defined outdoor air pollution and PM as the human carcinogen (Group 1), which mainly cause an increased risk of lung cancer. Scientists have considered epigenetic modifications as a possible mechanism to deal with adverse effects of air pollution. This study aimed to compare the effect of airborne PM10 (PM with aerodynamic diameter </=10 mum) on in vitro global methylation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PM10 was sampled in metropolitan Tehran, the capital of Iran. PBMCs were extracted from whole blood of healthy males and treated with PM10 suspension at concentrations of 50-300 mug/mL for 4 h. Untreated cells were used as the negative control. Genomic DNA was extracted from each sample using the DNA blood mini kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. Moreover, 5-methylsytosine (%5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (%5-hmC) were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. %5-mC and %5-hmC in each sample was compared with negative control and reported as difference %5-mC and %5-hmC."
30611219,0,a,"BACKGROUND: HIV testing and counselling (HTC) is an essential component for HIV prevention and a critical entry point into the HIV continuum of care and treatment. Despite the importance of HTC for HIV control, access to HTC services among female sex workers (FSWs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains suboptimal and little is known about factors influencing FSWs' access to HTC. Guided by the client-centred conceptual framework, we conducted a systematic review to understand the facilitators and barriers influencing FSWs in SSA to access HTC services. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, POPLINE and Web of Science databases for literature published between January 2000 and July 2017. References of relevant articles were also searched. We included primary studies of any design, conducted in SSA and published in the English language. Studies conducted in multi-sites inclusive of SSA were included only if data from sites in SSA were separately analysed and reported. Similarly, studies that included other subpopulations were only eligible if a separate analysis was done for FSWs. This review excluded papers published as systematic reviews, editorial comments and mathematical modelling. The protocol for this review is registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration number CRD42017062203. RESULTS: This review shows that factors related to approachability, acceptability, availability, affordability and appropriateness of the services are crucial in influencing access to HTC services among FSWs in SSA. These factors were mediated by individual attributes such as HIV risk perceptions, awareness of the availability of HTC, and perceptions of the importance and quality of HTC services. The decision to utilise HTC was predominantly hampered by discriminatory social norms such as HIV stigma and criminalisation of sex work. CONCLUSIONS: FSWs' access to HTC is facilitated by multiple factors, including individual awareness of the availability of HTC services, and perceived quality of HTC especially with regard to assured confidentiality. Concerns about HIV stigma and fear about discrimination due to community intolerance of sex work acted as major barriers for FSWs to seek HTC services from the facilities offering health services to the general population."
28286813,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: In addition to the annual mortality rate, unintentional home injury may result in temporary or permanent disability and requires medical attention and continuous care in millions of children. This study aimed to explore features and risk factors of these injuries. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, demographic variables and epidemiologic pattern of home injuries among children under 5 years of age were collected via a population-based survey in seven main cities of Khuzestan province, southwest Iran, during September 2011 to December 2012. Developing a risk stratification model, independent risk factors of unintentional home injury were determined and put to multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULT: 2693 children with the mean age of 27.36 +/- 15.55 months (1 to 60) were evaluated (50.9% boy). 827 (30.7%) cases had a history of at least one home injury occurrence since birth to study time. The most common injury mechanisms were burning with 291 (38.4%) cases, falling with 214 (28.3%) and poisoning with 66 (8.7%) cases, respectively. The independent risk factors of unintentional home injury were age >/= 24 month (p<0.001), residency in Ahvaz city (p<0.001), mother's illiteracy (p<0.014), ethnicity (p<0.001), private housing (p=0.01), birth weight (p<0.001), and being the first child (p=0. 01). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve of the model designed by multivariate analysis were 53.5%, 84.8%, and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.73- 0.77; P < 0.001, figure 1), respectively. CONCLUSION: According to the findings of this study, 30.7% of the studied children were injured at least once since birth. Burning, falling, poisoning, swallowing objects, choking, and biting were the main home injury mechanisms. Age >/= 24 months, being the first child, living in a private house, being a resident of Ahvaz city, and having an illiterate mother were found to be risk factors of home injury."
26060778,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, natural disasters and the accompanying health risks have become more frequent, and rehabilitation work has become an important part of government performance. On one hand, social networks play an important role in participants' therapeutic community participation and physical & mental recovery. On the other hand, therapeutic communities with widespread participation can also contribute to community recovery after disaster. METHODS: This paper described a field study in an earthquake-stricken area of Ya'an. A set of 3-stage follow-up data was obtained concerning with the villagers' participation in therapeutic community, social network status, demographic background, and other factors. The Hierarchical linear Model (HLM) method was used to investigate the determinants of social network on therapeutic community participation. RESULTS: First, social networks have significantly impacts on the annual changes of therapeutic community participation. Second, there were obvious differences in education between groups mobilized by the self-organization and local government. However, they all exerted the mobilization force through the acquaintance networks. Third, local cadre networks of villagers could negatively influence the activities of self-organized therapeutic community, while with positively influence in government-organized therapeutic activities. CONCLUSION: This paper suggests that relevant government departments need to focus more on the reconstruction and cultivation of villagers' social network and social capital in the process of post-disaster recovery. These findings contribute to better understandings of how social networks influence therapeutic community participation, and what role local government can play in post-disaster recovery and public health improvement after natural disasters."
29659598,0,a,"Individuals with low levels of education systematically have worse health than those with medium or high levels of education. Yet there are few examples of attempts to summarize the evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions targeting health-related behavior among individuals with low education levels, and a large part of the literature is descriptive rather than analytical. A rapid review was carried out to examine the impact of such interventions. Special attention was given to the relative impact of the interventions among individuals with low education levels and their potential to reduce health inequality. Of 1,365 articles initially identified, only 31 were deemed relevant for the review, and of those, nine met the inclusion and quality criteria. The comparability of included studies was limited due to differences in study design, sample characteristics, and definitions of exposure and outcome variables. Therefore, instead of performing a formal meta-analysis, an overall assessment of the available evidence was made and summarized into some general conclusions. We found no support for the notion that the methods used to reduce smoking decrease inequalities in health between educational groups. Evidence was also limited for decreasing inequality through interventions regarding dietary intake, physical activity and mental health. Only one study was found using an intervention designed to decrease socioeconomic inequalities by increasing the use of breast cancer screening. Thus, we concluded that there is a lack of support regarding this type of intervention as well. Therefore, the main conclusion is that solid evidence is lacking for interventions aimed at individual determinants of health and that more research is needed to fill this gap in knowledge."
29258514,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Social prescribing is targeted at isolated and lonely patients. Practitioners and patients jointly develop bespoke well-being plans to promote social integration and or social reactivation. Our aim was to investigate: whether a social prescribing service could be implemented in a general practice (GP) setting and to evaluate its effect on well-being and primary care resource use. METHODS: We used a mixed method evaluation approach using patient surveys with matched control groups and a qualitative interview study. The study was conducted in a mixed socio-economic, multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with socially isolated patients who frequently visited their GP. The intervention was implemented by 'social prescribing coordinators'. Outcomes of interest were psychological and social well-being and health care resource use. RESULTS: At 8 months follow-up there were no differences between patients referred to social prescribing and the controls for general health, depression, anxiety and 'positive and active engagement in life'. Social prescribing patients had high GP consultation rates, which fell in the year following referral. The qualitative study indicated that most patients had a positive experience with social prescribing but the service was not utilised to its full extent. CONCLUSION: Changes in general health and well-being following referral were very limited and comprehensive implementation was difficult to optimise. Although GP consultation rates fell, these may have reflected regression to the mean rather than changes related to the intervention. Whether social prescribing can contribute to the health of a nation for social and psychological wellbeing is still to be determined."
31285976,0,a,"Although acute care facilities have not typically focused on resolving the psychosocial determinants of health, new models are emerging. This article provides details of the Ke Ku'una Na'au (KKN) Native Hawaiian Behavioral Health Initiative implemented in 2016 at The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawai'i. The program is focused on reducing hospital readmissions for socially and economically vulnerable Native Hawaiian adults and improving their health care outcomes after hospitalization. The program was piloted on 2 medical units to assist patients who identified as Native Hawaiian, were ages 18 and older, and living with chronic diseases, psychosocial needs, and/or behavioral health problems. The program model was developed using a team of Native Hawaiian community health workers referred to as navigators, who were supported by an advanced practice nurse and a project coordinator/social worker. Navigators met patients during their inpatient stay and then followed patients post discharge to support them across any array of interpersonal needs for at least 30 days post-discharge. Goals were to assist patients with attending a post-hospital follow-up appointment, facilitate implementation of the discharge plan, and address social determinants of health that were impacting access to care. In 2017, 338 patients received care from the KKN program, a number that has grown since that time. In 2015, the baseline readmission rate for Native Hawaiians on the 2 medical units was 16.6% (for 440 Native Hawaiian patients in total). In 2017, the readmission rate for Native Hawaiians patients on the two medical units was 12.6% (for 445 Native Hawaiian patients, inclusive of KKN patients) (P=.092). This decrease suggests that the KKN program has been successful at reducing readmissions for vulnerable patients and, thus, improving care for Native Hawaiians in the health system generally. The KKN program has offered relevant, culturally sensitive care meeting a complex, personalized array of needs for over 338 patients and has shown demonstrated success in its outcomes. This information will be useful to other acute care organizations considering similar programs."
16679219,1,a,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: To determine the influence of the family risk factors (parental weight, socioeconomic status and cultural level) on the distribution of overweight or obesity in prepubertal children and the dynamics of their weight gain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred forty-one children (183 boys) attending the second grade of primary school (age 7.4+/-0.5 years) were enrolled in a longitudinal study in Southern Italy. Overweight and obesity status were defined by a body mass index (BMI) above the percentile having respectively the value of 25 and 30 kg/m(2) at 18 years, according to national reference data; overweight extent was expressed as BMI standard deviation score (BMI-SDS). Information about BMI and socioeconomic conditions (occupation and educational level) of parents were collected. Distribution of overweight and obese schoolchildren and variations of BMI-SDS were evaluated over a 3-year period; relationships with family risk factors were also sought. The distribution of overweight/obese children at baseline was high (40%). Tracking rates of overweight and obesity were 73% and 80%, respectively. The higher the BMI-SDS at 7 years, the higher the BMI-SDS at 10 years (r 0.86, P=0.0001). The highest BMI value and the highest distribution of overweight/obese children were observed in subjects with the highest amount of family risk factors. Children exhibiting accelerated weight gain (delta BM I>1/year) showed higher male/female ratio, higher baseline BMI values, higher maternal BMI values, lower maternal educational level and a dramatic increase in the percentage of overweight/obese children than children with normal weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Children who are overweight/obese at 7 years tend to maintain this condition during prepubertal age. Paediatricians should be alerted when dealing with a child showing a BMI increase above than 1U/year during primary school. Targeted intervention should be directed at young children with overweight parents and low socio-cultural level."
30946983,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A tremendous number of girls in Yemen are still subjected to female genital cutting (FGC), which carries an increased risk of health complications and violates children's rights. This study describes the prevalence of FGC in four Yemeni provinces and investigates the determinants of FGC. METHODS: We analyzed data from women aged 15 to 49 years who responded to a sub-national household survey conducted in six rural districts of four Yemeni provinces in 2008-2009. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between individual and household socioeconomic factors and FGC practices and attitudes. RESULTS: The prevalence of women's FGC was 48% while daughters' FGC was 34%. Almost 45.8% of the women surveyed believe the FGC practice should discontinue. Higher odds of FGC practice and positive attitude towards it were associated with older age, family marriage, and lower tertiles of wealth and education indices. Early marriage was also associated with increased odds of FGC practice (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic indices and other individual factors associated with FGC are differing and complex. Younger generations of women are more likely to not have FGC and to express negative attitudes towards the tradition. Appropriate strategies to invest in girls' education and women's empowerment with effective engagement of religious and community leaders might support the change of attitudes and practice of FGC in the younger generation."
10951443,1,a,"We have examined fatigue in myasthenia gravis (MG) by administering a measure of cognitive and physical fatigue to patients and control subjects before and after administration of a lengthy cognitive battery. Subjects also completed a scale that assessed the impact of fatigue on physical, social, and cognitive function. Results of the study revealed that MG patients experience significantly more cognitive and physical fatigue than do control subjects, and the patients' perceptions of both cognitive and physical fatigue increased significantly following completion of demanding cognitive work. Control subjects reported no significant change in fatigue. Furthermore, MG patients reported that fatigue produced mild to moderate effects on cognitive and social function and moderate effects on physical function. Results from this study indicate that cognitive fatigue is an important symptom of MG and that fatigue produces pervasive impairments in important aspects of patients' lives. Additional studies are needed to understand the neurobehavioral determinants of cognitive fatigue in this population."
16492623,1,a,"AIMS: The aim of the present study is to identify self-rated health predictors of return to work (RTW) within the study population as a whole as well as in three subgroups, namely musculoskeletal complaints, other physical health complaints, and psychological complaints. METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 862 employees on sickness absence (maximum duration of 12 weeks). The employees filled out a baseline questionnaire and were subsequently followed until the tenth month after listing sick. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify determinants of RTW. RESULTS: For the study population as a whole type of complaint, earlier sickness absence, subjective severity of complaints and several RAND-36 subscales were predictive of RTW. Furthermore, the RAND-36 subscales physical functioning, physical role limitations, mental health, and health change were predictive of RTW among employees with musculoskeletal complaints. For employees with other physical health problems subjective severity of complaints and the RAND-36 subscales physical and social functioning, general health perception, and health change were associated with RTW. Finally, with regard to the group with psychological complaints the RAND-36 subscales mental health and general health perception predicted RTW. CONCLUSION: Several aspects of self-rated health predict RTW for employees on long-term sickness absence. Variables related to functional status predict RTW for employees with physical complaints in contrast to psychological problems."
18201794,1,a,"In recent years, interest on researching on antenatal care issues and other health promotion and prevention interventions has increased. However, even though there is a growing interest in publishing about antenatal care use, evidence concerning which, and how socioeconomic conditions influence whether a pregnant woman demands or not antenatal consultations on the assumption that the theoretical access to this service has not entry barriers, is still limited. In order to generate this evidence, a two-stage analysis was performed with data gathered on the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) carried out by Profamilia in Colombia during 2005. The first stage was run as a logistic regression model showing the marginal effects on the probability of attending the first visit and an ordinary least squares model was performed for the second stage accounting for the absences to antenatal consultations once at least one visit was carried out. It was found that mothers living in the Pacific Ocean region as well as young mothers seem to have a lower probability of attending the first visit but these factors are not related to the number of absences to antenatal consultation once the first visit has been achieved. The effect of health insurance was surprising because of the differing effects that the health insurers showed. Some familiar and personal conditions such as willingness to have the last children and number of previous children, demonstrated to be important in the determination of demand. The effect of mother's educational attainment was proved as important whereas the father's educational achievement was not. This paper provides some elements for policy making in order to increase the demand inducement of antenatal care, as well as stimulating research on demand for specific issues on health."
17446148,1,a,"Sub-Saharan Africa has one of the highest levels of teenage pregnancies in the world. In spite of that, there is paucity of empirical research on causes of teenage pregnancies in African countries. This paper investigates the determinants of teenage pregnancies based on a case study of Busia District in Kenya. The data are from a household survey conducted in 1998/1999. Empirical results indicate that girls' education level has significant influence on the probability of teenage birth, with non-schooling adolescents and those with primary school level education being more vulnerable. Among the variables used as proxies for access to sex education, availability of church forums that educate adolescents about sex and family life issues reduce probability of teenage pregnancy. Age is positively related to teenage pregnancies, with older adolescents being more predisposed to pregnancies. Though use of contraceptives is found to have a positive effect, only a small proportion of adolescents were using modern contraceptives and, supply side factors such as quality and availability were not accounted for. Other key factors as outlined by the adolescents themselves include peer pressure and social environment-related factors like inappropriate forms of recreation, which act as rendezvous for pre-marital sex, as well as lack of parental guidance and counselling. Overall, lack of access to education opportunities, sex education and information regarding contraceptives, as well the widespread poverty predispose girls to teenage pregnancies. The problem of teenage pregnancies should be viewed within the broader socio-economic and socio-cultural environment in which the adolescents operate. For instance, lack of parental guidance on issues of sexuality and sex education was reinforced by cultural taboos that inhibit such discussions. Adolescents should be equipped with the relevant knowledge to enable them make informed choices regarding sexual relationships. This should be complemented with broader programmes aimed at promoting girl education and poverty alleviation."
26453175,0,a,"Sedentary behaviour (SB) has emerged as a potential risk factor for metabolic health in youth. Knowledge on the determinants of SB in youth is necessary to inform future intervention development to reduce SB. A systematic review was conducted to identify predictors and determinants of SB in youth. Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched, limiting to articles in English, published between January 2000 and May 2014. The search strategy was based on four key elements and their synonyms: (a) sedentary behaviour, (b) determinants, (c) types of sedentary behaviours, (d) types of determinants. The full protocol is available from PROSPERO (PROSPERO 2014:CRD42014009823). Cross-sectional studies were excluded. The analysis was guided by the socio-ecological model. 37 studies were selected out of 2654 identified papers from the systematic literature search. Most studies were conducted in Europe (n = 13), USA (n = 11), and Australia (n = 10). The study quality, using the Qualsyst tool, was high with a median of 82% (IQR: 74-91%). Multiple potential determinants were studied in only one or two studies. Determinants were found at the individual, interpersonal, environmental and policy level but few studies examined a comprehensive set of factors at different levels of influences. Evidence was found for age being positively associated with total SB, and weight status and baseline assessment of screen time being positively associated with screen time (at follow-up). A higher playground density and a higher availability of play and sports equipment at school were consistently related to an increased total SB, although these consistent findings come from single studies. Evidence was also reported for the presence of safe places to cross roads and lengthening morning and lunch breaks being associated with less total SB. Future interventions to decrease SB levels should especially target children with overweight or obesity and should start at a young age. However, since the relationship of many determinants with SB remains inconsistent, there is still a need for more longitudinal research on determinants of SB in youth."
10883746,1,a,"The aim of the present survey was to compare the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of asthma in boys and girls aged 6-7 and 13-14 years in a rural and an urban area in the West Bank. For this purpose, the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was issued to 970 schoolchildren in the two regions. The response rate was 92.2%. The prevalences of ever wheezing in the urban and rural areas were 16.4% and 12.0%, respectively (p < 0.05); the 12-month prevalences of wheezing were 10.5% and 5.5%, respectively (p < 0.05); the prevalences of more severe wheeze were 4.5% and 1.7%, respectively (p < 0.05); and prevalences of diagnosed asthma were 4.2% and 2.8%, respectively (p = NS). When controlling for age by stratification, the significant association between prevalence rates and place of residence persisted in the 13-14-year age group. These results also show that the prevalence of asthma among Palestinian children is moderately high in comparison with that reported from developing countries, but lower than those reported from Western countries. This survey, the first epidemiological survey on asthma in the West Bank, demonstrates a marked difference between urban and rural areas. The findings emphasize the need for further study of the environmental determinants of the disease among Palestinian children."
19346046,1,a,"Several significant developmental and socialisation processes in the life of children and adolescents take place in the area where they live. The extent to which they can feel and be safe in this environment is an important component of the success of those processes. This study highlights the independent contribution of neighbourhood and individual-level demographic and socioeconomic attributes to child and adolescent injuries. All individuals between the ages of 7 and 16 years living in Stockholm County in January 1998 (n=184 545) were followed up for their injuries during a five-year period considering injuries sustained as a pedestrian/cyclist/motor-vehicle rider and intentional injuries (violence-related and self-inflicted). A series of two-level logistic regressions were conducted to examine the association between the occurrence of injuries and individual (compositional) characteristics nested into parish of residence as well as contextual characteristics. For children and adolescents living in Stockholm County, contextual socioeconomic and social attributes of their place of residence were significant for injuries sustained as motor-vehicle riders but not for those sustained as pedestrians/cyclists or those inflicted intentionally. In the latter case, only the highest concentration of social benefit recipients was associated with significantly higher odds ratios. This emphasises that each injury mechanism has its own socioeconomic and social pathway, where contextual and compositional factors come into play to varying degrees."
11071843,1,a,"BACKGROUND: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine: (a) the effect of two physical activity modes on changes in subjective well-being (SWB) over the course of a 12-month period in older, formerly sedentary adults (N = 174, M age = 65.5 years) and (b) the role played by physical activity participation and social support in changes in SWB over time. METHOD: Participants were randomized into either an aerobic activity group or a stretching and toning group. Structural equation modeling was employed to conduct multiple sample latent growth curve analyses of individual growth in measures of SWB (happiness, satisfaction with life, and loneliness) over time. RESULTS: A curvilinear growth pattern was revealed with well-being significantly improving over the course of the intervention followed by significant declines at the 6-month follow-up. Subsequent structural analyses were conducted showing that frequency of exercise participation was a significant predictor of improvement in satisfaction with life, whereas social relations were related to increases in satisfaction with life and reductions in loneliness. Improvements in social relations and exercise frequency also helped to buffer the declines in satisfaction with life at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that social relations integral to the exercise environment are significant determinants of subjective well-being in older adults. Findings are discussed in terms of how physical activity environments might be structured to maximize improvements in more global well-being constructs such as satisfaction with life."
18922241,1,a,"INTRODUCTION: Anhedonia is defined as the loss of the capacity to feel pleasure and there is no consensus with its relationship with depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, no study has investigated the problematic of anhedonia in the context of HIV-infection, which concern a lot of patients with depressive symptoms. Depressive symptomatology presents a major challenge in the management of HIV-infection due to its central role in clinical progression. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to disentangle relationship between determinants of anhedonia, depression and anxiety in order to optimise mental management of HIV infection. METHOD: In 2003, a face-to-face survey (ANRS-EN12-VESPA) was conducted among patients selected in a random stratified sample of 102 French hospital departments delivering HIV care. Eligible respondents were HIV-infected outpatients, aged 18 or older living in France and diagnosed for at least six months. Among solicited patients, 2932 agreed to participate (response rate: 59%) and data about anhedonia, anxiety and depression are available for 1427 patients. The face-to-face gathered information on sociodemographic characteristics, such as education level, gender, partner, children, financial situation or housing and also psychosocial and sociobehavioural characteristics, such as drug use. Self-reported side effects of treatment were also available. ASSESSMENT TOOLS: Anxiety and depression were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale. Physical anhedonia was assessed using the French version of the Chapman scale. Three regression models were used to identify factors associated with anhedonia, anxiety and depression among demographic, psychosocial and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Factors independently associated with anhedonia were older age (>50), lower education level, unemployment and men HIV contaminated by heterosexual relation or injecting drug use. Women, with lower education level, unemployment, without steady partner, with a detectable viral load and who reported side effect of HAART presented more frequently anxiety. Unemployment, uncomfortable housing, no social support from friends, self-reported side effect and lipodystrophy were independently associated with depression. CONCLUSION: Our results underline the multiplicity of factors associated with mental disorders related to depression. These results can be explained by the fact that the anxiety and anhedonia are two cardinal symptoms of depression. Determinants of anhedonia and anxiety reported in this study may provide the key to a more exact delineation of depressive disorders in the context of HIV infection in order to optimize long-term psychological follow up of concerned patients."
28837566,0,a,"The use of the Internet and social applications has many benefits for the elderly, but numerous investigations have shown that the elderly do not perceive online social networks as a friendly social environment. Therefore, TreeIt, a social application specifically designed for the elderly, was developed for this study. In the TreeIt application, seven mechanisms promoting social interaction were designed to allow older adults to use social networking sites (SNSs) to increase social connection, maintain the intensity of social connections and strengthen social experience. This study's main objective was to investigate how user interface design affects older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. Fourteen user interface evaluation heuristics proposed by Zhang et al. were adopted as the criteria to assess user interface usability and further grouped into three categories: system support, user interface design and navigation. The technology acceptance model was adopted to assess older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. One hundred and one elderly persons were enrolled in this study as subjects, and the results showed that all of the hypotheses proposed in this study were valid: system support and perceived usefulness had a significant effect on behavioral intention; user interface design and perceived ease of use were positively correlated with perceived usefulness; and navigation exerted an influence on perceived ease of use. The results of this study are valuable for the future development of social applications for the elderly."
19944934,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Kalihi Valley is a densely populated, low-income community (28,958 residents in approximately 6 square miles) with insufficient sidewalks, bike lanes, and public green space to support regular physical activity for its residents. Kokua Kalihi Valley (KKV), a community health center formed in 1972, sought to improve Kalihi Valley's built environment based on its history of community- and partnership-based preventive health initiatives that have focused on the social determinants of health. INTERVENTION: Kokua Kalihi Valley used a flexible partnership model and a focus on direct community action to develop an unused 100-acre state park (the Kalihi Valley Nature Park) and establish a bicycle repair and recycling program that mobilized thousands of community volunteers, attracted widespread media coverage, and established a number of innovative programs for active living. Kokua Kalihi Valley and its partners also contributed to the successful passage of a city charter amendment to prioritize Honolulu as a bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly city. RESULTS: This initiative was successful in reclaiming a substantial amount of land for active living and in stimulating both public governmental support and widespread private community involvement in programs and activities. LESSONS LEARNED: Projects that engaged community members in activities with tangible accomplishment were shown to be most successful. CONCLUSIONS: This initiative showed that community health centers may be uniquely positioned to provide leadership and assume responsibility for cross-sectoral active-living health projects."
12707496,1,a,"The evidence-based approach has become the mantra of health care and service delivery. But just what it means, whether it is feasible, how to build it and the outcome of its use are not well understood. The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of an evidence-based approach to the prevention of oral disease, to examine the assessment of clinical trial evidence, to examine emerging approaches to assessing population-wide interventions and oral health promotion, and to illustrate some principles and issues through examples from preventive dentistry. The evidence-based approach to prevention is presented using an evidence loop, which emphasizes that the evidence-base should begin with an understanding to the burden of oral disease and its determinants, rather than a consideration of the efficacy or effectiveness of interventions in clinical dental research. A systematic review of evidence from clinical dental research is compiled and assessed, after which the intervention is decided upon and implemented. The evidence loop is completed by the monitoring of outcomes and reassessment of the intervention process. Attention is also given to steps in assessing non-randomized population-wide interventions and evidence on oral health promotion based on expert opinion. The requirement for evidence creates a substantial challenge which can only be met by increased research activity, improved quality of information and the appropriate application of the outcomes of research to policy making for the prevention of oral disease."
23903265,0,a,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE Patients with beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) experience physical, psychological and social problems that lead to decreased quality of life (QoL). The aim here was to measure health-related QoL and its determinants among patients with beta-TM, using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional study at the Hematology Research Center of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, in southern Iran. METHODS One hundred and one patients with beta-TM were randomly selected. After the participants' demographics and disease characteristics had been recorded, they were asked to fill out the SF-36 questionnaire. The correlations of clinical and demographic factors with the QoL score were evaluated. RESULTS There were 44 men and 57 women of mean age 19.52 +/- 4.3 years (range 12-38). On two scales, pain (P = 0.041) and emotional role (P = 0.009), the women showed significantly lower scores than the men. Lower income, poor compliance with iron-chelating therapy and presence of comorbidities were significantly correlated with lower SF-36 scores. These factors were also found to be determinants of worse SF-36 scores in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS We showed that the presence of disease complications, poor compliance with iron-chelating therapy and poor economic status were predictors of worse QoL among patients with beta-TM. Prevention and proper management of disease-related complications, increased knowledge among patients regarding the importance of managing comorbidities and greater compliance with iron-chelating therapy, along with psychosocial and financial support, could help these patients to cope better with this chronic disease state."
28722217,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims at testing predictions derived from temporal self-regulation theory (TST) in relation to discretionary food choices (snacks). TST combines a motivational sphere of influence (cognitions and temporal valuations resulting in intentions) with a momentary sphere (encompassing social and physical environmental cues). This dual approach differs from current health behaviour theories, but can potentially improve our understanding of the interplay of personal and environmental factors in health behaviour self-regulation. DESIGN: A mixed event-based and time-based (Ecological Momentary Assessment) study in 61 adults aged between 18 and 64, with a BMI range between 18.34 and 39.78 (M = 25.66, SD = 4.82) over two weeks. METHODS: Participants recorded their food and drink intake for two weeks in real time using electronic diaries. Participants also responded to non-consumption assessments at random intervals throughout each day. Momentary cues (individual, situational, and environmental factors) were assessed both during food logs and non-consumption assessments. Motivational factors, past behaviour, and trait self-regulation were assessed during baseline. RESULTS: Multilevel logistic regression analyses showed that across all snack types, environmental cues and negative affect were associated with an increased likelihood of snacking. Perceiving a cost of healthy eating to occur before eating was associated with an increased likelihood of snacking, whereas intentions and self-regulation were not. CONCLUSIONS: Discretionary food intake is largely guided by momentary cues, and motivational-level factors, such as intention and self-regulation, are less important in the initiation of discretionary food intake. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Overweight and obesity are a result of prolonged periods of energy imbalance between energy intake and expenditure (Hill & Peters, ). One of the key behavioural determinants of energy imbalances results from food intake, specifically from discretionary food choices (snacking). Temporal self-regulation theory (Hall & Fong, ) takes into account both deliberate and momentary influences on health behaviour, which is especially relevant to exploring the drivers of snacking. What does this study add? Offers new insight into the application of TST in explaining momentary eating behaviours. Snacking initiation is guided by momentary cues, not person-level factors. Dietary interventions should acknowledge the momentary cues that are associated with snacking."
20122256,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Neural tube defect (NTD) prevalence in northern China is among the highest worldwide. Dealing with the NTD situation is ranked as the number one task in China's scientific development plan in population and health field for the next decade. Physical and social environments account for much of the disease's occurrence. The environmental determinants and their effects on NTD vary across geographical regions, whereas factors that play a significant role in NTD occurrence may be buried by global statistics analysis to a pooled dataset over the entire study area. This study aims at identification of the local determinants of NTD across the study area and exploration of the epidemiological implications of the findings. METHODS: NTD prevalence rate is represented in terms of the random field theory, and Rushton's circle method is used to stabilize NTD rate estimation across the geographical area of interest; NTD determinants are represented by their measurable proxy variables and the geographical weighted regression (GWR) technique is used to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the NTD determinants. RESULTS: Informative maps of the NTD rates and the statistically significant proxy variables are generated and rigorously assessed in quantitative terms. CONCLUSIONS: The NTD determinants in the study area are investigated and interpreted on the basis of the maps of the proxy variables and the relationships between the proxy variables and the NTD determinants. No single determinant was found to dominate the NTD occurrence in the study area. Villages where NTD rates are significantly linked to environmental determinants are identified (some places are more closely linked to certain environmental factors than others). The results improve current understanding of NTD spread in China and provide valuable information for adequate disease intervention planning."
23500669,0,a,"Children with Asperger's syndrome show deficits in social functioning while their intellectual and language development is intact suggesting a specific dysfunction in mechanisms mediating social cognition. An action observation/execution matching system might be one such mechanism. Recent studies indeed showed that electrophysiological modulation of the ""Mu-rhythm"" in the 10-12Hz range is weaker when individuals with Asperger's syndrome observe actions performed by others compared to controls. However, electrophysiological studies typically fall short in revealing the neural generators of this activity. To fill this gap we assessed magnetoencephalographic Mu-modulations in Asperger's and typically developed children, while observing grasping movements. Mu-power increased at frontal and central sensors during movement observation. This modulation was stronger in typical than in Asperger children. Source localization revealed stronger sources in premotor cortex, the intraparietal lobule (IPL) and the mid-occipito-temporal gyrus (MOTG) and weaker sources in prefrontal cortex in typical participants compared to Asperger. Activity in premotor regions, IPL and MOTG correlated positively with social competence, whereas prefrontal Mu-sources correlated negatively with social competence. No correlation with intellectual ability was found at any of these sites. These findings localize abnormal Mu-activity in the brain of Asperger children providing evidence which associates motor-system abnormalities with social-function deficits."
25212478,0,a,"The PATHS Data Resource is a unique database comprising data that follow individuals from the prenatal period to adulthood. The PATHS Resource was developed for conducting longitudinal epidemiological research into child health and health equity.

28707639,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The desire to make meaning out of images, metaphor, and other representations indicates higher-order cognitive skills that can be difficult to teach, especially in the complex and unfamiliar environments like those encountered in many global health experiences. Because reflecting on art can help develop medical students' imaginative and interpretive skills, we used visual thinking strategies (VTS) during an immersive 4-week global health elective for medical students to help them construct new understanding of the social determinants of health in a low-resource setting. We were aware of no previous formal efforts to use art in global health training. METHODS: We assembled a group of eight medical students in front of a street mural in Kathmandu and used VTS methods to interpret the scene with respect to the social determinants of health. We recorded and transcribed the conversation and conducted a thematic analysis of student responses. RESULTS: Students shared observations about the mural in a supportive, nonjudgmental fashion. Two main themes emerged from their observations: those of human-environment interactions (specifically community dynamics, subsistence land use, resources, and health) and entrapment/control, particularly relating to expectations of, and demands on, women in traditional farming communities. They used the images as well as their experience in Nepali communities to consolidate complex community health concepts. DISCUSSION: VTS helped students articulate their deepening understanding of the social determinants of health in Nepal, suggesting that reflection on visual art can help learners apply, analyze, and evaluate complex concepts in global health. We demonstrate the relevance of drawing upon many aspects of cultural learning, regarding art as a kind of text that holds valuable information. These findings may help provide innovative opportunities for teaching and evaluating global health training in the future."
15770290,1,a,"In health care today, scientific and technological frontiers are expanding at unprecedented rates, even as economic and financial pressures shrink profit margins, intensify competition, and constrain the funds available for investment. Therefore, the world today has more economic, and social opportunities for people than 10 or 100 years since globalization has created a new ground somewhat characterized by rapid economic transformation, deregulation of national markets by new trade regimes, amazing transport, electronic communication possibilities and high turnover of foreign investment and capital flow as well as skilled labor. These trends can easily mask great inequalities in developing countries such as importation and spreading of infectious and non-communicable diseases; miniaturization of movement of medical technology; health sector trades management driven by economics without consideration to the social and health aspects and its effects, increasing health inequalities and their economic and social burden creation; multinational companies' cheap labor employment promotion in widening income differentials; and others. As a matter of fact, all these factors are major determinants of ill health. Health authorities of developing countries have to strengthen their regulatory framework in order to ensure that national health systems derive maximum benefit in terms of equity, quality and efficiency, while reducing potential social cost to a minimum generated risky side of globalization."
15155587,1,a,"In this study, determinants of tobacco use among Gambian youths were examined. A cross-sectional school-based survey was conducted among 282 students, aged 14-18. The potential determinants were derived from the core constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the ASE model. Moreover, various measures of knowledge and media influence were added to the research model. The results show that free cigarette offers by representatives of tobacco companies were mostly responsible for the difference between smokers and non-smokers. Other variables associated with smoking behavior were greater intention to smoke in the future, lower self-efficacy expectations regarding emotional situations, smoking behavior of the respondent's best friend, the mother having a job and the absence of other family members living in the house. Our study supports current efforts to prohibit tobacco advertising and promotions in The Gambia, especially the distribution of free samples. Additionally, we recommend prevention activities in schools and communities to aim at making children less vulnerable to 'sampling', increasing their self-efficacy expectations regarding emotional situations and making them aware of the influence of their best friend."
29252196,0,a,"Background Peer and parental substance use are established predictors for substance use among adolescent, little is known about influence of sibling cigarette smoking and its interaction with peer network on substance use potential that can introduce an important way for substance use prevention programs. Objective The aim of present study was to explore the association of sibling cigarette smoking and peer network with substance use potential among high school students in Tehran. Subjects Data were drawn from the population-based cross-sectional study of among 650 high schools students. Methods Multiple linear regression was used in order to determine the adjusted association between cigarette smoking among family members, peer network, their interaction and substance use potential. Result Having a sister who smokes (B = 3.19; p < 0.01) and peer network quality were associated with substance use potential (B = -0.1; p < 0.05). The increase in mean of substance use potential associated with decreases in peer network quality score is much more than in who have a sister with a cigarette smoking habit. Conclusion Having a sister who smokes interacts with peer network quality; appears to be one of the important mechanisms for adolescents' tendency to substance use. These findings can help in a better understanding of substance use potential mechanisms, screening efforts and the formulation of prevention programs."
27661619,0,a,"In the contemporary context of zoonosis emergence and spread, invasive species are a major issue since they represent potential pathogen hosts. Even though many progresses have been done to understand and predict spatial patterns of invasive species, the challenge to identify the underlying determinants of their distribution remains a central question in invasion biology. This is particularly exacerbated in the case of commensal species that strictly depend on humankind for dispersal and perennial establishment of new populations. The distribution of these species is predicted to be influenced by dispersal opportunities and conditions acting on establishment and proliferation, such as environmental characteristics, including spatio-temporal components of the human societies. We propose to contribute to the understanding of the recent spread of a major invasive rodent species, the black rat (Rattus rattus), in the changing southeastern of Senegal. We address the factors that promote the dispersal and distribution of this invasive rodent from the perspective of human geography. We first describe characteristics of human settlements in terms of social and spatial organization of human societies (i.e. economic activities, commercial and agricultural networks, roads connectivity). We then explore the relationship between these characteristics and the distribution of this invasive rodent. Finally we propose that historical and contemporary dynamics of human societies have contributed to the risk of invasion of the black rat. We argue that the diffusion processes of invasive species cannot be considered as a result of the spatial structure only (i.e. connectivity and distance), but as a part of the human territory that includes the social and spatial organization. Results suggest that the distribution of invasive rodents partly results from the contemporary and inherited human socio-spatial systems, beyond the existence of suitable ecological conditions that are classically investigated by biologists."
15330403,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Although patients with bipolar disorder have been shown to benefit from psychosocial interventions, the proportion that utilizes these interventions is unknown. We set out to clarify the determinants of psychosocial service utilization in adults with bipolar disorder. METHOD: We investigated psychosocial service utilization among the first 500 patients admitted to the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD). RESULTS: In the 3 months prior to enrollment in STEP-BD, a majority of the patients (54%) were engaged in at least one psychosocial service modality in addition to pharmacotherapy. In order of decreasing frequency, these were therapy with a psychologist, self-help group, therapy with a social worker, and therapy with another type of provider. Bipolar patients with personality disorders (80% vs 20%, p = 0.0002), alcohol/drug abuse disorders (76% vs 24%, p = 0.0022), and anxiety disorders (60% vs 40%, p = 0.0043) received more psychosocial services than those without. Poorer global functioning also increased the likelihood of receiving services, whereas being married decreased service utilization. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial service utilization by outpatients with bipolar disorder is strongly linked to greater severity/complexity of illness. Potential moderators, such as insurance status and availability of care, should be examined in future studies."
31058586,0,a,"One of the most important indicators for assessing the quality of healthcare is the evaluation of patients' rights status and the interaction between patients and the healthcare providers. The patient rights charter improves communication between patients and service providers and enhances the quality of healthcare. This is a descriptive-analytic study that was performed on 500 patients referred to 25 general hospitals supervised by Tehran University of Medical Sciences. In this study, the observance rate of the patient rights charter was considered and the patient rights charter in the samples were studied based on dependency type of hospitals. The patients' opinions showed that the observance rate of the patient rights charter in the hospitals was 60.7%. Observance rate of patients' rights charter according to the dependency type of hospitals (governmental - private - public - charity) in all clauses of the patient rights charter was statistically significant (p = 0.000). The findings of this study indicate that the majority of clauses in the patients' rights charter is observed in hospitals. In the field of observing of the patient rights charter, increasing patient's awareness about their rights is a priority. And in the next step, comprehensive and assured laws are needed to observe patients' rights in healthcare centers."

12134731,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate in a population-based sample of hypertensive men and women the impact of factors that determine frequency and pattern of antihypertensive treatment. METHODS: We used pooled data of two independent surveys conducted 1989/90 and 1994/95 in the Augsburg region among men and women aged 25 to 74 years. Co-morbidity and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed by questionnaire and examination. Multivariate and polytomous logistic regression analyses were used to assess treatment patterns adjusting for cofactors. RESULTS: Among a total of 9,795 survey participants, 2,279 men and 1,699 women were hypertensive with 30% of men and 43% of women using antihypertensive drugs. Hypercholesterolemia was unrelated and smoking even inversely related to treatment (adjusted odds ratio OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.56-0.92). Women were more likely to be treated than men (adjusted OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.34-1.82). Furthermore, women on monotherapy used diuretics significantly more often than men (adjusted OR relative to betablocker use 2.8, 95% CI: 1.6-4.8). CONCLUSIONS: We identified several determinants of drug treatment among hypertensives in the community. During the study period antihypertensive treatment seemed to be determined primarily by clinical disease but not by concomitant cardiovascular risk factor status, such as male gender, smoking, or hypercholesterolemia."
22915146,0,a,"Studies conducted in developing countries have noted associations between concurrent stunting, social-emotional problems and poor cognitive ability in young children. However, the relative contribution of these variables in Latin America is likely changing as undernutrition rates decline and prevalence of childhood obesity rises. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 106 normal-weight and 109 obese preschool children to compare the relative contribution of early nutrition, sociodemographic factors and psychosocial variables on cognitive development in normal-weight and obese preschool children in Chile. The study variables were categorized as: (1) socio-demographic (age, sex, birth order and socioeconomic) (2) early nutrition (maternal height, birth weight, birth length and height at 5 years) (3) psychosocial factors (maternal depression, social-emotional wellbeing and home space sufficiency). In order to assess determinants of cognitive development at 4-5 years we measured intelligence quotient (IQ); variability in normal children was mostly explained by socio-demographic characteristics (r(2) = 0.26), while in obese children early nutritional factors had a significant effect (r(2) = 0.12) beyond socio-demographic factors (r(2) = 0.19). Normal-weight children, who were first born, of slightly better SES and height Z score >1, had an IQ >/= 6 points greater than their counterparts (p < 0.05). Obese children who were first born with birth weight >4,000 g and low risk of socio-emotional problems had on average >/=5 IQ points greater than their peers (p < 0.05). We conclude that in Chile, a post-transitional country, IQ variability of normal children was mostly explained by socio-demographic characteristics; while in obese children, early nutrition also played a significant role."
14624964,1,a,"The purpose of this investigation was to identify determinants of alcohol consumption based on a number of demographic and psychosocial variables in a group of pregnant women at risk for alcohol consumption. Data were collected on a sample of 232 pregnant females who agreed to participant in a multistate alcohol prevention intervention. The variables of interest included demographic measures of race, age, education, marital status, health status, employment status and if they had been involved in physical abuse during the past year. Additionally, psychosocial variables were collected on social support, family functioning, mental health and illicit drug use. The dependent variables of interest were any alcohol use during the pregnancy and an abuse measure that was based on a composite score generated from questions related to problems associated with alcohol behavior. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to see if the independent variables (demographic and psychosocial variables) were predictive of any alcohol use. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to ascertain if the independent measures were predictive of alcohol abuse. The results showed that race, age, physical abuse and to a lesser extent health were associated to any alcohol use and alcohol abuse. The findings with the psychosocial variables were not as robust. Nevertheless, problematic psychiatric and drug use composite scores were associated with alcohol abuse."
15704819,1,a,"Changes in conduct problems from middle school through early adulthood were examined in a sample of 1191 African American and White males and females. Predictors were selected from a number of ecological contexts to examine the relative contribution of family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors to conduct problems during the 7th, 8th, and 11th grade and across transitions in middle school, into high school, and into young adulthood. Almost all contexts made a unique contribution to conduct problems except for the neighborhood setting. The variables that had the most regular influences during each of these periods were Family Consistent Control, Family Discipline Harshness, and Negative Peers. Positive family and positive peer variables had less consistent relations to outcomes. School variables were more influential in middle school than later. Few gender or race differences were found in the patterning of predictors across time. Studies using only one or two settings as predictors of conduct problems, may provide a misleading picture of their impact by excluding other contextual influences."
11450925,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to identify 'non-medical' datasets holding routinely collected information that might be used to measure and monitor the wider determinants of community health and well-being. METHODS: An expert panel discussion, involving public health and environmental health academics and professionals with expertise in a variety of backgrounds (including environmental health, housing, transport, community safety, public health, primary and secondary care), and interrogation of the Office for National Statistics database were carried out for the West Midlands region. The aim was to identify routinely collected 'non-medical' datasets containing information on the following factors: physical environment, crime, housing and homelessness, social services, socio-economic environment including employment, lifestyles, education, leisure and culture, transport and accidents. RESULTS: Fifty-six datasets were identified. Although 43 (77 per cent) were collected at least annually, few (17; 30 per cent) held data that were disaggregated and routinely available at the sub-local authority level. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a number of datasets that hold information relevant to health. However, no single dataset is likely to provide information on all dimensions of health and the determinants of health, and local agencies should consider carefully the strengths and weaknesses of each. Through the development of inter-sectoral working and multi-agency involvement at the local level there is now considerable scope to improve the quality of many of these datasets and to promote their use in the measurement and monitoring of community health."
25587550,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: High quality of care is one of the requirements of nursing which depends on the nursing competency. In this connection, the aim of this research was to determine the problems related to the academic training (nursing' educational program) and clinical practice to achieve competency from the viewpoint of nurses, faculty members, and nursing students. METHODS: the study was an analytical cross-sectional one. The sample consisted of the academic staff, the third and the fourth year nursing students and nurses in practice. The instrument of the study was a two-part researcher-made questionnaire with 22 questions in the theoretical- clinical realm to assess problems related to the theoretical and clinical teaching in nursing, and 23 questions to assess the clinical functions. The questionnaire was validated in terms of both face and content validity. Its reliability, using Cronbach's Alpha coefficient, was 0.72 in the theoretical-clinical and 0.73 in the clinical realm. Both descriptive and analytical statistics were used to analyze the data, using SPSS software. RESULTS: The results of this study indicated that from the participants' viewpoints, the most important problems in the academic education for nursea to acquire competency were as follows: lack of academic research the clinical period (88.9%), no application of theoretical aspects of the nursing process in practice (85.6%), insufficient knowledgeable and professional educators (81.1%), the use of traditional routine-oriented methods on the wards (75.6%); also insufficient time for performance based on knowledge in relation to the nurse's workload (86.5%), weakness and usefulness of scientific function encouragement systems in clinic (85.2%), and learnt theoretical subjects not coming into practice in clinical fields after graduation (75.6%). CONCLUSION: Efforts to reduce the gap between the theoretical and practical (clinical function) knowledge in educational and work environment are required to improve the training of qualified nurses."
30625268,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This research compared the effectiveness of play therapy provided individually or in groups for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms among children. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial that used a multi-stage random sampling method. Participants included 45 children aged 6 to 10 years old with ODD, all of whom had been referred to medical consultation centers in Ahvaz, Iran in 2012. Experimental groups consisted of 15 children receiving individual play therapy and 15 receiving group play therapy, while the control group consisted of 15 randomly selected children. Data were collected using the child behavior checklist parent report form and teacher report form, along with clinical interviews with the parents. Play therapy took place weekly for eight total sessions; individual sessions lasted 45 minutes each, while group sessions were each 60 minutes in duration. Participants were assessed in three stages, including preintervention, post-intervention, and at 2-month follow-up. PASW SPSS ver. 18.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and analysis of covariance analysis methods were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Results showed meaningful decreases in ODD symptoms in the experimental groups in comparison with the control group, based on parent reporting (P</=0.001 and F=129.40) and the teacher reports additionally showed meaningful decreases in ODD symptoms in the experimental groups compared to the control group, (P</=0.001 and F=93.14). Furthermore, the effects were maintained after 2 months. CONCLUSION: This research supports the efficacy of individual and group play therapy for the treatment of ODD in children, as well as the consistency of the effects at 2-month follow-up."
29930110,0,a,"Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology."
19635735,1,a,"Few prospective studies of smoking initiation have investigated a wide range of time-varying and invariant predictor variables at the individual and contextual levels concurrently. In this study (1999-2005), 877 Canadian students (mean age = 12.7 years) who had never smoked at baseline completed self-report questionnaires on cigarette smoking and 32 predictor variables in 20 survey cycles during secondary school. Height and weight were measured in survey cycles 1, 12, and 19. School administrators completed questionnaires on school tobacco control policies/activities, and trained observers collected data on access to tobacco products in commercial establishments near schools. Younger age, single-parent family status, smoking by parents, siblings, friends, and school staff, stress, impulsivity, lower self-esteem, feeling a need to smoke, not doing well at school, susceptibility to tobacco advertising, alcohol use, use of other tobacco products, and attending a smoking-tolerant school were independent determinants of smoking initiation. Independent determinants of daily smoking onset among initiators of nondaily smoking included smoking by siblings and friends, feeling a need to smoke, susceptibility to tobacco advertising, use of other tobacco products, and self-perceived mental and physical addiction. Adolescent tobacco control programs should address multiple individual and contextual-level risk factors. Strategies that address nicotine dependence symptoms are also needed for adolescents who have already initiated smoking."
16299386,1,a,"Myxococcus xanthus has two different mechanisms of motility, adventurous (A) motility, which permits individual cells to glide over solid surfaces, and social (S) motility, which permits groups of cells to glide. To identify the genes involved in S-gliding motility, we mutagenized a delta aglU (A-) strain with the defective transposon, magellan-4, and screened for S- mutants that form nonmotile colonies. Sequence analysis of the sites of the magellan-4 insertions in these mutants and the alignment of these sites with the M. xanthus genome sequence show that two-thirds of these insertions lie within 27 of the 37 nonessential genes known to be required for social motility, including those necessary for the biogenesis of type IV pili, exopolysaccharide, and lipopolysaccharide. The remaining insertions also identify 31 new, nonessential genes predicted to encode both structural and regulatory determinants of S motility. These include three tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, several regulators of transcription that may control the expression of genes involved in pilus extension and retraction, and additional enzymes involved in polysaccharide metabolism. Three insertions that abolish S motility lie within genes predicted to encode glycolytic enzymes, suggesting that the signal for pilus retraction may be a simple product of exopolysaccharide catabolism."
31479375,0,a,"People who are homeless use more hospital-based care than average, yet little is known about how hospital and shelter use are interrelated. We examined the timing of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations relative to entry into and exit from New York City homeless shelters, using an analysis of linked health care and shelter administrative databases. In the year before shelter entry and the year following shelter exit, 39.3 percent and 43.3 percent, respectively, of first-time adult shelter users had an ED visit or hospitalization. Hospital visits-particularly ED visits-began to increase several months before shelter entry and declined over several months after shelter exit, with spikes in ED visits and hospitalizations in the days immediately before shelter entry and following shelter exit. We recommend cross-system collaborations to better understand and address the co-occurring health and housing needs of vulnerable populations."
31223296,0,a,"This article describes a replicable model of health literacy that promotes positive youth development. Now in its fifth year of implementation and run by Advance African Development, Inc., it is an integrated year-long, in-class, student-centered, technology-driven, and service-learning youth empowerment program. Forty-minute sessions are offered once a week to create health literate K-12 public school students able to use the Internet to obtain and understand health information, and to practice informed decision-making about their health. Data collected were qualitative and included student service learning projects to solve community health issues. Community engagement exposed students to problem-solving, collaborative and transformational leadership, and advocacy skills. Prior to the program, less than half of the students had heard of MedlinePlus, and those who had heard of it rarely could describe its purpose. Approximately 500 students and 10 teachers participated, and over 40 sessions were provided from August 2015 to June 2016."
25079288,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The Health System Responsiveness Questionnaire is an instrument designed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000 to assess the experience of patients when interacting with the health care system. This investigation aimed to adapt a Mental Health System Responsiveness Questionnaire (MHSRQ) based on the WHO concept and evaluate its validity and reliability to the mental health care system in Iran. DESIGN: In accordance with the WHO health system responsiveness questionnaire and the findings of a qualitative study, a Farsi version of the MHSRQ was tailored to suit the mental health system in Iran. This version was tested in a cross-sectional study at nine public mental health clinics in Tehran. A sample of 500 mental health services patients was recruited and subsequently completed the questionnaire. Item missing rate was used to check the feasibility while the reliability of the scale was determined by assessing the Cronbach's alpha and item total correlations. The factor structure of the questionnaire was investigated by performing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). RESULTS: The results showed a satisfactory feasibility since the item missing value was lower than 5.2%. With the exception of access domain, reliability of different domains of the questionnaire was within a desirable range. The factor loading showed an acceptable unidimentionality of the scale despite the fact that three items related to access did not perform well. The CFA also indicated good fit indices for the model (CFI=0.99, GFI=0.97, IFI=0.99, AGFI=0.97). CONCLUSIONS: In general, the findings suggest that the Farsi version of the MHSRQ is a feasible, reliable, and valid measure of the mental health system responsiveness in Iran. Changes to the questions related to the access domain should be considered in order to improve the psychometric properties of the measure."
19742279,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Psychosocial symptoms are common in patients with heart failure. Little research, however, has been done to determine which psychosocial factors influence primary care patients' consultation frequency in the case of heart failure. METHODS: We recruited 310 primary care patients with heart failure by analysing electronic patient records. At baseline, psychological distress (anxiety and depression; HADS), disease coping (FKV), negative affectivity and social inhibition (DS-14), disease-specific quality of life (MLHFQ) and social support (F-SozU) were measured by validated questionnaires. Severity of heart failure (according to NYHA-classification and Goldman's Specific Activity Scale) and sociodemographic characteristics were documented by self-report instruments. Nine month later, patients were contacted by telephone in order to assess GP consultation frequency. Logistic regression was done to determine whether these psychological, medical and sociodemographic factors were associated with primary care utilisation. RESULTS: On average, patients consulted their general practitioner (GP) 8.2 times during nine months. Female subjects and patients with higher levels of perceived heart failure severity, physical problems and anxiety or depression as well as those living alone visited their GP significantly more often. In multivariate analysis, frequent attendance in general practices was predicted by physical problems and living alone. These factors explained 11.6% of the variance of frequent attendance in general practices. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial factors of help-seeking behaviour in heart failure patients focus on mental and physical discomfort and a lonely home situation. These factors might need to be compensated by GP consultation. GPs should address the rearrangement of physical, mental, and social resources to strengthen self-reliance of patients with heart failure."
19712011,1,a,"Menopause is a natural physiological event that usually begins in women between the ages of 48 and 55 years. In many cases, this event is associated with unpleasant somatic-vegetative, urogenital or psychological symptoms. To test the health and social demographic factors (especially household income level) that influence willingness to pay (WTP) for a new hormone-free treatment in women of menopausal age. 1365 women between the ages of 45 and 73 years were surveyed about their health and WTP for the new treatment. WTP was evaluated with a closed-ended binary questionnaire (four groups with different levels of co-payment between euro15 and euro60), using the contingent valuation method. The average WTP was calculated according to the area under the demand function. Factors contributing to payment readiness were examined by means of binary logistic regression. WTP was significantly affected by women's opinion of the new medication, the level of co-payment required, net household income, whether currently in treatment for menopausal symptoms, and Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) values. Compared with other factors, the level of co-payment was predicted to have a negative impact on WTP. Income level is an important factor in WTP and correlates highly with several other health-related variables (WHO-5 index, MRS value, receipt of other menopause medicines and existing co-morbidity). The average co-payment that our group of women was willing to pay was between euro17 and euro35 per month, or euro24 to euro42 for women who were currently receiving treatment for symptoms of menopause. While interpreting the results, it should be considered that the hypothetical therapy was assumed to be a new non-reimbursable alternative to conventional therapy offered under the existing statutory framework for health insurance in Germany. Despite some methodological limitations, these results are useful for examining the factors affecting WTP and incremental utilities for future medicine dealing with menopause."
29239799,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Demographic, physical and psychological associations of successful aging (SA) have been evaluated, but occupational factors have not. Nor has SA been evaluated in a specific occupational group. The aims of this study were to examine the occupational associations of SA in older physicians, and to explore the concept of occupational SA. METHODS: Physicians aged 55+ years completed self-ratings of occupational and personal SA on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS; 1 being ""least successful"" and 10 ""most successful""). Associations between occupational and personal SA (defined as 8-10 on the VAS), respectively, and demographic and practice characteristics; health; social and financial resources; cognitive, emotional and motivational resources; work centrality; and anxiety about aging were examined. RESULTS: Rates of occupational SA (69.2%; 95% CI: 66.3-72.0) were significantly higher than personal SA (63.1%; 95% CI: 60.1-66.0) in the sample of 1,048 physicians. Occupational and personal SA were strongly positively correlated (r = 0.73, N = 1,041, p < 0.001). Personal SA was predicted by demographic (older age, female, international medical graduate, urban practice), physical (better self-rated health), psychological (less depression, better cognitive, emotional and motivational resources, and greater anxiety about aging), and occupational (higher work centrality, fewer practice adaptations and not intending to retire) factors. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational factors are central to physicians' self-conceptualization of SA. That greater work centrality, fewer work adaptations and less retirement planning were associated with personal SA suggests older physicians' sense of ""success"" is intertwined with continuing practice. There is a need for educating physicians to adapt to aging and retirement."
19191176,1,a,"PURPOSE: International and national programs to control vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD) among children in developing countries are reducing the magnitude but VADD still occurs in deprived populations. The purpose of the study was to estimate the prevalence of and identify risk factors for xerophthalmia in children aged 6-71 months living in slums in Pune, India in 2003. METHODS: Children were enrolled into a cross sectional study from randomly selected Anganwadis (kindergartens) in selected slums using proportional to size sampling. Parents/caregivers were interviewed by social workers about night blindness, risk factors for VADD at individual and household levels, intake of vitamin A rich foods, and history of vitamin A supplementation. Children were examined for signs of xerophthalmia by an ophthalmologist. Risk factors for xerophthalmia were explored using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: 1,589 children were examined (response rate 80.2%) 22 of whom had xerophthalmia, prevalence 1.32% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.88%). There were no gender differences. Independent risk factors for xerophthalmia were having an illiterate mother [Odds ratio [OR]15.4 (95% CI 4.4-64.1)] and lack of a safe water supply [OR 6.11, 95% CI 2.5-5.1)]. Only 11.3 and 13.3% of children in different slums had taken vitamin A supplements. CONCLUSIONS: Xerophthalmia was at a level of public health significance in children living in slums in Pune. This study highlights the importance of female education and indicates that vitamin A supplementation and other approaches to control need to be improved in children living in deprived areas like urban slums."
31071070,0,a,"Incident human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among adolescent females and women declined during 2010-2016, with the largest decrease (21%) occurring among black women (1). However, in 2016, although black women accounted for 13% of the U.S. female population, 60% of new HIV infections among women were in black women, indicating persisting disparities (1). CDC used the population attributable proportion (PAP) disparity measure to describe the proportional decrease in HIV infection among black and white women combined that would be realized if the group with the higher rate (blacks) had the same rate as did the group with the lower rate (whites) (2). Analyses indicated that an estimated 3,900 of 4,200 (93%) incident HIV infections among black women in 2016 would not have occurred if rates were the same for black and white women. The PAP disparity measure decreased from 0.75 in 2010 to 0.70 in 2016, suggesting that if incidence rates for black women were the same as those for white women, the annual number of incident HIV infections among black and white women would have been 75% lower in 2010 and 70% lower in 2016. Continued efforts are needed to identify and address social and structural determinants associated with HIV-related disparities to eliminate these disparities and decrease HIV incidence among black women."
31309441,0,a,"Medical advancements over the past decades brought organ transplantation as a definitive therapy for different end-stage organ failure. However, non-availability of organs required for transplantation is a major challenge worldwide. We aimed to determine the knowledge and willingness to donate organs in various populations and settings in the Middle Eastern region. Literature searches were conducted on PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Google scholar electronic databases. Different combinations of search terms such as ""organ donation""; ""knowledge"", ""awareness""; ""beliefs"", ""willingness""; and ""attitude"" along with the country names were used. Additional searches using reference lists of studies and review articles were conducted. Data were extracted using standardized excel form and pilot tested. Three authors independently abstracted the data using a data collection form. Results from different studies were pooled for the analysis when appropriate. The search yielded 1806 articles; 1000 duplicates and review articles were excluded, and a further 792 articles not relevant were excluded. Finally, 14 original studies met the inclusion criteria. Total pooled sample size for assessing knowledge was 6697 and for willingness was 8714. Pooled overall knowledge regarding organ donation was 69% with a 95% CI [64.5, 73.5]. Pooled overall willingness to donate organ was 49.8% with a 95% CI [41.3, 58.4]. Knowledge about organ donation and willingness to donate organs varies in different population and settings in the Middle East. These in fact are linked to multiple social factors ultimately leads to 'consent' for donating organs by a potential donor. Family's influence; religious, traditional and spiritual beliefs; and status of ethnic, minority, and immigrant populace are the important determinants of the decision for organ donation. Understandings on social determinants in organ donation remain crucial and should be addressed while developing policies and organizational developments."
18434246,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the personal, social and cultural factors likely to explain recourse to the Internet as a preferred source of personal health information. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a population of 2923 Internet users visiting a firmly established website that offers information on personal health. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the determinants of site use. MEASUREMENT: The analysis template comprised four classes of determinants likely to explain Internet use: beliefs, intentions, user satisfaction and socio-demographic characteristics. Seven-point Likert scales were used. An analysis of the psychometric qualities of the variables provided compelling evidence of the construct's validity and reliability. A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the correspondence with the factors predicted by the theoretical model. FINDINGS: The regression analysis explained 35% of the variance in Internet use. Use was directly associated with five factors: perceived usefulness, importance given to written media in searches for health information, concern for personal health, importance given to the opinions of physicians and other health professionals, and the trust placed in the information available on the site itself. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the importance of the credibility of information on the frequency of Internet use as a preferred source of information on personal health. It also shows the potentially influential role of the Internet in the development of personal knowledge of health issues."
12090264,1,a,"AIM: To describe the oral health status and the dental service use pattern of a Turkish population in Witten, Germany, and to assess the factors affecting this use pattern. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. PARTICIPANTS: 532 Turkish people older than 12 years. METHODS: The data were obtained through a structured questionnaire and oral examination. The World Health Organisation methodology was followed in assessing the oral health status. RESULTS: Comparison of the study population with German studies showed a similar caries experience in younger groups, but in older groups a lower treatment level. The proportion of regular dental attendees indicated no difference according to age. A person was more likely to use dental services regularly if he had a better level of German language and preferred German services. Perceived oral condition, educational level and sex were also important for care pattern. Regular use of services was negatively associated with the mean number of decayed, missing and periodontally involved teeth, but positively related to the number of filled teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Since factors reflecting the level of adaptation to Germany were also important determinants of the dental utilisation pattern, efforts to improve the utilisation of services should be based on the socio-educational development of Turkish people in Germany."
17903329,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is considered a major public health issue in most developed countries nowadays. This paper provides an overview of current population data available in Spain and the approach to develop preventive strategies in the country. METHODS: Review of population data available is based on individually measured weight and height as well as determinants. On this basis, the approach used in the country to develop preventive strategies is discussed. RESULTS: According to the DORICA study, the prevalence of obesity (BMI >or=30 kg m-2) is 15.5% in Spanish adults aged 25-60 years (13.2% in men and 17.5% in women). Obesity rates are higher among women aged 45 years and older, low social class, living in semi-urban places. Population estimates for the prevalence of obesity in Spanish children and young people based on the enKid study are 13.9% for the whole group. In this study, overweight and obesity is related to absence of breastfeeding, low consumption of fruit and vegetables, high consumption of cakes, buns, softdrinks and butchery products, low physical activity levels and a positive association with time spent watching TV. In 2005, the Spanish Ministry of Health jointly with the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition launched the multifaceted NAOS strategy for nutrition, physical activity and the prevention of obesity. The important role of the family and the school setting as well as the responsibility of the Health Administration and Pediatric Care in the prevention of obesity is highlighted in the document. The need for environmental actions is recognised. The PERSEO programme, a multicomponent school-based intervention project is part of the strategy currently in place. CONCLUSION: Obesity is a public health issue in Spain. A national multifaceted strategy was launched to counteract the problem. Environmental and policy actions are a priority. Young children and their families are among the main target groups."
15353189,1,a,"The role of lifestyle in mediating the relationship between socio-economic characteristics and health has been discussed extensively in the epidemiological and economic literatures. Previous analyses have not considered a formal framework incorporating unobservable heterogeneity. In this paper, we develop a simple economic model in which health is determined (partially) by lifestyle, which depends on preferences, budget and time constraints and unobservable characteristics. We estimate a recursive empirical specification consisting of a health production function and reduced forms for the lifestyle equations using Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL) for a multivariate probit (MVP) model with discrete indicators of lifestyle choices and self-assessed health (SAH) on British panel data from the 1984 and 1991 Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS). We find that sleeping well, exercising, and not smoking in 1984 have dramatic positive effects on the probability of reporting excellent or good SAH in 1991, and that these effects are much larger having accounted for endogeneity. The failure of epidemiological analyses to account for unobserved heterogeneity can explain their low estimates of the relevance of lifestyle in the socio-economic status-health relationship. Indicators for prudent alcohol consumption and eating breakfast in 1984 are not found to be statistically significant determinants of SAH in 1991."
17522961,1,a,"The pattern of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has changed significantly with the emerging predominance of elderly patients. Age is no longer seen as a contraindication to dialysis. Based on 2004 data, in the USA, patients aged 45-64 years old comprise the largest portion of the incident population, while patients aged 75 and older have the highest incident rates of ESRD. Mortality is higher among the elderly dialysis patients for whom cardiovascular diseases and infections are the most common causes of death. The quality of life (QoL) of these patients has been found to vary in different investigations, dependent on such factors as the investigator(s), the composition of the study group and the criteria used, among others; however, age was always found one of the major determinants of their QoL. Quality-of-life data suggest that older dialysis patients have similar levels of social functioning and mental health as younger dialysis patients but that their level of physical functioning is poorer. As such, the survival and QoL of elderly patients depends mainly on the severity of the comorbid conditions. The rationing of dialysis on the basis of age alone is not justified as dialysis can provide elderly patients with the means to gain the health status that permits them to enjoy life, but in their own way."
28355636,0,a,"Background: It has been suggested that cross-national variation in educational inequalities in health outcomes (e.g. NCDs) is due to cross-national variation in risky health behaviour. In this paper we aim to use highly recent data (2014) to examine educational inequalities in risky health behaviour in 21 European countries from all regions of the continent to map cross-national variation in the extent to which educational level is associated with risky health behaviour. We focus on four dimensions of risky health behaviour: smoking, alcohol use, lack of physical activity and lack of fruit and vegetable consumption. Methods: We make use of recent data from the 7th wave of the European Social Survey (2014), which contains a special rotating module on the social determinants of health. We performed logistic regression analyses to examine the associations between educational level and the risky health behaviour indicators. Educational level was measured through a three-category version of the harmonized International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Results: Our findings show substantial and mostly significant inequalities in risky health behaviour between educational groups in most of the 21 European countries examined in this paper. The risk of being a daily smoker is higher as respondents' level of education is lower (Low education (L): OR = 4.24 (95% CI: 3.83-4.68); Middle education (M): OR = 2.91 (95% CI: 2.65-3.19)). Respondents have a lower risk of consuming alcohol frequently if they have a low level of education (L: OR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.54-0.64); M: OR = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.65-0.76)), but a higher risk of binge drinking frequently (L: OR = 1.29 (95% CI: 1.16-1.44); M: OR = 1.15 (95% CI: 1.04-1.27)). People are more likely to be physically active at least 3 days in the past week when they have a higher level of education (M: OR = 1.42 (95% CI: 1.34-1.50); H: OR = 1.67 (95% CI: 1.55-1.80)). Finally, people are more likely to consume fruit and vegetables at least daily if they have a higher level of education (fruit: M: OR = 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03-1.16); H: OR = 1.77 (95% CI: 1.63-1.92); vegetables: M: OR = 1.34 (95% CI: 1.26-1.42); H: OR = 2.35 (95% CI: 2.16-2.55)). However, we also found considerable cross-national variation in the associations between education and risky health behaviour. Conclusions: Our results yield a complex picture: the lowest educational groups are more likely to smoke and less likely to engage in physical activity and to eat fruit and vegetables, but the highest educational groups are at greater risk of frequent alcohol consumption. Additionally, inequalities in risky health behaviour do not appear to be systematically weakest in the South or strongest in the North and West of Europe."
30654680,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Mental health can help explain how social inequalities impact on health. Many current public health challenges are shaped by social, economic and environmental conditions that take a mental toll on society. PURPOSE: This article describes a conceptual framework illustrating the psychosocial pathways that link the wider conditions to health behaviours and outcomes. It draws out implications of this framework for mental health practice that aim to support policy and decision-making on future action to reduce health inequalities and presents practical examples of what can be done. METHODS: This article expands on a report commissioned by Public Health England. A narrative review and synthesis of relevant evidence built on existing research by the Institute of Health Equity. A conceptual framework was developed and a consultation exercise with stakeholders helped to revise and illustrate it with practice examples. CONCLUSIONS: The field of mental health has much to contribute to prevention, not just of mental illness but also of physical health conditions and reduction of inequalities in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy, especially through collaborative public health action."
28558671,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Unintended pregnancies are a global public health concern and contribute significantly to adverse maternal and neonatal health, social and economic outcomes and increase the risks of maternal deaths and neonatal mortality. In countries like Pakistan where data for the unintended pregnancies is scarce, studies are required to estimate its accurate prevalence and predictors using more specific tools such as the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancies (LMUP). METHODS: We conducted a hospital based cross sectional survey in two tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan. We used a pre tested structured questionnaire to collect the data on socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive history, awareness and past experience with contraceptives and unintended pregnancies using six item the LMUP. We used Univariate and multivariate analysis to explore the association between unintended pregnancies and predictor variables and presented the association as adjusted odds ratios. We also evaluated the psychometric properties of the Urdu version of the LMUP. RESULTS: Amongst 3010 pregnant women, 1150 (38.2%) pregnancies were reported as unintended. In the multivariate analysis age < 20 years (AOR 3.5 1.1-6.5), being illiterate (AOR 1.9 1.1-3.4), living in a rural setting (1.7 1.2-2.3), having a pregnancy interval of = < 12 months (AOR 1.7 1.4-2.2), having a parity of >2 (AOR 1.4 1.2-1.8), having no knowledge about contraceptive methods (AOR 3.0 1.7-5.4) and never use of contraceptive methods (AOR 2.3 1.4-5.1) remained significantly associated with unintended pregnancy. The Urdu version of the LMUP scale was found to be acceptable, valid and reliable with the Cronbach's alpha of 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: This study explores a high prevalence of unintended pregnancies and important factors especially those related to family planning. Integrated national family program that provides contraceptive services especially the modern methods to women during pre-conception and post-partum would be beneficial in averting unintended pregnancies and their related adverse outcomes in Pakistan."
30763391,0,a,"Human toxoplasmosis, a protozoonosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii, has been described as a worldwide foodborne disease with important public health impact. Despite infection has reportedly varied due to differences in alimentary, cultural and hygienic habits and geographic region, social vulnerability influence on toxoplasmosis distribution remains to be fully established. Accordingly, the present study has aimed to assess T. gondii seroprevalence and factors associated to social vulnerability for infection in households of Ivaipora, southern Brazil, with 33.6% population making half minimum wage or less, ranked 1,055th in population (31,816 habitants), 1,406th in per capita income (U$ 211.80 per month) and 1,021st in HDI (0.764) out of 5,570 Brazilian cities. Serum samples and epidemiological questionnaires were obtained from citizen volunteers with official City Secretary of Health assistance in 2015 and 2016. In overall, serosurvey has revealed 526/715 (73.57%) positive samples for anti-T. gondii antibodies by Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test. Logistic regression has shown a significant increase associated to adults (p = 0.021) and elderly (p = 0.014) people, illiterates (p = 0.025), unemployment (p <0.001) and lack of household water tank (p = 0.039). On the other hand, sex (male or female), living area (urban or rural), yard hygiene, meat ingestion, sand or land contact, owning pets (dog, cat or both) were not significant variables of positivity for anti-T. gondii antibodies in the surveyed population. Although no significant spatial cluster was found, high intensity areas of seropositive individuals were located in the Kernel map where the suburban neighborhoods are located. In conclusion, socioeconomic vulnerability determinants may be associated to Toxoplasma gondii exposure. The increased risk due to illiteracy, adult or elderly age, unemployment and lack of household water tank were confirmed by multivariate analysis and the influence of low family income for seropositivity by the spatial analysis."
19241490,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the 5-year trajectory of physical activity among women with breast cancer, and to evaluate biopsychosocial variables (health status, physical symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQL), depressive symptoms, and social support), measured soon after breast cancer diagnosis, as predictors of the 5-year trajectory. METHODS: Women diagnosed with Stage II or III regional breast cancer (n=227), surgically treated and awaiting the start of adjuvant therapy completed baseline assessments of medical, psychological, and behavioral functioning. Follow-up evaluations were conducted every 4 months during the first year and every 6 months during the subsequent 4 years (12 assessments total during the 5-year study). Mixed-effects modeling was utilized to estimate the baseline level of physical activity as well as rate of change over time. Measures of physical health status, HRQL, depressive symptoms, and social support were included as predictors of the physical activity trajectory. RESULTS: A curvilinear pattern of change in physical activity was evident over the 5-year follow-up (p=0.002). Physical activity increased gradually during the first 18 months, then declined steadily over the subsequent 42 months. Poor physical health, depressive symptoms, and lower emotional HRQL were associated with less physical activity. Higher family support was associated with a slower decline in physical activity in the latter 42 months of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional HRQL following diagnosis with breast cancer appears to be important for sustaining physical activity in the first 1-2 years following diagnosis. Physical activity interventions among breast cancer survivors should address depressive symptoms early in the course of treatment."
12511400,1,a,"A joint urban planning and public health perspective is articulated here for use, in health impact assessment. Absent a blueprint for a coherent and supportive structure on which to test our thinking, we are bound to fall flat. Such a perspective is made necessary by the sheer number of people living in cities throughout the world, the need for explicit attention to land use and transportation systems as determinants of population health, and the dearth of useful indicators of the built environment for monitoring progress. If explicit attention is not paid to the overarching goals of equality and democracy, they have little if any chance of being realized in projects, programs, and policies that shape the built environment and therefore the public's health."
26388976,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Many nurses have reported experiencing high levels of occupational stress in their work environment. Stress, as an outcome of stressful workplaces and tasks, affects nursing behavior in hospital wards. The objectives of this research were to determine the prevalence of occupational stress and mental health problems in nurses in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Shahid Mohammadi Hospital in Bandar Abbas in 2013 and to determine the relationship between occupational stress and mental health. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2013 on all of the nurses working in ICU at Shahid Mohammadi Hospital located in Bandar Abbas, Iran. Seventy-two nurses were selected as the population for this study, and all of them were female. Two questionnaires were used in this study, i.e., General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) for assessing mental health and an occupational stress test for assessing job stress. Furthermore, the relationship between occupational stress and mental health was examined. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), independent samples t-test, and Pearson's product-moment correlation test were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: High and moderate levels of occupational stress were experienced by 83.9% and 10.7% of ICU nurses, respectively. The prevalence of mental disorders, somatic symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction, and depression were 58.9, 60.7, 62.5, 71.4, and 10.7%, respectively. The findings of the independent samples t-test showed that somatic symptoms had significant relationships with age and working experience (p = 0.01). According to the independent samples t-test, there were no significant differences between somatic symptoms and working different shifts (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of occupational stress among ICU nurses. There was a significant relationship between occupational stress and mental health. Future interventions are needed to codify a comprehensive health program in this field to reduce occupational stress and enhance nurses' levels of mental health."
30730217,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: We carried out a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the effect of centchroman on mastalgia as well as any side effects. METHODS: The databases of the Cochrane Library, Medline (PubMed), Embase, ProQuest and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched. The quality of randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised clinical trials. The quality of non-randomised clinical trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomised studies of interventions (ROBINS-I). Owing to different outcomes reporting, a meta-analysis of the results was not possible. RESULTS: Thirteen papers were included in the study. Of these, 12 showed a significant effect of centchroman in reducing breast pain at 3 months. One study that compared the effect of centchroman with that of tamoxifen reported a significant reduction in breast pain in both groups at 3 months; the difference between the two groups was not significant. Six studies showed the effectiveness of centchroman at 6 months. None of the papers reported any serious side effects of centchroman. CONCLUSIONS: Since a meta-analysis could not be conducted and the quality of the papers was low, there was insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of centchroman on mastalgia. It is therefore recommended to conduct well-designed RCTs to compare the effect of centchroman on mastalgia with that of a placebo or other medication."
11202034,1,a,"The end of the last millennium witnessed an unprecedented degree of public awareness regarding mental disorder as well as motivation for policy change. Like Sartorius, we contend that the continued stigmatization of mental illness may well be the central issue facing the field, as nearly all attendant issues (e.g., standards of care, funding for basic and applied research efforts) emanate from professional, societal, and personal attitudes towards persons with aberrant behavior. We discuss empirical and narrative evidence for stigmatization as well as historical trends regarding conceptualizations of mental illness, including the field's increasing focus on genetic and neurobiological causes and determinants of mental disorder. We next define stigma explicitly, noting both the multiple levels (community, societal, familial, individual) through which stigma operates to dehumanize and delegitimize individuals with mental disorders and the impact of stigma across development. Key developmental psychopathology principles are salient in this regard. We express concern over the recent oversimplification of mental illness as ""brain disorder,"" supporting instead transactional models which account for the dynamic interplay of genes, neurobiology, environment, and self across development and which are consistent with both compassion and societal responsibility. Finally, we consider educational and policy-related initiatives regarding the destigmatization of mental disorder. We conclude that attitudes and policy regarding mental disorder reflect, in microcosmic form, two crucial issues for the next century and millennium: (a) tolerance for diversity (vs. pressure for conformity) and (b) intentional direction of our species' evolution, given fast-breaking genetic advances."
26401957,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Child abuse or maltreatment is a significant global public health problem of unknown global prevalence. About 40 million children aged 0-14 years require health and social care globally. The prevalence, determinants, and trends of national or global rates of child abuse and maltreatment are largely unknown. METHODS: Data for this retrospective cross-sectional study were derived from the 2005 Egyptian Demographic and Health Survey (2005 EDHS), and included 19474 women aged 15-49 years. Multivariate logistic regression analyses by stepwise regression, backward method were used to determine the independent contribution of the possible social determinants of child abuse, with the direction and magnitude of associations expressed as odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confident interval levels (95% CI). RESULTS: Identified determinants of child abuse included exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), justifying wife beating, exposure to generational IPV, and such factors as younger age of the women, male sex, partners' lower education, poverty, residence in urban areas, younger children, and residence in households with 3-5 children. CONCLUSIONS: Experience of IPV, mothers' justification of wife beating, and generational IPV were associated with elevated odds of child abuse. Findings indicate possible high levels of unmet child protection needs, and stress the need for professionals working with children to employ culturally-sensitive methods in investigating social determinants of child abuse."
22666725,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Studies on quality of life (QoL) on youths are limited and have not examined determinants of QoL for this cohort. AIMS: The current study seeks to examine the QoL of Jamaican youths and to build a model that identifies factors that explain QoL. MATERIALS AND METHOD: During the period June to August 2006, the Centre of Leadership and Governance, Department of Government, at the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus, conducted a stratified random probability survey of 1,338 respondents. Data were collected using a 166-item questionnaire. Of the sampled population (N=1,338), the proportion of those respondents age 18 to 25 years was 27% (N=364) and this constitutes the sample for the current study. The data were stored and retrieved in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 12). Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data, and logistic regression was used to establish the model. RESULTS: The quality of life of Jamaican youths was determined by 4 factors which explain 20% of the variability in quality of life. The parents' economic wellbeing has the most influence on the quality of life of Jamaican youths (OR=1.348; 95% CI: 1.35, 3.04), followed by moderate religiosity (OR=3.594; 95% CI: 1.47, 8.82), the extent of the welfarism of the state (OR=5.273; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.69) and gender (OR = 1.329, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.69). CONCLUSION: The current work has offered us an understanding of the determinants of QoL of youths and how interventions can be planned for in the future."
17682571,1,a,"This study was carried out to determine the association between body mass index and age related cataract among patients attending eye clinic. We conducted a case control study. The outcome of clinical eye assessment determined the patient's status. Mean body mass index among the cases was shown to be higher (25.4 +/- 4.5) than the control group (24.4 +/- 3.9) (p < 0.01). Crude analysis showed that only obese respondents were 2.4 times more likely to develop age related cataract, however this association was not seen in the multivariate analysis after adjusting for other determinants (aOR 1.81; 95% CI 0.91 - 3.62). We conclude that there is no association between body mass index and age related cataract."
22014976,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Behavioural factors and beliefs are important determinants of the adoption of sports injury interventions. This study aimed to understand behavioural factors associated with junior community netball players' intentions to learn correct landing technique during coach-led training sessions, proposed as a means of reducing their risk of lower limb injury. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: 287 female players from 58 junior netball teams in the 2007/2008-summer competition completed a 13-item questionnaire developed from the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). This assessed players' attitudes (four items), subjective norms (four), perceived behavioural control (four) and intentions (one) around the safety behaviour of learning correct landing technique at netball training. All items were rated on a seven-point bipolar scale. Cluster-adjusted logistic regression was used to assess which TPB constructs were most associated with strong intentions. RESULTS: Players had positive intentions and attitudes towards learning safe landing technique and perceived positive social pressure from significant others. They also perceived themselves to have considerable control over engaging (or not) in this behaviour. Players' attitudes (p<0.001) and subjective norms (p<0.001), but not perceived behavioural control (p=0.49), were associated with strong intentions to learn correct landing technique at training. CONCLUSIONS: Injury prevention implementation strategies aimed at maximising junior players' participation in correct landing training programs should emphasise the benefits of learning correct landing technique (i.e. change attitudes) and involve significant others and role models whom junior players admire (i.e. capitalise on social norms) in the promotion of such programs."
24820057,0,a,"AIM: This study aimed to explore the early clinical experience of medical students following the adaptation of an Early Patient Contact curriculum from a European culture in Ireland to an Arab culture in Bahrain. METHODS: Medical students in Bahrain took part in an Early Patient Contact module modelled on a similar module from a partner medical school in Ireland. We used a qualitative approach employing thematic analysis of 54 student reflective logbooks. Particular attention was placed on reflections of cultural influences of experience in the course. RESULTS: Medical students undergoing this module received reported documented benefits of early clinical experience. However, students in Bahrain were exposed to cultural norms of the local Arab society including gender values, visiting the homes of strangers, language barriers and generous hospitality that led to additional challenges and learning for the medical students in acculturating to norms of the medical profession. CONCLUSION: Modules intended for curriculum adaptation between two cultures would be best served by a group of ""core"" learning outcomes with ""secondary"" outcomes culturally appropriate to each site. Within the context of the Arab culture, early clinical experience has the added benefit of allowing students to learn about both local and professional cultural norms, thereby facilitating integration of these two cultures."
16900044,1,a,"This study investigates the determinants within socio-demography, health behaviour, employer characteristics, and psychosocial and physical work environment for return to work. In 2000, a total of 5357 employees were interviewed regarding age, gender, family status, education, health behaviour, employer characteristics and work environment. They were followed in a national register for 18 months in order to identify subjects with 2 weeks or more of sickness absence. They were followed for an additional 12 months in order to establish associations between baseline measurements and time to first return to work. A total of 930 (17.4%) employees experienced sickness absence in the 18 months after baseline. During the 12-month follow-up, 856 (92.0%) returned to work, the mean absence period being 6.6 weeks. Prolonged time to first return to work was associated with female gender, increased age, no post-school education, being employed by a public employer, working at a workplace with 20 or more employees, high emotional demands in work, high job insecurity and sedentary work. There were no associations between health behaviour variables and return to work. The study indicates a potential for promoting return to work through interventions targeting emotional job demands, job insecurity and decreasing the risks associated with sedentary work."
18194525,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Considering the high costs of sick leave and the consequences of sick leave for employees, an early return-to-work of employees with mental disorders is very important. Therefore, a workplace intervention is developed based on a successful return-to-work intervention for employees with low back pain. The objective of this paper is to present the design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the workplace intervention compared with usual care for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. METHODS: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with a follow-up of one year. Employees eligible for this study are on sick leave for 2 to 8 weeks with common mental disorders. The workplace intervention will be compared with usual care. The workplace intervention is a stepwise approach that aims to reach consensus about a return-to-work plan by active participation and strong commitment of both the sick-listed employee and the supervisor. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome of this study is lasting return-to-work, which will be acquired from continuous registration systems of the companies after the follow-up. Secondary outcomes are total number of days of sick leave during the follow-up, severity of common mental disorders, coping style, job content, and attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy determinants. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from the societal perspective. A process evaluation will also be conducted. DISCUSSION: Return-to-work is difficult to discuss in the workplace for sick-listed employees with mental disorders and their supervisors. Therefore, this intervention offers a unique opportunity for the sick-listed employee and the supervisor to discuss barriers for return-to-work. Results of this study will possibly contribute to improvement of disability management for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. Results will become available in 2009. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN92307123."
16138493,1,a,"The collapse of the Soviet Union was a massive natural experiment that has provided many insights that help our understanding of the determinants of population health. This paper identifies a series of lessons learnt from this experience: (1) Rapid transition can damage health. (2) When undertaking comparative research, it is essential to have a common understanding of what different terms mean in different places. (3) When looking at exposures and outcomes, it is important to appreciate that the delay between exposure to a risk factor and the appearance of disease can range from almost none to several decades. (4) Contrary to the views of some commentators, modern healthcare has made a substantial contribution to the health of populations in industrialised countries. (5) Science can flourish only where it is free from ideology. (6) Public health and basic science achieve most when they work together. (7) Without functioning democracy, the outlook for better health is poor."
22538178,0,a,"Adolescence is a life phase in which the opportunities for health are great and future patterns of adult health are established. Health in adolescence is the result of interactions between prenatal and early childhood development and the specific biological and social-role changes that accompany puberty, shaped by social determinants and risk and protective factors that affect the uptake of health-related behaviours. The shape of adolescence is rapidly changing-the age of onset of puberty is decreasing and the age at which mature social roles are achieved is rising. New understandings of the diverse and dynamic effects on adolescent health include insights into the effects of puberty and brain development, together with social media. A focus on adolescence is central to the success of many public health agendas, including the Millennium Development Goals aiming to reduce child and maternal mortality and HIV/AIDS, and the more recent emphases on mental health, injuries, and non-communicable diseases. Greater attention to adolescence is needed within each of these public health domains if global health targets are to be met. Strategies that place the adolescent years centre stage-rather than focusing only on specific health agendas-provide important opportunities to improve health, both in adolescence and later in life."
20446184,0,a,"Group disparities in health have been documented for several decades. Despite recent efforts to eliminate them, group differences persist and challenge the ability of scientists to address them using traditional research paradigms. Because the determinants of disparities occur at multiple levels, from the molecular to the societal, and interact with one another in ways not yet fully understood, they represent a challenge to researchers attempting to capture their complexity. After reviewing existing models of disciplinary collaboration, we outline the challenges of a transdisciplinary approach and its ability to afford the holistic view of disparities needed to develop effective interventions."
18341123,1,a,"Renewed international interest in the structural determinants of health manifests itself in a focus on the social determinants of health and the public policy antecedents that shape their quality. This increased international interest in public policy in support of the structural determinants of health has had little traction in the United States. This should be surprising since the United States presents one of the worst population health profiles and public policy environments in support of health among wealthy developed nations. The U.S. position as a health status and policy outlier results from long-term institutional changes that are shaped by political, economic, and social forces. U.S. public health researchers' and workers' neglect of these structural and public policy issues conforms to the dominant ideological discourses that serve to justify these changes. The author presents some means by which public health researchers and workers can challenge these dominant discourses."
29432789,0,a,"Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption are key determinants of morbidity and mortality. These health behaviours often begin at a young age and track into adulthood, emphasising a need for interventions in children and young people. Previous research has demonstrated the potential effectiveness of behavioural incentive (BI) interventions in adults. However, little is known about their effectiveness in children and adolescents. Eight bibliographic databases were searched. Eligibility criteria included controlled trials using behavioural incentives (rewards provided contingent on successful performance of the target behaviour) as an intervention component for health behaviour change in children and adolescents. Intervention effects (standardised mean differences or odds ratios) were calculated and pooled by health behaviour, using a random effects model. Twenty-two studies were included (of n=8392 identified), 19 of which were eligible for meta-analysis: physical activity (n=8); healthier eating (n=3); and smoking (n=8). There was strong evidence that behavioural incentives may encourage healthier eating behaviours, some evidence that behavioural incentives were effective for encouraging physical activity behaviour, and limited evidence to support the use of behavioural incentives for smoking cessation and prevention in adolescents. Findings suggest that behavioural incentives may encourage uptake and initiation of healthy eating and physical activity in young people. However, this is a limited evidence base and a wide range of incentive designs have yet to be explored. Future research should further investigate the acceptability of these intervention approaches for young people."
15702749,1,a,"The purpose of this article is to explain how globalization has evolved, in order to provide a context for assessing the health care restructuring that is occurring worldwide. The authors begin by defining globalization and introducing a framework for considering pathways that can affect social organization and health. They then draw attention to current trends, such as the GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services), that promise to open health services provision to increased pressures of globalization."
16211164,1,a,"Oral health is an important element of general health and well-being. Although largely preventable, many people across the world still suffer unnecessarily from the pain and discomfort associated with oral diseases. In addition, the costs of dental treatment are high, both to the individual and to society. Effective evidence-based preventive approaches are needed to address this major public health problem. The aim of this paper is to outline public health strategies to promote oral health and reduce inequalities. An extensive collection of public health policy documents produced by WHO are reviewed to guide the development of oral health strategies. In addition a range of Cochrane and other systematic reviews assessing the evidence base for oral health interventions are summarized. Public health strategies should tackle the underlying social determinants of oral health through the adoption of a common risk approach. Isolated interventions which merely focus on changing oral health behaviours will not achieve sustainable improvements in oral health. Radical public health action on the conditions which determine unhealthy behaviours across the population is needed rather than relying solely on the high-risk approach. Based upon the Ottawa Charter, a range of complementary strategies can be implemented in partnership with relevant local, national and international agencies. At the core of this public health approach is the need to empower local communities to become actively involved in efforts to promote their oral health."
29749300,0,a,"How might the science of men's health progress if research on marginalized or subordinated men is moved from the margins of the literature to the center? This commentary seeks to answer this question, suggesting that if more attention is paid to men of color and other marginalized men, the field will be greatly enriched in its ability to understand determinants of men's health. Reimagining men's health by moving men's health disparities to a primary focus of the field may yield critical new insights that would be essential to moving men's health to the center of health equity research. Focusing on the dual goals of improving the health of marginalized men and examining the determinants of disparities among men and between men and women will yield insights into mechanisms, pathways, and strategies to improve men's health and address health disparities. Current definitions of health disparities limit the nation's ability to dedicate resources to populations that need attention-men of color and other marginalized men-that do not fit these definitions. Moving marginalized men to the center of research in men's health will foster new ways of understanding determinants of men's health that cannot be identified without focusing on populations of men whose health is as influenced by race, ethnicity, and other structures of marginalization as it is by gender and masculinities. Using Black men as a case example, the article illustrates how studying marginalized men can refine the study of men's health and health equity."
20535030,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the determinants and correlates of coping styles in the chronic phase following acquired brain injury. DESIGN: Chart review. SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation center. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty-six persons with an acquired brain injury who were more than 6 months postinjury. MEASURES: Utrecht Coping List, Symptom Checklist 90, Stroop Color Word Test, and the 15-Word Learning Test. RESULTS: Neuropsychological performance did not influence the use of coping styles. Persons with higher levels of educational attainment most often reported active problem-focused coping styles. Persons with a long time period since injury most often used passive reactions. More use of passive coping styles and less seeking of social support contributed significantly to higher levels of subjective complaints. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive functions do not influence coping style. Passive emotion-focused coping styles in the chronic phase after injury are maladaptive. These findings emphasize the importance of training of adaptive coping styles as rehabilitation targets in the chronic phase, especially for persons with lower educational attainment."
31137811,0,a,"The aims of the study were: (1) compare sociodemographic characteristics among active tuberculosis (TB) cases and their household contacts in cold and hot spot transmission areas, and (2) quantify the influence of locality, genotype and potential determinants on the rates of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among household contacts of index TB cases. Parallel case-contact studies were conducted in two geographic areas classified as ""cold"" and ""hot"" spots based on TB notification and spatial clustering between January and June 2018 in Guangxi, China, using data from field contact investigations, whole genome sequencing, tuberculin skin tests (TSTs), and chest radiographs. Beijing family strains accounted for 64.6% of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains transmitted in hot spots, and 50.7% in cold spots (p-value = 0.02). The positive TST rate in hot spot areas was significantly higher than that observed in cold spot areas (p-value < 0.01). Living in hot spots (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.75, 95%, confidence interval (CI): 1.22, 2.50), Beijing family genotype (aOR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.81), living in the same room with an index case (aOR = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.5, 3.49), travelling time from home to a medical facility (aOR = 4.78, 95% CI: 2.96, 7.72), history of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination (aOR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.13 3.62), and delay in diagnosis (aOR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.13, 5.80) were significantly associated with positive TST results among household contacts of TB cases. The findings of this study confirmed the strong transmissibility of the Beijing genotype family strains and this genotype's important role in household transmission. We found that an extended traveling time from home to the medical facility was an important socioeconomic factor for Mtb transmission in the family. It is still necessary to improve the medical facility infrastructure and management, especially in areas with a high TB prevalence."
23833635,0,a,"Trends and determinants of marriage payments have rarely been examined at the population level despite their plausible implications for the welfare of family and the distribution of wealth across families and generations. In this study, we analyze population-based data from the Vietnam Study of Family Change to document prevalence and directions of marriage payments in Vietnam from 1963 to 2000. We investigate the extent to which structural and policy transformations (particularly market reform and the socialist policy that banned brideprice) influenced the practice of marriage payments as well as estimate how societal changes indirectly impacted payments via their effects on population characteristics. Results indicate that marriage payments surged following market reform but also reveal more nuanced trends and regional differences during earlier years. While the socialist attempts to eradicate brideprice appear to have been moderately successful in the North prior to economic renovation the evidence suggests they were largely unsuccessful in the South. Results suggest that structural and policy change explained most of the observed variations in marriage payments and that changing characteristics of the individuals who married mattered relatively little. We interpret the reemergence of marriage payments as attesting to resilience of traditional values and the unraveling of the socialist agenda, especially in the North, but also as a reflection of economic prosperity associated with market reform."
21042702,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships between perceived limitations in walking-related daily activities, walking ability (capacity), and the amount of daily walking (performance) in persons affected by leprosy and to identify their determinants. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: Thirty-nine persons affected by leprosy. METHODS: Perceived limitations were assessed with the World Health Organization Disability Schedule II, domain ""getting around"". Walking capacity was assessed as covered distance in 6 min. Walking performance was recorded as mean strides/day with the Stepwatch(TM) 3 Activity Monitor. Potential determinants were sensory function, foot deformities, joint mobility, ankle muscle strength and co-morbidity. RESULTS: Perceived limitations in walking-related activities were significantly correlated with walking capacity (r = -0.47; p < 0.01) but not with walking performance, although walking capacity significantly correlated with walking performance (r = 0.38; p < 0.05). Various foot impairments independently contributed to reduced walking capacity and, to a lower degree, to perceived limitations in activities and performance. CONCLUSION: People affected by leprosy perceive limitations in walking-related activities that are determined by a reduced walking ability and the severity of foot impairments. Since perceived limitations in walking-related activities were not related to walking performance, perceived limitations are apparently weighted against the individual's needs."
28114853,0,a,"Household environmental health hazards or simply household health hazards (HHH) are pathogens and chemicals in the household that can cause health problems. In this study, we assess their effect on under-five mortality (U5MR) in 12 sub-Saharan African countries, using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys. Referring to the principal component analysis approach, we measure the HHH by the following indicators: source of water and its location, type of toilet facility, flooring material, type of wall, type of roof and type of cooking fuel. In an unadjusted multilevel discrete-time hazard model, we find that HHH affect positively child mortality in 9 of the 12 countries, whereas this effect presented itself only in 4 countries when controlling for other covariates. However, using a model with interaction between the child's age and HHH, we find it interesting that increasing levels of the HHH are consistently associated with increasing risk of death during 24-59 months after birth in eight countries. Future researches are needed to decipher the mechanisms behind these findings, whether explained by the accumulation of hazardous environment in early childhood, or frequent contact with noxious environments at a later stage of childhood, or both."
12772438,1,a,"AIM: To present currently available evidence on the role that adverse psychosocial factors play in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The specific objectives of the review were to (1) provide a picture of what is known about the relationship between psychosocial factors and hypertension, (2) summarize the major methodological and conceptual pitfalls, and (3) identify gaps in the literature and suggest areas for future research. DATA SYNTHESIS: The scope of the literature review was adults and the literature published since 1990 (acknowledging that some articles published earlier would need to be taken into account). A number of journal searches were carried out. They included Medline, PsychInfo, and SocioFile, with keywords, such as hypertension, blood pressure, psychosocial, psychological, social, acculturation, occupation, socio-economic status, social class, education, depression, anger, and anxiety. The search included articles related to hypertension in developed countries and was limited to studies in the English language. CONCLUSION: A growing body of evidence supports the thesis that psychosocial factors play a role in the pathogenesis for hypertension."
12899910,1,a,"This paper represents an investigation into the determinants of young children's quality of life (QOL) in Thailand. The empirical work is based upon a sample of 498 children (aged 5-8); 220 were urban children and 278 children of construction workers in Bangkok. Their QOL was assessed using a new self-report QOL measure for children. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the father's income and education, type of school, mode of transportation to school, and the amount of time that the child spent on extra study courses were significant explanatory variables. It was found that these factors had different influences on the QOL of urban children and those of construction workers. Extra sport-related activities and extra work (other than housework) improved the QOL of urban children, while the QOL of construction workers' children was directly linked to father's education and income. This result is consistent with income having a diminishing marginal effect on the QOL of children. There is also evidence that amongst construction workers' children, boys have a lower QOL than girls. The different causal explanations for the QOL of urban and construction workers' children suggests that it is context specific, and what impacts one group of children's QOL within a particular context may not impact another group in a different situation. This has important policy implications. Throughout the study we could find no significant impact of health on QOL-neither chronic, acute nor severe illness has any significant impact on QOL. This is consistent with the hypothesis that QOL is influenced by expectations (Social Science and Medicine 41 (10) (1995) 1403). Findings of the effects of social and environmental factors on children's QOL are new in this field and should be further investigated."
23393307,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of an innovative curriculum, using trigger videos modeling screening for social determinants of health (SDH), on the comfort and screening practices of pediatric residents during well-child care. METHODS: A nonrandomized controlled study of an educational intervention was performed. Resident surveys assessing knowledge, comfort, and screening practices for SDH were performed pre- and post-intervention. Subsets of control and intervention residents were observed pre- and post-intervention to determine changes in SDH screening practices. RESULTS: Thirty-six residents completed the study. Intervention residents spent more time screening (P = .04), and inquired more frequently about family supports (P = .046) and housing conditions (P = .045). Intervention residents were less likely to note lack of knowledge and discomfort as barriers to screening. CONCLUSIONS: A curriculum incorporating trigger videos modeling SDH screening increased screening time and inquiry for a number of SDH by pediatric residents. Fewer barriers to screening were noted following the curriculum."
30383204,0,a,"Although less well-recognized than for other infectious diseases, heterogeneity is a defining feature of tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology. To advance toward TB elimination, this heterogeneity must be better understood and addressed. Drivers of heterogeneity in TB epidemiology act at the level of the infectious host, organism, susceptible host, environment, and distal determinants. These effects may be amplified by social mixing patterns, while the variable latent period between infection and disease may mask heterogeneity in transmission. Reliance on notified cases may lead to misidentification of the most affected groups, as case detection is often poorest where prevalence is highest. Assuming that average rates apply across diverse groups and ignoring the effects of cohort selection may result in misunderstanding of the epidemic and the anticipated effects of control measures. Given this substantial heterogeneity, interventions targeting high-risk groups based on location, social determinants, or comorbidities could improve efficiency, but raise ethical and equity considerations."
17307954,1,a,"Women and men are different as regards their biology, the roles and responsibilities that society assigns to them and their position in the family and community. These factors have a great influence on causes, consequences and management of diseases and ill-health and on the efficacy of health promotion policies and programmes. This is confirmed by evidence on male-female differences in cause-specific mortality and morbidity and exposure to risk factors. Health promoting interventions aimed at ensuring safe and supportive environments, healthy living conditions and lifestyles, community involvement and participation, access to essential facilities and to social and health services need to address these differences between women and men, boys and girls in an equitable manner in order to be effective. The aim of this paper is to (i) demonstrate that health promotion policies that take women's and men's differential biological and social vulnerability to health risks and the unequal power relationships between the sexes into account are more likely to be successful and effective compared to policies that are not concerned with such differences, and (ii) discuss what is required to build a multisectoral policy response to gender inequities in health through health promotion and disease prevention. The requirements discussed in the paper include i) the establishment of joint commitment for policy within society through setting objectives related to gender equality and equity in health as well as health promotion, ii) an assessment and analysis of gender inequalities affecting health and determinants of health, iii) the actions needed to tackle the main determinants of those inequalities and iv) documentation and dissemination of effective and gender sensitive policy interventions to promote health. In the discussion of these key policy elements, we use illustrative examples of good practices from different countries around the world."
12718455,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the influence of rates of general practitioner visits on rates of hospitalisations. DESIGN: Ecological cross-sectional study of factors influencing hospitalisation rates. Aggregated data on primary care centre area level. SETTING: The county of Ostergotland, Sweden, with 3 hospital districts and 41 primary health care centres, and the hospital district of Jonkoping in the county of Jonkoping, Sweden, with 11 primary health care centres. OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospitalisation rates. RESULTS: Age and rates of outpatient hospital visits were the most important factors explaining the variation in rates of hospitalisations between the primary health care centre areas. Hospital districts, socioeconomic factors and rates of GP visits also influenced the rates of hospitalisations. CONCLUSION: When evaluating the influence of primary health care on the rates of hospitalisations, both socioeconomic factors and health care structure must be taken into consideration. Doing this, the rates of GP visits correlated negatively with the rates of hospitalisations."

17761378,1,a,"Obesity in the United States has been linked to individual income and education. Less is known about its geographic distribution. The goal of this study was to determine whether obesity rates in King County, Washington State, at the ZIP code scale were associated with area-based measures of socioeconomic status and wealth. Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analyzed. At the ZIP code scale, crude obesity rates varied six-fold. In a model adjusting for covariates and spatial dependence, property values were the strongest predictor of the area-based smoothed obesity prevalence. Geocoding of health data provides new insights into the nature of social determinants of health. Disparities in obesity rates by ZIP code area were greater than disparities associated with individual income or race/ethnicity."
22511015,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHR) have the potential to improve patient care through efficient access to complete patient health information. This potential may not be reached because many of the most important determinants of health outcome are rarely included. Successful health promotion and disease prevention requires patient-reported data reflecting health behaviors and psychosocial issues. Furthermore, there is a need to harmonize this information across different EHR systems. METHODS: To fill this gap a three-phased process was used to conceptualize, identify and recommend patient-reported data elements on health behaviors and psychosocial factors for the EHR. Expert panels (n=13) identified candidate measures (phase 1) that were reviewed and rated by a wide range of health professionals (n=93) using the grid-enabled measures wiki social media platform (phase 2). Recommendations were finalized through a town hall meeting with key stakeholders including patients, providers, researchers, policy makers, and representatives from healthcare settings (phase 3). RESULTS: Nine key elements from three areas emerged as the initial critical patient-reported elements to incorporate systematically into EHR--health behaviors (eg, exercise), psychosocial issues (eg, distress), and patient-centered factors (eg, demographics). Recommendations were also made regarding the frequency of collection ranging from a single assessment (eg, demographic characteristics), to annual assessment (eg, health behaviors), or more frequent (eg, patient goals). CONCLUSIONS: There was strong stakeholder support for this initiative reflecting the perceived value of incorporating patient-reported elements into EHR. The next steps will include testing the feasibility of incorporating these elements into the EHR across diverse primary care settings."
29635799,0,a,"The World Health Organization has identified universal health coverage (UHC) as a key approach in reducing equity gaps in a country, and the social health insurance (SHI) has been recommended as an important strategy toward it. This article aims to analyze the design, expected benefits and challenges of realizing the goals of UHC through the recently launched SHI in Nepal. On top of the earlier free health-care policy and several other vertical schemes, the SHI scheme was implemented in 2016 and has reached population coverage of 5% in the implemented districts in just within a year of implementation. However, to achieve UHC in Nepal, in addition to operationalizing the scheme, several other requirements must be dealt simultaneously such as efficient health-care delivery system, adequate human resources for health, a strong information system, improved transparency and accountability, and a balanced mix of the preventive, health promotion, curative, and rehabilitative services including actions to address the social determinants of health. The article notes that strong political commitment and persistent efforts are the key lessons learnt from countries achieving progressive UHC through SHI."
27910999,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is increasing globally, supporting the need for the identification of novel biomarkers. Therefore in the present study, we have explored the association of SIL2A, SIL6R, STNFRI, STNFRII, and MMP9 in CAD patients. METHODS: Twenty one patients with angiographically defined CAD with more than 50% occlusion, at least, in one coronary artery and twenty healthy subjects (n=20) without the history of cardiovascular symptoms were enrolled. Demographic and biochemical analysis (e.g. Total Cholesterol (TC), Triglyceride (TG), and HDL-C) were measured in all the subjects. The level of cytokines receptor (SIL2A, SIL6R, SIL6R, STNFRI, STNFRII, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) were evaluated. RESULTS: Our results showed the higher level of MMP9 in patients group compared to the control subjects, while no significant differences were detected for other cytokines. In particular the level of MMP9 was significantly (P=.015) increased from 181.16 ng/mL (95%CI: 112.1-199.2) to 192.0 ng/mL (95%CI: 181.5-265.2). Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of MMP9 were 95.45% and 45%, respectively, as detected by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the significant correlation of MMP-9 with CAD with sensitivity of 95.45%, suggesting its role as a biomarker in CAD patients. Further studies in larger population - preferably multicenter setting - are warranted to explore the functional role of this marker in coronary artery disease."
31423539,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to examine the relative importance of medical and psychosocial needs of Asian breast cancer patients and their caregivers, and to identify the determinants of quality of life (QoL) at the time of diagnosis. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of the perceived needs and QoL of 99 dyads of breast cancer patients and their caregivers at diagnosis. A self-administered questionnaire was used to measure the perceived importance of medical and psychosocial support needs. Short-Form 36 health survey (SF-36) version 2 was used to measure QoL. We also collected patient and caregiver demographic profiles and disease-specific information. Descriptive analysis of perceived needs was performed. SF-36 scores for eight domains and composite scores were calculated. Bivariate analysis and linear regression were performed to identify significant independent predictors of QoL of patients and caregivers. RESULTS: The mean ages of the patients and caregivers were 56.5 years and 51.7 years, respectively. To have family around (73%), prompt information about treatment and treatment options, including side-effects (71%), and prompt treatment for side-effects (71%) were the top three needs among patients and their caregivers. Supportive nurses and prompt treatment for side-effects positively improved patients' social functioning and bodily pain scores. Stage of disease, age, education and ethnicity also influenced QoL. Only the presence of chronic disease influenced caregivers' physical functioning and role-physical scores. CONCLUSION: Patients and caregivers have similar perceptions of needs at diagnosis. A supportive healthcare team can positively influence patients' QoL, highlighting the importance of tailoring support according to needs."
31730539,0,a,"Background Anxiety is the most common psychological reaction in women during labor. Similar to numerous other surgeries, postoperative pain is also reported following cesarean section (C-section). According to the (Gate) Control Theory, there is a relationship between pain and psychological problems such as anxiety. Accordingly, the present study aimed to compare the effect of aromatherapy using lavender and Damask rose essential oils on the level of anxiety and severity of pain following C-section. Methods This triple-group randomized clinical trial was performed on 90 mothers who visited Motahari Hospital of Jahrom, Iran, for C-section in 2017. The incidence and severity of pain and anxiety were measured and recorded for all three groups prior to intervention. The intervention groups underwent aromatherapy with lavender and Damask rose essential oils. Patients were asked to inhale cotton balls, separately stained with three drops of each essential oil at a distance of 10cm for 30mins. The severity of pain and anxiety was measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) 5 min after the specified process, respectively. The control group underwent aromatherapy in a similar fashion with normal saline. Finally, data were analyzed using descriptive statistical indices and ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests in SPSS 21. Results There was no significant difference between the three groups in the mean severity of pain and anxiety before the intervention (p>0.05). The mean severity of pain and overt anxiety in the lavender and Damask rose aromatherapy groups was significantly different than the control group after the intervention (p<0.001). In addition, no significant difference was observed between the overt and overall anxiety levels of the two intervention groups after the intervention (p>0.05). Conclusions The findings suggested that inhalation aromatherapy can reduce the severity of overt anxiety and pain after C-section, with Damask rose essential oil showing a larger effect than lavender."
25412104,0,a,"With the global financial meltdown, the crisis of poverty has deepened in communities across the United States. This essay reports results from a culture-centered project on fostering spaces for listening to the voices of the poor in CrossRoads County, Indiana. It highlights the intersections of health and poverty as they emerge from the narratives of mothers utilizing the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Depression, humiliation, and inaccessibility to health care and healthy living outline the struggles of women as they negotiate their access to health. The articulations of agency are situated around competing cultural narratives that, on the one hand, draw on the threads of individual responsibility which resonate through mainstream discourses of poverty in the United States and, on the other hand, interrogate the structural erasure of the basic capacities of health."
16707074,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different classes of antipsychotic drug treatment in people with schizophrenia responding inadequately to, or having unacceptable side-effects from, their current medication. DESIGN: Two pragmatic, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were undertaken. The first RCT (band 1) compared the class of older, inexpensive conventional drugs with the class of new atypical drugs in people with schizophrenic disorders, whose current antipsychotic drug treatment was being changed either because of inadequate clinical response or owing to side-effects. The second RCT (band 2) compared the new (non-clozapine) atypical drugs with clozapine in people whose medication was being changed because of poor clinical response to two or more antipsychotic drugs. Both RCTs were four-centre trials with concealed randomisation and three follow-up assessments over 1 year, blind to treatment. SETTING: Adult mental health settings in England. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 227 participants aged 18-65 years (40% of the planned sample) were randomised to band 1 and 136 (98% of the planned sample) to band 2. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to a class of drug. The managing clinician selected the individual drug within that class, except for the clozapine arm in band 2. The new atypical drugs included risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and amisulpride. The conventional drugs included older drugs, including depot preparations. As in routine practice, clinicians and participants were aware of the identity of the prescribed drug, but clinicians were asked to keep their participating patient on the randomised medication for at least the first 12 weeks. If the medication needed to be changed, the clinician was asked to prescribe another drug within the same class, if possible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Secondary clinical outcomes included symptoms [Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)], side-effects and participant satisfaction. Economic outcomes were costs of health and social care and a utility measure. RESULTS: Recruitment to band 1 was less than anticipated (40%) and diminished over the trial. This appeared largely due to loss of perceived clinical equipoise (clinicians progressively becoming more convinced of the superiority of new atypicals). Good follow-up rates and a higher than expected correlation between QLS score at baseline and at follow-up meant that the sample as recruited had 75% power to detect a difference in QLS score of 5 points between the two treatment arms at 52 weeks. The recruitment to band 2 was approximately as planned. Follow-up assessments were completed at week 52 in 81% of band 1 and 87% of band 2 participants. Band 1 data showed that, on the QLS and symptom measures, those participants in the conventional arm tended towards greater improvements. This suggests that the failure to find the predicted advantage for new atypicals was not due to inadequate recruitment and statistical power in this sample. Participants reported no clear preference for either class of drug. There were no statistically significant differential outcomes for participants entering band 1 for reasons of treatment intolerance to those entering because of broadly defined treatment resistance. Net costs over the year varied widely, with a mean of 18,850 pounds sterling in the conventional drug group and 20,123 pounds sterling in the new atypical group, not a statistically significant difference. Of these costs, 2.1% and 3.8% were due to antipsychotic drug costs in the conventional and atypical group, respectively. There was a trend towards participants in the conventional drug group scoring more highly on the utility measure at 1 year. The results for band 2 showed an advantage for commencing clozapine in quality of life (QLS) at trend level (p = 0.08) and in symptoms (PANSS), which was statistically significant (p = 0.01), at 1 year. Clozapine showed approximately a 5-point advantage on PANSS total score and a trend towards having fewer total extrapyramidal side-effects. Participants reported at 12 weeks that their mental health was significantly better with clozapine than with new atypicals (p < 0.05). Net costs of care varied widely, but were higher than in band 1, with a mean of 33,800 pounds sterling in the clozapine group and 28,400 pounds sterling in the new atypical group. Of these costs, 4.0% and 3.3%, respectively, were due to antipsychotic drug costs. The increased costs in the clozapine group appeared to reflect the licensing requirement for inpatient admission for commencing the drug. There was a trend towards higher mean participant utility scores in the clozapine group. CONCLUSIONS: For band 1, there is no disadvantage in terms of quality of life and symptoms, or associated costs of care, over 1 year in commencing conventional antipsychotic drugs rather than new atypical drugs. Conventional drugs were associated with non-significantly better outcomes and lower costs. Drug costs represented a small proportion of the overall costs of care (<5%). For band 2, there is a statistically significant advantage in terms of symptoms but not quality of life over 1 year in commencing clozapine rather than new atypical drugs, but with increased associated costs of care. The results suggest that conventional antipsychotic drugs, which are substantially cheaper, still have a place in the treatment of patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, current medication. Further analyses of this data set are planned and further research is recommended into areas such as current antipsychotic treatment guidance, valid measures of utility in serious mental illness, low-dose 'conventional' treatment in first episode schizophrenia, QLS validity and determinants of QLS score in schizophrenia, and into the possible financial and other mechanisms of rewarding clinician participation in trials."
31198518,0,a,"Background: Low physical activity (PA) is increasing public health problem. The present study aimed to determine socioeconomic inequality in PA among children aged 10-12 years old in Kurdistan, west of Iran in 2015. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 2506 children aged 10-12 in Sanandaj, Iran, in 2015. Data on the children's level of PA were collected using the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire. The concentration index was used to measure inequality and the Oaxaca decomposition to examine the different determinants of the inequality. The data were analyzed in Stata 13 and SPSS 20. Results: Of the 2506 participants, 40.90% (38.97-42.82) had insufficient PA. Girls had a lower level of PA than boys (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.28-0.41) and it is directly related to maternal education (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.18-2.47), the family's Socioeconomic status (SES) (OR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.56-3.05), and the place of residence (OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.16-2.44). The concentration index for insufficient PA was -0.25 (95 CI: -0.30 to -0.21), revealing an insufficient PA in the group with a low SES. The prevalence of insufficient PA is 51.38% (95% CI: 48.45-54.31) in poor group and 28.40% (95% CI: 22.80-33.99) in the wealthier group. The Oaxaca decomposition showed maternal education and the place of residence was the most important determinants of inequality. Conclusions: According to the findings, most of the children especially in the poor groups didn't have sufficient PA and socioeconomic factors could have the important role."
29357365,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Facial cleanliness and sanitation are postulated to reduce trachoma transmission, but there are no previous data on community-level herd protection thresholds. We characterize associations between active trachoma, access to improved sanitation facilities, and access to improved water sources for the purpose of face washing, with the aim of estimating community-level or herd protection thresholds. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used cluster-sampled Global Trachoma Mapping Project data on 884,850 children aged 1-9 years from 354,990 households in 13 countries. We employed multivariable mixed-effects modified Poisson regression models to assess the relationships between water and sanitation coverage and trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF). We observed lower TF prevalence among those with household-level access to improved sanitation (prevalence ratio, PR = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.83-0.91), and household-level access to an improved washing water source in the residence/yard (PR = 0.81; 95%CI: 0.75-0.88). Controlling for household-level water and latrine access, we found evidence of community-level protection against TF for children living in communities with high sanitation coverage (PR80-90% = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.73-1.02; PR90-100% = 0.76; 95%CI: 0.67-0.85). Community sanitation coverage levels greater than 80% were associated with herd protection against TF (PR = 0.77; 95%CI: 0.62-0.97)-that is, lower TF in individuals whose households lacked individual sanitation but who lived in communities with high sanitation coverage. For community-level water coverage, there was no apparent threshold, although we observed lower TF among several of the higher deciles of community-level water coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides insights into the community water and sanitation coverage levels that might be required to best control trachoma. Our results suggest access to adequate water and sanitation can be important components in working towards the 2020 target of eliminating trachoma as a public health problem."
29183223,0,a,"In recent years, the experiences of immigrant and refugee young men have drawn attention worldwide. Human-induced environmental disasters, local and global conflicts, and increasingly inequitable distributions of wealth have shaped transnational migration patterns. Canada is home to a large immigrant and refugee population, particularly in its urban areas, and supporting the mental health and well-being of these communities is of critical importance. The aim of this article is to report findings from a qualitative study on the social context of mental health among immigrant and refugee young men, with a focus on their migration and resettlement experiences. Informed by the conceptual lens of social context, a thematic narrative analysis approach was used to examine qualitative data from individual and group interviews with 33 young men (age 15 to 22 years) self-identified as immigrants or refugees and were living in Greater Vancouver, western Canada. Three thematic narratives were identified: a better life, living the (immigrant) dream, and starting again from way below. The narratives characterized the social context for immigrant and refugee young men and were connected by a central theme of negotiating second-class citizenship. Implications include the need for mental health frameworks that address marginalization and take into account the contexts and discourses that shape the mental health of immigrant and refugee populations in Canada and worldwide."
29490695,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Health disparities are a persistent problem in many high-income countries. Health policymakers recognize the need to develop systematic methods for documenting and tracking these disparities in order to reduce them. The experience of the U.S., which has a well-established health disparities monitoring infrastructure, provides useful insights for other countries. MAIN BODY: This article provides an in-depth review of health disparities monitoring in the U.S. Lessons of potential relevance for other countries include: 1) the integration of health disparities monitoring in population health surveillance, 2) the role of political commitment, 3) use of monitoring as a feedback loop to inform future directions, 4) use of monitoring to identify data gaps, 5) development of extensive cross-departmental cooperation, and 6) exploitation of digital tools for monitoring and reporting. Using Israel as a case in point, we provide a brief overview of the healthcare and health disparities landscape in Israel, and examine how the lessons from the U.S. experience might be applied in the Israeli context. CONCLUSION: The U.S. model of health disparities monitoring provides useful lessons for other countries with respect to documentation of health disparities and tracking of progress made towards their elimination. Given the persistence of health disparities both in the U.S. and Israel, there is a need for monitoring systems to expand beyond individual- and healthcare system-level factors, to incorporate social and environmental determinants of health as health indicators/outcomes."
26307405,0,a,"BACKGROUND: For conservation of highly threatened species to be effective, it is crucial to differentiate natural population parameters from atypical behavioural, ecological and demographic characteristics associated with human disturbance and habitat degradation, which can constrain population growth and recovery. Unfortunately, these parameters can be very hard to determine for species of extreme rarity. The Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), the world's rarest ape, consists of a single population of c.25 individuals, but intensive management is constrained by a limited understanding of the species' expected population characteristics and environmental requirements. In order to generate a more robust evidence-base for Hainan gibbon conservation, we employed a comparative approach to identify intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of variation in key ecological and behavioural traits (home range size, social group size, mating system) across the Hylobatidae while controlling for phylogenetic non-independence. RESULTS: All three studied traits show strong phylogenetic signals across the Hylobatidae. Although the Hainan gibbon and some closely related species have large reported group sizes, no observed gibbon group size is significantly different from the values expected on the basis of phylogenetic relationship alone. However, the Hainan gibbon and two other Nomascus species (N. concolor, N. nasutus) show home range values that are higher than expected relative to all other gibbon species. Predictive models incorporating intraspecific trait variation but controlling for covariance between population samples due to phylogenetic relatedness reveal additional environmental and biological determinants of variation in gibbon ranging requirements and social structure, but not those immediately associated with recent habitat degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the first systematic assessment of behavioural and ecological trait patterns across the Hylobatidae using recent approaches in comparative analysis. By formally contextualising the Hainan gibbon's observed behavioural and ecological characteristics within family-wide variation in gibbons, we are able to determine natural population parameters expected for this Critically Endangered species, as well as wider correlates of variation for key population characteristics across the Hylobatidae. This approach reveals key insights with a direct impact on future Hainan gibbon conservation planning, and demonstrates the usefulness of the comparative approach for informing management of species of conservation concern."
29580610,0,a,"Mental health has been included in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. However, uncertainty exists about the extent to which the major social determinants of mental disorders are addressed by these goals. The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the social determinants of mental disorders that is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, to use this framework to systematically review evidence regarding these social determinants, and to identify potential mechanisms and targets for interventions. We did a systematic review of reviews using a conceptual framework comprising demographic, economic, neighbourhood, environmental events, and social and culture domains. We included 289 articles in the final Review. This study sheds new light on how the Sustainable Development Goals are relevant for addressing the social determinants of mental disorders, and how these goals could be optimised to prevent mental disorders."
25912201,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome has been speculated to be linked to cognitive impairment through vascular risk factors or through its effect on sleep deprivation. Previous studies on the association between restless legs syndrome and cognitive function have been inconclusive. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the association between restless legs syndrome and cognitive function using data from a large population-based study of elderly individuals residing in France. METHODS: We used information from 2070 individuals from the Dijon, France center of the Three-City study who had available information on restless legs syndrome and cognitive functioning measures. Restless legs syndrome was assessed using the 4 minimal diagnostic criteria of the International Restless Legs Study Group. During the same wave in which restless legs syndrome status was assessed, cognitive functions also were assessed using 4 tests: Isaacs' test of verbal/category fluency, the Benton Visual Retention Test, the Trail Making Test B, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. We created a summary global cognitive score by summing the z scores for the 4 tests and used analysis of covariance to explore the association between restless legs syndrome and cognitive function. RESULTS: We did not observe any statistically significant differences in any cognitive z-score between those with restless legs syndrome and those without restless legs syndrome. The mean global z-score after multivariate adjustment was -0.003 (SE 0.173) for those with restless legs syndrome and -0.007 (SE 0.129) for those without restless legs syndrome (P-value = .98). CONCLUSION: Data from this large, population-based study do not suggest that restless legs syndrome is associated with prevalent cognitive deficits in elderly individuals."
16783115,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to examine the demographic, medical, and social cognitive determinants of exercise intentions in a population-based sample of multiple myeloma cancer survivors. Using a cross-sectional survey, 70 multiple myeloma cancer survivors completed a questionnaire that assessed their medical and demographic characteristics, past exercise behavior, and social cognitive exercise beliefs using the theory of planned behavior. Seventy participants provided valuable data. Descriptive statistics indicated that participants had quite positive instrumental attitude, intentions, and subjective norms and moderate levels of perceived behavioral control and affective attitudes for exercise. Forced entry multiple regression showed that the theory of planned behavior explained 43% of the variance in exercise intentions. Instrumental attitude and perceived behavioral control were both independent predictors of exercise intentions. No demographic or medical variable moderated the association between the theory of planned behavior constructs and exercise intentions. The results of the present investigation support the growing body of evidence confirming the utility of the theory of planned behavior to understand the salient determinants of exercise in cancer survivors. Knowledge gained from this study provides important information to oncology practitioners who are responsible for delivering supportive care interventions, including exercise, to patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma."
23290623,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Exposure to child maltreatment is associated with physical, emotional, and social impairment, yet in Canada there is a paucity of community-based information about the extent of this problem and its determinants. We examined the prevalence of child physical and sexual abuse and the associations of child abuse with early contextual, family, and individual factors using a community-based sample in Ontario. METHODS: The Ontario Child Health Study is a province-wide health survey of children aged 4 through 16 years. Conducted in 1983, a second wave was undertaken in 1987 and a third in 2000-2001. The third wave (N=1,928) included questions about exposure to physical and sexual abuse in childhood. RESULTS: Males reported significantly more child physical abuse (33.7%), but not severe physical abuse (21.5%), than females (28.2% and 18.3%, respectively). Females reported significantly more child sexual abuse (22.1%) than males (8.3%). Growing up in an urban area, young maternal age at the time of the first child's birth, and living in poverty, predicted child physical abuse (and the severe category), and sexual abuse. Childhood psychiatric disorder was associated with child physical abuse (and the severe category), while parental adversity was associated with child sexual abuse and severe physical abuse. Siblings of those who experienced either physical abuse or sexual abuse in childhood were at increased risk for the same abuse exposure; the risk was highest for physical abuse. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight important similarities and differences in risk factors for physical and sexual abuse in childhood. Such information is useful in considering approaches to prevention and early detection of child maltreatment. Clinicians who identify physical abuse or sexual abuse in children should be alert to the need to assess whether siblings have experienced similar exposures. This has important implications for assessment of other children in the home at the time of identification with the overall goal of reducing further occurrence of abuse."
12774653,1,a,"Epidemiology is a core science of public health, focusing on research related to the distribution and determinants of both positive and adverse health states and events and on application of knowledge gained to improve public health. The American College of Epidemiology (ACE) is a professional organization devoted to the professional practice of epidemiology. As part of that commitment, and in response to concerns for more explicit attention to core values and duties of epidemiologists in light of emerging issues and increased scrutiny of epidemiology, the College developed, adopted, and published a set of Ethics Guidelines. The structure of the ACE ethics guidelines is in four parts: (1) a brief statement of core values and duties of epidemiologists, coupled with the virtues important to professional practice; (2) concise statements of key duties and obligations; (3) exposition of the duties and obligations with more applications; and (4) a brief summary and conclusion. The Guidelines have been published on the ACE website and in the official College journal Annals of Epidemiology. The guidelines contain (and maintain) core elements that define the discipline of epidemiology and its fundamental duties, but they are also intended to be dynamic and evolving, responsive to a changing professional and social environment."
25888526,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A low socioeconomic position (SEP) is consistently associated with ill health, sickness absence (SA) and permanent disability, but studies among young employees are lacking. We examined the interrelationships between education, occupational class and income as determinants of SA among 25-34-year-old employees. We also examined, whether the association between SEP and SA varied over time in 2002-2007 and 2008-2013. METHODS: The analyses covered young, 25-34-year-old women and men employed by the City of Helsinki over the time periods 2002-2007 and 2008-2013. Four-level education and occupational class classifications were used, as well as income quartiles. The outcome measure was the number of annual SA days. RESULTS: Education had the strongest and most consistent independent association with SA among women and men in both periods under study. Occupational class had weaker independent and less consistent association with SA. Income had an independent association with SA, which strengthened over time among the men. The interrelationships between the SEP indicators and SA were partly explained by prior or mediated through subsequent SEP indicators. Socioeconomic differences followed only partially a gradient for occupational class and also for income among men. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive measures to reduce the risk of SA should be considered, especially among young employees with a basic or lower-secondary education."
12007554,1,a,"The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which respondents provided the same answers to a health-related lifestyle questionnaire in self- and interviewer-administered forms. A total of 234 subjects completed a 110-item questionnaire in both interviewer and self-administered forms. Modes of administration were separated by a 2-week interval. The order was determined by random allocation. The presence and the extent of the tendency to give socially acceptable responses were evaluated using percentage of bias calculated as the ratio of the difference in proportion of positive responses or the mean between interviews and questionnaires and those in questionnaires. All percentages of bias were in the positive direction, ranging from 1.4% (physical exercise) to 26.1% (general life stress). The average percentage of bias was higher in women than in men and were stronger for younger respondents. The age differences between interviewer and respondent were inversely and most strongly related to percentage of bias. Self- and interviewer-administered questionnaires yield very similar results in discriminating between subjects, but the interviewer-administered questionnaire showed systematically more desirable responses to questions related to lifestyle factors. The differences in characteristics between interviewer and respondent may be important determinants of the socially desirability bias in the interview."
25413492,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between intermediary social determinants, namely social support and social network with dental caries in adolescents. METHODS: An adapted version of the WHO social determinants of health conceptual framework was used to organize structural and intermediary social determinants of dental caries into six blocks including perceived social support and number of social networks. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a representative sample of 542 students between 12 and 14 years of age in public schools located in the city of Dourados, Brazil in 2012. The outcome variables were caries experience (DMFT >/= 1) and current dental caries (component D of DMFT >/= 1) recorded by a calibrated dentist. Individual interviews were performed to collect data on perceived social support and numbers of social networks from family and friends and covariates. Multivariate Poisson regressions using hierarchical models were conducted. RESULTS: The prevalence of adolescents with caries experience and current dental caries was 55.2% and 32.1%, respectively. Adolescents with low numbers of social networks and low levels of social support from family (PR 1.47; 95% CI = 1.01-2.14) were more likely to have DMFT >/= 1. Current dental caries was associated with low numbers of social networks and low levels of social support from family (PR 2.26; 95% CI = 1.15-4.44). CONCLUSION: Social support and social network were influential psychosocial factors to dental caries in adolescents. This finding requires confirmation in other countries but potentially has implications for programmes to promote oral health."
30937463,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to implement a novel, community-based physical activity (PA) intervention in a Swiss town with active participation of elderly participants and to evaluate its effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability and sustainability. METHODS: The CAPACITY intervention combined important determinants of PA, used smartphone apps to provide feedback/facilitate interaction, and followed a citizen science approach to enable participants to organize walking groups. We targeted persons > 60 years from Wetzikon. Assessments took place at baseline and after 6 months, during this intervention period, and 11 months after step-wise withdrawal of the study team. RESULTS: Twenty-nine persons were included in the study; 25 conducted 6-month follow-up. They had a significant increase in moderate-to-vigorous PA (p = 0.046) but not in daily steps (p = 0.331). After the intervention period, key participants took over organization, independently organized monthly get-togethers, added new walking routes and continuously recruit new participants. Eleven months after withdrawal of the study team, 61 people regularly walk in groups together. CONCLUSIONS: The novel CAPACITY intervention was successfully implemented, transferred to participants and is now self-sustainable for almost 1 year in the community."
22995043,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There is a shortage of information about the factors that mediate physical activity intervention effects which involve youth. The purpose of this study was to examine whether personal, social and physical-environmental factors mediated the intervention effect on physical activity and whether gender and weight status moderated mediated effects in the Health In Adolescents Study - a school-based intervention to promote healthy weight development among young adolescents. METHODS: Participating schools were randomized to Control (n = 25) and Intervention (n = 12). The intervention components to enhance physical activity targeted change through theoretically informed mediators embedded in a social-ecological framework. Accelerometer assessed physical activity (mean count per minute) and self-efficacy, enjoyment, perceived social support from parents, teachers and friends and perceived environmental opportunities were measured by questionnaires at baseline and post-intervention after 20 months among 700 11-13 year-old adolescents (Intervention = 485; Control = 215). The product-of-coefficient test was used to examine mediation. RESULTS: No mediating effect of any of the hypothesized mediators was identified and gender and weight status did not moderate any mediated effects with the exception of weight status that moderated the mediated effect of enjoyment. Few intervention effects were seen on the mediators, except for a positive change in social support from teachers among girls and the normal weight, and a negative effect on enjoyment and self-efficacy among the overweight. However, change in enjoyment, self-efficacy, perceived social support from friends and environmental opportunities were associated with change in mean count per minute with some variation across the investigated subgroups, and thus show evidence of being potential mediators of physical activity change in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: While no mediation effects were observed, change in both personal and social-environmental factors predicted change in physical activity behavior. Hence, a social- ecological approach targeting a wide range of determinants to promote change in physical activity holds promise. Overweight and normal weight adolescents may not respond in the same way to school-based physical activity interventions. Therefore, strategies to better reach the overweight seem needed. Future studies should continue to identify mediating and moderation mechanisms in physical activity change in adolescents."
25904944,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to detect low parasite and asymptomatic malaria infections by means of three malaria diagnostic tests, in a low transmission region of Minab district, Hormozgan Province, southern Iran. METHODS: Blood samples of 200 healthy volunteers from Bagh-e-Malek area were evaluated using microscopic, rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and nested-PCR to inspect malaria parasite. RESULTS: The results showed no Plasmodium parasite in subjects by means of microscopy and RDT. However, 3 P. vivax positive samples (1.5%) were discovered by Nested-PCR while microscopy and RDT missed the cases. CONCLUSION: Microscopy as the gold standard method and RDT correctly identified 98.5% of cases, and molecular analysis is sensitive and reliable, especially in the detection of ""asymptomatic"" infections for active case surveillance. Regarding the existence of asymptomatic malaria in endemic area of Hormozgan, Iran, nested-PCR could be considered as a sensitive tool to interrupt malaria transmission in the country, beside the microscopic and RDT methods."
17469399,1,a,"Benchmarking of the performance of states, provinces, or districts in a decentralised health system is important for fostering of accountability, monitoring of progress, identification of determinants of success and failure, and creation of a culture of evidence. The Mexican Ministry of Health has, since 2001, used a benchmarking approach based on the World Health Organization (WHO) concept of effective coverage of an intervention, which is defined as the proportion of potential health gain that could be delivered by the health system to that which is actually delivered. Using data collection systems, including state representative examination surveys, vital registration, and hospital discharge registries, we have monitored the delivery of 14 interventions for 2005-06. Overall effective coverage ranges from 54.0% in Chiapas, a poor state, to 65.1% in the Federal District. Effective coverage for maternal and child health interventions is substantially higher than that for interventions that target other health problems. Effective coverage for the lowest wealth quintile is 52% compared with 61% for the highest quintile. Effective coverage is closely related to public-health spending per head across states; this relation is stronger for interventions that are not related to maternal and child health than those for maternal and child health. Considerable variation also exists in effective coverage at similar amounts of spending. We discuss the implications of these issues for the further development of the Mexican health-information system. Benchmarking of performance by measuring effective coverage encourages decision-makers to focus on quality service provision, not only service availability. The effective coverage calculation is an important device for health-system stewardship. In adopting this approach, other countries should select interventions to be measured on the basis of the criteria of affordability, effect on population health, effect on health inequalities, and capacity to measure the effects of the intervention. The national institutions undertaking this benchmarking must have the mandate, skills, resources, and independence to succeed."
20131095,0,a,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate perceived unmet need for mental healthcare, determinants of unmet need, and barriers to care in individuals with social anxiety (SA) or panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) in Quebec. Data from 206 participants diagnosed with SA or PDA were collected using an online questionnaire. Correlational analyses and binary stepwise logistic regressions were conducted to explore determinants of perceived unmet need. Of the 206 participants, 144 (69.9%) reported instances of unmet need for treatment. Perceived unmet need was correlated with variables related to the severity of the disorder, such as comorbid depression, avoidance, duration of worry, interference with functioning, and time lapsed between the appearance of first symptoms and first consultation. Depression and avoidance emerged as predictors for perceived unmet need in the regression analysis. The most common barriers to treatment reported were concern about the cost of services (63.9%), not knowing where to go to get help (63.2%), lack of health insurance coverage (52.4%), and appointment wait times (52.1%). The results of this study demonstrate the need to overcome barriers to treatment engendered by avoidance behaviors associated with anxiety. Potential methods for achieving this objective include Internet outreach, support groups, and increased accessibility to public services."
17448554,1,a,"This paper uses the British Health and Lifestyle Survey (1984-1985) data and the longitudinal follow-up of May 2003 to investigate the determinants of premature mortality in Great Britain and the contribution of lifestyle choices to socio-economic inequality in mortality. A behavioural model, which relates premature mortality to a set of observable and unobservable factors, is considered. A maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) approach for a multivariate probit (MVP) is used to estimate a recursive system of equations for mortality, morbidity and lifestyles. Health inequality is explored using the Gini coefficient and a decomposition technique. The decomposition analysis for predicted mortality shows that, after allowing for endogeneity, lifestyles contribute strongly to inequality in mortality, reducing the direct role of socio-economic status. This contradicts the view, which is widely held in epidemiology, that lifestyles make a relatively minor contribution to observed socio-economic gradients in health."
15210092,1,a,"Social capital is an increasingly popular construct in research examining social and behavioral determinants of health and well-being. Yet, comparing the results of social capital research is inhibited by inconsistencies in labeling, different definitions and subsequent disagreement on level of analysis, and limited evaluation of the psychometric properties of measures of social capital. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Social Capital Questionnaire (Journal of Applied Behavioral Science 36(1) (2000) 23). In the current study, the original Australian-based instrument was modified for telephone administration with a US sample. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a similar factor structure to that found during initial survey development. These findings lend support to the notion of social capital as a meaningful construct and suggest the Onyx and Bullen instrument deserves further attention as a practical tool for health researchers and community agencies interested in social capital."
26164612,0,a,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Expectancies are core features of mental disorders, and change in expectations is therefore one of the core mechanisms of treatment in psychiatry. We aim to improve our understanding of expectancies by summarizing factors that contribute to their development, persistence, and modification. We pay particular attention to the issue of persistence of expectancies despite experiences that contradict them. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on recent research findings, we propose a new model for expectation persistence and expectation change. When expectations are established, effects are evident in neural and other biological systems, for example, via anticipatory reactions, different biological reactions to expected versus unexpected stimuli, etc. Psychological 'immunization' and 'assimilation', implicit self-confirming processes, and stability of biological processes help us to better understand why expectancies persist even in the presence of expectation violations. SUMMARY: Learning theory, attentional processes, social influences, and biological determinants contribute to the development, persistence, and modification of expectancies. Psychological interventions should focus on optimizing expectation violation to achieve optimal treatment outcome and to avoid treatment failures."
15156843,1,a,"Health-related behavior is a function of the sociocultural and environmental contexts in which it occurs. With South Asian immigrants, a comprehensive approach that focuses on community and individual factors may be more effective than an individualistic one. This article explores the factors that may influence HIV/AIDS-related health care seeking by South Asian immigrants to the United States. It focuses on South Asians from Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. The need to involve the community in any intervention process is discussed. An understanding of the determinants of HIV-related health care seeking and behavioral change factors can help social work practitioners develop effective interventions for and with South Asian immigrants."
19553025,1,a,"Socioeconomic determinants of injury have been associated with risk of burn in the UK and USA, but the relative significance of this impact is largely unknown across Canadian populations. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to risk of burn in the province of British Columbia (BC) and identify the extent to which these findings are generalizable across both urban and rural population groups. Measures of SES were based on province-wide comparisons using data obtained from the Canada Census using the Vancouver Area Neighbourhood Deprivation Index (VANDIX). Results illustrate that the effects of SES and increased injury risk are substantial, though the most pronounced variations were exhibited across each SES stratum for urban areas and with less demonstrable effect when itemized by injury type within rural areas. Although conservative, the results from this study illustrate that burns disproportionately affect populations of greater relative socioeconomic disadvantage and continued efforts to also address social inequities and their link to injury incidence is likely to be more effective than targeting individual behavior alone when trying to reduce and eliminate their occurrence."
19161600,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Vertical and horizontal trust, as dimensions of social capital, may be important determinants of health. As mass media campaigns have been used extensively to promote healthy lifestyles and convey health-related information, high levels of individual trust in the media may facilitate the success of such campaigns and, hence, have a positive influence on health. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between trust levels in mass media, an aspect of vertical trust, and health. METHODS: Based on cross-sectional data of the general population from the AsiaBarometer Survey (2003-2006), we analyzed the relationship between self-rated health and trust in mass media, using a multilevel logistic model, adjusted for age, gender, marital status, income, education, occupation, horizontal trust, and trust in the healthcare system. RESULTS: In a total of 39082 participants (mean age 38; 49% male), 26808 (69%) were classified as in good health. By the levels of trust in mass media, there were 6399 (16%) who reported that they trust a lot, 16327 (42%) reporting trust to a degree, 9838 (25%) who do not really trust, 3307 (9%) who do not trust at all, and 191 (0.5%) who have not thought about it. In the multilevel model, trust in mass media was associated with good health (do not trust at all as the base group): the odds ratios (OR) of 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-1.27) for do not really trust; OR of 1.35 (95% CI = 1.23-1.49) for trust to a degree, and 1.57 (95% CI = 1.36-1.81) for trust a lot. Horizontal trust and trust in the healthcare system were also associated with health. CONCLUSION: Vertical trust in mass media is associated with better health in Asian people. Since mass media is likely an important arena for public health, media trust should be enhanced to make people healthier."

31008235,0,a,"Introduction: Global health case studies can highlight, often in dramatic fashion, topics such as health disparities, health systems, and the social determinants of health. This resource presents a case study of an adolescent Haitian boy requiring lifesaving heart surgery in the US due to an acquired mitral valve disease from untreated streptococcal pharyngitis. Methods: While the case begins in a US clinic setting, it then goes on to explore the patient's home context-an impoverished village in rural Haiti-in order to demonstrate the effect of social determinants on both an individual's health and the capacity of health care systems to provide appropriate care. The case study concludes by asking the students to explore which health interventions, from a list of options, they would recommend to improve health in rural Haiti. Students discuss the advantages and disadvantages of developing health initiatives that vary by level of impact and approach. Results: This case study has been presented to two classes of first-year medical students during their Health Systems course and was well received. Discussion: By providing linkages between the local and international contexts, this case provides greater relevance for global health material to all participating students."
27393704,0,a,"Patients with advanced renal failure often face considerable sociopsychological stress as a result of lifestyle changes due to the disease and its treatment. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of the Holy Qur'an recitation on depressive symptoms in hemodialysis patients. In this clinical trial, 54 hemodialysis patients were randomized to either an experimental (n = 27) or a control (n = 27) group. Patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at baseline and at 1 month after the intervention. Participants in the experimental group listened to recitation of the Holy Qur'an, while those in the control group received no intervention. The mean BDI-II score at baseline was 33.6 (+/-6.7) for the experimental group and 29.3 (+/-9.0) for the control group; at the end of treatment, BDI-II scores in the experimental and control groups were 14.5 (+/-4.8) and 31.6 (+/-9.2), respectively. Results from the repeated-measures general linear model controlling for baseline differences indicated a significant treatment effect (F = 9.30, p = 0.004, Cohen's d = 0.85). Holy Qur'an recitation has a significant effect on lowering depressive symptoms in hemodialysis patients. Holy Qur'an recitation is an easy-to-implement and cost-effective strategy that may be used to supplement the treatment of depression in this setting in Iran."
21431819,1,a,"This paper introduces a series of research projects designed to fulfill the societal role of environmental health studies by investigating (1) the dynamic and complex relationships between environmental conditions and (2) health in an urban setting. Research in this first category has revealed the existence of the combined influence of multiple physical environmental factors on health and its mechanisms. In the second category, there have been a number of studies of the integrated influence of social environmental factors on health employing an aggregate modeling of multiple determinants of health and studies of individual topics related to social determinants of health. These research projects have contributed to the formulation of specific remedies and the development of comprehensive health policies. Participatory approaches have been used to enhance capacity building opportunities and to ensure that research results reflect the actual conditions in urban societies. Healthy Cities projects and programs have been developed in close collaboration with this type of research. Urban societies have become interdependent and share the same issues globally. Further research into the relationships between health and the environment in the context of urbanization will expand the base of evidence applicable to the complex realities in modern societies."
29283994,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: In European countries, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) disproportionately affects migrants from medium- and high-endemic areas and is largely underdiagnosed. To inform policy and improve screening strategies, we measured the timing of CHB diagnosis after migration and its determinants among sub-Saharan migrants living in the Paris metropolitan area (France). DESIGN: The PARCOURS study is a retrospective life-event history survey conducted in health care services in 2012-2013 among 779 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa who were receiving care for CHB. We investigated the timing of CHB diagnosis from the time of arrival in France using the Kaplan-Meier method and characteristics associated with CHB diagnosis since the time of arrival in France using discrete-time multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: The median CHB diagnosis occurred during the fourth year spent in France for men and during the second year spent in France for women. Among men, the probability of CHB diagnosis increased during years with (versus without) a temporary resident permit (aOR: 1.6, 95%CI: 1.1-2.2), a precarious accommodation (aOR: 1.7, 95%CI: 1.1-2.6), and hospitalization (aOR: 7.7, 95%CI: 3.4-15.1). Among women, CHB diagnosis was more likely to occur during years with unemployment (aOR: 1.9, 95%CI: 1.1-3.94), pregnancy (aOR: 6.6, 95%CI: 3.5-12.5) and hospitalization (aOR: 9.0, 95%CI: 2.95-32.3). For both sexes, the probability of CHB diagnosis was higher among those who migrated to France because they were threatened in their country. CONCLUSION: This study shows that social hardships (residential, economic, administrative) and contact with the health care system after arrival in France hasten access to a CHB diagnosis."
18268195,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Although risk factors for Alzheimer disease have been well studied, much less is known about risk factors for primary progressive aphasia (PPA). OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that learning disabilities (LDs) are more common in patients with PPA and their first-degree family members. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Self-report endorsement of an individual and family history of an LD in a sample of 699 subjects from the Northwestern Alzheimer's Disease Center registry. We compared 3 dementia groups (PPA, typical amnestic Alzheimer disease, and the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia) and 1 elderly control group. A retrospective medical record review in the PPA probands was used to obtain additional information. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of LDs among probands and their first-degree relatives. RESULTS: The patients with PPA and their first-degree family members had a significantly higher frequency of LD compared with the other dementia groups and the controls. Some of the families of patients with PPA displayed unusual concentrations of LD, especially dyslexia. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LD may constitute a risk factor for PPA, providing additional clues concerning the determinants for the selective vulnerability of the language network in this syndrome."
15246170,1,a,"There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that negative health lifestyles are the principal social determinants of the mortality crisis in the former socialist states. Little is known, however, about health lifestyles in Central Asia, where the downturn in life expectancy was also experienced. This paper examines health lifestyles in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in order to fill an important gap in the literature. The data show, consistent with the improved longevity of the Kyrgyz population, that such lifestyles are more positive in Kyrgyzstan despite the somewhat better economic situation in Kazakhstan, where the mortality crisis continues."
24616603,1,a,"The development of expertise in sport is the result of successful interaction of biological, psychological, and sociological constraints. This review examines the training and environmental factors that influence the acquisition of sport expertise. Research examining the quality and quantity of training indicate that these two elements are crucial predictors of attainment. In addition, the possession of resources such as parental support and adequate coaching are essential. Social factors such as cultural influences and the relative age effect are also considered as determinants of sport expertise. Although it is evident that environmental factors are essential to the acquisition of high levels of sport development, further research is clearly required."
21489217,0,a,"This paper provides a synthesis on socioeconomic inequalities in cancer incidence, mortality and survival across countries and within countries, with particular focus on the Italian context; the paper also describes the underlying mechanisms documented for cancer incidence, and reports some remarks on policies to tackle inequalities.From a worldwide perspective, the burden of cancer appears to be particularly increasing in developing countries, where many cancers with a poor prognosis (liver, stomach and oesophagus) are much more common than in richer countries. As in the case of incidence and mortality, also in cancer survival we observe a great variability across countries. Different studies have suggested a possible impact of health care on the social gradients in cancer survival, even in countries with a National Health System providing equitable access to care.In developed countries, there is increasing awareness of social inequalities as an important public health issue; as a consequence, there is a variety of strategies and policies being implemented throughout Europe. However, recent reviews emphasize that present knowledge on effectiveness of policies and interventions on health inequalities is not sufficient to offer a robust and evidence-based guide to the choice and design of interventions, and that more evaluation studies are needed.The large disparities in health that we can measure within and between countries represent a challenge to the world; social health inequalities are avoidable, and their reduction therefore represents an achievable goal and an ethical imperative."
26630926,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Tackling inequalities in overweight, obesity and related determinants has become a top priority for the European research and policy agendas. Although it has been established that such inequalities accumulate from early childhood onward, they have not been studied extensively in children. The current article discusses the results of an explorative analysis for the identification of inequalities in behaviours and their determinants between groups with high and low socio-economic status. METHODS: This study is part of the Epode for the Promotion of Health Equity (EPHE) evaluation study, the overall aim of which is to assess the impact and sustainability of EPODE methodology to diminish inequalities in childhood obesity and overweight. Seven community-based programmes from different European countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Portugal, Romania, The Netherlands) participate in the EPHE study. In each of the communities, children aged 6-8 years participated, resulting in a total sample of 1266 children and their families. A parental self-administrated questionnaire was disseminated in order to assess the socio-economic status of the household, selected energy balance-related behaviours (1. fruit and vegetable consumption; 2. soft drink/ fruit juices and water consumption; 3. screen time and 4. sleep duration) of the children and associated family environmental determinants. The Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson's chi-square test were used to test differences between the low and high education groups. The country-specific median was chosen as the cut-off point to determine the educational level, given the different average educational level in every country. RESULTS: Children with mothers of relatively high educational level consumed fruits and vegetables more frequently than their peers of low socio-economic status. The latter group of children had a higher intake of fruit juices and/or soft drinks and had higher screen time. Parental rules and home availability were consistently different between the two socio-economic groups in our study in all countries. However we did not find a common pattern for all behaviours and the variability across the countries was large. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are indicative of socio-economic inequalities in our samples, although the variability across the countries was large. The effectiveness of interventions aimed at chancing parental rules and behaviour on health inequalities should be studied."
20120654,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Postherpetic neuralgia is a neuralgia caused by the varicella zoster virus. Its natural history involves slow resolution of the pain syndrome. A subgroup of patients may develop severe, long-lasting pain that does not respond to medical therapy. It also accounts for 11-15% of all referrals to pain clinics but little is known about the quality of life of patients with this condition in our locality Nigeria. METHOD: Fifty three Post herpetic Neuralgia patients aged between 25 and 56 years (mean = 37.47 +/- 8.29 years) receiving antiretroviral therapy/treatment at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Maiduguri, Nigeria participated in this study. The short-form 36 (SF-36) generic health-related Quality of Life questionnaire was used to assess the QoL. Spearman rank correlation procedure was used to evaluate the relationship of HRQoL outcomes with medical and socio-demographic factor. RESULT: Physical functioning), Role limitations due to physical health (LPH), Role limitations due to emotional problems (LEP), Social functioning (SF), General health perceptions (GH) scores were below average (35.59 +/- 19.85, 34.28 +/- 33.16, 33.70 +/- 23.26, 49.07 +/- 17.04, 44.09 +/- 9.72 respectively) while Emotional well being/Mental health (EM) was above average (50.13 +/- 11.56). An average (moderate) symptom scale score was Energy/Fatigue (EF) (51.32 +/- 12.87) while Bodily pain (BP) was severe (31.09 +/- 20.46). Age and sex had no significant influence on any of the functional and symptom scale scores as well as the overall QOL. Inverse relationship was observed between age and each of the LPH, LEP, SF, GH, overall QoL and the entire symptom scales. The overall QoL and each of the symptom scale scores were significantly related (P > 0.05). The functional scale score PF, RPH, REP EM and GH were significantly related to overall QoL while SF was not significantly related (P > 0.01). CONCLUSION: This study has shown that the overall QoL of PHN in HIV positive patients undergoing adjuvant therapy is below average. The predictor factors of the overall QoL of this group of patients have been brought to light. These patients would require ways to improve the QoL, there is the need for health care provider to address the factors uncovered by this study. Four of the determinant factors (PF, LP, BP and EF) are issues that fall within the corridor of physical therapy. Physical therapist should arise to address these significant aspects of the management this group of patients."
23375367,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The authors designed an instrument to measure objectively aspects of the built and food environments in urban areas, the EURO-PREVOB Community Questionnaire, within the EU-funded project 'Tackling the social and economic determinants of nutrition and physical activity for the prevention of obesity across Europe' (EURO-PREVOB). This paper describes its development, reliability, validity, feasibility and relevance to public health and obesity research. STUDY DESIGN: The Community Questionnaire is designed to measure key aspects of the food and built environments in urban areas of varying levels of affluence or deprivation, within different countries. The questionnaire assesses (1) the food environment and (2) the built environment. METHODS: Pilot tests of the EURO-PREVOB Community Questionnaire were conducted in five to 10 purposively sampled urban areas of different socio-economic status in each of Ankara, Brno, Marseille, Riga, and Sarajevo. Inter-rater reliability was compared between two pairs of fieldworkers in each city centre using three methods: inter-observer agreement (IOA), kappa statistics, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: Data were collected successfully in all five cities. Overall reliability of the EURO-PREVOB Community Questionnaire was excellent (inter-observer agreement (IOA) > 0.87; intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)s > 0.91 and kappa statistics > 0.7. However, assessment of certain aspects of the quality of the built environment yielded slightly lower IOA coefficients than the quantitative aspects. CONCLUSIONS: The EURO-PREVOB Community Questionnaire was found to be a reliable and practical observational tool for measuring differences in community-level data on environmental factors that can impact on dietary intake and physical activity. The next step is to evaluate its predictive power by collecting behavioural and anthropometric data relevant to obesity and its determinants."
23318979,0,a,"Hydroxyurea (HU) is a drug that induces fetal hemoglobin production. As a result, HU is widely used to treat beta-thalassemia (beta-thal) patients. However, the response of these patients to HU varies. Some beta-thal patients respond favorably to treatment while others do not respond at all. HU has a number of side-effects and therefore its targeted prescription is beneficial. Hence, identifying the genetic determinants which lead to the differential HU response is important. This review summarizes recent findings which have shed light on this topic. Special emphasis is given to the mechanisms and genetic loci which may govern these differences. These findings have helped identify several single nucleotide polymorphisms which associate with the response to HU in both beta-thal and sickle cell disease patients."
30867676,0,a,"Background: Depression and heart disease are an important public-health problem. Depression is one of the most prevalent and disabling psychiatric disorders with more than three times increased risk among patients with cardiovascular disorders. Objective: To identify the prevalence and associated factors of depressive disorder among adult patients with cardiovascular disease. Methods: Institution based cross-sectional study design was used to conduct this study on 293 study participants attending an outpatient cardiac clinic at Jimma University Teaching Hospital. All eligible patients were recruited into the study consecutively. Depression was assessed using patient health questionnaire-9. The patient health questionnaire-9 had a total score of 27, from which 0-4: no/minimal depression, 5-9: mild depression, 10-14: moderately depression, 15-19: moderately severe depression and 20-27 severe depression. The data was feed into Epi-data version 3.1 and lastly exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Bivariate analysis was used to analyze the statistical association of covariates of interest with depressive disorder among patients with cardiovascular disease. Then, logistic regression analysis was used as a final model to control confounders. The strength of association was measured by a 95% confidence interval. Results: A total of 293 adult patients diagnosed with the cardiovascular disease were included in the study with 97% (n = 284) of response rate, 47.2% (n = 134) males and 52.8% (n = 150) females, making female to a male ratio around 1.1:1. The prevalence of depression was 52.8% (n = 150/284). Out of the subjects with depression 52.67% (n = 79), 36.0% (n = 54) and 11.33% (n = 17) were mild, moderate and severe depression, respectively. Variables such as employed, unemployed, physical activity, current cigarette user and poor social support were independently associated with depression in the final model. Conclusions: In this study, depression was found to be highly prevalent psychiatric comorbidity in adult cardiovascular disease patients."
18355407,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Few studies of the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have focussed on women who work as street sex workers to finance their drug use. METHODS: The investigators report the survey findings of such a population in Glasgow. All women attending the health and social care drop-in centre, situated in Glasgow's ""Red Light Area"", during a four-week period in 1999 were invited to participate in a survey involving the provision of a saliva sample for anonymous HCV testing and the self-completion of a questionnaire seeking demographic, sexual and injecting practice data. RESULTS: Of the 223 women who attended, 51% agreed to participate. Of the 98 women who provided a sufficient saliva sample, 64% (95% CI: 54%-74%) tested HCV antibody positive; 98% of those who tested positive had ever injected drugs. Adjusting for the 85% sensitivity of the saliva test, the HCV antibody prevalence among IDU sex workers sampled was 81%; a rate which is considerably higher than those recorded, contemporaneously, among Glasgow IDUs generally. Two factors were independently associated with HCV antibody positivity in saliva: ever shared needles and syringes (adjusted OR 5.7, 95% CI 2-16) and number of times imprisoned (adjusted OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.4-39, for more than five times compared to zero times). CONCLUSION: Women who engage in street sex work to finance their drug habit are a particularly desperate, chaotic and vulnerable population. This study demonstrates that their HCV infection risk may be greater than that for other IDUs. Those responsible for designing interventions to prevent HCV infection among IDUs should consider the special needs of this group."
30255113,0,a,"Background: Hepatitis C is now curable for most individuals, and national goals for elimination have been established. Transmission persists, however, particularly in nonurban regions affected by the opioid epidemic. To reach goals of elimination, barriers to treatment must be identified. Methods: In this open cohort of all individuals diagnosed with active hepatitis C from 2010 to 2016 at a large medical center, we identified patient and clinic characteristics associated with our primary outcome, sustained virologic response (SVR). We performed a subgroup analysis for those with documented substance misuse. Results: SVR was achieved in 1544 (41%) of 3790 people with active hepatitis C. In a multivariable Poisson regression model, SVR was more likely in individuals diagnosed outpatient (incident rate ratio [IRR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.0), living in close proximity to the medical center (IRR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3), with private insurance (IRR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3), and with cirrhosis (IRR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.5). Achieving SVR was less likely in those qualifying as indigent (IRR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9) and those with substance misuse (IRR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9). In the subgroup analysis of those with substance misuse, SVR rates were higher in those linked to the infectious diseases clinic, which has embedded support services, than those linked to the gastroenterology clinic, which does not (IRR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9). Conclusions: Social determinants of health including proximity to care and poverty impacted achievement of SVR. Those with substance misuse, a high-priority population for treatment of hepatitis C, had better outcomes when receiving care in a clinic with embedded support services."
28110222,0,a,"The health impacts of trade liberalization are often described in relation to access to medicines, changing dietary patterns, tobacco use and alcohol consumption. The impacts of trade liberalization on the social determinants of health (SDH), are by contrast, less well known. Missing is an account of how liberalizing processes identified across different research areas relate to each other and how the association between trade liberalization and health is conceptualized within each of them, especially with reference to SDH. This paper presents a systematic review which provides a more complete picture of the pathways between trade liberalization and health, with special attention to SDH pathways. This picture captures the interrelationships between different areas of investigation, along with current limitations of our understanding and recommendations for future research."

21046908,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To correlate the occurrence of tooth decay with a social class indicator (occupational level) and the immigrant status in a sample of pre-school children in Veneto region. BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. CLINICAL SETTING: Twenty nursery schools in the area of Health District n.15. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,410 children aged 3 to 5 years old visited between September 2005-May 2006. OUTCOMES: Occurrence of dental caries into dentine threshold was made visually and confirmed with a probe when necessary by two calibrated examiners. Information on immigrant status and occupational level of parents was obtained by a questionnaire. Children were categorized as immigrant or non-immigrant on the basis of their mother's country of origin. Means and standard deviation were calculated for continuous variables; for categorical variables the results were provided as proportions. Comparisons between groups were made using Pearson chi-square test. The association between caries occurrence and the independent variables gender, age, immigrant status and family social class was evaluated by means of a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Caries occurrence was higher among children from lower social class families (1.7 +/- 3.2) than among children from higher social class (0.8 +/- 2.1). The prevalence of dental caries in immigrant preschool children was significantly higher than in indigenous ones (15% vs 40%; p = 0.000) while the severity in immigrants was almost 4 times higher (2.2 +/- 3.6 vs 0.6 +/- 1.8). CONCLUSIONS: Our data on preschoolers confirm the worldwide literature shared statement that social class as well as immigration status are determinants of oral health."
18720399,1,a,"Hurricane Katrina was the most devastating natural disaster to hit the United States in the past 75 years. The authors conducted interviews of 810 persons who were representative of adult residents living in the 23 southernmost counties of Mississippi before Hurricane Katrina. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) since Hurricane Katrina was 22.5%. The determinants of PTSD were female gender, experience of hurricane-related financial loss, postdisaster stressors, low social support, and postdisaster traumatic events. Kaplan-Meier survival curves suggest that exposure to both hurricane-related traumatic events and to financial and social stressors influenced the duration of PTSD symptoms. Postdisaster interventions that aim to improve manipulable stressors after these events may influence the onset and course of PTSD."
16848898,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Although there has been concern about the levels of carbon monoxide exposure, particularly among older people, little is known about COHb levels and their determinants in the general population. We examined these issues in a study of older British men. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 4252 men aged 60-79 years selected from one socially representative general practice in each of 24 British towns and who attended for examination between 1998 and 2000. Blood samples were measured for COHb and information on social, household and individual factors assessed by questionnaire. Analyses were based on 3603 men measured in or close to (< 10 miles) their place of residence. RESULTS: The COHb distribution was positively skewed. Geometric mean COHb level was 0.46% and the median 0.50%; 9.2% of men had a COHb level of 2.5% or more and 0.1% of subjects had a level of 7.5% or more. Factors which were independently related to mean COHb level included season (highest in autumn and winter), region (highest in Northern England), gas cooking (slight increase) and central heating (slight decrease) and active smoking, the strongest determinant. Mean COHb levels were more than ten times greater in men smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day (3.29%) compared with non-smokers (0.32%); almost all subjects with COHb levels of 2.5% and above were smokers (93%). Pipe and cigar smoking was associated with more modest increases in COHb level. Passive cigarette smoking exposure had no independent association with COHb after adjustment for other factors. Active smoking accounted for 41% of variance in COHb level and all factors together for 47%. CONCLUSION: An appreciable proportion of men have COHb levels of 2.5% or more at which symptomatic effects may occur, though very high levels are uncommon. The results confirm that smoking (particularly cigarette smoking) is the dominant influence on COHb levels."
24373219,0,a,"BACKGROUND: People who identity as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) have specific health needs. Sexual orientation and gender identity are social determinants of health, as homophobia and heteronormativity persist as prejudices in society. LGBT patients often experience discrimination and prejudice in health care settings. While recent South African policies recognise the need for providing LGBT specific health care, no curricula for teaching about LGBT health related issues exist in South African health sciences faculties. This study aimed to determine the extent to which LGBT health related content is taught in the University of Cape Town's medical curriculum. METHODS: A curriculum mapping exercise was conducted through an online survey of all academic staff at the UCT health sciences faculty, determining LGBT health related content, pedagogical methodology and assessment. RESULTS: 127 academics, across 31 divisions and research units in the Faculty of Health Sciences, responded to the survey, of which 93 completed the questionnaire. Ten taught some content related to LGBT health in the MBChB curriculum. No LGBT health related content was taught in the allied health sciences curricula. The MBChB curriculum provided no opportunity for students to challenge their own attitudes towards LGBT patients, and key LGBT health topics such as safer sex, mental health, substance abuse and adolescent health were not addressed. CONCLUSION: At present, UCTs health sciences curricula do not adequately address LGBT specific health issues. Where LGBT health related content is taught in the MBChB curriculum, it is largely discretionary, unsystematic and not incorporated into the overarching structure. Coordinated initiatives to integrate LGBT health related content into all health sciences curricula should be supported, and follow an approach that challenges students to develop professional attitudes and behaviour concerning care for patients from LGBT backgrounds, as well as providing them with specific LGBT health knowledge. Educating health professions students on the health needs of LGBT people is essential to improving this population's health by providing competent and non-judgmental care."
28462813,0,a,"PURPOSE: Significant racial disparities and continuing poor birth outcomes make adolescent pregnancy a significant public health concern in the United States despite declining pregnancy rates. Social determinants of health are associated with increased likelihood of pregnancy and poor maternal and child health outcomes. This study aims to characterize specific elements of social determinants of health in a cohort of predominantly Latina adolescent mothers. METHODS: Between February 2007 and August 2008, 106 pregnant adolescents participated in a study with assessments at 20 to 24 weeks of gestation, and at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Survey questions addressed residential mobility, financial support and childcare, and perceived need for and use of community resources. Comparative analysis assessed differences between adolescents by age (<16 vs. >/=16 years old) and ethnicity (Latina vs. non-Latina). FINDINGS: Adolescent mothers experienced high rates of residential mobility, with 59.4% moving at least once in the year before their prenatal survey. Participants relied primarily on public aid (94-96%) and their parents (81-85%) for financial support. Latina participants were more likely than non-Latinas to rely on public aid. Although many participants reported needing financial support and housing, few used available services. Younger adolescents relied less often on the father of the baby for support than older adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent mothers' high rates of residential mobility and increasing reliance on public assistance highlight resource gaps that potentially put them and their children at risk for poor outcomes. Targeted efforts to augment systemic support in these domains are a critical component of addressing health disparities for this population."
30524986,0,a,"Background: Out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure directly impacts on poverty and household welfare, especially when there is a decline in healthcare financing. This study was aimed to describe the temporal pattern of OOP expenditures related to Iranian healthcare services during 1995-2014. Methods: For describing the trend of OOP spending in Iran, the database of the World Bank was mined for the period under study. Further, the trend analysis has been complemented by an exhaustive and comprehensive review of the extant literature. Results: From 1995 to 2014, out-of-pocket decreased from 53.59% to 47.8% of the total health expenditure, probably because of the different health reforms implemented throughout the years. However, out-of-pocket expenditure in Iran remains higher than the world average (roughly 3 times higher). Conclusion: It is an onus of the Iranian government to make serious attempts in order to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure, as well as to protect particularly poor and vulnerable subjects against catastrophic health expenditure. In order to ensure an equitable and affordable access to the healthcare system, decision- and policy-makers in Iran should implement a review of health care costs, insurance tariffs, and healthcare services packages covered by insurance organizations as well as introduce a progressive tax-based financing scheme as soon as possible."
18030822,1,a,"BACKGROUND: In 2006, the city of Milwaukee ranked worse than any Wisconsin county for health outcomes and worse than all but 1 county for health determinants. METHODS: To further examine disparities in health, Milwaukee city ZIP codes were stratified into 3 groups (lower, middle, and upper) by socioeconomic status (SES). Health determinants (15 measures) and health outcomes (2 measures) were compared across these ZIP code groups, and to the rest of Wisconsin. RESULTS: The risk ratio for the lower SES group in comparison to the upper SES group was at least 2.0 for 5 of the 17 measures examined, and was at least 1.5 for 13 of the 17 measures. The upper SES group in Milwaukee, while the healthiest in the city, was worse than the state average in 6 measures. CONCLUSIONS: Large health disparities within the city of Milwaukee are associated with geographic regions of differing socioeconomic status. As the state's largest urban center, Milwaukee's relatively poor health and significant health disparities have a considerable impact on the overall health of the state. To improve population health in Wisconsin, substantial efforts and resources are needed to address these disparities, and their related upstream factors."
30510896,0,a,"Through the application of science to public health practice, National Cancer Control Programmes provide the framework for the development of policies on cancer control, with the ultimate goal of reducing cancer morbidity and mortality, and improving quality of life. In the last decade, a substantial number of Member States in the European Union (EU) have formulated and/or updated their National Cancer Control Programmes, Plans or Strategies including primary prevention (health promotion and environmental protection), secondary prevention (screening and early detection), integrated care and organization of services, and palliative care as main elements. Although tobacco control and population-based screening policies are examples of best practices that are gradually being implemented in most of the EU countries, there are still large regional differences in cancer burden arising from the wide variety of social determinants and other epidemiological factors, along with gaps in the policy and practical articulation of cancer control within the health systems. On the other hand, few quantitative assessments are available with regard to evaluating the success or failure of the implementation of these programmes, especially in terms of reducing cancer incidence or mortality. An EU framework to better assess of the effectiveness of cancer prevention policies and the factors triggering shortfall in best practices implementation seems imperative."
24179279,0,a,"In Alameda County, California, significant health inequities by race/ethnicity, income, and place persist. Many of the county's low-income residents and residents of color live in communities that have faced historical and current disinvestment through public policies. This disinvestment affects community conditions such as access to economic opportunities, well-maintained and affordable housing, high-quality schools, healthy food, safe parks, and clean water and air. These community conditions greatly affect health. At the invitation of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies' national Place Matters initiative, Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson's Office and the Alameda County Public Health Department launched Alameda County Place Matters, an initiative that addresses community conditions through local policy change. We describe the initiative's creation, activities, policy successes, and best practices."
19923665,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Intersectoral action is now widely recognized as an effective approach to addressing the social determinants of health. In particular, collaboration between different sectors of the community has been recommended as a strategy for developing employment opportunities for persons diagnosed with mental illness. However, there is limited evidence on the actual implementation of intersectoral action between the employment and mental health sector. METHODS: Case study methodology was utilized to examine a unique partnership formed under the principles of public health and local development to create a social enterprise. Stakeholders representing organizations from several sectors of the community, including health and employment, partnered to develop work opportunities for a population that is disadvantaged from the mainstream employment market including (but not exclusive to) persons diagnosed with mental illness. The three main methods of inquiry were: semistructured interviews, participant observation and collected documentation. FINDINGS: Stakeholders experienced several kinds of challenges during the implementation process and used different strategies to manage these challenges. The findings suggest barriers and facilitators to successful intersectoral action initiatives, some of which are directly applicable to the context of employment and mental illness. CONCLUSION: Several lessons are drawn from these experiences."
10896759,1,a,"The aim of this research was to compare the effects of tailored or general nutrition messages on individuals' food knowledge, food consumption, and fiber intake. Past research in the area of food choice has applied the Theory of Reasoned Action or the Theory of Planned Behavior to identify the determinants of choice. Neither theory, however, is structured to allow the researcher to examine a person's attitudes toward a wide range of foods and then to specify which food(s) from among the set of foods to include in a nutrition message. In contrast, the Behavioral Alternatives Model (BAM) allows the researcher to examine attitudes toward behavioral alternatives (i.e. foods) and to identify which foods are most likely to be selected from among a set of foods. We used the BAM to specify the foods to include in a tailored nutrition message. The results indicated that respondents who received a tailored message derived from the BAM had more food-related knowledge and dietary changes in the recommended direction than the respondents who received a general message."
18415929,1,a,"Unplanned and premature discharge from in-patient alcohol or drug detoxification is a common and severe problem in the treatment of substance abuse. So far, most of the relevant studies focused on drug detoxification, whereas only few studies also investigated alcohol detoxification. The aim of the present study was to comparatively identify and analyse determinants of unplanned discharge during in-patient treatment in both diagnostic groups which simultaneously underwent detoxification under the same treatment setting. Subjects were 239 consecutive admissions (alcohol: n = 90; illegal drugs: n = 149) to a specialised qualified detoxification unit at the Psychiatric University Hospital of Heidelberg during the year 2000. Data on sociodemographical and psychosocial variables, medical history, psychopathological findings on admission and presence of psychiatric and/or somatic comorbidity as well as intensity level of withdrawal symptoms were collected retrospectively and analysed with respect to the prediction of planned/unplanned discharge. The high overall rates of unplanned discharge (alcohol: 43.3 % and drugs 62.4 %) confirm the previously reported figures. Treatment success of drug patients was rather affected by sociodemographical and psychosocial factors such as level of education, delinquency, unemployment and hepatitis C diagnosis. Relating to alcohol patients psychopathological findings on admission including orientation, affective state and cognition were most relevant for planned discharge. Furthermore, the results of this study underline the central role of motivation during in-patient treatment as well as the importance of a planned treatment continuation after discharge from the detoxification program."
17020784,1,a,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) play a key role in identifying and managing patients with suicidal tendencies. Few studies, however, examine both GP and patient characteristics and GP practices associated with suicide assessment. This article aims to evaluate 1) GPs' success in early identification of suicidal ideation (SI) in patients starting antidepressant or anxiolytic treatment, and 2) patient- and GP-related factors associated with this success. METHODS: Survey of 144 GPs practising in southeastern France and of consecutive adults consulting them during June-October 2004 and prescribed antidepressant or anxiolytic treatment. Data were collected from GPs (consultation-questionnaires focusing on their prescription, diagnosis and detection of SI) and patients (self-administered questionnaires including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and social and demographic characteristics). We used multilevel logistic regression to analyse factors associated with SI detection. RESULTS: GPs completed consultation-questionnaires for 713 patients, 405 of whom completed self-administered questionnaires. Eighty-nine patients (22%) reported SI; in 43 cases (48%) SI had not been detected by the GP. GPs detected SI more frequently when they had completed continuing medical education about depression, when patients had higher depressive symptom scores, and when consultations were relatively long. LIMITATIONS: Study limited to patients receiving initial prescriptions for antidepressants or anxiolytics. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of undetected SI in this study population was high. Additional training of GPs increases the chances of detecting SI. Medical training and continuing medical education should include better instruction about SI risk factors and diagnosis, including non-major depressions, and stress that screening requires sufficient consultation time."
22694988,0,a,"Perceived discrimination has been shown to be associated with health. However, it is uncertain whether discrimination based on geographical place of residence (geographically-based discrimination), such as Buraku or Nishinari discrimination in Japan, is associated with health. We conducted a cross-sectional study (response rate = 52.3%) from February to March 2009 in a Buraku district of Nishinari ward in Osaka city, one of the most deprived areas in Japan. We implemented sex-stratified and education-stratified multivariate regression models to examine the association between geographically-based discrimination and two mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms and diagnosis of mental illness) with adjustment for age, socioeconomic status, social relationships and lifestyle factors. A total of 1994 persons aged 25-79 years (928 men and 1066 women) living in the district were analyzed. In the fully-adjusted model, perceived geographically-based discrimination was significantly associated with depressive symptoms and diagnosis of mental illness. It was more strongly associated among men or highly educated people than among women or among less educated people. The effect of geographically-based discrimination on mental health is independent of socioeconomic status, social relationship and lifestyle factors. Geographically-based discrimination may be one of the social determinants of mental health."
19771953,1,a,"This study addresses recent public health policies in Norway, asking how policies on health inequalities have developed over the past 20 years. The authors focus on how the problem has been defined, what goals have been set, and what means have been put forward to achieve them. The data consist of official documents and interviews of key actors in research and the health bureaucracy. The results indicate that the theme of health inequalities has developed from a non-topic to a high-priority topic in Norway's public health policy. This change has been accompanied by formulation of clear goals and an overarching and long-term strategy, including concrete means to reduce health inequalities. Over the past five years, the problem definition has changed from one of individualization with a focus on health behaviors to a structural understanding that emphasizes the problem of the gradient and social determinants of health. Norway is on the move from a state of political indifference toward action in developing comprehensive, coordinating policy."
11818587,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinants of mental health among severe hearing-impaired adults in the Netherlands, separately by prelingual and postlingual age of onset. METHODS: Five hundred twenty-three face-to-face interviews were carried out by persons with practical skills in communication with hearing-impaired people. RESULTS: Of prelingually and postlingually deaf men, 27.1% and 27.7%, respectively, reported mental distress (scores on the General Health Questionnaire > or = 2), and among women these figures were 32.4% and 43.2%. These rates are higher than in the general population (men: 22.0%; women: 26.6%). Among the prelingual category, none of the demographic or hearing loss-related characteristics was associated with mental health status as measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Of these variables, only additional impairment or serious illness was associated with the brief Symptom Checklist (SCL-8D). Among the postlingual category, female gender and equilibrium disturbance was associated with both the GHQ and SCL-8D, and additional impairment or serious illness with the SCL-8D. For both categories, the risk of mental distress also was higher in those with more communication problems, lower levels of self-esteem, and poorer acceptance of the hearing loss. Opportunities for identification in youth and social support were not associated with mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health status differs between the hearing-impaired and the general population, but not as much as is sometimes suggested. Mental distress is greater in those in certain categories of the hearing-impaired."
12481209,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: The Russian mortality crisis of the early 1990s attracted considerable attention, but information on possible covariates of mortality is lacking, and concerns have been raised about the validity of official mortality data. To help elucidate the determinants of mortality, we examined whether indirect demographic techniques could be used to study mortality in countries such as the Russian Federation, where mortality data are inadequate, using input data independent from official vital statistics. METHODS: A national sample of the population was interviewed (n = 1600, response rate = 67%). Participants who had ever been married (82% of the sample) were asked about the date of birth and vital status of their first spouse. Spousal mortality was then estimated indirectly for the 531 men and 710 women for whom valid data were available. FINDINGS: The estimated risk of death between the ages of 35-69 years was 57% for male spouses and 17% for female spouses. Corresponding figures derived from national data for 1990 were 52% and 25% for the Russian Federation, and 31% and 20% for the United Kingdom. According to spouses' reports, 38% of their husbands died from cardiovascular disease, 22% from cancer, and 14% from injuries and accidents. Mortality of male spouses was inversely related to the education level of their wives, and the age-adjusted hazard ratios for death from all causes, compared to primary education, were 0.77 for secondary education and 0.57 for university education (trend P = 0.03). Mortality was also inversely related to ownership of household items, but not to size of settlement, pride in Russia, membership in the Soviet Communist Party, nationality or self-assessed social status. CONCLUSIONS: Although the indirect estimates were imprecise (partly owing to the small population size of the study), and mortality in women was probably underestimated (owing to many factors, including poorer reporting by males and high male mortality), our results are nevertheless consistent with the mortality pattern observed in official mortality data. The indirect technique thus appears to be a useful tool to study the determinants of mortality in the Russian Federation and other populations, where reliable or sufficiently extensive data are not available."
11018394,1,a,"PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between social class factors and squamous cell esophageal cancer and the extent to which alcohol, tobacco, diet, and social class contribute to the five-fold higher incidence among black than white men in the United States.METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 347 incident cases of squamous cell esophageal cancer (119 white males and 228 black males) and 1354 population-based controls (743 white males and 611 black males) from Atlanta, Detroit, and New Jersey. Risks were estimated using unconditional logistic regression controlling for potential confounders.RESULTS: Elevated risks of squamous cell esophageal cancer were associated with indicators of low social class, especially low annual income. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for subjects with incomes < $10,000 versus incomes of $25,000 or more were 4.3 (95% CI = 2.1-8.7) for whites and 8.0 (95% CI = 4.3-15.0) for blacks. The combination of all four major risk factors: annual income less than $25,000, moderate/heavy use of alcohol, use of tobacco for six months or longer, and consumption of less than 2.5 servings of raw fruits and vegetables per day accounted for almost all of the squamous cell esophageal cancers in whites (98%) and blacks (99%), and for 99% of the excess incidence among black men.CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle modifications, especially a lower intake of alcoholic beverages, would markedly decrease the incidence of this cancer in both races and narrow the racial disparity in risk. Further studies into the determinants of social class may help identify a new set of exposures for this tumor that are amendable to intervention."
18194525,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Considering the high costs of sick leave and the consequences of sick leave for employees, an early return-to-work of employees with mental disorders is very important. Therefore, a workplace intervention is developed based on a successful return-to-work intervention for employees with low back pain. The objective of this paper is to present the design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the workplace intervention compared with usual care for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. METHODS: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with a follow-up of one year. Employees eligible for this study are on sick leave for 2 to 8 weeks with common mental disorders. The workplace intervention will be compared with usual care. The workplace intervention is a stepwise approach that aims to reach consensus about a return-to-work plan by active participation and strong commitment of both the sick-listed employee and the supervisor. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome of this study is lasting return-to-work, which will be acquired from continuous registration systems of the companies after the follow-up. Secondary outcomes are total number of days of sick leave during the follow-up, severity of common mental disorders, coping style, job content, and attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy determinants. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from the societal perspective. A process evaluation will also be conducted. DISCUSSION: Return-to-work is difficult to discuss in the workplace for sick-listed employees with mental disorders and their supervisors. Therefore, this intervention offers a unique opportunity for the sick-listed employee and the supervisor to discuss barriers for return-to-work. Results of this study will possibly contribute to improvement of disability management for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. Results will become available in 2009. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN92307123."
23804585,0,a,"AIM: Response to stress can vary greatly between individuals. However, it remains unknown whether perceived impact of stress on health is associated with adverse health outcomes. We examined whether individuals who report that stress adversely affects their health are at increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) compared with those who report that stress has no adverse health impact. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analyses are based on 7268 men and women (mean age: 49.5 years, interquartile range: 11 years) from the British Whitehall II cohort study. Over 18 years of follow-up, there were 352 coronary deaths or first non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) events. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, participants who reported at baseline that stress has affected their health 'a lot or extremely' had a 2.12 times higher (95% CI 1.52-2.98) risk of coronary death or incident non-fatal MI when compared with those who reported no effect of stress on their health. This association was attenuated but remained statistically significant after adjustment for biological, behavioural, and other psychological risk factors including perceived stress levels, and measures of social support; fully adjusted hazard ratio: 1.49 (95% CI 1.01-2.22). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort study, the perception that stress affects health, different from perceived stress levels, was associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether disease risk can be reduced by increasing clinical attention to those who complain that stress greatly affects their health."
29439740,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Inequality in life expectancy (ILE) is defined as inequality in the distribution of expected span of life-based on data from survival tables estimated using the Atkinson inequality index. ILE can be influenced by socio-ecological indicators including the Gini coefficient, secondary education, output per worker, and old age pension. This study examined the effects on ILE from a social ecology perspective. METHODS: This analysis is based on ILE data from 108 countries obtained from the United Nations Development Programme. Data on socio-ecological indicators were obtained from the United Nations database. The associations between socio-ecological indicators and ILE were assessed using correlation coefficients and multiple regression models. RESULTS: Significant correlations were evident between ILE and the following indicators from a socio-ecological perspective: Gini coefficient (GC: r = 0.335, p = 0.001) as an indicator of income inequality, female population with at least some secondary education (FSE: r = - 0.757, p = 0.001), male population with at least some secondary education (MSE: r = - 0.741, p = 0.001), output per worker as a measure of labor productivity (OPW: r = - 0.714, p = 0.001), and number of old age pension recipients (OPR: r = - 0.641, p = 0.001). In multivariate regression, the ILE predictors were higher GC and lower levels of FSE, MSE, OPW, and OPR (R(2) = 0.648, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Socio-ecological factors have an important effect on ILE. Policies that address ILE should consider targeted socio-ecological factors, such as the Gini coefficient of income inequality, that give a personal perspective of economic deprivation, attainment of at least a secondary education by both females and males that gives a social environment perspective, output per worker that indicates labor productivity, and the number of old age pension recipients that indicates social security from a public policy perspective."
26791057,0,a,"BACKGROUND: ""Gender"" reflects social norms for women and men, whereas ""sex"" defines biological characteristics. Gender-related characteristics explain some differences in access to care for premature acute coronary syndrome (ACS); whether they are associated with cardiovascular outcomes is unknown. OBJECTIVES: This study estimated associations between gender and sex with recurrent ACS and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (e.g., ACS, cardiac mortality, revascularization) over 12 months in patients with ACS. METHODS: We studied 273 women and 636 men age 18 to 55 years from GENESIS-PRAXY (GENdEr and Sex determInantS of cardiovascular disease: from bench to beyond-Premature Acute Coronary SYndrome), a prospective observational cohort study, who were hospitalized for ACS between January 2009 and April 2013. Gender-related characteristics (e.g., social roles) were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire, and a composite measure of gender was derived. Outcomes included recurrent ACS and MACE over 12 months. RESULTS: Feminine roles and personality traits were associated with higher rates of recurrent ACS and MACE compared with masculine characteristics. This difference persisted for recurrent ACS, after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio from score 0 to 100: 4.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 19.27), and was a nonstatistically significant trend for MACE (hazard ratio: 1.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.90 to 2.66). A possible explanation is increased anxiety, the only condition that was more prevalent in patients with feminine characteristics and that rendered the association between gender and recurrent ACS nonstatistically significant (hazard ratio: 3.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.81 to 15.61). Female sex was not associated with outcomes post-ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Younger adults with ACS with feminine gender are at an increased risk of recurrent ACS over 12 months, independent of female sex."
23173332,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Self-rated health is a one-point measure commonly used for recognising subjectively perceived health and covering a wide range of individual's health aspects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to examine the extent to which self-rated health reflects the differences due to demographic characteristics, physical, psychical and social well-being, health disorders, occurrence of chronic disease and negative life events in Polish social and cultural conditions. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data were collected by non-addressed questionnaire methods from 402 Warsaw inhabitants. The questionnaire contained the questions concerning self-rated health, physical, psychical and social well-being, the use of health care services, occurrence of chronic disease and contact with negative life events. RESULTS: The analysis showed that worse self-rated health increased exponentially with age and less sharply with lower level of education. Pensioners were more likely to assess their own health worse then employed or students. Such difference was not found for unemployed. Compared to married, the self-rated health of divorced or widowed respondents was lower. Gender does not differentiate self-rated health. In regard to well-being, self-rated health linearly decreased for physical well-being, for social and, especially, for psychical well-being the differences were significant, but more complicated. Hospitalisation, especially repeated, strongly determined worse self-rated health. In contrast, relationship between self-rated health and sickness absence or frequency of contact with physician were lower. Chronic diseases substantially increased the risk of poorer self-rated health, and their co-morbidity increased the risk exponentially. The patients with cancer were the group, in which the risk several times exceeded that reported for the patients of other diseases. Regarding negative life events, only experience with violence and financial difficulties were resulted in worse self-rated health. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed the usefulness of self-rated health for public health research."
15081207,1,a,"Gender-based inequalities in health have been frequently documented. This paper examines the extent to which these inequalities reflect the different social experiences and conditions of men's and women's lives. We address four specific questions. Are there gender differences in mental and physical health? What is the relative importance of the structural, behavioural and psychosocial determinants of health? Are the gender differences in health attributable to the differing structural (socio-economic, age, social support, family arrangement) context in which women and men live, and to their differential exposure to lifestyle (smoking, drinking, exercise, diet) and psychosocial (critical life events, stress, psychological resources) factors? Are gender differences in health also attributable to gender differences in vulnerability to these structural, behavioural and psychosocial determinants of health? Multivariate analyses of Canadian National Population Health Survey data show gender differences in health (measured by self-rated health, functional health, chronic illness and distress). Social structural and psychosocial determinants of health are generally more important for women and behavioural determinants are generally more important for men. Gender differences in exposure to these forces contribute to inequalities in health between men and women, however, statistically significant inequalities remain after controlling for exposure. Gender-based health inequalities are further explained by differential vulnerabilities to social forces between men and women. Our findings suggest the value of models that include a wide range of health and health-determinant variables, and affirm the importance of looking more closely at gender differences in health."
27210851,0,a,"Strengthening training (ST) and whole body vibration training (WBV) alone may improve symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. In this study, we investigated the effect of adding WBV training to quadriceps and hamstring muscles strengthening training on functional activity, pain, quality of life and muscle strength in patients with knee osteoarthritis. 28 volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups; 1) quadriceps and hamstring muscles strengthening training (ST group, 13 patients) and 2) quadriceps and hamstring muscles strengthening training along with WBV training (ST + WBV group, 15 patients). The treatment protocol for both groups involved 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks. All measurements were performed before and after intervention. The measurements included: pain by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS), quality of life by means of the WOMAC scale, functional activity by the 2 min walking test (2MWT), time up & go test (TUGT) and 50-foot walking test (50FWT) and the muscle peak torque (MPT), total work (TW) and muscle power (MP) as muscle performance of quadriceps and hamstring muscles by an Isokinetic Biodex machine. After intervention, the comparison of mean changes between two groups showed improvement in the WBV + ST group in terms of 2MWT, MPT, TW and MP variables (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the experimental groups in term of pain, quality of life, TUGT and 50FWT. These results suggest that adding whole body vibration training to strengthening training may provide better treatment effects for patients with knee osteoarthritis."
26157562,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Considering the importance of anger, aggression, violence and other misbehaviours in schoolchildren education, the present study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge and practice of students in Isfahan province regarding violence, in order to figure out the required interventions for violence-reduction. METHODS: In a survey during 2008-2009, 5500 junior and senior high school students of Isfahan province were assessed in a multistage sampling process to determine their level of knowledge about various types of violent behaviors, causes of violence, its consequences, and preventive behaviors. Validity and reliability of the data collection tool (questionnaire) were assessed. RESULTS: The study revealed that the mean scores of violent behaviors knowledge, knowledge of violent behavior outcomes, and knowledge of violence preventive behaviors, were 6.6 +/- 2.1, 5.5 +/- 1.9, and 4.7 +/- 1.3, respectively. Sources of violent behaviors in 92% of urban students and 89% of rural students were personal reasons and family behaviors, and 85% of urban and 88% of rural students considered mass media and computer games blameworthy, and the differences were statistically significant in all cases (P < 0.0001). In terms of practice, overall, 69.7% of girls and 84.2% of boys had violent behaviors. Physical and verbal violence were 31.3% and 40.7%in girls, and 66% and 52.8% in boys, respectively (intersexes P values were P < 0.001 and P = 0.7 respectively, and intra-sex P value was P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that girls and city dwellers were more aware of recognizing violent behaviors, outcomes, and causes, compared with boys and villagers, and in terms of general practice, violence was observed among boys more than girls. Further complementary studies in this area seem required."
28583955,0,a,"Life expectancy and disease rates in the United States differ starkly among Americans depending on their demographic characteristics and where they live. Although health care systems are taking important steps to reduce inequities, meaningful progress requires interventions outside the clinic, in sectors such as employment, housing, transportation, and public safety. Inequities exist in each of these sectors, and barriers to educational attainment, higher-income jobs, and social mobility limit the opportunity of disadvantaged people to improve their circumstances. Financial institutions and other stakeholders are investing in cross-sector collaborations to remove these barriers and thereby strengthen local economies and population health. Meanwhile, recent trends suggest the need to widen the lens on health equity, to include not only the low-income residents of inner-city neighborhoods but also people in economically marginalized rural communities. Widening income inequality and stagnant wages, and their alarming health consequences, underscore the need for policies to help low-income and middle-class families and improve educational opportunities for their children."
18787497,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine patient-perceived communication styles (empathic and dominant communication styles) of Korean physicians in rehabilitation and their effects on patient outcomes (patient satisfaction and compliance). DESIGN: A total of 150 rehabilitation patients from a large university hospital in Korea were interviewed with a 26 item-questionnaire. RESULTS: Only 30% of the patients considered their physicians as highly affective whereas about 55% of them viewed their doctors as highly dominant. Physicians' affective and cognitive empathic communication styles were significantly and positively correlated with both patient satisfaction and compliance. Correlation analysis showed that physicians' dominant communication style was significantly but negatively related to patient satisfaction. However, compliance, cross-tabulation, and regression analyses suggested that physicians' dominant communication style may not be a good predictor of patient satisfaction and compliance. Those patients who perceived their physicians as highly affective or highly cognitive showed the highest rates of being completely satisfied, whereas none of those patients who ranked their physicians as least affective or least cognitive said that they were completely satisfied. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the existing findings in the West that physician's communication styles were major determinants of the patient outcomes. Patients' highly negative view of their physicians' dominant communication style might raise some concerns about Korean physicians' authoritarian attitudes toward their patients."
17958280,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the self reported prevalence of suicidal ideation in South Australia and to examine the relationship of suicidal ideation with a range of risk, social and demographic factors and related health issues using data collected in a risk factor surveillance system. METHOD: Data were collected using a monthly risk factor surveillance system where each month a representative random sample of South Australian is selected from the Electronic White Pages with interviews conducted using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). RESULTS: In total, 4.7% of South Australian, aged 16 years and over, were determined to have suicidal ideation. There was no change in the trend over the years when surveys between 1997 and 2005 were compared. A wide range of variables were significant with suicidal ideation at the univariate level. In the final multivariate model, marital status, money situation, psychosocial stress (K10), physical activity, fruit consumption, health service use and mental health service use proved to be best joint predictors of suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Suicidal ideation in the community has not increased (or decreased) over time and questions assessing suicidal ideation can be used effectively in a surveillance system."
16797813,1,a,"Aspects of the social environment, including social conditions (socio-economic status, household situations, chronic illnesses) and social relations (attitude and behaviors of relations) are major determinants of depression among women. This study evaluates the relative power of social relations and social conditions in predicting depression among pregnant women in Pakistan. In the qualitative phase of the study, social environmental determinants were identified through literature search, and experts' opinions from psychologists, psychiatrists, gynecologists, sociologists and researchers. Along with this, 79 in-depth interviews were conducted with pregnant women drawn from six hospitals (public and private) and two communities in Karachi, Pakistan. Identified determinants of depression were grouped into themes of social conditions and social relations and pregnancy-related concerns. In the study's quantitative phase, the relative power of the identified themes and categories, based on their scores for predicting depression (determined by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D scale)), was determined through multivariate linear regression. Social environmental determinants of pregnant women were described under the themes and categories of (1) social relations: involving husband, in-laws and children; (2) social conditions: involving the economy, illness, life events, household work, environmental circumstances and social problems; and (3) pregnancy-related concerns i.e. symptoms of pregnancy, changes during pregnancy, dependency and concern for unborn baby. Multivariate analysis found that among these themes, social relations and pregnancy-related concerns were significantly associated with total CES-D scores. Among the categories besides increasing age and less education, husband, in-laws, household work and pregnancy symptoms were significantly associated with total CES-D scores. The study highlights the importance of social relations compared to social conditions for determining depression in pregnant women."
10951443,1,a,"We have examined fatigue in myasthenia gravis (MG) by administering a measure of cognitive and physical fatigue to patients and control subjects before and after administration of a lengthy cognitive battery. Subjects also completed a scale that assessed the impact of fatigue on physical, social, and cognitive function. Results of the study revealed that MG patients experience significantly more cognitive and physical fatigue than do control subjects, and the patients' perceptions of both cognitive and physical fatigue increased significantly following completion of demanding cognitive work. Control subjects reported no significant change in fatigue. Furthermore, MG patients reported that fatigue produced mild to moderate effects on cognitive and social function and moderate effects on physical function. Results from this study indicate that cognitive fatigue is an important symptom of MG and that fatigue produces pervasive impairments in important aspects of patients' lives. Additional studies are needed to understand the neurobehavioral determinants of cognitive fatigue in this population."
15006238,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: There is concern about whether public services in Northern Ireland are equitably targeted across the religious divide. This study investigates whether use of acute hospital inpatient services differs by religious denomination, after adjusting for supply and for identified demographic, morbidity and socio-economic determinants of need for such services. METHODS: Hospital utilisation at small area level was modelled against a wide range of potential health and socioeconomic factors. Spatial interactive modelling was used to estimate the effect of supply of hospital beds and other facilities on hospital utilisation. Two-stage weighted least-squares regression was used to model utilisation against need and supply. RESULTS: There was a clear positive relationship between the proportion of Roman Catholics in a ward and both need for and utilisation of inpatient services. The higher levels of relative utilisation in wards with a greater proportion of Catholics persisted after controlling for needs but not when supply variables were also entered in the regression equation. The surviving needs drivers were: uptake levels of 'income maintenance' benefits, all-ages standardised mortality ratio, low birth weight and elderly people living alone. Most of these indicators of need are positively correlated with proportion of Catholics. CONCLUSIONS: When both need and supply factors are taken into account, there appears to be no significant effect of religion on inpatient hospital use in Northern Ireland. Efforts to ensure socio-economic equity between the two communities should focus on ensuring that hospital rationalisation does not lead to disadvantage and on reducing socio-economic differentials between the Catholic and Protestant communities."
26729882,0,a,"Two decades of research indicate causal associations between social relationships and mortality, but important questions remain as to how social relationships affect health, when effects emerge, and how long they last. Drawing on data from four nationally representative longitudinal samples of the US population, we implemented an innovative life course design to assess the prospective association of both structural and functional dimensions of social relationships (social integration, social support, and social strain) with objectively measured biomarkers of physical health (C-reactive protein, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and body mass index) within each life stage, including adolescence and young, middle, and late adulthood, and compare such associations across life stages. We found that a higher degree of social integration was associated with lower risk of physiological dysregulation in a dose-response manner in both early and later life. Conversely, lack of social connections was associated with vastly elevated risk in specific life stages. For example, social isolation increased the risk of inflammation by the same magnitude as physical inactivity in adolescence, and the effect of social isolation on hypertension exceeded that of clinical risk factors such as diabetes in old age. Analyses of multiple dimensions of social relationships within multiple samples across the life course produced consistent and robust associations with health. Physiological impacts of structural and functional dimensions of social relationships emerge uniquely in adolescence and midlife and persist into old age."
19306200,1,a,"Cancer is primarily a chronic disease of older adults that must be managed and incorporated into everyday activities. Online sites are important sources of health care information and support. Health literacy is necessary for full utilisation of online resources. The objective of this study was to examine and compare cancer related conversations in online forums hosted by Canadian and American associations for retired persons. A content analysis was used to evaluate archived cancer conversations of general-health online forums representing two leading North American associations for retired persons. There were 125/1817 (6.8%) Canadians and 70/892 (7.8%) US cancer discussions among participants in 2006. Online conversations were grouped into three categories: request for information, provision of information and sharing of information. Important subthemes included cancer prevention and screening, treatment and cancer care and health system issues. There were significantly more posts about provision of cancer information from the Canadian compared with the US site (p = 0.023). American more than Canadian conversations emphasised the health system concerns as determinants of cancer care practices. Online discussion forums hosted by retirement associations may serve as an important channel in information dissemination about cancer prevention and screening, treatment and care support and health care advice for seniors."
30720625,0,a,"CONTEXT: Despite a growing consensus in public health to address health inequities and leverage social determinants of health (SDoH), the level of public health practitioners' readiness to become the agents of change in promoting health equity and shaping SDoH is not well researched. OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) the level of public health agency employees' perceived desirability for impacting health equity and SDoH, and (2) the impact of employee characteristics such as a (PH WINS) public health degree and awareness of health in all policies on such desirability. METHODS: Data from the 2017 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey were used in examining the sense of desirability among agency employees for affecting health equity and SDoH in the agency jurisdictions. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of health agency employees believed that their agencies should be very involved in affecting health equity in their jurisdictions. Fairly smaller proportions of employees believed in the desirability of affecting SDoH, and the proportions who believed that the agency should be very involved in affecting specific SDoH were 17.8% for affecting the quality of transportation, 18.5% for affecting the economy, 22.2% for quality of housing, 22.4% for quality of the built environment, 25.4% for K-12 education system, and 34.5% for impacting the quality of social support systems. Agency employees without a public health degree had significantly lower odds (P < .05) of believing that the agency should be very involved in affecting health equity. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing efforts to reduce health inequities and leverage SDoH for improved population health, gaps exist in the public health workforce's perceived desirability for their agencies to be involved in such efforts. These gaps exist among employees regardless of their demographic characteristics, length of tenure, or agency setting. Policy and practice initiatives aimed to improve health equity might benefit from our findings positing a need for education regarding SDoH and health equity. Our study findings imply the need for interventions for improving alignment between employee beliefs and organizational priorities for an effective transformation to Public Health 3.0. Fostering cross-sector partnerships with a focus on Health in All Policies (HiAP), SDoH, and health equity must be a high priority for public health agencies, which can be formalized through organizational strategic plans."
30670400,0,a,"As a result of a large and compelling body of evidence documenting the impacts of social determinants, such as income and education, on health outcomes, health care systems are beginning to incorporate social and economic risk data into health care delivery decisions. But there is a risk that some of these efforts could worsen health and widen health inequities. We highlight 3 examples- including recent policy changes in Medicaid, social needs, informed risk prediction models, and advances in precision medicine-where the inclusion of social risk information threatens to reduce care quality or health care access for some groups of patients. A new dialog is needed about both the opportunities and potential consequences of bringing information about patients' social circumstances into a market-based health care system."
18266845,1,a,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of self-efficacy on depression and to consider the mediating effect of self-care behaviour. BACKGROUND: Depression is a problem for kidney transplant recipients and can compromise their quality of life. From other studies on chronic illnesses, self-efficacy and self-care behaviour have been considered to be potential determinants for depressive symptoms. However, none of these previous studies have investigated the relationships among these variables in kidney transplantation recipients. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey employing correlation design and purposive sampling was used. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven persons who had received a kidney transplant participated. A self-administrated questionnaire and a medical record audit were used to collect data. The data were analysed using correlation and hierarchical linear regression methods. RESULTS: The average score of depressive symptoms was 8.61 SD 7.64. Among the participants in the study, 32.8% had scores of depressive symptoms higher than 11 (indicating mild to severe symptoms of depression). Self-efficacy and self-care behaviour had direct negative effects on depressive symptoms. Self-care behaviour had partial mediating effect on the relationship between self-efficacy and depression. Total variance explained was 23%. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms are still a problem that need to be addressed among kidney transplantation patients. Patients who have higher self-efficacy and higher self-care behaviour will have lower depressive symptoms. Our results support that self-efficacy is the significant predictor of depressive symptoms. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Self-efficacy is a powerful and modifiable determinant of depressive symptoms. We should design interventions that focus not only on the skill aspects of self-care behaviour but also on those that have a strong connection with self-efficacy. We could incorporate the self-efficacy-enhanced strategies as proposed by social cognitive theory into the kidney transplantation care programme."
11299268,1,a,"An autosomal genomewide search for genes related to body composition and its changes after a 20-wk endurance-exercise training program has been completed in the HERITAGE Family Study. Phenotypes included body mass index (BMI), sum of eight skinfold thicknesses, fat mass (FM), fat-free mass, percent body fat (%Fat), and plasma leptin levels. A maximum of 364 sib-pairs from 99 Caucasian families was studied with the use of 344 markers with single-point and multipoint linkage analyses. Evidence of significant linkage was observed for changes in fat-free mass with the S100A and the insulin-like growth factor I genes (P = 0.0001). Suggestive evidence (2.0 < or = Lod < 3.0; 0.0001 < P < or = 0.001) was also observed for the changes in FM and %Fat at 1q31 and 18q21-q23, in %Fat with the uncoupling protein 2 and 3 genes, and in BMI at 5q14-q21. At baseline, suggestive evidence was observed for BMI at 8q23-q24, 10p15, and 14q11; for FM at 14q11; and for plasma leptin levels with the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene. This is the first genomic scan on genes involved in exercise-training-induced changes in body composition that could provide information on the determinants of weight loss."
16326659,1,a,"PURPOSE: Healthful eating is important for optimal diabetes self-care. However, the level of food sufficiency may influence the degree of adherence to dietary self-care behaviors through the affordability of nutritionally appropriate food. This study examines whether homebound older adults with diabetes were at greater risk for heightened food insufficiency over 1 year, despite regular receipt of home-delivered meals. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a longitudinal study of a randomly recruited sample of 268 homebound older adults in the Nutrition and Function Study (NAFS) who regularly received home-delivered meals and completed baseline and 1-year in-home assessments. Based on an economic context model, self-reported data were collected on fundamental and proximate factors, food-sufficiency status, and intervening events. Determinants of heightened food insufficiency were examined with multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Not only did food-sufficiency status diminish over time in this sample, but it became or remained worse for older adults with diabetes. In addition to diabetes status, heightened food insufficiency was associated with perceived inadequacy of economic resources. IMPLICATIONS: Health care providers and nutrition programs should attempt to identify high-risk older adults - those who have diabetes and are at risk of food insufficiency - and develop community linkages and strategies that integrate nutrition with diabetes care plans, thus supporting a multidisciplinary, chronic care model to improve diabetes management and outcomes."
18799005,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This article aims to provide an introduction to emerging evidence and debate about the relationship between climate change and mental health. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The authors argue that:i) the direct impacts of climate change such as extreme weather events will have significant mental health implications;ii) climate change is already impacting on the social, economic and environmental determinants of mental health with the most severe consequences being felt by disadvantaged communities and populations; iii) understanding the full extent of the long term social and environmental challenges posed by climate change has the potential to create emotional distress and anxiety; and iv) understanding the psycho-social implications of climate change is also an important starting point for informed action to prevent dangerous climate change at individual, community and societal levels."
27614465,0,a,"Purpose The significant individual and societal burden of work disability could be reduced if supportive workplace strategies could be added to evidence-based clinical treatment and rehabilitation to improve return-to-work (RTW) and other disability outcomes. The goal of this article is to summarize existing research on workplace interventions to prevent disability, relate these to employer disability management practices, and recommend future research priorities. Methods The authors participated in a year-long collaboration that ultimately led to an invited 3-day conference, Improving Research of Employer Practices to Prevent Disability, held October 14-16, 2015, in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, USA. The collaboration included a topical review of the literature, group conference calls to identify key areas and challenges, drafting of initial documents, review of industry publications, and a conference presentation that included feedback from peer researchers and a question/answer session with an expert panel with direct employer experience. Results Evidence from randomized trials and other research designs has shown general support for job modification, RTW coordination, and organizational support, but evidence is still lacking for interventions at a more granular level. Grey literature reports focused mainly on job re-design and work organization. Panel feedback focused on organizational readiness and the beliefs and values of senior managers as critical factors in facilitating changes to disability management practices. While the scientific literature is focused on facilitating improved coping and reducing discomforts for individual workers, the employer-directed grey literature is focused on making group-level changes to policies and procedures. Conclusions Future research might better target employer practices by tying interventions to positive workplace influences and determinants, by developing more participatory interventions and research designs, and by designing interventions that address factors of organizational change."
18484442,1,a,"While imposing research has been conducted with respect to the biological determinants of painful menstruation, little is known about the psychosocial factors, including work-related stress that might influence menstrual pain. We conducted a study in which we aimed to determine besides the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea whether menstrual pain was associated with job control, co-worker social support, job security and dissatisfaction with the job. Data of 2772 working women aged 18-55 years, participants in the Hungarostudy 2002 nation-wide representative survey was analyzed. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between work stress factors and menstrual pain. Altogether 15.5% of women reported to experience menstrual pain that limits their daily activity. Low job control, low co-worker social support and low job security were found to be associated with a higher risk for menstrual pain even after controlling for the effect of age, educational attainment, parity status, smoking, body-mass index and treatment for gynecological problems. Job dissatisfaction was also related to dysmenorrhoea, albeit not significantly. The relationship between work-related psychosocial factors and painful menstruation deserves further investigation in order to determine the possible pathways of this association."
17457370,1,a,"Nutrition might induce, at some loci, epigenetic or other changes that could be transmitted to the next generation impacting on health. The slow growth period (SGP) before the prepubertal peak in growth velocity has emerged as a sensitive period where different food availability is followed by different transgenerational response (TGR). The aim of this study is to investigate to what extent the probands own childhood circumstances are in fact the determinants of the findings. In the analysis, data from three random samples, comprising 271 probands and their 1626 parents and grandparents, left after exclusions because of missing data, were utilized. The availability of food during any given year was classified based on regional statistics. The ancestors' SGP was set at the ages of 8-12 years and the availability of food during these years classified as good, intermediate or poor. The probands' childhood circumstances were defined by the father's ownership of land, the number of siblings and order in the sibship, the death of parents and the parents' level of literacy. An earlier finding of a sex-specific influence from the ancestors' nutrition during the SGP, going from the paternal grandmother to the female proband and from the paternal grandfather to the male proband, was confirmed. In addition, a response from father to son emerged when childhood social circumstances of the son were accounted for. Early social circumstances influenced longevity for the male proband. TGRs to ancestors' nutrition prevailed as the main influence on longevity."
28633689,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To apply the Theory of Planned Behaviour to examine the relationship between the constructs of background factors and beliefs towards using policy, systems and environmental (PSE) strategies and reported use of PSE strategies to prevent obesity by a group of professional nutrition educators. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using self-reported survey. SETTING: Cooperative Extension in New York, USA. SUBJECTS: Nutrition educators (n 58); survey response rate 100 %. RESULTS: Nutrition educators' reported use of PSE strategies to prevent obesity were positively associated with background factors of their community networking and number of staff they managed, their belief of other people's expectations of them to make PSE changes and the belief that their communities were ready to use PSE strategies; and negatively associated with their belief that individual-level factors contributed to obesity. The relationships among these variables were complicated and their use of PSE strategies occurred only when they utilized their professional networks at a moderately high level (above mean of 5.3 on a scale of 1-7), given that their community was also ready to use PSE strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition educators' use of PSE strategies depends on several internal and external factors. Community networking needs to be emphasized as one of the most significant factors contributing to nutrition educators' work in this area. Organizational and community support should be in place in order to facilitate nutrition educators' effective use of PSE strategies."
19346779,1,a,"Community-based approaches have been the mainstay of interventions to address the problem of child malnutrition in developing societies. Many programs have been in operation in several countries for decades and originated largely as social welfare, food security and poverty eradication programs. Increasingly conceptual frameworks to guide this activity have been developed as our understanding of the complex nature of the determinants of undernutrition improves. Alongside this evolution, is the accumulation of evidence on the types of interventions in the community that are effective, practical and sustainable. The changing environment is probably determining the altering scenario of child nutrition in developing societies, with rapid developmental transition and urbanization being responsible for the emerging problems of obesity and other metabolic disorders that are largely the result of the now well-recognized linkages between child undernutrition and early onset adult chronic diseases. This dramatic change is contributing to the double burden of malnutrition in developing countries. Community interventions hence need to be integrated and joined up to reduce both aspects of malnutrition in societies. The evidence that community-based nutrition interventions can have a positive impact on pregnancy outcomes and child undernutrition needs to be evaluated to enable programs to prioritize and incorporate the interventions that work in the community. Programs that are operational and successful also need to be evaluated and disseminated in order to enable countries to generate their own programs tailored to tackling the changing nutritional problems of the children in their society."
29795554,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Addressing factors leading to health disparities in the Circumpolar North require approaches that consider and address the social determinants of health including on-going colonization. Today, colonization and related policies and processes, continue to manifest in the marginalization of Indigenous knowledge, particularly its use in research; however, Indigenous populations have moved from being research subjects to leaders and consumers of environmental health research. Given the tensions that exist between how health research is conducted, how the results are mobilized, and who has control and access to the results, we examine how peer-reviewed environment-related Indigenous health research in the Circumpolar North is serving the needs of Indigenous communities, governments, and organizations. METHODS: A modified systematic-realist literature review was conducted. Three databases were searched for peer-reviewed literature published from 2000 to 2015. Articles were included if the research focused on the intersection of the environment and health in Northern Canada and/or Alaska. A total of 960 unique records were screened for relevance, and 210 articles were analysed. RESULTS: Of these relevant articles, 19% discussed how Indigenous peoples were engaged in the research. There was a significant increase in reporting participatory, community-based methods over time; the proportion of articles reporting community-engagement varied by research topic; quantitative research articles were significantly less likely to report community-engaged methods; and most articles did not clearly report how the results were shared with the community. CONCLUSION: The results raise a number of questions for the field of Circumpolar environment-related Indigenous health research, including whether or how authors of peer-reviewed literature should (or should not) be obliged to describe how research is serving Northern Indigenous communities. The results are intended to stimulate further conversations and bridge perceived dichotomies of quantitative/qualitative, Western/Indigenous, and empirical/community driven research approaches, as well as underlying assumptions that frame health research."
18561037,1,a,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the incidence and outcome of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Switzerland and to test the feasibility of a large cohort study with case identification in the first 24 hours and 6-month follow-up. METHODS: From January to June 2005, we consecutively enrolled and followed up all persons with severe TBI (Abbreviated Injury Score of the head region >3 and Glasgow Coma Scale <9) in the catchment areas of 3 Swiss medical centres with neurosurgical facilities. The primary outcome was the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) after 6 months. Secondary outcomes included survival, Functional Independence Mea - sure (FIM), and health-related quality of life (SF-12) at defined time-points up to 6 months after injury. RESULTS: We recruited 101 participants from a source population of about 2.47 million (ie, about 33% of Swiss population). The incidence of severe TBI was 8.2 per 100,000 person-years. The overall case fatality was 70%: 41 of 101 persons (41%) died at the scene of the accident. 23 of 60 hospitalised participants (38%) died within 48 hours, and 31 (53%) within 6 months. In all hospitalised patients, the median GOSE was 1 (range 1-8) after 6 months, and was 6 (2-8) in 6-month survivors. The median total FIM score was 125 (range 18-126); median-SF-12 component mea - sures were 44 (25-55) for the physical scale and 52 (32-65) for the mental scale. CONCLUSIONS: Severe TBI was associated with high case fatality and considerable morbidity in survivors. We demonstrated the feasibility of a multicentre cohort study in Switzerland with the aim of identifying modifiable determinants of outcome and improving current trauma care."
27729255,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of infant morbidity and mortality. Although major strides have been made in identifying risk factors for preterm birth, the complexities between social and individual risk factors are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the association between neighborhood youth violence and preterm birth. STUDY DESIGN: A 10-year live birth registry data set (2004 through 2013) from Richmond, VA, a mid-sized, racially diverse city, was analyzed (N = 27,519). Data were geocoded and merged with census tract and police report data. Gestational age at birth was classified as <32 weeks, 32-36 weeks, and term >/=37 weeks. Using police report data, youth violence rates were calculated for each census tract area and categorized into quartiles. Hierarchical models were examined fitting multilevel logistic regression models incorporating randomly distributed census tract-specific intercepts assuming a binary distribution and a logit link function. RESULTS: Nearly a fifth of all births occurred in areas with the highest quartiles of violence. After adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, paternal presence, parity, adequacy of prenatal care, pregnancy complications, history of preterm birth, insurance, and tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, census tracts with the highest level of violence had 38% higher odds of very preterm births (adjusted odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.80), than census tracts with the lowest level of violence. CONCLUSION: There is an association between high rate of youth violence and very preterm birth. Findings from this study may help inform future research to develop targeted interventions aimed at reducing community violence and very preterm birth in vulnerable populations."
18656859,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the umbilical cord blood lead levels (BLLs) of Pakistani neonates and to identify determinants for umbilical BLLs. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of mothers and infants at one of the two obstetric units of two tertiary care hospitals in Karachi during January-August 2005. Information from 540 mothers selected randomly from those registered for delivery was obtained about their pregnancy, diet, and current and past lead exposures. We collected umbilical cord blood for lead levels analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. We computed geometric and arithmetic means. We performed multiple linear regression analysis to identify factors associated with log-transformed umbilical cord BLLs. We also performed logistic regression analysis to identify determinants of high lead cord BLLs (10 microg/dl). RESULTS: The geometric mean cord BLL of the neonates was 9.6 microg/dl; arithmetic mean (S.D.) was 10.8 microg/dl (5.7) with a median of 9.7 microg/dl and a range of 1.8-48.9 microg/dl. Women who reported intake of less than 58.5mg of elemental iron supplement per day during pregnancy had cord BLL of 10.0 microg/dl; in comparison those women who had higher iron intake had lower cord BLL (8.4 microg/dl). Those who used surma (an eye cosmetic) daily had higher cord BLL (11.5 microg/dl) as compared to those who used it less frequently (9.4 microg/dl). In multivariable linear regression model, higher iron intake, owning a car, and being in 2nd quartile of mid-arm circumference were associated with low lead levels while father's occupation in lead-based industry was associated with significantly higher umbilical cord BLLs. There was interaction of daily surma use and ethnicity. Geometric mean BLLs were varied among surma users by ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical cord BLLs are high in Karachi, Pakistan, in comparison to those in developed countries such as United States. Measures are needed to reduce fetal lead exposure to prevent adverse affect on neurocognitive development. Association of low iron (below RDA of 60 mg per day) with high umbilical cord has implications for strengthening iron supplement intake during pregnancy. Umbilical cord BLLs differed among surma users by ethnicity."
23817536,0,a,"STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort. OBJECTIVES: To characterize spinal cord injury (SCI)-related pain and treatment in victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. SETTING: Mianzhu County, China. METHODS: Twenty-six patients who sustained SCI in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and who were treated in the same hospital were enrolled. Data was collected on pain severity with a visual analog scale, depression with Patient Health Questionnaire-9, quality of life (QoL) with World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF and social participation with the Craig Hospital Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique Short Form at three assessment points. Detailed pain descriptions including therapeutic interventions were elicited at the fourth assessment. Pain determinants were analyzed with a longitudinal Tobit regression, and Pearson's correlations of pain severity with depression, QoL and social participation stratified by measurement point were calculated. RESULTS: SCI-related pain was highly prevalent and prevalence of neuropathic pain was nearly twice that of nociceptive pain. Most patients reported pain since the onset and severity was not significantly reduced over time. Cervical injury, complete lesions and education level were significant pain determinants. Depression and QoL scores were highly correlated with pain at the first two assessments points but not at the third measurement. Most patients did not seek treatment because they regarded pain as either a normal condition after SCI or were afraid of drug dependency. CONCLUSION: This initial longitudinal assessment and characterization of SCI-related pain in earthquake victims provides a foundation for further exploration of the biological and psychosocial determinants of pain severity and of the correlation of chronic pain with other outcomes of interest in this population. Patient pain-treatment-seeking behavior and therapeutic interventions should be evaluated concurrently."
30016960,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged political instability may have exacerbated gender inequitable beliefs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The aim of this study was to assess attitudes related to gender-equitable norms and its determinants among young, church-going women and men in Kinshasa, DRC. METHOD: Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey with 291 church-going women and 289 men aged 18-24 years old, residing in three disadvantaged communes of Kinshasa. Variables included sociodemographic characteristics, attitudes towards gender equality, and responses to issues related to the gender-equitable men (GEM) scale. The GEM scale is a 24 item-questionnaire developed to measure attitudes towards gender equitable norms. Logistic regression was applied to discover the associations between the independent variables and the GEM outcome. RESULTS: Our study reflected the existence of attitudes hampering gender equality that were endorsed by both women and men. For example, 91.4% of women and 83% of men agreed with the statement ""a woman's most important role is to take care of her home and cook for her family"". Similarly, 88.3% of women and 82.9% of men concurred with the idea that men need more sex than women. These findings coexisted with a few equitable norms, because 93.7% of women and 92.3% of men agreed that a man and a woman should decide together if they want to have children. A positive association was found in both women and men between being educated, being single and separated and having supportive attitudes towards gender equality and a higher GEM scale score. Residency in Camp Luka and Masina was also a significant social determinant associated with equitable gender norms among men whilst job status was only significant among women. CONCLUSION: While both women and men had high levels of gender inequitable norms, those with more education, single, and with supportive attitudes to gender equality had high GEM scale scores. The results highlight an urgent need for the church to challenge and change gender norms among church youths."
31615454,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In low-income countries with poor coverage of healthcare services such as Mozambique, antenatal care serves as a vital tool for providing life-saving and cost-effective services for pregnant mothers. Nonetheless, many countries in Africa, including Mozambique, are struggling to attain an optimum level of antenatal care (at least 4 visits) utilisation among pregnant women. In the present study, we aimed to assess the sociodemographic and economic factors associated with antenatal care use in Mozambique. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the latest round of Mozambique Demographic and Health Survey (2011) on women aged 15-49 years (n = 7080) were analysed. The outcome measures were early and adequate antenatal visit and HIV tests during the last pregnancy. Data were analysed using descriptive and multivariate regression methods. The predictor variables included various demographic (e.g. age, parity), empowerment (e.g. type of employment, household wealth status) and sociocultural factors (e.g. ethnicity, religion). RESULTS: Of the 7080 women whose data was analyzed, 15.3 and 60.1% had early and adequate ANC visits respectively while 75.4% received HIV test during ANC visits. The odds of early ANC visits were higher [OR = 1.300, 95%CI = 1.062,1.592] among women in the rural areas compared with those in the urban areas. However, participants in rural areas had lower odds [OR = 0.788, 0.687,0.902] of receiving HIV tests during ANC visits. Women in the urban areas with secondary [OR = 1.296, 95%CI = 1.007,1.666] and higher [OR = 1.663, 95%CI = 1.052,2.628] education had higher odds of having early ANC visit. Those in the higher wealth quintiles also had significantly increased odds of using all three types of ANC indicators, particularly for rural women in the highest wealth quintile [OR = 4.776, 95%CI = 1.250,18.24]. Being within the higher wealth quintiles was found to significantly increase the odds of using all three types of ANC indicators, particularly women from rural areas with highest wealth quintile [OR = 4.776, 95%CI = 1.250,18.24]. CONCLUSION: About two-fifth of the women in Mozambique are not using adequate antenatal care and about and a quarter do not take HIV tests during pregnancy. The sources of low and unequal use of these vital health services might be rooted in women's socioeconomic status and cultural issues that require special policy and research attention."

26702552,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to engage wide-ranging stakeholders and develop consensus learning objectives for undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. METHODS: A UK-wide consultation garnered opinions of healthcare students, healthcare educators and other key stakeholders about environmental sustainability in medical education. The policy Delphi approach informed this study. Draft learning objectives were revised iteratively during three rounds of consultation: online questionnaire or telephone interview, face-to-face seminar and email consultation. RESULTS: Twelve draft learning objectives were developed based on review of relevant literature. In round one, 64 participants' median ratings of the learning objectives were 3.5 for relevance and 3.0 for feasibility on a Likert scale of one to four. Revisions were proposed, e.g. to highlight relevance to public health and professionalism. Thirty three participants attended round two. Conflicting opinions were explored. Added content areas included health benefits of sustainable behaviours. To enhance usability, restructuring provided three overarching learning objectives, each with subsidiary points. All participants from rounds one and two were contacted in round three, and no further edits were required. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first attempt to define consensus learning objectives for medical students about environmental sustainability. Allowing a wide range of stakeholders to comment on multiple iterations of the document stimulated their engagement with the issues raised and ownership of the resulting learning objectives."
31498010,0,a,"Studies that examined the impacts of inflammatory factors on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are very sparse. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and the risk of GDM. Pregnant women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and their gestational ages were below 10 weeks were recruited to this cohort study and were followed up until the 24-28 weeks of gestation. At the first pre-natal care visit blood samples were taken from all the pregnant women to investigate the serum concentration of CRP and fasting blood sugar. At 24-28 weeks of gestation, an oral glucose tolerance test was done to diagnose GDM as routine. About 5% of the women participating in the study were diagnosed as having GDM. There was a significant association between the increased serum concentration of CRP in the first trimester and the risk of GDM. The risk of GDM in women with the highest serum concentration of CRP is three times higher than that of women with the lowest serum concentration of CRP. Systemic inflammation can be associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Multiple studies have shown that chronic inflammation can increase the risk of developing type2 diabetes. There is incertitude as to the best attitude for screening and diagnosis of GDM. The studies were examined the impacts of inflammatory factors on GDM is very restricted. What do the results of this study add? CRP level measurement in the first trimester can be considered as a screening test. This is an easy and cost-effective test to make decision for performing oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The results of this study could give physicians and other health care providers the hint that increasing serum CRP levels in early pregnancy can be a risk factor for gestational diabetes."
15271082,1,a,"Behavioural interactions are often analysed in terms of their costs and benefits to the actors [Hamilton, (1964) J. Theor. Biol.7 1-16; Gadagkar, (1993) Trends Ecol. Evol.8 232-234; Foster et al., (2001) Ann. Zool. Fenn.38 229-238]. Using the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, we wish to distinguish between two possible determinants of interaction behaviour between conspecifics, namely kin-directed behaviour that reflects genetic distance between individuals, or, alternatively, interactions guided by a functional distance between individuals, specifically, with respect to disease susceptibility. We find no relationship between contact rate of individuals and the genetic distance of their respective colonies. Interestingly, we do find a significant negative correlation between contact rate and the distance between the two colonies in susceptibility to a spectrum of parasite strains. This cannot be explained by either of the a priori alternatives so we propose two further testable hypotheses to explain our results."
23415046,0,a,"Teams participating in QI collaboratives reportedly enhance innovative culture in long-term care, but we currently lack empirical evidence of the ability of such teams to enhance (determinants of) innovative culture over time. The objectives of our study are therefore to explore innovative cultures in QI teams over time and identify its determinants. The study included QI teams participating between 2006 and 2011 in a national Dutch quality program (Care for Better), using an adapted version of the Breakthrough Method. Each QI team member received a questionnaire by mail within one week after the second (2-3 months post-implementation of the collaborative = T0) and final conference (12 months post-implementation = T1). A total of 859 (out of 1161) respondents filled in the questionnaire at T0 and 541 at T1 (47% response). A total of 307 team members filled in the questionnaire at both T0 and T1. We measured innovative culture, respondent characteristics (age, gender, education), perceived team effectiveness, organizational support, and management support. Two-tailed paired t-tests showed that innovative culture was slightly but significantly lower at T1 compared to T0 (12 months and 2-3 months after the start of the collaborative, respectively). Univariate analyses revealed that perceived effectiveness, organizational and management support were significantly related to innovative culture at T1 (all at p </= 0.001). Multilevel analyses showed that perceived effectiveness, organizational support, and management support predicted innovative culture. Our QI teams were not able to improve innovative culture over time, but their innovative culture scores were higher than non-participant professionals. QI interventions require organizational and management support to enhance innovative culture in long-term care settings."
17488752,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Extremely high rates of mortality and morbidity have been reported among people with intellectual disabilities. Virtually no research has addressed the potential social determinants of health status within this very vulnerable population. METHOD: Cross-sectional survey of self-reported health status and indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage and social connectedness in 1273 English adults with mild or moderate intellectual disabilities. RESULTS: Indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage accounted for a statistically significant proportion of variation in health status, over and above any variation attributable to the personal characteristics and living circumstances of participants. Indicators of social participation and networks did not add to the explanatory power of the model. Among the indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage, hardship was more strongly associated with variation in health status than either employment status or area-level deprivation. CONCLUSION: As in the general population, self-reported health was associated with indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage, especially hardship. In contrast, there was no evidence of any association between health status and social participation and networks."
14722836,1,a,"A positive parent-child relationship is one of the most important determinants of a healthy cognitive, emotional and social development. The relationship from parent to child is determined by parenting styles. Parenting styles are characterised by the two dimensions parental attitudes and rearing practices. The development and the psychometric properties of a questionnaire on parental attitudes and rearing practices (FEPS), which contains an extended version of the Parental Bonding Instrument by Parker et al. (PBI, 1979) and two scales on parental reinforcement and punishment behaviour, is presented. In a sample of 457 women and 159 men factorial and item analysis revealed four scales (care, autonomy, low punishment and low material reinforcement). The care dimension contained items of immaterial reinforcement on the positive pole and items of coldness and ignorance as means of punishment on the negative pole. Based on findings from its first application in a clinical study it can be assumed that the FEPS differentiates between clinical and non-clinical populations. Additionally, varying patterns of the four scales may emerge as risk factors for the development of certain psychiatric/psychological problems."
25852972,0,a,"PURPOSE: This study examined the effects of a physical activity (PA) intervention for young adult cancer survivors on changes in self-efficacy, social support, and self-monitoring and determined whether changes in these social cognitive theory constructs mediated the relationship between the intervention and changes in PA. METHODS: A 12-week randomized trial compared a Facebook-based intervention (FITNET) aimed at increasing moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA to a Facebook-based self-help comparison group. Young adult cancer survivors (N=86, aged 21-39) were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Self-report measures of PA and psychosocial variables were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: The FITNET group reported lower self-efficacy for sticking to exercise (mean change=-0.38; 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.12; p=0.025) and social support from friends on social networking websites (mean change=-0.47; 95% CI: -1.45 to 0.65; p=0.039) relative to the self-help comparison group over time. Changes in social support from friends on social networking websites partially mediated the intervention effects on moderate-to-vigorous PA (mean indirect effect=-22.4; 95% CI: -62.0 to -2.8) in the unexpected direction. Across both groups, social support from friends and self-monitoring were positively associated with changes in moderate-to-vigorous PA. CONCLUSION: The proposed mediators did not explain the positive effects of the FITNET intervention on mild PA. The lack of significant improvements in psychosocial constructs among FITNET participants may partly explain why the intervention did not increase moderate-to-vigorous PA relative to the self-help comparison group. Future PA interventions with young adult cancer survivors should examine targeting social support from friends and self-monitoring."
29433782,0,a,"Socio-economic dynamics determine the transition from diets characterized by the risk of famine, to those characterized by the risk of diet-related non-communicable disease (DR-NCD). This transition is of particular concern in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in which key socio-economic interactions that influence diet include economic growth and rapid urbanization; inequality and a growing middle class; and obesogenic food environments and an increasing prevalence of DR-NCD. In each case, countries in SSA are among those experiencing the most rapid change in the world. These interactions, styled as 'keystones', affect the functioning of other components of the food system and the diets that result. Data from the wealthiest quartile of countries in SSA suggest that these keystones may be increasing the risk of DR-NCD, widening inequalities in health outcomes due to unbalanced diets. To address this, new consumer and government capabilities that address these keystones are required. Food sensitive urban planning, supporting food literacy and fiscal management of consumption are examples."
28888890,0,a,"Reducing child mortality is a Sustainable Development Goal yet to be achieved by many low-income countries. We applied a subnational and spatial approach based on publicly available datasets and identified permanent insolvency, urbanicity, and malaria endemicity as factors associated with child mortality. We further detected spatial clusters in the east of Bangladesh and noted Sylhet and Jamalpur as those districts that need immediate attention to reduce child mortality. Our approach is transferable to other regions in comparable settings worldwide and may guide future studies to identify subnational regions in need for public health attention. Our study adds to our understanding where we may intervene to more effectively improve health, particularly among disadvantaged populations."
15798125,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: We examined a community-based participatory diabetes intervention to identify facilitators of and barriers to sustained community efforts to address social factors that contribute to health. METHODS: We conducted a case study description and analysis of the Healthy Eating and Exercising to Reduce Diabetes project in the theoretical context of a conceptual model of social determinants of health. RESULTS: We identified several barriers to and facilitators of analysis of social determinants of a community-identified disease priority (in this case, diabetes). Barriers included prevailing conceptual models, which emphasize health behavioral and biomedical paradigms that exclude social determinants of health. Facilitating factors included (1) opportunities to link individual health concerns to social contexts and (2) availability of support from diverse partners with a range of complementary resources. CONCLUSIONS: Partnerships that offer community members tangible resources with which to manage existing health concerns and that integrate an analysis of social determinants of health can facilitate sustained engagement of community members and health professionals in multilevel efforts to address health disparities."
19997790,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about psychosocial mechanisms that may underlie differences in lifestyle change between socioeconomic groups. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine how educational level influences middle-aged participants' (N = 385) psychosocial responses to the GOAL Lifestyle Implementation Trial. METHODS: The measurements of self-efficacy and planning for healthy lifestyle were conducted pre-intervention (T1) and post-intervention (T2, 3 months), and measurements of exercise and healthy eating as outcomes at T1 and at 12 months (T3). RESULTS: Psychosocial determinants at T1 and their T1-T2 changes were mostly similar, irrespective of educational levels. Exercise barriers self-efficacy was enhanced slightly less (p = 0.08) among the low-SES. T2 levels as well as pre-post-intervention changes in exercise self-efficacy predicted 12-month changes in exercise, and T2 diet coping planning predicted changes in dietary fat intake. The associations were similar across all SES groups. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing self-efficacy and planning is similarly effective among intervention participants regardless of education level."
11063059,1,a,"This study examines the effectiveness of the PSI/PMSC Horizon Jeunes youth-targeted social marketing program for improving adolescent reproductive health in urban Cameroon. The program targeted adolescents through peer education, youth clubs, mass media promotion, and behavior change communications. After about 13 months of intervention, knowledge of the program was nearly universal, and the majority of youths had direct contact with the program. Program effectiveness is examined using a quasi-experimental research design with a preintervention and postintervention survey in an intervention and comparison site. The intervention had a significant effect on several determinants of preventive behavior, including awareness of sexual risks, knowledge of birth control methods, and discussion of sexuality and contraceptives. The intervention increased the proportion of female youths who reported using oral contraceptives and condoms for birth control. However, condom use is not yet consistent. Although the proportion of young men who reported using condoms for birth control also increased, this change could not be attributed to the intervention. Although this short intervention successfully increased the reported use of various birth control methods, including condoms, there is no evidence that the intervention increased use of condoms for STD prevention of sexually transmitted diseases."
11428201,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Data from two consecutive households surveys undertaken in mid-80s and mid-90s allow to characterize and analyse secular trends in infant and child anaemia in the city of S.

Capillary blood samples, collected by digital puncture in the two surveys, were analysed regarding their haemoglobin concentration. The anaemic status was determined when haemoglobin concentration was below 11 g/dL. For each survey, the study of the social distribution of child anaemia took into account tertiles of the per capita family income. For the study of the determinants of secular trends, hierarchical causal models, multivariate regression analyses and calculations analogous to the ones used to assess population attributable risks were applied. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: In the time span from the first to the second survey, there was a significant reduction in the average haemoglobin concentration (from 11.6 g/dl to 11.0 g/dl), as well as a considerable increase in anaemia prevalence (from 35.6% to 46.9%). Unfavourable trends were observed in both sexes, all age groups and all income strata. Trends were still less favourable among the poorest families, aggravating the social burden related to child anaemia. Changes in distal (family income and maternal schooling) and proximal determinants (breast or bottle-feeding) of child anaemia were positive in the study period and therefore they cannot explain the increase in the disease. A low iron diet could explain the high prevalence of anaemia in both surveys but could not explain its further increase."
12601262,1,a,"The present study investigated work-related determinants of return to work. Our hypothesis was based on the strain hypothesis of the Demand-Control-Support model, which postulates a relation between job demands, job control and support at work on the one hand, and the aetiology of health complaints on the other hand. High demands were hypothesized to obstruct return to work, whereas high control and high support were thought to have a positive effect on return to work. This hypothesis was tested in a population of employees who were sick-listed for 6-8 weeks. Return to work, as operationalized by the categories (i) not working; (ii) return to work with adjustments; and (iii) full return to work, was determined 4 months after the onset of the sick leave. The hypothesis was tested by logistic regression analyses. High job demands were the least predictive of full return to work. However, the likelihood of employees with high job demands returning to work with adjustments was higher than the likelihood of them not working. Therefore, job demands might also work as a pressure to return to work (compare this with Smulders and Nijhuis, 1999). Furthermore, high skill discretion in combination with high job demands predicted working with adjustments in comparison with not working. Finally, high supervisor support was the most predictive of return to work without adjustments, and the least predictive of not working."
23186253,0,a,"BACKGROUND: School dropout is a persisting problem with major socioeconomic consequences. Although poor health probably contributes to pathways leading to school dropout and health is likely negatively affected by dropout, these issues are relatively absent on the public health agenda. This emphasises the importance of integrative research aimed at identifying children at risk for school dropout at an early stage, discovering how socioeconomic status and gender affect health-related pathways that lead to dropout and developing a prevention tool that can be used in public health services for youth. METHODS/DESIGN: The SIODO study is a sequential mixed-methods study. A case-control study will be conducted among 18 to 24 year olds in the south of the Netherlands (n = 580). Data are currently being collected from compulsory education departments at municipalities (dropout data), regional public health services (developmental data from birth onwards) and an additional questionnaire has been sent to participants (e.g. personality data). Advanced analyses, including cluster and factor analyses, will be used to identify children at risk at an early stage. Using the quantitative data, we have planned individual interviews with participants and focus groups with important stakeholders such as parents, teachers and public health professionals. A thematic content analysis will be used to analyse the qualitative data. DISCUSSION: The SIODO study will use a life-course perspective, the ICF-CY model to group the determinants and a mixed-methods design. In this respect, the SIODO study is innovative because it both broadens and deepens the study of health-related determinants of school dropout. It examines how these determinants contribute to socioeconomic and gender differences in health and contributes to the development of a tool that can be used in public health practice to tackle the problem of school dropout at its roots."
19545045,1,a,"The purpose of this review of the literature is to present factors possibly affecting the spread of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa over the next 20 years. Malaria is a vector-borne disease that depends on environmental and human constraints. The main environmental limitations involve susceptibility of the vector (mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus) and parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) to climate. Malaria is a stable, endemic disease over most of the African continent. Climatic change can only affect a few regions on the fringes of stable zones (e.g. altitude areas or Sahel) where malaria is an unstable, epidemic disease. Higher temperatures could induce a decrease of malaria transmission in regions of the Sahel or an increase in the highlands. The extent of these overall trends will depend on the unpredictable occurrence of major meteorological phenomenon as well as on human activities affecting the environment that could lead to dramatic but limited outbreaks in some locations. The most influential human factors could be runaway demographic growth and urban development. Estimations based on modeling studies indicate that urbanization will lead to a 53.5% drop in exposure to malaria by 2030. However this reduction could be less than expected because of adaptation of Anopheles gambiae and An. arabiensis, the main vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, to the urban environment as well as increasing vector resistance to insecticides. Another unforeseeable factor that could induce unexpected malaria epidemics is mass migration due to war or famine. Finally immunosuppressive illnesses (e.g. HIV and malnutrition) could alter individual susceptibility to malaria. Social constraints also include human activities that modify land use. In this regard land use (e.g. forest clearance and irrigation) is known to influence the burden of malaria that is itself dependent on local determinants of transmission. Overall the most important social constraint for the population will be access to malarial prevention and implementation action to control this scourge."

23975798,0,a,"Individual risk assessment and behavior change dominate the content of high school health education instruction whereas broader social, political, and economic factors that influence health-known as upstream causes-are less commonly considered. With input from instructors and students, we developed a 10-lesson experiential Public Health Advocacy Curriculum that uses classroom-based activities to teach high school students about the upstream causes of health and engages them in community-based health advocacy. The Curriculum, most suitable for health- or advocacy-related elective classes or after-school programs, may be taught in its entirety or as single lessons integrated into existing coursework. Although students at many schools are using the Curriculum, it has been formally evaluated with 110 predominantly Latino students at one urban and one semirural public high school in Northern California (six classes). In pre-post surveys, students showed highly significant and positive changes in the nine questions that covered the three main Curriculum domains (Upstream Causes, Community Exploration, and Public Health Advocacy), p values .02 to <.001. The Curriculum is being widely disseminated without charge to local, national, and international audiences, with the objective of grooming a generation of youth who are committed to the public health perspective to health."
26818190,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a health issue that often occurs after serious disaster. Social factors, which can be disrupted by disaster, are important determinants of physical activity levels in everyday living. This study was designed to confirm the association between social factors and physical activity among elderly survivors of the Great East Japan Earthquake. METHODS: From September 2011 to February 2012, 4316 males and females aged 65 or older participated in a health survey of Great East Japan Earthquake survivors. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed with the dichotomous dependent variable of physical activity (high versus low) and working status, social network, and place of residence (one's own home versus elsewhere) as independent variables. RESULTS: Participants who had been displaced from their homes were more likely to have low physical activity (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI] for men: 1.37, 1.12 to 1.68; for women: 1.30, 1.09 to 1.55). Non-working status was significantly associated with low physical activity (men: 2.03, 1.65 to 2.49; women: 1.94, 1.60 to 2.34). Detriments to the social network were significantly associated with low physical activity (men: 1.71, 1.41 to 2.08; women: 1.79, 1.51 to 2.13). CONCLUSION: Place of residence and social factors were associated with physical activity levels in elderly survivors of the Great East Japan Earthquake. The findings suggest a need for improvement of social factors to encourage increases in physical activity for elderly persons after disaster."
18083447,1,a,"BACKGROUND: With increased numbers of children attending child care, this setting presents an ideal opportunity to promote physical activity and the early development of healthy behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between the childcare environment and physical activity behavior of preschool children. METHODS: Aspects of the environment hypothesized to influence children's physical activity were assessed in 20 childcare centers using the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) instrument. Physical activity behavior was assessed over 2 days using direct observation. RESULTS: Children in centers with supportive environments achieved more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (15% of observations vs 9%; effect size [ES]=1.17), spent less time in sedentary activities (50% vs 61%; ES=-1.52), and had higher mean physical activity levels (2.68 vs 2.43; ES=1.41) compared to centers with less supportive environments. Facets of the physical and social environment related to physical activity behavior included active opportunities, portable play equipment, fixed play equipment, sedentary environment, and physical activity training and education. CONCLUSIONS: Previous research indicates that the childcare center that children attend significantly affects physical activity behavior. The current findings extend this evidence by identifying aspects of the childcare environment that relate to the physical activity behavior of children. These factors should be considered when identifying determinants of physical activity and designing interventions."
17687880,1,a,"Cocaine consumption in Spain continues to rise and is reaching an alarming level. This is a descriptive and correlational study in which a transcultural analysis is made with a sample of 62 different countries. The aim of this study is to compare the influence of macrosocial, cultural and economic variables on the behaviour of cocaine abuse. Thus, the importance of the cocaine traffic and supply is shown in relation to the abuse of the same, but recognition and emphasis is given to the presence of other explanatory factors characteristic of societies in which cocaine is abused and demanded. These factors are: predominance of cultural values of self-expression, high index of subjective wellbeing and a high GNP per capita. Finally, the relevance of social factors, environment and socio-economic context, as determinants of cocaine abuse from a trans-cultural perspective, are discussed. The implementation of different actions is proposed: the promotion of values oriented towards self-regulation and self-control, the control of the cocaine supply (direct and indirect), combating early cultural destruction by means of publicity and promoting cultural creation and the diversification of leisure."
16678558,1,a,"This report reviews recent research on the psychosocial aspects of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). A review and evaluation of existing literature was conducted by a multidisciplinary committee of experts in this field. This report is a synopsis of a chapter published in the Rome III book. The committee reached consensus in finding considerable evidence supporting the association between psychological distress, childhood trauma and recent environmental stress, and several of the FGIDs but noted that this association is not specific to FGIDs. There is also considerable evidence that psychosocial variables are important determinants of the outcomes of global well-being, health-related quality of life, and health care seeking. In line with these descriptive findings, there is now increasing evidence that a number of psychological treatments and antidepressants are helpful in reducing symptoms and other consequences of the FGIDs in children and adults. The FGIDs are a result of complex interactions between biological, psychological, and social factors, and they can only be treated satisfactorily when all these factors are considered and addressed. Therefore, knowledge about the psychosocial aspects of FGIDs is fundamental and critical to the understanding, assessment, and treatment of these disorders. More extensive physician training is needed if these aspects of treatment are to be used effectively and widely in clinical practice."
28462813,0,a,"PURPOSE: Significant racial disparities and continuing poor birth outcomes make adolescent pregnancy a significant public health concern in the United States despite declining pregnancy rates. Social determinants of health are associated with increased likelihood of pregnancy and poor maternal and child health outcomes. This study aims to characterize specific elements of social determinants of health in a cohort of predominantly Latina adolescent mothers. METHODS: Between February 2007 and August 2008, 106 pregnant adolescents participated in a study with assessments at 20 to 24 weeks of gestation, and at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Survey questions addressed residential mobility, financial support and childcare, and perceived need for and use of community resources. Comparative analysis assessed differences between adolescents by age (<16 vs. >/=16 years old) and ethnicity (Latina vs. non-Latina). FINDINGS: Adolescent mothers experienced high rates of residential mobility, with 59.4% moving at least once in the year before their prenatal survey. Participants relied primarily on public aid (94-96%) and their parents (81-85%) for financial support. Latina participants were more likely than non-Latinas to rely on public aid. Although many participants reported needing financial support and housing, few used available services. Younger adolescents relied less often on the father of the baby for support than older adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent mothers' high rates of residential mobility and increasing reliance on public assistance highlight resource gaps that potentially put them and their children at risk for poor outcomes. Targeted efforts to augment systemic support in these domains are a critical component of addressing health disparities for this population."
29187771,0,a,"Trust is a good approach to explain the functioning of markets, institutions or society as a whole. It is a key element in almost every commercial transaction over time and might be one of the main explanations of economic success and development. Trust diminishes the more we perceive others to have economically different living realities. In most of the relevant contributions, scholars have taken a macro perspective on the inequality-trust linkage, with an aggregation of both trust and inequality on a country level. However, patterns of within-country inequality and possibly influential determinants, such as perception and socioeconomic reference, remained undetected. This paper offers the opportunity to look at the interplay between inequality and trust at a more refined level. A measure of (generalized) trust emerges from ESS 5 survey which asks ""...generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?"". With the use of 2009 EU-SILC data, measurements of income inequality are developed for age-specific groups of society in 22 countries. A sizable variation in inequality measures can be noticed. Even in low inequality countries, like Sweden, income imbalances within certain age groups have the potential to undermine social trust."
12667891,1,a,"Borna Disease Virus (BDV) is a neurotropic RNA virus that is worldwide in distribution, causing movement and behavior disorders in a wide range of animal species. BDV has also been reported to be associated with neuropsychiatric diseases of humans by serologic study and by recovery of nucleic acid or virus from blood or brain. Natural infections of horses and sheep produce encephalitis with erratic excited behaviors, hyperkinetic movement or gait abnormalities; naturally infected cats have ataxic ""staggering disease."" Experimentally infected primates develop hyperactivity, aggression, disinhibition, then apathy; prosimians (lower primates) have hyperactivity, circadian disruption, abnormal social and dominance behaviors, and postural disorders. However, the neuropharmacological determinants of BD phenotypes in laboratory and natural hosts are incompletely understood. Here we review how experimentally infected rodents have provided models for examining behavioral, pharmacologic, and biochemical responses to viral challenge, and how rodents experimentally infected as neonates or as adolescents are providing models for examining age-specific neuropharmacological adaptations to viral injury."
19629855,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: This paper explores the presence of sex preference and its influence on contraceptive use among the Garo, a matrilineal community, of Bangladesh. METHODS: In this study, 223 currently married Garo women were interviewed, selected purposively from two districts of Bangladesh, where most of the Garo people live. A binary logistic regression model was fitted to explore the determinants of current use of contraceptives among the Garo community. RESULTS: About 80% of the Garo women were currently using contraceptive methods, which was much higher than the contraceptive prevalence at the national level (55.8%). However, the use of modern male methods was very low in that community. Regression analysis revealed that the strong preference for girls was a significant determinant of contraceptive use. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the Garo apply contraception more than the Bangladeshi community in general, their strong preference for girls may restrain its success. Family planning information can be designed so as not to challenge the matrilineal structure of the society and both spouses counselled together to promote also modern male methods."
14978603,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary characteristics were studied to gain insights into determinants of total diet quality and diversity in a weighted sample of 460 participants aged 55-74 (53% female) from the 1990 Enqu te qu b coise sur la nutrition (EQN) dataset. METHODS: Dietary data consisted of an interviewer-administered 24-hour recall and food frequency questionnaire, and a self-administered questionnaire on dietary behaviours, attitudes and perceptions. 24-hour recall data were coded into food groups as described in Canada's Food Guide for Healthy Eating. Diet quality was scored using the categorical Dietary Diversity Score (DDS, range 0-4) and continuous Dietary Adequacy Score (DAS, range 0-18). A second nonconsecutive recall (10% of subjects) permitted correction of food group portions for intraindividual variability and subsequent calculation and validation of usual DDS and DAS. Relationships were examined between the scores and independent variables. Forward leastwise logistic regession (DDS) and stepwise multiple regression (DAS) analyses were conducted with independent variables showing significant bivariate relationships. RESULTS: Among men, breakfast consumption and eating commercially-prepared meals were positively associated with usual DDS, but poor social support and supplement use negatively predicted this score. Eating fewer than 3 meals daily, smoking, and dietary supplement use were negative predictors of usual DAS (r2=0.155). Among women, eating commercial foods was a negative predictor of usual DDS, as was preferring overweight to depriving themselves of favourite foods. Reporting that health concerns influenced food choices and disagreeing with the statement that effort is needed to have a nice body were positive determinants of usual DAS in women. On the other hand, eating fewer than 3 meals daily negatively predicted this dietary index (r2 = 0.162). CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in predictors of diet quality suggest the need to target nutrition health promotion to the needs of older men and women to encourage optimal eating habits."
30413048,0,a,"Food purchasing and consumption behaviors have implications for nutrition and obesity. Food retail environments, in particular, shape customer food choices and energy intake. The marketing literature offers insights about how public health practitioners can work within food retail environments to encourage healthy food choices. We reviewed experimental studies in the marketing literature to examine factors influencing customer purchase intentions and choice for food products in retail stores. Database searches were conducted in February 2016 for original, empirical articles published in English from 2000(-)2015 in marketing journals. Each research article included at least one experimental design study conducted in a real or simulated retail environment with purchase intentions or choice of food products as an outcome variable. Backward and forward reference searches were conducted for articles meeting inclusion criteria. Narrative synthesis methods were used to thematically group and summarize the findings of forty-one articles that met inclusion criteria into three categories: shelf display and product factors, pricing and price promotion factors, and in-store and customer decision-making factors. This research contributes to the literature by providing specific and actionable approaches that can increase/decrease customer purchase intentions and choice for food products in retail environments. Translating marketing strategies into public health applications can provide recommendations for future intervention research and policy related to customer food purchasing behavior."
14713671,1,a,"Over the past two decades, public health research has emphasized the role of individual risk behaviors, primarily injection and sexual risk behaviors, in the spread of HIV infection. Much less emphasis has been given to understanding the determinants of these risk behaviors. Although individual characteristics are partly responsible for risky injection and sexual behaviors, they do not explain all the interpersonal variability in risk behavior. Contextual factors associated with HIV risk behavior may include structural factors (e.g., availability of services), social norms and attitudes (e.g., social trust), disadvantage (e.g., neighborhood socioeconomic status), and features of the physical environment (e.g., housing quality). This article presents a conceptual framework that incorporates some of the key contextual domains that may affect drug use behavior. It also presents data from a study of street-recruited drug users as an example of the relations between social contextual factors and frequency of injecting drug use, and discusses some methodological challenges in the study of contextual determinants of drug use behavior."
16051408,1,a,"Several scholars have put forward the view that the estimates by Rodgers [(1979). Income and inequality as determinants of mortality: An international cross-section analysis. Population Studies, 33 (2), 343-351], Flegg [(1982). Inequality of income, illiteracy and medical care as determinants of infant mortality in underdeveloped countries. Population Studies, 36 (3), 441-458] and Waldmann [(1992). Income distribution and infant mortality. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107 (4), 1283-1302] showing a negative cross-country association between income inequality and population health, cannot be replicated from recent data. In view of the importance of this matter, the present study further examines the issue from the most recent, and probably more accurate, data for the largest cross-country sample used in this line of research. The main conclusion is that the negative cross-country association between income inequality and good health, reported by Rodgers, Flegg, and Waldmann, is replicated very well. The different findings indicated by some scholars may have been due to their samples or the models being unusual. Therefore, the recent skepticism about the existence of such a negative association needs to be reconsidered. Several additional points are also noted. First, income inequality shows significance even after an index of ethnic heterogeneity is included. Second, ethnic heterogeneity itself has a negative association with population health. Third, income inequality retains significance in the presence of a measure of social capital. Fourth, however, the association between the measure of social capital and population health appears weak. Fifth, a simple analysis does not support the view that the positive association between income inequality and infant mortality in less developed countries (LDCs) may just be a reflection of the role of poverty. Finally, there is some support for the proposition that while income may be relatively more important for health in LDCs, the role of income inequality may be stronger in developed economies."
12227963,1,a,"Urbanization, a characteristic of the twentieth century, is a profound transformation of human settlement processes and their outcomes, which has not been well understood in terms of both positive and negative impacts. This paper argues that the interrelations between urban planning, health, social, and environmental policies have been poorly articulated until now. Although sectoral approaches have often applied remedial and corrective measures to overcome unsatisfactory conditions in urban areas, today we know that infectious diseases stemming from insanitary conditions are not the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Europe. Nonetheless diverse forms of ill health remain associated with place of work and residence. Therefore, in order to deal with the complexity and diversity of urban areas there is an urgent need to move from conventional, sectoral approaches based on biomedical models of health to coordinated action stemming from an ecological interpretation of health including its social determinants. This kind of approach is presented in order to promote health and social development at the local level."

The discussion includes a description of the significant educational processes that supported the development of health promoting family practice and an outline of the transformative changes the team members experienced as they evolved their health promoting practices."
16162598,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Underweight, overweight, and obese women aged 18-34 years were compared with normal weight women of the corresponding age according to socioeconomic, psychosocial, health behaviour, self reported global and psychological health, and locus of control characteristics. METHODS: The 2000 public health survey in Scania is a cross-sectional study. A total 13,715 persons aged 18-80 years, of which 1967 were females of 18-34 years of age, were included in this study. They answered a postal questionnaire, which represents 59% of the random sample. A logistic regression model adjusted for age was used to investigate the association between socioeconomic, psychosocial, health behaviour, self reported global and psychological health, locus of control, and the BMI categories. RESULTS: A 17.5% proportion of the women, aged 18-34 years, were underweight (BMI < 20.0), 18.4% were overweight, and 7.0% obese. The prevalence of underweight according to the BMI < 18.5 definition was 5.8% among women aged 18-34 years. Women who were underweight had significantly higher odds ratios for overtime work, being students, low emotional support, and poor self reported global as well as poor psychological health than normal weight women. Women who were overweight/obese were unemployed, had low education, low social participation, low emotional and instrumental support, were daily smokers, had a sedentary lifestyle, had poor self reported global health, and had lack of internal locus of control compared with normal weight women. CONCLUSIONS: Underweight women are more likely to have poorer psychological health than normal weight women. In contrast, overweight and obese women are more likely to have poor health related behaviours and lack of internal locus of control compared with normal weight women. These differing patterns suggest both different etiology and different preventive strategies to deal with the health risks of people who are underweight as opposed to those who are overweight/obese."
28242166,0,a,"Dysphagia after primary chemoradiotherapy or radiation alone in pharyngeal cancers can have a devastating impact on a patient's physical, social and emotional state. Establishing and validating efficient dysphagia-optimised radiotherapy techniques is, therefore, of paramount importance in an era where health-related quality of life measures are increasingly influential determinants of curative management strategies, particularly as the incidence of good prognosis, human papillomavirus-driven pharyngeal cancer in younger patients continues to rise. The preferential sparing achievable with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) of key swallowing structures implicated in post-radiation dysfunction, such as the pharyngeal constrictor muscles (PCM), has generated significant research into toxicity-mitigating strategies. The lack of randomised evidence, however, means that there remains uncertainty about the true clinical benefits of the dosimetric gains offered by technological advances in radiotherapy. As a result, we feel that IMRT techniques that spare PCM cannot be incorporated into routine practice. In this review, we discuss the swallowing structures responsible for functional impairment, analyse the studies that have explored the dose-response relationship between these critical structures and late dysphagia, and consider the merits of reported dysphagia-optimised IMRT (Do-IMRT) approaches, thus far. Finally, we discuss the dysphagia/aspiration-related structures (DARS) study (ISRCTN 25458988), which is the first phase III randomised controlled trial designed to investigate the impact of swallow-sparing strategies on improving long-term function. To maximise patient benefits, improvements in radiation delivery will need to integrate with novel treatment paradigms and comprehensive rehabilitation strategies to eventually provide a patient-centric, personalised treatment plan."
15793014,1,a,"Community-academic partnerships in the training of doctors offer unique learning opportunities of great importance. Such partnerships can induce a paradigm shift such that physicians view community as a teaching resource and partner rather than as a passive recipient of services or solely as a placement site. The authors describe a model of a community-academic partnership in New York City, begun in 1995, in which, for training and service, pediatric residents are integrally involved in a community-based program. Principles adapted from the Community-Campus Partnerships for Health's principles of partnership provide a framework for portraying the essential elements of developing and maintaining the partnership. The authors explain the clashes that may arise between partners and show how the principles of partnership guide partnership members in working and learning within a setting that by its nature entails conflict and inequality. This report is based on the knowledge gained from the structured reflections of both members of this partnership: the residency program at a large academic health center and the community-based social service organization. Such partnerships provide the training ground for the development of physicians who understand the social and cultural determinants of health and constructively use community agencies' input in promoting child health and well-being. Within this framework, community-based organizations are not solely service providers but become educators of physicians-in-training who, with new knowledge gained through the partnership, more effectively contribute to the overall health of the communities they serve."

18815713,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to quantify socioeconomic inequalities in low-back pain, neck-shoulder pain, and arm pain in the general working population in Oslo and to examine the impact of job characteristics on these inequalities. METHODS: All economically active 30-, 40-, and 45-year-old persons who attended the Oslo health study in 2000-2001 and answered questions on physical job demands, job autonomy, and musculoskeletal pain were included (N=7293). Occupational class was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status. The lower occupational classes were compared with higher grade professionals, and prevalences, prevalence ratios, prevalence differences, and population attributable fractions were calculated. RESULTS: There were marked, stepwise socioeconomic gradients for musculoskeletal pain, steeper for the men than for the women. The relative differences (prevalence ratios) were larger for low-back pain and arm pain than for neck-shoulder pain. The absolute differences (prevalence differences) were the largest for low-back pain. Physical job demands explained a substantial proportion of the absolute occupational class inequalities in low-back pain, while job autonomy was more important in explaining the inequalities in neck-shoulder pain and arm pain. The estimated population attributable fractions supported the impact of job characteristics at the working population level, especially for low-back pain. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, physical job demands and job autonomy explained a substantial proportion of occupational class inequalities in self-reported musculoskeletal pain in the working population in Oslo. This finding indicates that the workplace may be an important arena for preventive efforts to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in musculoskeletal pain."
31063310,0,a,"Kidney disease is a global public health problem; affects more than 750million persons worldwide. The burden of kidney disease varies substantially across the world, as does its detection and treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that developing countries have a similar or even greater kidney disease burden than developed countries. In many settings, rates of kidney disease and the provision of care are defined by socioeconomic, cultural, and political factors, leading to significant disparities, even in developed countries. These disparities exist across the spectrum of kidney disease -prevention, screening, care and treatment. World Kidney Day 2019 offers an opportunity to raise awareness of kidney disease. This editorial highlights these disparities and emphasizes the role of public policies and organizational structures in addressing them. We outline opportunities to improve our understanding of disparities, the best ways to address them, and how to streamline efforts toward achieving kidney health equity across the globe."
29499545,0,a,"The vulnerability of cities and communities in the Amazon to flooding and flash flooding is increasing. The effects of extreme events on populations vary across landscapes, causing vulnerability to differ spatially. Traditional vulnerability studies in Brazil and across the world have used the vulnerability index for the country and, more recently, municipality scales. The vulnerability dimensions are exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. For each of these dimensions, there is a group of indicators that constitutes a vulnerability index using quantitative data. Several vulnerability assessments have used sensitivity and exposure analyses and, recently, adaptive capacity has been considered. The Geographical Information Systems (GIS) analysis allows spatial regional modeling using quantitative vulnerability indicators. This paper presents a local-scale vulnerability assessment in an urban Amazonian area, Santarem City, using interdisciplinary methods. Data for exposure and sensitivity were gathered by remote sensing and census data, respectively. However, adaptive capacity refers to local capacities, whether infrastructural or not, and the latter were gathered by qualitative participatory methods. For the mixed data used to study adaptive capacity, we consider tangible components for countable infrastructure that can cope with hazards, and intangible components that reflect social activities based on risk perceptions and collective action. The results indicate that over 80% of the area is highly or moderately vulnerable to flooding and flash flooding. Exposure and adaptive capacity were determinants of the results. Lower values of adaptive capacity play a significant role in vulnerability enhancement."

The present study assessed prevalence of food insecurity and its covariates among a group of marginally housed individuals living in single-room occupancy (SRO) dwellings, a population for which there is little extant health or nutrition research. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey incorporating the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. SETTING: Ten private SRO residences in the Uptown neighbourhood of Chicago, IL, USA, 2013. SUBJECTS: SRO residents over 18 years of age who were able to communicate verbally in English (n 153). RESULTS: Food insecurity was widespread among SRO residents, with 75 % of the sample considered food insecure and 52 % meeting criteria for severe food insecurity. Bivariate analyses indicated that female gender, eating most meals at a soup kitchen, having a mental health condition, problem drinking, having at least one chronic health condition, and diabetes were all significantly associated with food insecurity. In the multivariate ordered logistic regression model, eating most meals at a soup kitchen remained as the only significant correlate of food insecurity (OR=10.13). CONCLUSIONS: SRO residents and other marginally housed populations face unique food access challenges. Although targeted assistance in the form of food stamps and congregate meal programmes remains critical, efforts to prevent and address food insecurity among homeless and marginally housed individuals should include policy interventions that recognize poverty as the root cause of food insecurity and aim to increase overall income and improve housing conditions."
31696080,0,a,"Background: Overuse and underuse of health care services are progressively recognized in all health systems around the world. There is evidence of overuse and underuse of health care services in Iran. In this study, it was aimed to summarize the evidence of overuse and underuse of health care services in the Iranian health care system. Methods: This study will be conducted in 5 steps using a sequential explanatory multimethod design, literature review, systematic review, qualitative interview, expert panel, and policy Delphi method. This study was approved by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (ethical confirmation number: IR.TBZMED.REC.1396.908). Conclusion: There is a strong evidence of worldwide overuse and underuse of health care services. Designing context-based prevention strategies by conducting comprehensive and systematic studies will improve the appropriate use of routine services and help patients, physicians, and providers make evidence-based decisions."
15254475,1,a,"Maternal smoking has been repeatedly found to be the most important determinant of children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Here, we further investigated predictors for the urinary cotinine/creatinine ratio (CCR, ng/mg) in 1220 preschool children for the year 1996. Children from smoking homes (35.1%) had significantly higher CCR than children from nonsmoking homes (mean: 55.5 vs. 14.9 ng/mg). The level of education of the parents was a strong predictor for CCRs even after adjusting for number of cigarettes smoked, maternal smoking and dwelling space. Additionally, dwelling space was inversely related to children's urinary cotinine level. The CCR- levels in children investigated in 1996 and 1998 were significantly correlated (Pearson's r=0.67). The parents of 806 children agreed for a visit to their homes. In 79 of the 536 (14.7%) of the self-reported, nonsmoking households, smoking was admitted during the visit. The mean urinary CCR of these children was 25.2 ng/mg. We conclude that in addition to parental smoking behaviour, other variables such as dwelling space and social and educational status predict the children's exposure to ETS. Our data also revealed that a considerable percentage of parents denied the ETS exposure of their children at home."
27028397,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of sickle cell disease (SCD) and determinants of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards SCD in western Kordofan State, Sudan. METHODS: A community-based, descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in three towns. Three hundred and seventy-two households were polled, and blood samples for haemoglobin phenotyping were collected from 1116 individuals. Sociodemographic, socio-economic and KAP data were collected using investigator-administered questionnaires. Descriptive, frequency distribution and multiple regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: About 50.9% of the study population were Misseriya tribes. Consanguineous marriages were reported by 67.5% of the households. The highest percentage of homozygous SCD was 2.8% among children under 5 years of age. About 24.9% were carriers of HbS allele (HbAS). HbS allele frequency was highest in children aged 5-11 years (18.3%, CI: 13.7-22.9%) and lowest in males >15 years old (12.0%, CI: 6.1-17.9%). The average HbS frequency across all age groups was 14.5% (95% CI: 12.2-16.8%). The most frequent beta-globin gene cluster haplotype was the Cameroon (30.8%), followed by the Benin (21.8%), the Senegal (12.8%) and the Bantu (2.2%) haplotypes. About 17.0% of all-cause child deaths were due to SCD. The estimated change in log odds of having the SS genotype per year increase in age was (-) 0.0058 (95% CI -0.0359, 0.0242). This represents a non-statistically significant 2.9% increase in 5-year mortality for individuals with the SS genotype relative to those with AS and AA genotypes. About 46.9% of the households had poor knowledge, 26.1% had satisfactory knowledge, and 26.9% had good knowledge about sickle cell disease. Mothers' and fathers' educational levels were significant predictors of good knowledge about SCD (P < 0.05). About 48.0% had a satisfactory attitude towards sickle cell disease while 30.7% had poor attitude and only 21.3 showed good attitudes. Poor knowledge about SCD and low socio-economic status were the strongest positive predictors of poor attitude and practices towards SCD (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Sickle cell disease is a major health problem in West Kordofan, Sudan. Knowledge, attitude and practices towards the disease are not satisfactory. The development of public health programs is highly recommended to control and manage SCD in western parts of Sudan."
10928731,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Most adolescents experiment with alcohol, and the use of alcohol typically escalates during the teenage years. The present study examined how several risk and protective factors measured during early adolescence were associated with heavy drinking in a sample of high school seniors. METHOD: As part of a school-based survey, seventh-grade students (N = 1,132) reported degrees of experimentation with alcohol and cigarettes. Several psychosocial factors deemed to be important in the etiology of drinking were also assessed. Students were followed-up in the twelfth grade, when 16% were categorized as heavy drinkers based on drinking and drunkenness frequency and quantity typically consumed. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses revealed that heavy drinking was predicted by having had experimented with alcohol or cigarettes, having had a majority of one's friends drink and having had poor behavioral self-control in early adolescence. In addition, several effects were limited to either boys or girls. For example, positive alcohol expectancies predicted greater later heavy drinking in boys, while friends' smoking predicted later heavy drinking in girls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that early intervention programs aimed at preventing alcohol use by addressing the social and psychological determinants of alcohol use may have important preventive effects in terms of later heavy drinking."
21907950,0,a,"Potential upstream determinants of coronary heart disease (CHD) include life-course socioeconomic position (e.g., childhood socioeconomic circumstances, own education and occupation); however, several plausible biological mechanisms by which socioeconomic position (SEP) may influence CHD are poorly understood. Several CHD risk factors appear to be more strongly associated with SEP in women than in men; little is known as to whether any CHD risk factors may be more strongly associated with SEP in men. Objectives were to evaluate whether cumulative life-course SEP is associated with a measurement of subclinical atherosclerosis, the ankle-brachial index (ABI), in men and women. This study was a prospective analysis of 1,454 participants from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (mean age 57 years, 53.8% women). Cumulative SEP was calculated by summing tertile scores for father's education, own education, and own occupation. ABI was dichotomized as low (</=1.1) and normal (>1.1 to 1.4). After adjustment for age and CHD risk factors cumulative life-course SEP was associated with low ABI in men (odds ratio [OR] 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22 to 3.42, for low vs high cumulative SEP score) but not in women (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.33). Associations with low ABI in men were substantially driven by their own education (OR 4.13, 95% CI 1.86 to 9.16, for lower vs higher than high school education). In conclusion, cumulative life-course SEP was associated with low ABI in men but not in women."
15203779,1,a,"The recent global increase in argileh use represents the modern renaissance of an old public health threat and a new tobacco epidemic. This study examined argileh smoking knowledge and attitudes in a sample of university students in Beirut as determinants of argileh smoking. Data were collected cross-sectionally through self-administered questionnaires from 416 students at the American University of Beirut through stratified cluster sampling. The proportion of ever-smokers in this study was 43%, compared with the 30% reported 4 years ago. A total of 28.3% of the surveyed students were current argileh smokers, and the average initiation age was 16 years. Compared with argileh smokers, significantly greater proportions of nonsmokers had positive attitudes about argileh banning and more accurate knowledge about argileh. Argileh smoking among Lebanese young is on the rise. Students demonstrated partial knowledge and moderate to favorable attitudes concerning argileh smoking. Possible public health interventions are discussed in light of the social and cultural context of argileh use to neutralize this emerging global public health threat."
27373554,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To uncover the rationale underlying the perceived distinction between clusters of health behaviours by identifying cognitive constructs that differentiate among them, and creating a 'cognitive profile' for each behavioural cluster. Thus, different determinants and characteristics of health behaviours (e.g. 'perceived behavioural control', 'impact on health', 'effort', 'non-health rewards', 'habit') were used to compare health behaviour meta-clusters (physical and psychosocial) and clusters (e.g. nutrition behaviours, substance abuse, medical practices). METHODS: A sample of lay people (N = 1956) judged items representing behavioural clusters delineated in the Health Behaviour Taxonomy on 14 constructs. RESULTS: Significant differences emerged between the physical and psychosocial meta-clusters, as well as among their sub-clusters. For example, physical behaviours were higher on 'perceived behavioural control' and 'impact on health' compared to psychosocial behaviours, and nutrition was perceived highest on 'effort' and 'non-health rewards' compared to the other clusters of the physical meta-cluster. CONCLUSION: The findings increase our understanding of the logic underlying lay people's cognitive schema of health behaviour clusters. 'Cognitive profiles' that explain differences between the clusters were identified, which can be used to design health messages and interventions targeting multiple health behaviours."
23591761,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A combined quantitative and qualitative socio-technical approach is applied in two evaluation studies of electronic patient records (EPR). In these studies the focus was on factors influencing the adoption of the EPR by care providers. OBJECTIVE: The research approach is based on the USE IT-model. In addition to the USE IT-interview model, the USE IT-questionnaire is presented and evaluated in order to present a valid and useful integrated approach for the evaluation of IT-adoption in healthcare. METHODS: The USE IT-questionnaire was evaluated by applying a principal component analysis of the quantitative results in two cases (n = 222), and by comparison of the resulting factors with the determinants of the USE IT-model. RESULTS: The factor analysis of the USE IT-questionnaire resulted in six valid factors: 1. Task support satisfaction, 2. Interface satisfaction, 3. Compatibility, 4. Collaboration, 5. Learnability, and 6. Accessibility. The questions about resources did not combine into a factor. CONCLUSION: The detailed questions of the questionnaire lead to decomposition of the constructs Task support satisfaction and Ease of use into factors. The construct Task support satisfaction which was supposed to measure relevance was decomposed in two factors measuring relevance and two factors measuring micro-requirements."
25354071,0,a,"The goal of MD-PhD training programs is to produce physician-scientists with unique capacities to lead the future biomedical research workforce. The current dearth of physician-scientists with expertise outside conventional biomedical or clinical sciences raises the question of whether MD-PhD training programs should allow or even encourage scholars to pursue doctoral studies in disciplines that are deemed nontraditional, yet are intrinsically germane to major influences on health. This question is especially relevant because the central value and ultimate goal of the academic medicine community is to help attain the highest level of health and health equity for all people. Advances in medical science and practice, along with improvements in health care access and delivery, are steps toward health equity, but alone they will not come close to eliminating health inequalities. Addressing the complex health issues in our communities and society as a whole requires a biomedical research workforce with knowledge, practice, and research skills well beyond conventional biomedical or clinical sciences. To make real progress in advancing health equity, educational pathways must prepare physician-scientists to treat both micro and macro determinants of health. The authors argue that MD-PhD programs should allow and encourage their scholars to cross boundaries into less traditional disciplines such as epidemiology, statistics, anthropology, sociology, ethics, public policy, management, economics, education, social work, informatics, communications, and marketing. To fulfill current and coming health care needs, nontraditional MD-PhD students should be welcomed and supported as valuable members of our biomedical research workforce."
16530864,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to investigate factors related to self-rated health and to mortality among 2490 community-living elderly. Respondents were followed for 7.3 years for all-cause mortality. To compare the relative impact of each variable, we employed logistic regression analysis for self-rated health and Cox hazard analysis for mortality. Cox analysis stratified by gender, follow-up periods, age group, and functional status was also employed. Series of analysis found that factors associated with self-rated health and with mortality were not identical. Psychological factors such as perceived isolation at home or 'ikigai (one aspect of psychological well-being)' were associated with self-rated health only. Age, functional status, and social relations were associated both with self-rated health and mortality after controlling for possible confounders. Illnesses and functional status accounted for 35-40% of variances in the fair/poor self-rated health. Differences by gender and functional status were observed in the factors related to self-rated health. Overall, self-rated health effect on mortality was stronger for people with no functional impairment, for shorter follow-up period, and for young-old age group. Although, illnesses and functional status were major determinants of self-rated health, economical, psychological, and social factors were also related to self-rated health."
30992698,0,a,"Background and aim: Many health systems attempt to develop integrated and population health-oriented systems of care, but knowledge of strategies and interventions to support this effort is lacking. We aimed to identify specific redesign strategies and interventions, and to present evidence of their effectiveness. Method: A modified scoping review process was carried out. Fifteen relevant examples of integrated care organizations that incorporated a broad population health approach in countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development described in 57 articles and reports were included in analysis. Results: Seven key redesign strategies and multiple redesign interventions have been identified and are described. Most commonly used redesign strategies included focusing on health and wellness, embracing intersectoral action and partnerships, addressing health in vulnerable groups, and addressing a wide range of determinants of health, including making improvements in health services. Redesign interventions included creative and innovative ways of addressing clinical and non-clinical issues such as establishing housing surgeries in primary care, establlishing vast social and provider networks to support patients with complex needs and also broadening of the scope of services, workforce redesign and other. Potential reductions in the utilization of care and costs could be derived by the wider adoption of these strategies and interventions. Conclusion: Development of integrated and population health-oriented systems of care requires the redesign of how services are organized and delivered, and how organizations and care systems operate. Combining integration of care with the population health approach can be supported by a set of cohesive strategies and interventions aimed at preventing disease, addressing social determinants of health and improving health equity at both population- and individual-level."
17684859,1,a,"We assessed health-related lifestyles and their determinants among 600 Alexandria University students living in university hostels. Data were collected by questionnaires, and anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were taken. Most students were not satisfied with their situation in terms of accommodation, health and support. About 86% ate unhealthy diets, 33.8% were physically inactive, 25.3% were overweight or at risk of becoming overweight, 17.5% of male students were current smokers and 32.2% had poor sleep behaviours. About 28% of the students adopted 3 or more risk behaviours. About 23% reported low perceived health status and 80.3% felt they had low to moderate social support. There were significant sex differences regarding some behaviours."
18430691,1,a,"This review examines the impact of Global Health Initiatives (GHIs) on health equity, focusing on low- and middle-income countries. It is a summary of a literature review commissioned by the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. GHIs have emerged during the past decade as a mechanism in development assistance for health. The review focuses on three GHIs, the US President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the World Bank's Multi-country AIDS Programme (MAP) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. All three have leveraged significant amounts of funding for their focal diseases - together these three GHIs provide an estimated two-thirds of external resources going to HIV/AIDS. This paper examines their impact on gender equity. An analysis of these Initiatives finds that they have a significant impact on health equity, including gender equity, through their processes of programme formulation and implementation, and through the activities they fund and implement, including through their impact on health systems and human resources. However, GHIs have so far paid insufficient attention to health inequities. While increasingly acknowledging equity, including gender equity, as a concern, Initiatives have so far failed to adequately translate this into programmes that address drivers of health inequity, including gender inequities. The review highlights the comparative advantage of individual GHIs, which point to an increased need for, and continued difficulties in, harmonisation of activities at country level. On the basis of this comparative analysis, key recommendations are made. They include a call for equity-sensitive targets, the collection of gender-disaggregated data, the use of policy-making processes for empowerment, programmes that explicitly address causes of health inequity and impact assessments of interventions' effect on social inequities."
10960532,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Health policymakers are concerned about the proportion of people who say they are unwilling to receive a blood transfusion. This article examines how social, cultural, and political factors affect the perceived risk of transfusions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected as part of a large national telephone survey of 1204 people conducted in the United States in 1997 and 1998. The survey elicited images associated with blood transfusions and contained questions about the perceived risk of the blood supply, sensitivity to stigma, world views, trust, and demographics. RESULTS: The results showed that a substantial proportion of people do not consider the US blood supply to be safe and say they would not accept blood if hospitalized. The images evoked most frequently by the stimulus phrase ""blood transfusions"" were related to AIDS or HIV. The people who tend to perceive the greatest personal and public risk from blood transfusions are female, nonwhite, and less educated, and they have not previously received a transfusion. Sensitivity to stigma, mistrust, one's perceived inability to control hazardous activities and technologies, and fatalistic and egalitarian world views tend to be associated with heightened concern about the risk of blood transfusions. CONCLUSION: Risk perceptions need to be monitored to anticipate and deal with problems of public acceptance. Risk management strategies should be tailored to the specific characteristics of individuals that are important determinants of the perceived risk of transfusions."
24578832,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Disability is more based on social, rather than medical aspects. Lack of attention and social support may impact on participation of people with physical disability in various aspects and their return to normal life in the society. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine perceived social support and related factors among physically disabled in the city of Tehran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study by using simple random sampling was conducted on 136 people with physically disabled who were covered by Welfare Organization of Tehran. The Norbeck social support questionnaire was used .Multiple linear regression analysis with the backward method was used to identify the adjusted association between perceived social support as dependent variable and demographic variables as independent variables. RESULTS: The present sample comprised of 68 (50%) male and 68 (50%) female with the mean age of 33 (SD = 8.9) years. Based on the results, mean of functional support was 135. 57 (SD = 98.77) and mean of structural support was 77.37 (SD = 52.37). Regression analysis model, demonstrates that variables of age and marital status remained in the model as significant predictors of functional support (P = 0.003, P = 0.004, respectively) and structural support (P = 0.002, P = 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, participants in the study didn't have favorable status with respect to perceived social support (in all dimensions) from their social network members. While, social support as one of the social determinants of health, plays an important role in improving psychological conditions in people's lives; therefore, being aware of social support and designing effective interventions to improve it for the disabled is very important."
27062284,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, affecting the motor system with psychological difficulties also frequently reported. While explanations for psychological difficulties are historically situated within a biomedical framework, more recently the relevance of psychological determinants has become a research focus. This review therefore examines this relationship with the two most commonly reported psychological difficulties (anxiety and depression) in people with PD. METHOD: Databases were systematically searched up to December 17, 2013, identifying 24 studies meeting inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Significant predictors of heightened anxiety and depression included increased emotion-focused coping; less problem-focused coping; lower perceived control; more dominant beliefs about PD as part of a person's identity and influence on life; less social support and more avoidant personality types. CONCLUSIONS: Relationships between some specific psychological predictors and depression and anxiety seem well supported. The complexity of relationships between these psychological determinants should be taken into consideration when delivering psychological interventions."
17279404,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the different practice profiles of general practitioners (GPs) in order to test the hypothesis of heterogeneity in physician behaviour. DATA: For the year 2000, 4,660 GPs from two regions in France. VARIABLES: volume and structure of the physicians' medical activity, income level, personal characteristics, socioeconomic and geographical environment, characteristics of their patients. METHODS: A cluster analysis to identify different practice profiles and a regression analysis to display the determinants of the physicians' activity. RESULTS: Four different homogeneous groups can be identified, each one associating a physician's level of activity to his socioeconomic status. The level and the intensity of medical activity depend on individual factors, patients' characteristics as well as the socioeconomic context. CONCLUSIONS: There is no uniformity in the way GPs practice medicine. An immediate consequence is that any cost-containment measure that is applied uniformly to all GPs inevitably results in different outcomes according to the physicians' category type."
19635735,1,a,"Few prospective studies of smoking initiation have investigated a wide range of time-varying and invariant predictor variables at the individual and contextual levels concurrently. In this study (1999-2005), 877 Canadian students (mean age = 12.7 years) who had never smoked at baseline completed self-report questionnaires on cigarette smoking and 32 predictor variables in 20 survey cycles during secondary school. Height and weight were measured in survey cycles 1, 12, and 19. School administrators completed questionnaires on school tobacco control policies/activities, and trained observers collected data on access to tobacco products in commercial establishments near schools. Younger age, single-parent family status, smoking by parents, siblings, friends, and school staff, stress, impulsivity, lower self-esteem, feeling a need to smoke, not doing well at school, susceptibility to tobacco advertising, alcohol use, use of other tobacco products, and attending a smoking-tolerant school were independent determinants of smoking initiation. Independent determinants of daily smoking onset among initiators of nondaily smoking included smoking by siblings and friends, feeling a need to smoke, susceptibility to tobacco advertising, use of other tobacco products, and self-perceived mental and physical addiction. Adolescent tobacco control programs should address multiple individual and contextual-level risk factors. Strategies that address nicotine dependence symptoms are also needed for adolescents who have already initiated smoking."
30777496,0,a,"Background: With improving prognosis, the ability to return to work after cancer has become a realistic goal but only little is known regarding details such as sustainability, financial consequences, and potential determinants of return to work in long-term survivors in Germany. Methods: We studied return to work in a population-based sample of 1558 long-term cancer survivors, diagnosed in 1994-2004 with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer before age 60 (mean 50.1). Information regarding employment status and financial difficulties was obtained via mailed questionnaires from patients who were identified by six population-based cancer registries in Germany. Cumulative incidence of return to work was determined by time-to-event analysis with consideration of competing events. Chi(2) tests and multiple logistic regression modeling were employed to identify potential sociodemographic and clinical determinants of return to work. Results: Within a mean period since diagnosis of 8.3 years, 63% of all working-age cancer survivors initially returned to their old job and another 7% took up a new job. Seventeen percent were granted a disability pension, 6% were early retired (not cancer-related), 4% became unemployed, and 1% left the job market for other reasons. Resumption of work occurred within the first 2 years after diagnosis in 90% of all returnees. Cancer-related reduction of working hours was reported by 17% among all returnees and 6% quit their job due to cancer within 5 years past return to work. The probability of return to work was strongly related with age at diagnosis, tumor stage, education, and occupational class but did not differ with respect to the tumor site, gender nor marital status. Conclusions: Most long-term survivors after breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer of working-age are able to return to work. However, financial problems might arise due to a reduction in working hours. An additional provision of targeted interventions for high-risk groups should be discussed."
15798119,1,a,The National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal (NSNR) is a central component of British policy to reduce health disparities.

16094843,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: We aim at analysing the increase of CVDs in the Tunisian hospitals in order to assess the burden of NCDs in the transitional context. METHODS: Data are recorded through the Tunisian National Morbidity and Mortality Survey (TNMMS). In order to assess the CVDs (CHDs vs RHDs) trend, two representative samples of Cardiology Departements patients were compared one is selected from the TNMMS and the second from the hospitalisations recorded in 1992. Causes, stay duration, status at the end of the hospitalisation, transfer to another hospital and patients socio-demographic characteristics are recorded and compared for the two periods. All the diagnosis are coded referring to the DMC 10. To analyze the determinant of the epidemiological transition, we have elaborated the CVD causal pattern and we have documented all their determinants. RESULTS: CHD rate has dramatically increased, while RHD has decreased especially on men. In 1992, 39.2% of men and 11.8% of women were admitted for CHD. In 2002, these rate are respectivly 58.8% and 38.2% while RHD rates were, in 1992, 11.8% on men and 25.3% on women vs 4.4% and 11.7% respectively. CONCLUSION: This study has confirmed that so far controlling transmitted diseases seems to be successful, Tunisian people are about to face a new problems as hypertension, obesity, diabetes and tobacco smoking. The new challenge with the burden of diseases requires the implementation of a national strategy relevant to the epidemiological, social and economical transition. Population needs and cost effectiveness of interventions assessment is crucial to set the national priorities."
11297008,1,a,"BACKGROUND: With the introduction of the new consensus on 30 minutes of moderate physical activity preferably on all days of the week, exercise implemented into daily activities is promoted whereas structured activity programs lose importance. Activity levels of most older people don't come up with current recommendations. Therefore strategies to enhance attendance of older adults in physical activities should be developed. Group programs may be more effective in changing exercise behaviour of older adults than non-supervised physical activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in level of activity and psychosocial determinants of physical activity between seniors involved in an exercise class and seniors not engaged in any organised physical activity. METHODS: Seventy-five elderly who were currently involved in structured exercise classes and 75 elderly who did not participate in any organised physical activity during the previous year were recruited in senior citizens' centres and were asked to fill out a questionnaire. RESULTS: Subjects involved in an exercise program had higher levels of activity and reported more social influences and higher self-efficacy compared to the respondents practising on an individual basis. No differences were found in perceived barriers or benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Exercising in a group program gives the opportunity to accumulate some extra physical activity and positively affects the level of activity outside the program. Stimulating older adults to join a structured activity program in the company of family or friends in order to enhance supporting social influences and perceived competence could be an important intervention strategy."
17016900,1,a,"Caregiving is a demanding responsibility. Because of the de-institutionalization movement, much of the care provided by hospitals has been shifted to the community. Caregivers' issues cannot be overlooked. The purposes of the study are: (a) to understand meaning of caregiving, perceived social support and level of depression of caregivers during the transition phase immediately following a family members' discharge from the hospital to the community; (b) to determine the association between determinants and meaning of caregiving, perceived social support level of depression; (c) to determine the association between meaning of caregiving, perceived social support level of depression. Fifty five caregivers of schizophrenic patients were recruited from a private hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. Certain characteristics of caregivers were found to be associated with lower levels of depression, meaning of caregiving and perceived social support. Perceived social support was shown to be a mediator between the meaning of caregiving and caregivers' level of depression. Despite the small sample size, the findings can serve as a reference for mental health professionals as they develop mental health care program for patients and also for caregivers."
15935621,1,a,"To compare the health-related quality of life (HRQL) for patients with epilepsy and health subjects, we collected the clinical and demographic data and information on health states by using the Taiwan version of World Health Organization quality of life (WHOQOL)-BREF questionnaire in 296 patients (aged 19-73 years) with confirmed active epilepsy visiting the clinic of National Taiwan University Hospital, and 296 age-, gender-, municipal- and education-matched Taiwanese healthy subjects sampled from a national health interview survey. Multiple regression analyses with stepwise selection strategy were conducted to study risk factors for impairment of HRQL. Patients with epilepsy have poorer HRQL than the healthy population in physical, psychological and social domains but not in environment domain (p<0.005). Patients with less than 4 attacks during the previous 1 month had a better score in the availability and quality of health and social care in environment domain than healthy subjects (p<0.05). After controlling other determinants, seizure frequency, and comobid with other diseases are the important factors in predicting HRQL for epilepsy patients. Patients with employment and married had a significantly better HRQL. Effective control of seizure frequency and thoughtful promotion of positive attitudes in community are essential to improve the HRQL of epilepsy patients."
22966959,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Nutrition and physical activity are major determinants of health and quality of life; however, there exists little research focusing on determinants of these behaviours in older adults. This is important, since just as these behaviours vary according to subpopulation, it is likely that the determinants also vary. An understanding of the modifiable determinants of nutrition and physical activity behaviours among older adults to take into account the specific life-stage context is required in order to develop effective interventions to promote health and well-being and prevent chronic disease and improve quality of life. METHODS: The aim of this work is to identify how intrapersonal, social and environmental factors influence nutrition and physical activity behaviours among older adults living in urban and rural areas. This study is a cohort study of adults aged 55-65 years across urban and rural Victoria, Australia. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline in 2010 and will complete follow-up questionnaires in 2012 and 2014. Self-report questionnaires will be used to assess outcomes such as food intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviours, anthropometry and quality of life. Explanatory variables include socioeconomic position, and measures of the three levels of influence on older adults' nutrition and physical activity behaviours (intrapersonal, social and perceived environmental influences). DISCUSSION: Obesity and its determinant behaviours, physical inactivity and poor diet are major public health concerns and are significant determinants of the quality of life among the ageing population. There is a critical need for a better understanding of the determinants of nutrition and physical activity in this important target group. This research will provide evidence for the development of effective policies and programs to promote and support increased physical activity and healthy eating behaviours among older adults."
19191176,1,a,"PURPOSE: International and national programs to control vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD) among children in developing countries are reducing the magnitude but VADD still occurs in deprived populations. The purpose of the study was to estimate the prevalence of and identify risk factors for xerophthalmia in children aged 6-71 months living in slums in Pune, India in 2003. METHODS: Children were enrolled into a cross sectional study from randomly selected Anganwadis (kindergartens) in selected slums using proportional to size sampling. Parents/caregivers were interviewed by social workers about night blindness, risk factors for VADD at individual and household levels, intake of vitamin A rich foods, and history of vitamin A supplementation. Children were examined for signs of xerophthalmia by an ophthalmologist. Risk factors for xerophthalmia were explored using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: 1,589 children were examined (response rate 80.2%) 22 of whom had xerophthalmia, prevalence 1.32% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.88%). There were no gender differences. Independent risk factors for xerophthalmia were having an illiterate mother [Odds ratio [OR]15.4 (95% CI 4.4-64.1)] and lack of a safe water supply [OR 6.11, 95% CI 2.5-5.1)]. Only 11.3 and 13.3% of children in different slums had taken vitamin A supplements. CONCLUSIONS: Xerophthalmia was at a level of public health significance in children living in slums in Pune. This study highlights the importance of female education and indicates that vitamin A supplementation and other approaches to control need to be improved in children living in deprived areas like urban slums."
30406071,0,a,"Background: Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) has a range of health benefits across the life span. Although many putative determinants of children's MVPA have been identified, their causal status is uncertain due to difficulties in adjusting for potential confounders. Objective: To inform promotion of children's MVPA we therefore aimed to examine well-known child-, family- and contextual predictors of MVPA in middle childhood, by applying a fixed effects regression approach, which rules out the influence of all unmeasured time-invariant confounders. Methods: Two birth cohorts of children living in the city of Trondheim, Norway were invited to participate (82.0% consented). The participants were followed-up biennially from age 6 to 10 years (n = 800) between 2009 and 2014. MVPA in children was recorded by accelerometers and child-, family- and contextual factors were obtained through interviews and questionnaires. Predictors included (i) child-level factors: the child's time outdoors, organized sports participation, athletic self-concept, self-reported screen time and objectively measured sedentariness; (ii) family factors: self-reported parental MVPA and actively transporting the child to school; and (iii) contextual factors: parental socio-economic status (SES), access to playgrounds and ballparks, traffic safety, and having a garden. A three-wave prospective study was conducted with a hybrid fixed effects regressions analysis adjusting for all time-invariant confounders to examine predictors of MVPA. Results: Children evidenced increased MVPA when they spent more time outside, spent less time being sedentary and when the family had a garden and lived in a traffic-safe area. Conclusion: Adjusting for measured time-varying and all unmeasured time-invariant confounders renders many previously identified child and family factors without impact on MVPA in children. However, several contextual factors may promote MVPA in middle childhood, and efforts to facilitate children being outside in environments that promote physical activity (e.g., being outside, in gardens, or otherwise traffic safe areas) may prove important."
16204363,1,a,"CONTEXT: Ghrelin may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying risk factor clustering observed in the metabolic syndrome, but this has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to study the association between ghrelin and the metabolic syndrome and identify social and behavioral determinants of ghrelin. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. SETTING: The setting of this work was the Rancho Bernardo Study. PARTICIPANTS: Study subjects included 1513 men and women, aged 51-90 yr in 1984-1987. OUTCOMES: Total ghrelin, measured by RIA, and the metabolic syndrome, defined using Adult Treatment Panel III diagnostic criteria, were the outcome measures. RESULTS: Levels of ghrelin (mean +/- SD) did not differ between the 848 men (1451 +/- 532 pg/ml) and the 665 women (1459 +/- 672 pg/ml) or by age. Education, alcohol intake, and smoking history were each significantly and positively associated with ghrelin in a dose-related manner, independent of body mass index (BMI). Compared with participants with the lowest third of ghrelin levels, the age- and sex-adjusted odds of having the metabolic syndrome were 18% lower in the middle third and 53% lower in the highest third. This corresponds to a 21% decrease per SD increase in ghrelin (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.69, 0.89; P < or = 0.001); this was attenuated to 13% (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.75, 1.01; P = 0.07), after adjustment for BMI. Of the five metabolic syndrome components, only the association between ghrelin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was independent of BMI. A significant association independent of BMI was also observed between insulin and ghrelin. CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin levels are influenced by lifestyle factors. The inverse association between endogenous ghrelin and the metabolic syndrome is largely explained by the strong ghrelin-BMI association."
19342853,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a recognized and important outcome after stroke. An increased survival and the presence of moderate impairment in long-term stroke survivors impact their HRQoL. METHODS: HRQoL measures and HRQoL determinants in stroke survivors are reviewed. RESULTS: Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in western countries. Specific HRQoL scales have been developed in the last years, such as the Stroke Impact Scale, the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale, the Stroke and Aphasia HRQoL Scale, and the Burden of Stroke Scale. Disability and poststroke depression are consistent determinants of HRQoL. Other determinants include female sex, coping strategies, and social support. Poststroke depression affects HRQoL, functional recovery, cognitive function and healthcare use in stroke survivors. Stroke caregivers have lower HRQoL, greater prevalence of stress and depression, economical burden, and changes in social relationships. Advancing age and anxiety in patients and caregivers, high dependency and poor family support identify caregivers at risk of adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Physical and psychosocial well-being is greatly affected in stroke survivors and their caregivers."
11888046,1,a,"The present study analyzed what determinants are important to describe and explain the intention of testicular self-examination (TSE) for young men aged 15-19 attending senior high school (response rate 80%, n = 274). The questionnaire assessed determinants, including knowledge, attitude (positive and negative consequences, anticipated regret, and moral obligation), social influence (social norm, social support and modeling) and self-efficacy. Knowledge of testicular cancer and TSE was very low. Only 2% of the subjects reported regularly performing TSE. After hearing of TSE (through the questionnaire), 41% of all young men had a positive intention to start performing TSE regularly. The various intention groups (positive, neutral and negative) differed significantly on almost all of the determinants. Multiple regression analysis showed that young men who where anxious about TSE and those who were not anxious had different determinants explaining the variance in the intention to perform TSE regularly (R2 = 41-57%). Differences in determinants of intention between young men who are anxious about TSE and young men who are not can be used to design health education interventions that may therefore be more effective for these different subgroups."
11048582,1,a,"Aiming to analyze the mild to moderate growth retardation associate factors in children at school age, a case control study was conducted with 153 pairs of seven and eight years old children from public schools of the outskirts of the city. The cases were defined as children with a height for age(H/A) between -1 and -2 Z score, according to NCHS/WHO standards, and matched with a H/A +/- 0.5 Z-score children of same age, gender, school, classroom and class time, as controls. The height was measured at school according to WHO rules by trained professionals, and household visits were carried out to obtain environmental and socio-economic data. Initially the data was analyzed by the univariate conditional method and then, the statistically significant variables were included in a model of multivariate logistic regression analysis. As a result, the risk factors remaining at the end of the multivariate analyses, by Odds Ratio and it's 95% Confidence Interval were respectively:--mother's height: for each decrease of one standard deviation the OR increased 1.84(CI: 1.35 to 2.49); inadequate feeding pattern: OR = 2.12; CI: 1.17 to 3.83, very low socio-economic level: OR = 9.2; CI: 3.35 to 25.13, low birth weight: OR = 2.59; CI: 1.44 to 4.63 and smoking during pregnancy: OR = 1.75; CI: 0.98 to 3.12. These results highlight the environment as a determinant factor for growth performance during the first years of the child's life. Despite this, the significant OR for Mother's height allows the assumption that besides the environment, the parent's height has to be considered as one of the determinants of height deficit, even for the low socioeconomic level."
11682918,1,a,"Given the longevity achievable with current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for persons with HIV infection, quality of life (QOL) has emerged as a significant medical outcome measure, and its enhancement as an important goal. This review highlights current knowledge about the relevance and complexity of physical, psychological, and social factors as determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infected persons. Existing data suggest physical manifestations, antiretroviral therapy, psychological well-being, social support systems, coping strategies, spiritual well-being, and psychiatric comorbidities are important predictors of QOL in this population. Health care professionals are encouraged to become familiar with the full spectrum of predictors of HRQOL, which may eventually contribute to the development of multiple entry points for interventions in promoting QOL in these patients. Identifying variables influencing QOL among diverse groups, particularly women, injection drug users, and adolescents, and designing effective interventions specific to the social and psychological well-being of HIV-infected individuals are areas for research."
29398554,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The role of maternal serum triglycerides (TGs) in the development of fetal macrosomia in different subgroups of body mass index (BMI) has received little attention. The aim of this study was to determine the association between the level of maternal TGs and fetal macrosomia in Iranian pregnant women of different BMI subgroups with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: This cohort study was conducted on 305 pregnant women with GDM referred for glucose control to Kowsar Hospital in Qazvin, Iran. Level of TGs was measured on the 24th-28th weeks of pregnancy. The ROC curve of the level of TGs was depicted in BMI subgroups to predict fetal macrosomia. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk of macrosomia per 1-SD increase in the level of TGs. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia did not significantly differ across BMI subgroups. Macrosomia was more prevalent in obese women (32.2%) than overweight (19.1%) and normal weight (11.1%) women (P < 0.05). A 1-SD increase in the level of TG was associated with 4.2 and 1.9 times increased risk of macrosomia in normal weight (P < 0.01) and overweight (P < 0.01) women, respectively. Serum level of TGs was not associated with macrosomia in any adjustment models in obese women. The area under the curve of the level of TGs for macrosomia was 0.828 (95% CI: 0.712-0.911, P < 0.001) and 0.711 (95% CI: 0.639-0.775, P < 0.001) in normal weight and overweight women, respectively. CONCLUSION: Hypertriglyceridemia was a predictor of macrosomia in non-obese women. More studies on different ethnicities and lifestyles are necessary to determine the association between the level of maternal TG and fetal macrosomia in BMI subgroups."
10927844,1,a,"Community members, service providers, and elected representatives in two Toronto communities were asked to identify community factors influencing the health of community members. Many of the identified barriers to health related to government policies and actions. Cutbacks in federal transfers to provinces and provincial cutbacks in funding for agencies, reductions in social assistance, ending of new social housing, and other policy changes were seen as negatively impacting the health of the community and its members. These perceptions were remarkably consistent with emerging findings concerning the determinants of health. Implications for public health practice were considered."
11020935,1,a,"In Bangladesh, the total fertility rate declined from more than six children per woman of reproductive age in 1980 to 3.3 children per woman in 1996. Much discussion has ensued about the circumstances responsible for this decline and, in particular, about the contribution made by the national family planning program. For this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with 67 women concerning the factors influencing their reproductive behavior. The participants, residents of a rural area in southwestern Bangladesh, consisted of two groups: women who were currently practicing family planning and women who had never practiced or had not done so for at least four years. The findings suggest that the family planning program has played an important role in reducing family size, but also indicate that economic and social changes, and especially growing aspirations (particularly for a life outside agriculture) have combined with changes in the nature of family decision making to make couples more receptive to the idea of family planning."
26650382,0,a,"HIV is uncommon in most US counties but travels quickly through vulnerable communities when it strikes. Tracking behavior through social media may provide an unobtrusive, naturalistic means of predicting HIV outbreaks and understanding the behavioral and psychological factors that increase communities' risk. General action goals, or the motivation to engage in cognitive and motor activity, may support protective health behavior (e.g., using condoms) or encourage activity indiscriminately (e.g., risky sex), resulting in mixed health effects. We explored these opposing hypotheses by regressing county-level HIV prevalence on action language (e.g., work, plan) in over 150 million tweets mapped to US counties. Controlling for demographic and structural predictors of HIV, more active language was associated with lower HIV rates. By leveraging language used on social media to improve existing predictive models of geographic variation in HIV, future targeted HIV-prevention interventions may have a better chance of reaching high-risk communities before outbreaks occur."
31086789,0,a,"Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder characterized by massive damage in various fields of development. Impaired social interaction and communication skills, unusual behavior or interests, and repetitive activities are considerably disabling in these patients. There are several challenges in diagnosis of ASD patients such as co-existing epilepsy, difference in clinician attitudes and possibly multifactorial etiology of autistic behavior among children and adults. Research in recent years has emphasized a possible connection between mutations in PTEN and macrocephaly (head circumference > 97th centile). Methods: Articles in English Language were searched from international databases including Medline (PubMed), Google Scholar, Scopus, and CINHAL from January 1998 to January 2016. Results: The results showed that among 2940 patients with behavioral disorders, 2755 individuals had ASD, and 35 cases with macrocephaly had mutations in PTEN. About 77% of the articles (7/9) analyzed mutations in PTEN in patients with head circumference more than 2SD away from the mean, but did not check mutations in this gene in other ASD patients without macrocephaly. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first systematic review on human PTEN mutations and classical autistic behavior. Conclusion: We conclude that the presence of macrocephaly may not be sufficient to examine the PTEN mutation in this group; however, surveying this gene in all cases of macrocephaly seems to be necessary."
11784904,1,a,"A population-based case-control study was carried out to identify determinant factors for post-neonatal infant deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia, and malnutrition in Greater Metropolitan Belo Horizonte, Southeast Brazil. From May 1, 1991, to April 30, 1992, 511 post-neonatal deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia, and malnutrition were selected after investigation of medical records to validate cause of death. Of this total, 396 deaths were compared to a neighborhood control group, matched for age. The study was carried out in a low-income area with a high proportion of families living in shantytowns. The article discusses the methodology and selected socioeconomic factors. Logistic regression analysis indicated that number of household appliances, mother's and father's education, and mother's marital and work status were significantly associated with risk of infant death, i.e., they were determinants of infant deaths due to avoidable causes."
28830654,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes the social determinants associated with the overweight or obesity prevalence of 85 elementary schools during the 2010-11 academic year in a predominantly Hispanic school district. METHODS: A binomial logistic regression is used to analyze the aggregate overweight or obesity rate of a school by the percent of Hispanic students in each school, selected school and neighborhood characteristics, and its geographical location. RESULTS: The proportion of Hispanic enrollment more readily explains a school's aggregate overweight or obesity rate than social determinants or spatial location. Number of fast food establishments and the academic ranking of a school appear to slightly impact the aggregate prevalence rate. Spatial location of school is not a significant factor, controlling for other determinants. CONCLUSIONS: An elementary school's overall overweight or obesity rate provides a valuable health indicator to study the social determinants of obesity among Hispanics and other students within a local neighborhood."
12215241,1,a,"The psychosocial and behavioral determinants of smoking cessation from late adolescence to early adulthood were investigated in a sample of 711 individuals followed from 1990 (grade 12) to 1995. Analyses stratified by sex indicated that female smokers were more likely to quit 5 years later if they had fewer friends who smoked, less parental approval of their smoking, weaker intentions to continue smoking, higher smoking resistance self-efficacy and better grades at grade 12. Several of these associations could be accounted for by smoking quantity. Similar analyses for male smokers indicated that those who eventually quit were more likely to have fewer cigarette offers, weaker intentions to smoke, better grades and an intact nuclear family at grade 12. The associations for males could not be explained by smoking quantity. Interaction analyses showed few significant sex differences in the predictors of smoking cessation. Results suggest that cessation programs should continue to target parental and peer influences, as well as skills at resisting social influences to smoke, through late adolescence, but do not indicate that such programs need to be adapted to the special needs of male and female smokers."
12815083,1,a,"Racial and ethnic disparities in health care continue to be a major impediment to improving the health of many communities in the United States. Efforts must be directed at the multiple social, economic, and historic determinants of health disparities. In addition, health care providers must be aware of these determinants and must have the tools to address them in their individual relationships with patients. This article describes a partnership that arose out of the mutual recognition by a community organization and public hospital of the need to (a) teach physicians how to recognize the root causes of health disparities, (b) improve their cross-cultural understanding and communication, and (c) enhance their awareness of the capacity of community resources to positively impact their patients' lives."
16676729,1,a,"The Authors analyse and discuss the contents of some recent international meetings devoted to Public Health, namely the 10th Congress of the WFPHA, the 12th British annual Forum of Public Health and the 12th Conference of the EUPHA. Their efforts to evaluate health services comes off enriched with new scenarios of integration and convergence. Objectives of global interest in the world cannot be faced by individual countries alone: on the contrary, the whole scientific community of public health operators must be involved. The cultural, social and economic development is the unavoidable condition to increase the health level of the populations. No health organization with the characteristics of excellence can exist without a comparable, balanced development regarding the society and its economy. With such considerations in mind, the European Commission in 1997 has began to develop the Health Monitoring Programme, with the aim to build a system for monitoring health in the UE. Within this Programme, the Study ECHI 1 (European Community Health Indicators 1) has been published, which includes 4 large groups of indicators (demographic and socioeconomic indicators, health indicators, determinants of health/disease indicators, health services indicators); such a study was performed with the cooperation of OCSE and WHO/Euro researchers. The following ECHI 2 research did not change the supporting philosophy of ECHI 1. We are trying to evaluate whether the intervention of health operators and health structures could influence - increasing or decreasing - the phenomena described and measured by the indicators, inviting the readers to start a debate with us."
18325417,1,a,"PROBLEM: Preventive interventions to reduce occupational injuries and health problems in farmers require the identification of factors that contribute to unsafe and health damaging behavior. This paper describes the development and validation of a self-report questionnaire, which measures the determinants of occupational health-related behaviors in farmers. METHOD: A representative sample of 283 Flemish farmers completed a provisional 135 item questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, measuring four behaviors related to occupational health (machinery use, animal handling, preventing falls, and pesticide use), as well as the intentions, attitudes, perceived social norms, and self-efficacy for each of these behaviors. RESULTS: The fit indices of the Confirmatory Factor Analysis turned out not to be sufficient to reproduce the dimensions of the TPB. Therefore exploratory factor analysis was use to determine the underlying dimensions. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) on the behavioral items yielded single component solutions explaining a considerable proportion of the variance for each behavior and for behavioral intentions. Principal component analyses toward an a priori three-component structure reflecting the TPB dimensions did not produce sufficient congruence for the determinants of the four behaviors. Subsequent Varimax rotations and discarding of redundant items resulted in three component solutions explaining 50% to 69% of the variance in the determinants of each behavior, corresponding with the dimensions of the TPB. Internal consistencies ranged from .25 to .89. Scale scores accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in intention and self-reported behavior. IMPACT: The study demonstrates the validity of the TPB in predicting behavior related to occupational safety and health in farmers, and provides a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure the cognitive concepts featured in this model. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Both authors share the same view on this study's impact on industry. In recent years, efforts have been made to create awareness among farmers about occupational hazards, and to encourage farmers to perform safer and healthier behavior. However, only a limited number of these interventions have proven to be successful. A possible reason for this relative lack of success is that interventions typically focus on risk analysis and raising awareness, whereas the literature on preventive health behavior change indicates that knowledge and awareness with regard to possible health risks are neither necessary nor sufficient to change behavior. To raise the effectiveness of prevention programs, other relevant determinants of behavior need to be addressed as well, such as: attitudes, perceived social norms, self efficacy, and elements of the physical environment that elicit or reinforce behavior. These determinants play a key role in psychological models of health related behavior, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior. Thus far, the use of these models within agricultural settings is fairly limited. This study demonstrates the validity of the Theory of Planned Behavior in predicting behavior related to occupational safety and health in farmers, and provides a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure the cognitive concepts featured in this model."
27568318,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Considering the growing number of patients who suffer from cardiovascular and coronary artery disease and the significant importance of angiography in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, this study investigated the effects of position change on the acute complications of coronary angiography. METHODS: This study was a randomized clinical trial. Sixty patients undergoing coronary angiography, which was performed by a single operator were selected by convenience sampling method and were assigned to intervention or control groups by randomized block design (30 cases in each group). Intervention group patients' position was changed according to schedule, whereas patients in the control group remained in the supine position in complete bed rest. At the entrance hours, 3, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the angiography, patients in both groups were evaluated in terms of vascular complications, urinary retention, low back pain, groin pain, and comfort. Data were analyzed by repeated measures, Friedman, Mann-Whitney, chi-square, independent t-test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests with SPSS-22. RESULTS: The two groups did not show any significant difference in terms of demographic, clinical, and preinterventional catheterization characteristics (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference with regard to vascular complications including hematoma (P = 0.149), bleeding (P > 0.01), bruise (P = 0.081), and thrombosis in the two groups of patients during 5 consecutive reviews. However, there was a significant statistical difference regarding low back pain (P < 0.001), groin pain (P < 0.001), urinary retention (P = 0.02), and comfort (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that changing the positions of patients after angiography based on the provided program created no change in the incidence of vascular complications (hematoma, bleeding, thrombosis, and bruise) but resulted in reduced severity of back pain, groin pain, urinary retention, and increased patients' comfort."
22626258,0,a,"BACKGROUND: More adolescents in Ethiopia are in school today than ever, but few studies have assessed the sexual behaviour of these learners. Thus, this study tried to assess pre-marital sexual debut and factors associated with it among in-school adolescents in Eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional school-based study was conducted using a facilitator guided selfadministered questionnaire. Respondents were students attending regular school classes in fourteen high schools. The proportion of adolescents involved in pre-marital sexual debut and the mean age at sexual debut was computed. Factors associated with pre-marital sexual debut were assessed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: About one in four, 686 (24.8%) never married in-school adolescent respondents reported pre-marital sexual debut of these 28.8% were males and 14.7% were females (p < 0.001). Pre-marital sexual debut was more common among adolescents who had their parents in urban areas (Adjusted OR and [95% CI] = 1.42 [1.17-1.73]), who received higher pocket money per month (Adjusted OR and [95% CI] = 1.56 [1.19-2.04]), who perceived low self-educational rank (Adjusted OR and [95% CI] = 1.89 [1.07-3.34]) and who lived in rented houses (Adjusted OR and [95% CI] = 1.32 [1.03-1.70]). The females and those who were less influenced by external pressure were more protected against pre-marital sexual debut (Adjusted OR and [95% CI] = 0.44 [0.35-0.56; 0.62 [0.52-0.74, respectively]) than their counterparts. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of in-school adolescents were engaged in sexual relationship. Thus, public health interventions should consider the broader determinants of premarital sexual debut, including the ecological factors in which the behavior occurs."
18568706,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has damaging impacts on victims and family members' lives and their long-term social integration constitutes a major challenge. PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to document the repercussions of TBI on victims' long-term social integration (10 years post-trauma) and the contribution made by the services received from the point of view of TBI victims and family caregivers. This article examines the determinants of long-term social integration as well as the impact of TBI on family caregivers. METHODS: A qualitative design was used (semi-directed interviews). The sample consisted of 22 individuals who had sustained a moderate or severe TBI and 21 family caregivers. RESULTS: The results show that TBI is an experience that continues to present difficulties, even 10 years after the accident, and that different barriers contribute to this difficulty: not going back to work, depressive episodes, problems in relationships and sequellae. Family caregivers must help TBI victims confront the barriers in their path. IMPLICATIONS: This study adopts a longitudinal perspective to help professionals determine how to intervene with TBI victims and their families. It validates the importance of having clients and family caregivers describe their reality."
27491283,0,a,"The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize evidence describing delivery of healthcare services to adolescents while in foster care and to young adults after they exit foster care. The long-term, deleterious effect of abuse and/or neglect by caregivers among youth who have been placed in foster care is grounded in empirical evidence demonstrating the relationship between long-term health needs and exposure to trauma in childhood. Evidence is needed to provide culturally-specific care and also to identify knowledge gaps in the care of adolescents and young adults who have been in the foster care system. Peer-reviewed research studies published between 2004 and 2014 that include samples of youth 12 to 30 years of age are included in the review. Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria for the review. Physical and behavioral healthcare needs among youth with foster care experience are significant. The ability to adequately meet health needs are inextricable from the ability to negotiate resources and to successfully interact with adults. Challenges that youth with foster care histories experience when transitioning into young adulthood are comparable to other populations of vulnerable youth not in foster care. Nurses must use each healthcare encounter to assess how the social determinants of health facilitate or impede optimal health among youth with foster care experience. The development of integrated intervention strategies to inform best practice models is a priority for current and former foster care youth as they transition into young adulthood."
30339069,0,a,"An absolute decline in US life expectancy in low education whites has alarmed policy makers and attracted media attention. Depending on which studies are correct, low education white women have lost between 3 and 5 years of lifespan; men, between 6 months and 3 years. Although absolute declines in life expectancy are relatively rare, some commentators see the public alarm as reflecting a racist concern for white lives over black ones. How ought we ethically to evaluate this lifespan contraction in low education whites? Should we care, or is it racist to care? Does it constitute an injustice or reflect justice being done? I argue that the lifespan contraction in low education whites violates key normative criteria used to make determinations of health justice, and that these judgments do not vitiate concerns about racism. I conclude with reflections on US population health policy and building an inclusive health equity movement."
23587104,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There are many social and cultural factors affecting the sexual knowledge of adolescents. This study measured the sexual health knowledge level of adolescents and identified its association with role of parents, friends and school environment in adolescent girls in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Four hundred and nineteen Saudi female students belonging to intermediate and secondary grades were randomly selected from four public and private girl schools. 255 (69.8%) students were </=15 years and 164 (39.2%) were >15 years. A self-administered structured questionnaire comprising of socio-demographic information, role of parents and teachers, availability of school curriculum on sexual health was used. Sexual health knowledge was assessed through questions on identification of physical changes during puberty for </=15 years and separate questions on sexually transmitted infections for >15 years. RESULTS: 54% of </=15 years and 70.7% of >15 years had poor sexual health knowledge. Multivariate analysis found determinants for poor sexual health education in </=15 years are: lower education level of both parents (OR 10.87; 95% CI 2.44-48.38), second birth order or more (OR 2.32; 95% CI 1.24-4.33) and absence of school curriculum on sexual health (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.33-0.95). Determinants for >15 years of age are : mothers with low literacy (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.42-6.71), as for sources of poor sexual knowledge : parents (OR 10.10; 95% CI 2.70-37.74), schools (OR 6.95; 95% CI 1.95-24.78) maids (OR 4.57; 95% CI 1.26-16.59) and media (OR 5.12; 95% CI 1.29-20.07) were statistically significant factors. CONCLUSION: Government agencies with collaboration of all stake holders should develop policies and programs for implementing and evaluating integrated and comprehensive sexual educational programs for adolescents in Saudi Arabia."
15598757,1,a,"Our understanding of longitudinal patterns of adolescent smoking development and the determinants of these patterns is limited. The present study evaluated adolescent smoking trajectories and characterized these trajectories with social, psychological, and behavioral factors in a cohort of adolescents assessed annually from grades 9 to 12. Complete data (smoking practices, novelty seeking, academic performance, substance use, peer smoking, physical activity and sports participation, and tobacco ad receptivity) were available on 968 participants; data were analyzed using latent class growth modeling. Four adolescent smoking trajectories emerged: never smokers, experimenters, earlier/faster smoking adopters, and later/slower smoking adopters. Early adopters were characterized by their high novelty seeking personality, depressive symptoms, poorer academic performance, and receptivity to tobacco advertising, as well as their exposure to other smokers, and use of other substances. Later adopters were characterized quite similarly to the early adopters, although they tended to perform better in school and to be more involved in sports. Experimenters also shared many of these same risk characteristics but to a lesser degree. Overall, never smokers were the most conventional in their profile. These data suggest that there is significant heterogeneity in the timing, rate, and intensity of smoking progression. Adolescent smoking prevention and intervention programs will need to consider this heterogeneity and tailor or enhance attention to risk and protective factors depending on the subpopulation."
18562877,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine determinants of quality of care provided by pediatric emergency departments (PEDs) in tertiary European centers. METHODS: Analysis of questionnaires was sent to directors of PEDs. Questionnaires were sent through the pediatric research group of the European Society for Emergency Medicine. Three major descriptive categories were included in a 28-point questionnaire: institution's pediatric inpatient capabilities, scope of services, and medical staff education and structure. RESULTS: Sixty-five questionnaires were completed in full. Fifty-three tertiary medical centers from 14 countries were included in the study. In 86.8% of these institutions, the PED is separated from the adult emergency department; 91% have a pediatric intensive care unit, and 72% have an in-patient pediatric trauma service. Eighty-eight percent of the PEDs have incorporated triage protocols. Social service was not available in 17% of the departments. Sedation for painful procedures is provided by the staff in 77% of the PEDs. Only 24% of the PED medical directors have been formally trained in pediatric emergency medicine. In 17% of the departments, there is a 24-hour 7-day residents' coverage with no attending pediatrician or pediatric emergency medicine-trained physician. CONCLUSIONS: According to this pilot study, the basic services provided by tertiary PEDs in Europe appear to be appropriate. Physicians training level and staffing may not be adequate to achieve optimal patient outcome."
27335366,0,a,"This case presentation of a 19-year-old Ethiopian woman diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma reveals the barriers the patient has to medical treatment, including poverty and a lack of national infrastructure. The patient lives a life of poverty, and the outcome of her illness is a result of her being unable to overcome barriers to accessing health care due to inability to afford transport, lodging and treatment. In this case, the patient's vulnerability to disease due to her poverty is not overcome because of lack of infrastructure. The infrastructure fails to develop because of inadequate investment and other delays in building. The end result is that the patient is vulnerable to disease. Her disease process impacts her family and their contribution to Ethiopia's development."
15132249,1,a,"This article addresses newly emerging concepts regarding the examination of outcomes in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Three important factors have prompted a change toward a broader approach to outcome measurement: (1) the recent endorsement of the World Health Organization classification scheme of functioning, disability, and health; (2) recognition of the importance of the role of child and environmental factors in modifying outcome; and (3) appreciation of the challenges faced at key transitions during development. Comparison of the literature on outcomes in children with CP published in 2002 with studies published 10 years earlier demonstrates an increased number of studies and a wider range of outcome measures used to characterize the functioning of these children. A better understanding of the extent and nature of the outcomes and their determinants is critical to guide clinical decision making and program planning to maximize community integration, social participation, and overall well-being of the child and family."
16000340,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The new public health rejects old individualist attempts at improving health and embraces community-based approaches in reducing health inequalities. Primary Care Trusts in England face the challenge of converting community participation in health into reality. This study explores differences in perception of participation between lay and professional stakeholders of a community health project for a South Asian population in Greater Manchester. METHODS: In-depth interviews and focus groups were used to explore the views of professional and lay stakeholders. All data were audio-taped, transcribed and analysed for emerging themes using a qualitative framework. RESULTS: Professionals talked of working in partnership with the community but lay stakeholders did not feel that they had control over the project. There were problems in engaging the community and local health professionals in the project. Lack of cultural awareness hampered participation in the project. There was agreement that the project improved the self-confidence of participants and created a more informed population. However, there was little support for claims of improvements in social cohesion and changes in lifestyle directly as a result of the project. CONCLUSION: Converting the rhetoric of community participation in health into reality is a greater challenge than was envisaged by policy makers. Marginalized communities may not be willing participants and issues of language and cultural sensitivity are important. Project outcomes need to be agreed to ensure projects are evaluated appropriately. Projects with South Asian communities should not be seen to be dealing with all 'ethnic health' issues without addressing changes in statutory organizations and other wider social determinants of health."
31271940,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In both the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US), health inequities are proving resistant to improvement. Nurses are ideally placed to advocate for social justice. It is therefore important that nurse education encourages awareness of the social determinants of health and equips students to act to address health inequity. However, little is known about student nurses' attitudes to social justice and poverty and the impact of pedagogical strategies used to teach the determinants and patterns of health inequities. OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare UK and US student nurses' attitudes towards social justice and poverty before and after learning about social determinants of health and health inequities. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with embedded before and after design using validated measures. SETTING: Two universities: one urban UK university and one US university with urban and rural campuses. PARTICIPANTS: 230 student nurses in the UK (n=143) and US (n=87) enrolled in courses teaching content including health inequities and social determinants of health. RESULTS: Student nurses generally disagreed with stigmatizing statements about people living in poverty and mostly agreed with statements promoting social justice. However, US students were significantly more likely to have positive attitudes towards both social justice (p=0.001) and poverty (p<0.001). In multiple regression analyses, engagement in social justice-promoting activities, activism and higher levels of education were associated with positive attitudes to social justice and poverty. Statistically significant positive changes in attitudes to poverty and social justice after their courses were observed only among US student nurses. CONCLUSION: UK and US student nurses' attitudes to poverty and social justice were generally positive. Education around social determinants of health and health inequity had a different effect in the UK and the US. There is a need to explore further what specific components of educational programmes lead to positive changes in attitudes."
22318665,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The authors aimed to examine whether changes in health risk behaviour rates alter the relationships between behaviours during adolescence, by comparing clustering of risk behaviours at different time points. DESIGN: Comparison of two cohort studies, the Twenty-07 Study ('earlier cohort', surveyed in 1987 and 1990) and the 11-16/16+ Study ('later cohort', surveyed 1999 and 2003). SETTING: Central Clydeside Conurbation around Glasgow City. PARTICIPANTS: Young people who participated in the Twenty-07 and 11-16/16+ studies at ages 15 and 18-19. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: The authors analysed data on risk behaviours in both early adolescence (started smoking prior to age 14, monthly drinking and ever used illicit drugs at age 15 and sexual intercourse prior to age 16) and late adolescence (age 18-19, current smoking, excessive drinking, ever used illicit drugs and multiple sexual partners) by gender and social class. RESULTS: Drinking, illicit drug use and risky sexual behaviour (but not smoking) increased between the earlier and later cohort, especially among girls. The authors found strong associations between substance use and sexual risk behaviour during early and late adolescence, with few differences between cohorts, or by gender or social class. Adjusted ORs for associations between each substance and sexual risk behaviour were around 2.00. The only significant between-cohort difference was a stronger association between female early adolescent smoking and early sexual initiation in the later cohort. Also, relationships between illicit drug use and both early sexual initiation and multiple sexual partners in late adolescence were significantly stronger among girls than boys in the later cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Despite changes in rates, relationships between adolescent risk behaviours remain strong, irrespective of gender and social class. This indicates a need for improved risk behaviour prevention in young people, perhaps through a holistic approach, that addresses the broad shared determinants of various risk behaviours."
26913252,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Breakfast is the most important daily meal, but neglected more than other meals by children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention, based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) to increase breakfast consumption among school children in Bandar Abbas, Iran. METHODS: In this quasi experimental study which was conducted in 2012, 88 students of four secondary schools in Bandar Abbas, south of Iran, were enrolled. Multi-stage cluster sampling was performed with random allocation of interventional and control groups. The study tool was a questionnaire which was filled by the students before and two months after the educational intervention. For data analysis, statistical tests including paired-samples t-test, independent samples t-test, Wilcoxon test, and Mann-Whitney test were used through SPSS v.18 software. RESULTS: The result of the study showed that application of TRA significantly increased scores of behavior of breakfast consumption (p<0.01). After the intervention, a significant increase was revealed in all nutrition intakes, except for fat and sugar (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The findings support application of the TRA in improving the intention and behavior of breakfast consumption. Applying this theory for designing interventions to increase breakfast eating is recommended."
15052398,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with receipt of different levels of shared care, and the effect of shared care on patient outcomes. METHOD: A total of 349 patients with severe mental illness were selected from general practice lists. Patient functioning was assessed using standardised questionnaires, and GPs completed a questionnaire about patients' shared care arrangements at baseline (response-rate 79%). Patients were followed up at 12 months. RESULTS: Receipt of high shared care was associated with greater patient satisfaction with services and social functioning at baseline (p < 0.005). Patients receiving high shared care showed greater improvements in SF-12 mental health scores at follow-up compared to low shared care groups (p = 0.02). This effect was abolished after adjustment for age, sex and psychiatric diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Receipt of high shared care was not associated with demographic or clinical characteristics. High shared care had limited value for patients in terms of improved clinical, social or general health functioning over one year."
17259636,1,a,"BACKGROUND: fall-related injuries in older people are a major public health concern. This study examined the relationship between psychosocial determinants of healthy ageing and risk of fall-related hip fracture in community-dwelling older people. The purpose was to contribute evidence for promotion of healthy ageing strategies in population-based interventions for fall injury prevention. METHODS: a case-control study was conducted with 387 participants, with at least two controls recruited per case. Cases of fall-related hip fracture in community-dwelling people aged 65 and older were recruited from hospital admissions in Brisbane, Australia, in 2003-2004. Community-based controls, matched by age, sex and postcode, were recruited via electoral roll sampling. A questionnaire assessing psychosocial factors, identified as determinants of healthy ageing, was administered at face-to-face interviews. RESULTS: psychosocial factors having a significant independent protective effect on hip fracture risk included being currently married [OR: 0.44 (0.22 to 0.88)], living in present residence for 5 years or more [OR: 0.43 (0.22 to 0.84)], having private health insurance [OR: 0.49 (0.27 to 0.90)], using proactive coping strategies [OR: 0.52 (0.29 to 0.92)], having a higher level of life satisfaction [OR: 0.47 (0.27 to 0.81)], and engagement in social activities in older age [OR: 0.30 (0.17 to 0.54)]. CONCLUSION: this study suggests that psychosocial determinants of healthy ageing are protective in fall-related hip fracture injury in older people. Reduction in the public health burden caused by this injury may then be achieved by implementing healthy ageing strategies involving community-based approaches to enhance the psychosocial environments of older people."
11728789,1,a,"Excessive alcohol consumption and related problems are common among clients in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), yet relatively little is known about the psychological and social determinants of alcohol-related attitudes and behaviors during treatment. This study reports on the prevalence of alcohol dependence, patterns of alcohol consumption and preliminary findings about clients' beliefs that they will change their drinking behavior in the future. Data were gathered from personal interviews with 66 clients attending a MMT program in South London (some 80.5% of the eligible caseload). Forty-one percent of the overall sample met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence in the past 12 months. Among clients who reported drinking in the past month (n = 50), 54% were classified as dependent, and these clients reported consuming an average of 23.5 UK standard units of absolute alcohol (188g/6.58 ounces) on a typical drinking day in the past month. Exploratory analyses suggested that expectations to change drinking behavior were predicted by subjective norms (social pressures), perceived functions of alcohol use, past drinking levels and current dose of methadone. Clinicians engaged in alcohol problems assessment and counseling during MMT could usefully examine these influences to strengthen treatment provision."
22095353,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact of social determinants of potential exposure to H1N1--which are unequally distributed by race/ethnicity in the United States--on incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. METHODS: In January 2010 we surveyed a nationally representative sample (n = 2079) of US adults from the Knowledge Networks online research panel, with Hispanic and African American oversamples. The completion rate was 56%. RESULTS: Path analysis examining ILI incidence, race, and social determinants of potential exposure to H1N1 demonstrated that higher ILI incidence was related to workplace policies, such as lack of access to sick leave, and structural factors, such as number of children in the household. Hispanic ethnicity was related to a greater risk of ILI attributable to these social determinants, even after we controlled for income and education. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of certain workplace policies, such as paid sick leave, confers a population-attributable risk of 5 million additional cases of ILI in the general population and 1.2 million cases among Hispanics. Federal mandates for sick leave could have significant health impacts by reducing morbidity from ILI, especially in Hispanics."
18994665,1,a,"The reduction of health inequities is an ethical imperative, according to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH). Drawing on detailed multidisciplinary evidence assembled by the Globalization Knowledge Network that supported the CSDH, we define globalisation in mainly economic terms. We consider and reject the presumption that globalisation will yield health benefits as a result of its contribution to rapid economic growth and associated reductions in poverty. Expanding on this point, we describe four disequalising dynamics by which contemporary globalisation causes divergence: the global reorganisation of production and emergence of a global labour-market; the increasing importance of binding trade agreements and processes to resolve disputes; the rapidly increasing mobility of financial capital; and the persistence of debt crises in developing countries. Generic policies designed to reduce health inequities are described with reference to the three Rs of redistribution, regulation, and rights. We conclude with an examination of the interconnected intellectual and institutional challenges to reduction of health inequities that are created by contemporary globalisation."

17279845,1,a,"Three studies support the proposal that need for closure (NFC) involves a desire for consensual validation that leads to cultural conformity. Individual differences in NFC interact with cultural group variables to determine East Asian versus Western differences in conflict style and procedural preferences (Study 1), information gathering in disputes (Study 2), and fairness judgment in reward allocations (Study 3). Results from experimental tests indicate that the relevance of NFC to cultural conformity reflects consensus motives rather than effort minimization (Study 2) or political conservatism (Study 3). Implications for research on conflict resolution and motivated cultural cognition are discussed."
29181151,0,a,"Background: Socio-demographic variables are widely known to have an association with the presence of any disability. However, the association between the severity of locomotor disability and socio-demographic variables has never been investigated in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross sectional survey of adults with locomotor disabilities was conducted between December 2010 and February 2011 at the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed (CRP), Dhaka, Bangladesh. During the study period 328 adults with locomotor disabilities met our selection criteria, but 316 consented and participated in the study. The 55-item Locomotor Disability Scale was used to measure disability. This study investigated the socio-demographic determinants of the severity of locomotor disability: age, gender, marital status, educational attainment, occupation, income status, type of house, living in own/rented house, household monthly income, household population and area of residence. Results: Participants' age was positively associated with the severity of their locomotor disability (beta = 0.01; 95% CI: 0.004 to 0.02), adjusting for diagnosis and other socio-demographic variables studied. Individuals who had an income experienced 0.35 (95% CI: -0.63 to -0.07) points decrease in the severity of disability than those did not have an income, adjusting for diagnosis and rest of the socio-demographic variables studied. In comparison to the unemployed individuals, students, homemakers, and individuals in elementary occupation respectively experienced 0.75 (95% CI: -1.08 to -0.43), 0.51 (95% CI: -0.82 to -0.19) and 0.37 (95% CI: -0.66 to -0.08) points decrease in the severity of locomotor disability, adjusting for diagnosis and rest of the socio-demographic variables studied. Conclusions: The severity of locomotor disability has an association with individuals' age, income status and occupation of the adults with such disability in Bangladesh. No such association was evident with other socioeconomic position and demographic variables. This finding suggests that people with locomotor disabilities in Bangladesh experience similar disabling built and attitudinal environments irrespective of their socioeconomic positions and demographic characteristics. Further community-based studies are needed to confirm such conclusions."
30362506,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The objective was to estimate the frequency of visits to a dentist and to assess the impact of determinants on dental care utilisation among adults in the Republic of Srpska (RS), Bosnia and Herzegovina. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the 2010 National Health Survey performed in the RS. A total of 4,128 adults (>/=18 years) were interviewed in their homes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between demographic characteristics, socio-economic characteristics, health behaviours, self-rated health, self-reported noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and dental care utilisation. RESULTS: Only 20% of all respondents reported a visit to a dentist in the year preceding the interview. Younger respondents (OR = 0.97), women (OR = 1.30-1.39), urban dwellers (OR = 1.41-1.61), those who were employed (OR = 1.20) and those who self-reported NCDs (OR = 1.32-1.33) more frequently utilised dental services. The opposite was true for those in the low wealth index group (OR = 0.79), persons with a low (OR = 0.31) and middle (OR = 0.48) level of education and people who self-rated their health as average (OR = 0.76-0.80). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed a low frequency of visits to a dentist, especially for preventive oral health care. It also confirmed demographic, socio-economic and health-related differences in dental-care utilisation in RS. To minimise those differences, systemic approaches aimed at increasing access to dental care could be an important step. Oral health-promotion policies need to be adopted in the RS."
31373039,0,a,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have demonstrable negative effects on long-term physical and mental health. Low-income and ethnic minority communities face significant disparities in exposure to ACEs. Pediatric settings offer an opportune context to identify and address ACEs, with the potential to reduce barriers in access to resources and services. The current study examined the feasibility and acceptability of screening infants and their parents for ACEs at a community medical clinic. Feasibility data indicated that 151 (92%) of the 164 unique patients that presented for well-child visits for infants (4- to 12-months) across a 13-month period were screened for infant and parent ACEs. Of these 151 patients, 47% met eligibility (infants with 1 + ACEs, parents with 2 + ACEs) deemed intermediate risk and indicated referral to prevention services. The majority of referred families (77%) accepted prevention services, including appointments with bilingual and bicultural wellness navigators who provided a cultural bridge and access to resources that could address patients' social determinants of health. Qualitative interviews with providers expand upon screening acceptability. Implications for integrated behavioral health, ACEs screening, and trauma-responsive prevention in a pediatric setting are discussed."
10607798,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that, in addition to genetic liability and environment in early childhood, intrauterine life also influences the risk for asthma beyond childhood. Low birth weight, prematurity, young maternal age, and maternal smoking have all shown an association with asthma. The effect of perinatal factors on the risk for asthma in relation to familial and social risk factors was studied in a nationwide population-based sample of adolescent twins. In addition to a distribution of birth characteristics among twins which differs from that of singletons, data on twins enable a distinction to be made between genetic and environmental sources of variation. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to five consecutive birth cohorts of Finnish 16 year old twins born in 1975-9 and to their parents (3065 families). The outcome measure was life time prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma in these adolescents. The association between asthma and potential risk factors was assessed by multiple logistic regression and discordant twin pair analysis. RESULTS: Risk for asthma increased with increasing ponderal index (p for trend <0.01) and decreasing maternal age (p for trend <0.05). Among the 25% of twins with the highest ponderal index, the odds ratio for asthma was 1.82 (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.79) compared with those in the lowest 25%. Neither birth weight, gestational age, nor Apgar score was associated with asthma. When perinatal risk factors were combined with familial and social risk factors, ponderal index, maternal smoking, parental asthma, and sibship size were all significant independent determinants of asthma in these adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The risk for asthma in adolescent twins increases with increasing ponderal index when adjusted for familial and social factors."
27666269,0,a,"The health of children and adolescents of Armenia has been affected by various socioeconomic, environmental, educational, and behavioral factors, demonstrating trends typical for both developed and developing countries. Key issues to be addressed by Armenian pediatricians are child mortality, malnutrition, and growth failure in the early years and overweight in later years. The case of Armenia illustrates how countries in transition are currently tackling both ""old"" problems (mortality and malnutrition) and ""new"" emerging morbidities (chronic diseases and adolescent health problems) based on social and health determinants, but the financing of the health system is far from satisfactory. Lessons of Armenia indicate the need for more cooperation between general practitioners and pediatricians at a primary care level. In addition, a better balance between inpatient and outpatient care could be achieved, which is not yet the case. Nevertheless, the overall performance of the Armenian child health care system can be considered satisfactory when bearing in mind the limitation of resources. Among the successful factors are those inherited from the Soviet period health system, including key institutions such as rural health posts and health centers, city polyclinics, and hospitals. These institutions mostly meet the needs of Armenian children and families today."
31530321,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Successful scale-up of integrated primary mental healthcare requires routine monitoring of key programme performance indicators. A consensus set of mental health indicators has been proposed but evidence on their use in routine settings is lacking. AIMS: To assess the acceptability, feasibility, perceived costs and sustainability of implementing indicators relating to integrated mental health service coverage in six South Asian (India, Nepal) and sub-Saharan African countries (Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda). METHOD: A qualitative study using semi-structured key informant interviews (n = 128) was conducted. The 'Performance of Routine Information Systems' framework served as the basis for a coding framework covering three main categories related to the performance of new tools introduced to collect data on mental health indicators: (1) technical; (2) organisation; and (3) behavioural determinants. RESULTS: Most mental health indicators were deemed relevant and potentially useful for improving care, and therefore acceptable to end users. Exceptions were indicators on functionality, cost and severity. The simplicity of the data-capturing formats contributed to the feasibility of using forms to generate data on mental health indicators. Health workers reported increasing confidence in their capacity to record the mental health data and minimal additional cost to initiate mental health reporting. However, overstretched primary care staff and the time-consuming reporting process affected perceived sustainability. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the newly developed, contextually appropriate mental health indicators in health facilities providing primary care services was seen largely to be feasible in the six Emerald countries, mainly because of the simplicity of the forms and continued support in the design and implementation stage. However, approaches to implementation of new forms generating data on mental health indicators need to be customised to the specific health system context of different countries. Further work is needed to identify ways to utilise mental health data to monitor and improve the quality of mental health services. DECLARATION OF INTEREST: None."
24585730,0,a,"Chronic diseases are a global problem, yet information on their determinants is generally scant in low- and middle-income countries. The Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) aims to contribute relevant information regarding the development and progression of clinical and subclinical chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, in one such setting. At Visit 1, we enrolled 15 105 civil servants from predefined universities or research institutes. Baseline assessment (2008-10) included detailed interviews and measurements to assess social and biological determinants of health, as well as various clinical and subclinical conditions related to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mental health. A second visit of interviews and examinations is under way (2012-14) to enrich the assessment of cohort exposures and to detect initial incident events. Annual surveillance has been conducted since 2009 for the ascertainment of incident events. Biological samples (sera, plasma, urine and DNA) obtained at both visits have been placed in long-term storage. Baseline data are available for analyses, and collaboration via specific research proposals directed to study investigators is welcome."
17003158,1,a,"PURPOSE: A seamless system of social, behavioral, and medical services for the uninsured was created to address the social determinants of disease, reduce health disparities, and foster local economic development in 2 inner-city neighborhoods and 2 rural counties in New Mexico. METHODS: Our family medicine department helped urban and rural communities that had large uninsured, minority populations create Health Commons models. These models of care are characterized by health planning shared by community stakeholders; 1-stop shopping for medical, behavioral, and social services; employment of community health workers bridging the clinic and the community; and job creation. RESULTS: Outcomes of the Health Commons included creation of a Web-based assignment of uninsured emergency department patients to primary care homes, reducing return visits by 31%; creation of a Web-based interface allowing partner organizations with incompatible information systems to share medical information; and creation of a statewide telephone Health Advice Line offering rural and urban uninsured individuals access to health and social service information and referrals 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Health Commons created jobs and has been sustained by attracting local investment and external public and private funding for its products. Our department's role in developing the Health Commons helped the academic health center (AHC) form mutually beneficial community partnerships with surrounding and distant urban and rural communities. CONCLUSIONS: Broad stakeholder participation built trust and investment in the Health Commons, expanding services for the uninsured. This participation also fostered marketable innovations applicable to all Health Commons' sites. Family medicine can promote the Health Commons as a venue for linking complementary strengths of the AHC and the community, while addressing the unique needs of each. Overall, our experience suggests that family medicine can play a leadership role in building collaborative approaches to seemingly intractable health problems among the uninsured, benefiting not only the community, but also the AHC."
23364209,0,a,"The General Population Cohort (GPC) was set up in 1989 to examine trends in HIV prevalence and incidence, and their determinants in rural south-western Uganda. Recently, the research questions have included the epidemiology and genetics of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) to address the limited data on the burden and risk factors for NCDs in sub-Saharan Africa. The cohort comprises all residents (52% aged >/=13years, men and women in equal proportions) within one-half of a rural sub-county, residing in scattered houses, and largely farmers of three major ethnic groups. Data collected through annual surveys include; mapping for spatial analysis and participant location; census for individual socio-demographic and household socioeconomic status assessment; and a medical survey for health, lifestyle and biophysical and blood measurements to ascertain disease outcomes and risk factors for selected participants. This cohort offers a rich platform to investigate the interplay between communicable diseases and NCDs.

24791240,0,a,"Protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is a major public health problem in India. This affects the child at the most crucial period of time of development, which can lead to permanent impairment in later life. PEM is measured in terms of underweight (low weight for age), stunting (low height for age) and wasting (low weight for height). The prevalence of stunting among under five is 48% and wasting is 19.8% and with an underweight prevalence of 42.5%, it is the highest in the world. Undernutrition predisposes the child to infection and complements its effect in contributing to child mortality. Lalonde model (1974) is used to look into the various determinants of PEM in under five children and its interrelation in causation of PEM. The determinants of PEM are broadly classified under four distinct categories: Environmental factors including the physical and social environment, behavioral factors, health-care service related and biological factors. The socio-cultural factors play an important role wherein, it affects the attitude of the care giver in feeding and care practices. Faulty feeding practice in addition to poor nutritional status of the mother further worsens the situation. The vicious cycle of poor nutritional status of the mother leading to low birth weight child further exposes the child to susceptibility to infections which aggravates the situation. However, it is seen that percapita income of the family did not have much bearing on the poor nutritional status of the child rather lack of proper health-care services adversely contributed to poor nutritional status of the child. PEM is a critical problem with many determinants playing a role in causing this vicious cycle of undernutrition. With almost half of under five children undernourished in India, the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the prevalence of underweight by 2015 seems a distant dream."
25671991,0,a,"Because population health improvement requires action on multiple determinants--including medical care, health behaviors, and the social and physical environments--no single entity can be held accountable for achieving improved outcomes. Medical organizations, government, schools, businesses, and community organizations all need to make substantial changes in how they approach health and how they allocate resources. To this end, we suggest the development of multisectoral community health business partnership models. Such collaborative efforts are needed by sectors and actors not accustomed to working together. Healthcare executives can play important leadership roles in fostering or supporting such partnerships in local and national arenas where they have influence. In this article, we develop the following components of this argument: defining a community health business model; defining population health and the Triple Aim concept; reaching beyond core mission to help create the model; discussing the shift for care delivery beyond healthcare organizations to other community sectors; examining who should lead in developing the community business model; discussing where the resources for a community business model might come from; identifying that better evidence is needed to inform where to make cost-effective investments; and proposing some next steps. The approach we have outlined is a departure from much current policy and management practice. But new models are needed as a road map to drive action--not just thinking--to address the enormous challenge of improving population health. While we applaud continuing calls to improve health and reduce disparities, progress will require more robust incentives, strategies, and action than have been in practice to date. Our hope is that ideas presented here will help to catalyze a collective, multisectoral response to this critical social and economic challenge."
21338747,0,a,"Minority populations have remained in relatively poor health compared to the majority population and continue to be underserved by the health care system. Racial and ethnic health disparities are not new phenomena. Understanding the causes of these disparities continues to evolve. Within the past decade researchers have looked more toward social determinants of health to explain the differences. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care provided documentation to shift the discussion from patient behaviors to the contributions of health care systems, including health care providers, that contribute to health disparities. The report was the first comprehensive study that documented racial and ethnic inequities within the US health care delivery system (ie, differential treatment on the basis of race and ethnicity). The authors of the IOM report indicated that they found some evidence to suggest that bias, prejudice, and stereotyping by providers may contribute to differences in care. It is possible that food and nutrition practitioners have the same biases and are presented with the same systems challenges as the health care providers referenced in the IOM report. It is, therefore, also possible that food and nutrition practitioners may be at risk of contributing to health disparities. This article provides an in-depth look at the recommendations put forth by the IOM, offers discipline-specific recommendations consistent with those outlined in the IOM model, and introduces other models that may be of use as food and nutrition practitioners move forward with developing strategies to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities."
26310793,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the predominant cause of death globally. The large health disparities in the distribution of the burden of disease seen in developed and developing countries are of growing concern. Central to this concern is the poor outcome which is seen disproportionately in socially disadvantaged groups and racial/ethnic minorities. The aim of the study was to conduct a systematic literature review to investigate the nature of cardiovascular disease health disparities among Afro-Caribbean origin populations and identify current knowledge gaps. METHODS: A systematic literature review including a detailed search strategy was developed to search MEDLINE and other research databases. Using an a priori protocol peer-reviewed publications and grey literature articles were retrieved and screened and relevant data extracted by two independent review authors. Thematic analysis was done according to CVD outcomes and measures of disparity including age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: The search retrieved 665 articles of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in the United Kingdom and centered on the prevalence of CVD by ethnicity, age and sex. An important sub-theme identified was the disparities in health service utilization/hospital admission. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) were less prevalent among Afro-Caribbeans compared to Caucasian and South East Asian ethnic groups. The prevalence of CHD ranged from 0-7% in Afro-Caribbean to 2-22% in Caucasians. Strokes were more common among Afro-Caribbeans. There are inadequate data on morbidity and mortality from CVD, particularly across the socio-economic gradient, in Afro-Caribbean populations. CONCLUSIONS: There are important differences in morbidity and mortality from CVD across ethnic groups. Important knowledge gaps remain in understanding the social determinants of these disparities in CVD. More research exploring these gaps by varying disparity indicators needs to be undertaken."
11338939,1,a,"Flashbulb memories are vivid and long-lasting memories for the reception context of an important public event (Brown & Kulik, 1977). They are assumed to be triggered by emotional factors (i.e., intensity of emotional feeling, appraisal of the original event) and by social factors (i.e., social sharing of the news, following media debate about the event). The present study investigated the memory for the death of the former President of France F. Mitterrand in two social groups, i.e., French and Belgian people. This study tests whether the flashbulb memory attributes, the memory for the original event, and the impact of the emotional and social determinants of flashbulb memory differed across groups. The results indicated that the flashbulb memory for Mitterrand's death is affected by group provenance, as French people showed higher levels of recall for the flashbulb memory attributes and their determinants than Belgian people. Time impaired recollections in both groups, so that flashbulb memories appear prone to decay and share the same destiny as ordinary memories. The theoretical construct of concern--as the most basic antecedent of emotional experiences and its related appraisal (Frijda, 1994)--is discussed in order to explain the differences in memory of the two social groups."
25720044,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking remains a major preventable public health problem associated with premature deaths worldwide. Adolescence is a unique developmental stage between childhood and adulthood. Smoking is a lifestyle habit acquired during adolescence and into adulthood, with its associated morbidity and mortality. It is therefore important to determine the factors associated with cigarette smoking in these adolescents in order to institute preventive measures and health policies to protect these adolescents early. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the prevalence of smoking, factors associated with smoking, and knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking in these adolescents. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1120 adolescents aged 10-19 years selected from 10 secondary schools in Port Harcourt was conducted using a multistage sampling technique. The Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) core questionnaire was used to collect data from the subjects. A smoker was defined as one who had ever smoked a cigarette or who had one or two puffs, while a current smoker was defined as one who had taken a puff or smoked cigarettes in the last 30 days preceding the day of the questionnaire's completion. RESULTS: Eighty subjects (7.1%) were smokers. This was significantly (p=<0.001) higher in males (9.7%) than in females (4%). Thirty seven (3.3%) subjects were current smokers. The mean age at which smoking was initiated was 12.47+/-3.0 years. Twenty six (32.5%) of the smokers reported that they were initiated into cigarette smoking by their friends, 36 (45%) just wanted to experiment, 7 (8.8%) were influenced by media advertisements while 5 (6.3%) were due to parental exposure. Parental history of smoking and poor knowledge of cancer of the lungs as a harmful effect of smoking, was significantly (p=<0.05) associated with cigarette smoking. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of smoking in adolescents in Port Harcourt is high and is associated with parental smoking and poor knowledge of cancer of the lungs as a harmful effect. We recommend that adolescent health education with an emphasis on the harmful effects of smoking be included in the curriculum of all secondary schools."
30541042,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify associations of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with cancer risk but usually only explain a fraction of the inherited variability. Pathway analysis of genetic variants is a powerful tool to identify networks of susceptibility genes. METHODS: We conducted a large agnostic pathway-based meta-analysis of GWAS data using the summary-based adaptive rank truncated product method to identify gene sets and pathways associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in 9040 cases and 12 496 controls. We performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and functional annotation of the top SNPs in genes contributing to the top associated pathways and gene sets. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We identified 14 pathways and gene sets associated with PDAC at a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. After Bonferroni correction (P </= 1.3 x 10-5), the strongest associations were detected in five pathways and gene sets, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young, regulation of beta-cell development, role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor transactivation by G protein-coupled receptors in cardiac hypertrophy pathways, and the Nikolsky breast cancer chr17q11-q21 amplicon and Pujana ATM Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) network gene sets. We identified and validated rs876493 and three correlating SNPs (PGAP3) and rs3124737 (CASP7) from the Pujana ATM PCC gene set as eQTLs in two normal derived pancreas tissue datasets. CONCLUSION: Our agnostic pathway and gene set analysis integrated with functional annotation and eQTL analysis provides insight into genes and pathways that may be biologically relevant for risk of PDAC, including those not previously identified."
19850895,1,a,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Riks-Stroke, the Swedish Stroke Register, was used to explore patient characteristics and stroke services as determinants of patient dissatisfaction with acute in-hospital care. METHODS: All 79 hospitals in Sweden admitting acute stroke patients participate in Riks-Stroke. During 2001 to 2007, 104,876 patients (87% of survivors) responded to a follow-up questionnaire 3 months after acute stroke; this included questions on satisfaction with various aspects of stroke care. RESULTS: The majority (>90%) were satisfied with acute in-hospital stroke care. Dissatisfaction was closely associated with outcome at 3 months. Patient who were dependent regarding activities of daily living, felt depressed, or had poor self-perceived general health were more likely to be dissatisfied. Dissatisfaction with global acute stroke care was linked to dissatisfaction with other aspects of care, including rehabilitation and support by community services. Patients treated in stroke units were less often dissatisfied than patients in general wards, as were patients who had been treated in a small hospital (vs medium or large hospitals) and patient who had participated in discharge planning. In multivariate analyses, the strongest predictor of dissatisfaction with acute care was poor outcome (dependency regarding activities of daily living, depressed mood, poor self-perceived health). CONCLUSIONS: Dissatisfaction with in-hospital acute stroke care is part of a more extensive complex comprising poor functional outcome, depressive mood, poor self-perceived general health, and dissatisfaction not only with acute care but also with health care and social services at large. Several aspects of stroke care organization are associated with a lower risk of dissatisfaction."
12880519,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the vast scientific literature on the social determinants of health, there is still a debate on the extent to which this relationship remains in old age. The objective of this study was to examine the association between socioeconomic circumstances and health among older adults in a small town in Brazil. METHODS: The study was carried out in Bambui, a town of around 15 000 inhabitants that is located in the state of Minas Gerais, which is in southeastern Brazil. From 1 177 residents aged 65 years or older, 1 074 of them (91.2%) were interviewed and 997 (84.7%) were examined (physical measurements and blood tests). Those in the lowest third of the distribution of total household monthly income, with an income of less than US$ 240 per month, were compared with those who had an income above that level. RESULTS: Lower family income was independently associated with: (1) some lifestyle risk factors (less consumption of fresh fruits or vegetables and less frequent exercise during leisure time in the preceding 30 days), (2) several indicators of worse health status (General Health Questionnaire score, self-rated health, self-rated visual acuity, level of difficulty in walking 300 meters, inability to perform routine activities because of a health problem in the preceding 2 weeks, and seropositivity for Trypanosoma cruzi), (3) a higher number of nonprescribed medications used in the preceding 3 months, and (4) a higher number of hospitalizations in the preceding 12 months. Obesity was more frequent in the higher-income group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not confirm observations in some developed countries of a lack of association between socioeconomic status and health among the aged. Our results showed that a small difference in monthly family income was sufficiently sensitive to identify elderly persons in worse health, even within a community that appears to be uniformly poor."
30173537,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Rural health workforce shortages are a global phenomenon. Countries like Australia, with industrialised economies, large land masses and broadly dispersed populations, face unique rural health challenges in providing adequate services and addressing workforce shortages. This article focuses on retention of early-career nursing and allied health professionals working in rural and remote Australia. Some of Australia's most severe and protracted rural workforce shortages, particularly among early-career health professionals, are in public sector community mental health (CMH), a multidisciplinary workforce staffed primarily by nurses and allied health professionals. This study investigated how employment and rural-living factors impacted the turnover intention of early-career, rural-based CMH professionals in their first few years of working. METHODS: A constructivist grounded theory methodological approach, primarily guided by the work of Charmaz, was selected for the study. By implication, the choice of a grounded theory approach meant that the research question would be answered through the development of a substantive theory. Twenty-six nursing and allied health professionals working in CMH in rural New South Wales (NSW) for the state health department services participated in in-depth, semi-structured interviews. The study sought to identify the particular life factors - workplace conditions, career-advancement opportunities and social and personal determinants - affecting workers' turnover intention. The substantive grounded theory was developed from an identified core category and basic social process. RESULTS: The turnover intention theory provides a whole-of-person explanation of turnover intention. It was developed based on an identified core category of professional and personal expectations being met and an identified basic social process of adjusting to change. The theory posits that an individual's decision to stay or leave their job is determined by the meeting of life aspirations, and this relates to the extent of the gap between individuals' professional and personal expectations and the reality of their current employment and rural-living experience. The extent of individuals' professional and personal expectations can be measured by their satisfaction levels. A major finding from the identification of the basic social process was that, in the adjustment stages (initial and continuing), turnover intention was most strongly affected by professional experiences, in particular those relating to the job role, workplace relationships and level of access to continuing professional development. In this stage, personal satisfaction mostly concerned those with limited social connections in the town (ie non-local - newcomers). Having reached the 'having adapted' stage, the major influence on turnover intention shifted to personal satisfaction, and this was strongly impacted by individuals' life stage. By drawing on the turnover intention theory and the basic social process, it is possible to make a risk assessment of individuals' turnover intention. Three levels of risk were identified: highly vulnerable, moderately vulnerable and not very vulnerable. CONCLUSIONS: The study offers a holistic explanation of life factors influencing the turnover intention of early-career health professionals working in public health services in rural NSW. These findings and the turnover intention risk matrix are thought to be suitable for use by Australian public health services and governments, as well as in other highly industrialised countries, to assist in the development of policies and strategies tailored for individual health professionals' work-experience level and life stage. By adopting such a whole-of-person approach, health services and governments will be better positioned to address the life aspirations of rural-based, early-career health professionals and this is likely to assist in the reduction of avoidable turnover."
30782175,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Operations of transnational corporations (TNCs) affect population health through production methods, shaping social determinants of health, or by influencing regulation of their activities. Research on community exposures to TNC practices and policies has been limited. Our research on extractive industries examined Rio Tinto in Australia and Southern Africa to test methods for assessing the health impacts of corporates in high and middle income jurisdictions with different regulatory frameworks. METHODS: We adapted existing Health Impact Assessment methods. Data identifying potential impacts were sourced through media analysis, document analysis, company literature and semi-structured interviews. The data were mapped against a corporate health impact assessment framework (CHIA) which included Rio Tinto's political and business practices; productions; and workforce, social, environmental and economic conditions. RESULTS: Both positive and detrimental aspects of Rio Tinto's operations were identified. Requirements imposed by Rio Tinto on its global supply chain are likely to have positive health impacts for workers. However, political lobbying and membership of representative organisations can influence government policy in ways that are unfavourable to health and equity. Positive impacts include provision of direct employment under decent working conditions, but countered by an increase in precariousness of employment. Commitments to upholding sustainable development principles are undermined by limited site remediation and other environmental impacts. Positive contributions are made to national and local economies but then undermined by business strategies that include tax minimisation. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that it is possible to undertake a CHIA on an extractive industry TNC. The different methods provided sufficient information to understand the need to strengthen regulations that are conducive to health; the opportunity for Rio Tinto to extend corporate responsibility initiatives and support their social licence to operate; and for civil society actors to inform their advocacy towards improving health and equity outcomes from TNC operations."
18720399,1,a,"Hurricane Katrina was the most devastating natural disaster to hit the United States in the past 75 years. The authors conducted interviews of 810 persons who were representative of adult residents living in the 23 southernmost counties of Mississippi before Hurricane Katrina. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) since Hurricane Katrina was 22.5%. The determinants of PTSD were female gender, experience of hurricane-related financial loss, postdisaster stressors, low social support, and postdisaster traumatic events. Kaplan-Meier survival curves suggest that exposure to both hurricane-related traumatic events and to financial and social stressors influenced the duration of PTSD symptoms. Postdisaster interventions that aim to improve manipulable stressors after these events may influence the onset and course of PTSD."
11676587,1,a,"BACKGROUND: A clear, up-to-date picture of smoking prevalence and its determinants is needed to inform the development of an effective tobacco control policy in Ukraine, particularly given the way in which the tobacco industry has targeted post-Soviet countries since transition. METHODS: A nationally representative household survey was undertaken in Ukraine in February 2000. RESULTS: Data were available on 1,590 individuals (response rate 72%). Fifty-seven percent of men and 10% of women were current smokers and an additional 21 and 7%, respectively, were ex-smokers. Smoking behavior has changed considerably over successive generations, with an increase in the proportion of women smoking and a reduction in the mean age at first smoking. Factors associated with smoking include young age, urban residence (among women), and material hardship, particularly unemployment. Involvement in social networks appears to reduce the probability of smoking. Smoking commonly occurs in public places and smokers differ from nonsmokers in their health beliefs about smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of smoking among men are already high and among young women are increasing rapidly. Unless an effective tobacco policy response is developed to address the issues identified, tobacco will continue to make an increasingly large contribution to premature morbidity and mortality in Ukraine."
11890169,1,a,"Successful aging calls for effective adaptation, which in turn implies flexible use of coping strategies to optimize personal functioning and well-being. The present paper studied adaptive choice behavior of older, independently living persons faced with complications in their houses. The goal was to gain insight into the concrete coping process and its outcome-in terms of the choice of assimilative vs. accommodative strategies-and in the role of three determinants on this process. The determinants were perceived self-efficacy, importance of the problem, and personal dispositions (flexibility and tenacity). A sample of 199 independently-living older persons participated in an experiment that was based on a scenario and questionnaire method, with problems stemming from the domain of independent living. Results mainly underlie the crucial role of perceived self-efficacy and are discussed in view of the concept of successful aging."
30857931,0,a,"To increase vaccination coverage, it is essential to understand the vaccine decision-making process. High population coverage is required to obtain herd immunity and to protect vulnerable groups in terms of age (e.g. the very young) or health (e.g. immunodeficiency). Vaccine confidence and coverage in South Africa are relatively low, opening the window for sustained outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in a country facing one of the most severe HIV epidemics in the world. To capture the vaccine-related decision-making process in South Africa, we performed a discrete choice experiment with 1200 participants in December 2017. We asked for their preferences with respect to (1) vaccine effectiveness, (2) vaccine-preventable burden of disease, (3) accessibility of the vaccine in terms of co-payment and prescription requirements, (4) frequency of mild vaccine-related side-effects, (5) population vaccination coverage and (6) local vaccination coverage. We distinguished between decision-making for vaccines administered to the participant, and for vaccines administered to their youngest child. We analyzed the data for each of these groups using a panel mixed logit model and found similar results for decisions to vaccinate oneself or one's child. Vaccine effectiveness was the most important attribute followed by population coverage and burden of disease. Local coverage and accessibility were also important determinants of vaccination behavior, but to a lesser extent. Regarding population and local coverage, we observed a positive effect on vaccine utility indicating the potential of peer influence. As such, social normative influence could be exploited to increase vaccination confidence and coverage. With respect to vaccine-preventable burden of the disease, the marginal utilities showed disease severity to be more important than frequency of disease. Policymakers and health care workers should stress the effectiveness of vaccines together with the severity of vaccine-preventable diseases."
31381131,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to artificial tanning devices is carcinogenic to humans, and government regulations to restrict or ban indoor tanning appear to be increasing. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated changes in the international prevalence of indoor tanning among adolescents and adults after artificial tanning devices were classified as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2009. METHODS: Systematic searches in PubMed and Web of Science databases were undertaken. Overall, 43 studies reporting 'ever' or 'past-year' indoor tanning exposure after 2009 were identified. We used metaregression analysis to evaluate the prevalence of indoor tanning over time. Random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize the prevalence of indoor tanning in adolescents and adults according to sex, region and presence of age prohibitions. RESULTS: Global prevalence of indoor tanning in adolescents for 2013-2018 was 6.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-10.6], 70% lower than the 22.0% (95% CI 17.2-26.8) prevalence for 2007-2012. Among adults, the prevalence was 10.4% (95% CI 5.7-16.3) for 2013-2018, a decrease of 35% from 18.2% for 2007-2012. Since 2009, the overall past-year prevalence among adolescents was 6.7% (95% CI 4.4-9.6) and 12.5% (95% CI 9.5-15.6) among adults. The prevalence of tanning indoors in the past year was similar in North America (adults, 12.5%; adolescents, 7.6%) and Europe (adults, 11.1%; adolescents, 5.1%). In 2009, three countries had regulations restricting indoor tanning, compared with 26 countries today. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of indoor tanning has declined substantially and significantly in adolescents and adults since the 2009 IARC statement, reflecting the rise in regulations that limit this source of unnecessary exposure to carcinogenic ultraviolet radiation. What is already known about this topic? Indoor tanning is associated with an increased risk of melanoma. A meta-analysis of worldwide indoor tanning prevalence for 1986-2012 found a past-year prevalence of 18% in adolescents and 14% in adults, with higher prevalences during the period 2007-2012. Policies to regulate indoor tanning began to be implemented across the globe in 2009. Only one study carried out in the U.S.A. has evaluated the efficacy of such policies in reducing indoor tanning prevalence. What does this study add? For the period 2013-2018, we found indoor tanning prevalences of 6.7% in adolescents and 11.9% in adults. This implies a reduction in indoor tanning use of 70% in adolescents and 35% in adults during the last 10 years. Our study encourages policy makers to strengthen indoor tanning regulations that reduce sunbed use among the general population in order to produce maximum public health benefit."
15456977,1,a,"Reform of the Lithuanian health system is a challenging process. The aim of this article is to assess the role of health managers in the process of health reform, evaluating the perception of health management and their training needs, as the possible determinants for the success of the reform. The results of several questionnaire surveys of Lithuanian health managers, particularly the one carried out in 2002 are used. The studies demonstrate great diversity in the conceptual understanding of health management, with prevailing rational and technical understanding. This might be associated with the rapid structural and organizational changes in the early stages of health reform and insufficient involvement of health managers in the planning and management of changes. General management, health policy, economic and law are considered as the most important study areas for health managers. The major lacking knowledge is in the subjects of law, economics and health financing. Health managers should act as mediators between politicians and health professionals. Enlargement of the area of competences, increasing autonomy in solving problems and meeting of the training needs of health managers is essential."
21903318,0,a,"The literature reports an association between neighbourhood deprivation and individual depression after adjustment for individual factors. The present paper investigates whether vulnerability to neighbourhood features is influenced by individual ""activity space"" (i.e., the space within which people move about or travel in the course of their daily activities). It can be assumed that a deprived residential environment can exert a stronger influence on the mental health of people whose activity space is limited to their neighbourhood of residence, since their exposure to their neighbourhood would be greater. Moreover, we studied the relationship between activity space size and depression. A limited activity space could indeed reflect spatial and social confinement and thus be associated with a higher risk of being depressed, or, conversely, it could be linked to a deep attachment to the neighbourhood of residence and thus be associated with a lower risk of being depressed. Multilevel logistic regression analyses of a representative sample consisting of 3011 inhabitants surveyed in 2005 in the Paris, France metropolitan area and nested within 50 census blocks showed, after adjusting for individual-level variables, that people living in deprived neighbourhoods were significantly more depressed that those living in more advantaged neighbourhoods. We also observed a statistically significant cross-level interaction between activity space and neighbourhood deprivation, as they relate to depression. Living in a deprived neighbourhood had a stronger and statistically significant effect on depression in people whose activity space was limited to their neighbourhood than in those whose daily travels extended beyond it. In addition, a limited activity space appeared to be a protective factor with regard to depression for people living in advantaged neighbourhoods and a risk factor for those living in deprived neighbourhoods. It could therefore be useful to take activity space into consideration more often when studying the social and spatial determinants of depression."
12783770,1,a,"CONTEXT: Gender discrimination and son preference are key demographic features of South Asia and are well documented for India. However, gender bias and sex preference in Nepal have received little attention. METHODS: 1996 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey data on ever-married women aged 15-49 who did not desire any more children were used to investigate levels of gender bias and sex preference. The level of contraceptive use and the total fertility rate in the absence of sex preference were estimated, and logistic regression was performed to analyze the association between socioeconomic and demographic variables and stopping childbearing after the birth of a son. RESULTS: Commonly used indicators of gender bias, such as sex ratio at birth and sex-specific immunization rates, do not suggest a high level of gender discrimination in Nepal. However, sex preference decreases contraceptive use by 24% and increases the total fertility rate by more than 6%. Women's contraceptive use, exposure to the media, parity, last birth interval, educational level and religion are linked to stopping childbearing after the birth of a boy, as is the ethnic makeup of the local area. CONCLUSIONS: The level of sex preference in Nepal is substantial. Sex preference is an important barrier to the increase of contraceptive use and decline of fertility in the country; its impact will be greater as desired family size declines."
28210469,0,a,"Introduction: Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation is the first and important part of the airway management. The aim of present study was to evaluate the quality of four different BVM ventilation techniques - E-C, Thenar Eminence, Thenar Eminence (Dominant hand)-E-C (Non dominant hand), and Thenar Eminence (Non dominant hand)-E-C (Dominant hand) - among two novice and experienced groups. Methods: In a case-control and mannequin based study that was conducted in Tabriz University of medical sciences, 120 volunteers were recruited and divided into two groups. 60 participants in experienced and other 60 as novice group who observed BVM ventilation but hadn't practical experience about BVM ventilation. Every participant in both groups performed 4 BVM ventilation techniques under the supervision of an experienced assessor. Quality of mannequin chest expansion was recorded by two other experienced assessors who were blind to ventilation process. The data were analyzed with SPSS 17.0. Results: In novice group, when evaluating each technique performance, they did Thenar Eminence (non-dominant hand) - E-C (dominant hand) technique much better than the others (P<0.0001). But in the experienced group, there was no meaningful difference between the all four techniques (P= 0.102). Conclusion: Novice participants did Thenar Eminence (non-dominant hand) - E-C (dominant hand) technique better than the others. Therefore, it is recommended that training of this technique was placed in educational program of medical students."
19041187,1,a,"Stress and stress-related health impairments are major problems in human life and elucidating the biological pathways linking stress and disease is of substantial importance. However, the identification of mechanisms underlying a dysregulation of major components of the stress response system is, particularly in humans, a very challenging task. Salivary cortisol responses to diverse acute challenge paradigms show large intra- and interindividual variability. In order to uncover mechanisms mediating stress-related disorders and to potentially develop new therapeutic strategies, an extensive phenotyping of HPA axis stress responses is essential. Such a research agenda depends on substantial knowledge of moderating and intervening variables that affect cortisol responses to different stressors and stimuli. The aim of this report is, therefore, to provide a comprehensive summary of important determinants of, in particular, human salivary cortisol responses to different kinds of laboratory stimuli including acute psychosocial stress as well as pharmacological provocation procedures. This overview demonstrates the role of age and gender, endogenous and exogenous sex steroid levels, pregnancy, lactation and breast-feeding, smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption as well as dietary energy supply in salivary cortisol responses to acute stress. Furthermore, it briefly summarizes current knowledge of the role of genetic factors and methodological issues in terms of habituation to repeated psychosocial stress exposures and time of testing as well as psychological factors, that have been shown to be associated with salivary cortisol responses like early life experiences, social factors, psychological interventions, personality as well as acute subjective-psychological stress responses and finally states of chronic stress and psychopathology."
29931374,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Smoking is the biggest preventable cause of death and kills about seven million people annually. As smoking prevalence is falling in developed countries, tobacco businesses are turning to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to generate new tobacco markets. To prevent young people from initiating smoking and becoming regular smokers, it is important to understand the causes of susceptibility to smoking. In this study, we report a nationwide survey of the prevalence and risk factors of smoking susceptibility among students aged 12-20 years in The Gambia. METHODS: We used two-stage cluster random sampling to select students in secondary schools throughout The Gambia and questionnaire to collect data on demographic characteristics and indicators on susceptibility to initiating smoking. RESULTS: Among the total sample of 10289 students, 9831 (96%; 55.6% girls and 44.4% boys, aged 12-20 years) nonsmokers were included in the analysis. Of these, 3333 (33.9%) were found to be susceptible to smoking. Smoking susceptibility was more common among students attending grant-aided schools, non-Muslims, who had smoking allowed at home, had family members or friends who smoke, were sent to purchase cigarettes, had poor knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking, noticed point-of-sale tobacco advertisements, and who had positive attitudes towards smoking. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that susceptibility to smoking is common among students and associated with preventable exposures. Although based on cross-sectional data, these findings suggest that raising students' awareness of the harmful effects of smoking and reducing the prevalence of adult smoking, extending tobacco advertising restrictions to include point-of-sale, are all important to preventing the uptake of smoking among students. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to provide detailed data on smoking susceptibility and risk factors in a nationally representative sample of young people in The Gambia. Our findings show that susceptibility to smoking is relatively high and associated with preventable measures. Our results also identify an urgent need to broaden the ban on tobacco advertising to explicitly include point-of-sale advertisements. These findings provide valuable information for tobacco control policies and evidence to enable targeted intervention for young people most at risk of initiating smoking."

Social identity theories of race, social class, and attachment to school, and research in the social psychology of achievement motivation both suggest differential levels of student engagement among diverse student groups. Using multilevel models, the author investigates the relationship between classroom context and students' levels of engagement. Levels of engagement among black and low SES students are mostly insensitive to classroom context, suggesting there is little collective action directed at fostering anti-school norms among these student groups. However, consistent with research in the social psychology of achievement motivation, students who begin class with weaker reading and writing skills are less likely to be engaged, setting the stage for a cycle of reduced achievement growth."
26619045,0,a,"IMPORTANCE: Atopic disease is associated with chronic inflammation, food allergen avoidance, and use of systemic immunosuppressant medications. All these factors have been shown to be associated with anemia. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether atopic disease is associated with increased risk of childhood anemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional survey and laboratory assessment were conducted using data from the 1997-2013 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) that included 207,007 children and adolescents and the 1999-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that included 30,673 children and adolescents. Analysis of the data was conducted between August 1, 2014, and August 28, 2015. EXPOSURES: Caregiver-reported history of eczema, asthma, hay fever, and/or food allergy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Anemia was defined by caregiver report in the NHIS and by hemoglobin levels for age and sex in the NHANES. RESULTS: Data were collected on 207,007 children and adolescents from NHIS, representing all pediatric age, sex, racial/ethnic, household educational level, and income groups. The US prevalence was 9.5% (95% CI, 9.4%-9.7%) from all years of the NHIS for health care-diagnosed eczema, 12.8% (95% CI, 12.6%-13.0%) for asthma, 17.1% (95% CI, 16.9%-17.3%) for hay fever, 4.2% (95% CI, 4.1%-4.3%) for food allergy, and 1.1% (95% CI, 1.1%-1.2%) for anemia. In multivariable logistic regression models controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, annual household income, highest educational level in the family, insurance coverage, number of persons in the household, birthplace in the United States, and history of asthma, hay fever, and food allergy, anemia was associated with eczema in 14 of 17 studies, asthma in 11, hay fever in 12, and food allergy in 12. In multivariable analysis across the NHIS (with results reported as adjusted odds ratios [95% CIs]), children with any eczema (1.83; 1.58-2.13), asthma (1.31; 1.14-1.51), hay fever (1.57; 1.36-1.81), and food allergy (2.08; 1.71-2.52) had higher odds of anemia (P < .001 for all). In the NHANES, current history of asthma (1.33; 1.04-1.70; P = .02) and eczema (1.93; 1.04-3.59; P = .04) were associated with higher odds of anemia, particularly microcytic anemia (asthma: 1.61; 1.09-2.38; P = .02; eczema: 2.03; 1.20-3.46; P = .009) while history of hay fever was not associated with anemia (0.85; 0.62-1.17; P = .33). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The association between atopic disease and anemia was reproducible in multiple cohorts. Future studies are needed to identify the determinants of association between atopic disease and anemia."
29386948,0,a,"Globally, unintended adolescent pregnancies pose a significant burden. One of the most important tools that can help prevent unintended pregnancy is the timely use of emergency contraception (EC), which in turn will decrease the need for abortions and complications related to adolescent pregnancies. Indications for the use of EC include unprotected sexual intercourse, contraceptive failure, or sexual assault. Use of EC is recommended within 120 hours, though is most effective if used as soon as possible after unprotected sex. To use EC, adolescents need to be equipped with knowledge about the various EC methods, and how and where EC can be accessed. Great variability in the knowledge and use of EC around the world exists, which is a major barrier to its use. The aims of this paper were to 1) provide a brief overview of EC, 2) discuss key social determinants affecting knowledge and use of EC, and 3) explore best practices for overcoming the barriers of lack of knowledge, use, and access of EC."
28944020,0,a,"Breeding dispersal is a key process of population structure and dynamics and is often triggered by an individual's breeding failure. In both colonial and territorial birds, reproductive success of conspecifics (RSc) can also lead individuals to change breeding sites after a failure on a site. Yet, few studies have simultaneously investigated the independent contribution of individual reproductive success (RSi) and of RSc on dispersal decision. Here, we develop a modeling framework to disentangle the effects of RSi and RSc on demographic parameters, while accounting for imperfect individual detection and other confounding factors such as age or dispersal behavior in the previous year. Using a 10-year capture-recapture dataset composed of 1,595 banded tree swallows, we assessed the effects of nonmanipulated RSi and RSc on female breeding dispersal in this semicolonial passerine. Dispersal was strongly driven by RSi, but not by RSc. Unsuccessful females were 9.5-2.5 times more likely to disperse than successful ones, depending if they had dispersed or not in the previous year, respectively. Unsuccessful females were also three times less likely to be detected than successful ones. Contrary to theoretical and empirical studies, RSc did not drive the decision to disperse but influenced the selection of the following breeding site once dispersal had been initiated. Because detection of individuals was driven by RSi, which was positively correlated to RSc, assuming a perfect detection as in previous studies may have lead us to conclude that RSc affected dispersal patterns, yet our approach corrected for this bias. Overall, our results suggest that the value and use of RSc as public information to guide dispersal decisions are likely dictated by multiple ecological determinants, such as landscape structure and extent, if this cue is indeed used."
15239775,1,a,"Terms such as 'molecular epidemiology' and 'genetic epidemiology' have been coined to depict the change from 'traditional epidemiology', concerned with disease determinants at the community or society level, over to 'modern epidemiology', which is concerned with determinants operating at the individual level or even below, i.e. at the organ, tissue, cell, or molecular level. In this commentary, we point out to the limitations of this development and suggest that more emphasis is placed on making the presumed causal disease models explicit, when investigating the relationship between putative determinants and disease. Understanding the disease processes at the micro-level is insufficient for understanding disease at the individual level; and disease patterns at the population level cannot be understood unless it is realized that individuals exist in a variety of contexts that cannot be reduced to individual attributes."
15578812,1,a,"AIM: To examine infant growth characteristics and their socio-demographic determinants in Severodvinsk, northwest Russia. METHODS: Length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length Z-scores of 1,067 infants born in 1999-2000 in Severodvinsk were calculated on the basis of the data on the length and weight obtained from the medical files. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate independent effects of maternal age, education, occupation, marital status, weight, parity, sex of the baby, and breastfeeding duration on infant growth. RESULTS: At the age of 12 months, 1.1% of the infants were stunted, 1.1% underweight, and 0.5% wasted in comparison with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 reference population. The mean Z-scores for length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length were 0.48+/-0.93, 0.38+/-1.04, and 0.65+/-1.03, respectively. Mean weight-for-length Z-scores considerably increased from birth to 12 months, while length-for-age Z-score remained largely unchanged. In regression analysis, length-for-age Z-scores were lower by 0.43 (p=0.028) and by 0.30 (p<0.001) in infants born to mothers with basic and unknown education, respectively. Positive trends between linear growth and maternal age (p=0.027) and education (p=0.024) were observed. No social variations in weight-for-length Z-scores were found. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting were lower than previously reported from Russia, which may reflect good overall socio-economic conditions in the town. Social variations in linear growth indicate the existence of inequalities in infant health, which may further increase with age."
30299474,0,a,"Bacteria of the Azospirillum and Pseudomonas genera are ubiquitous members of the rhizosphere, where they stimulate plant growth. Given the outstanding capacity of pseudomonads to antagonize other microorganisms, we analyzed the interaction between these two bacterial groups to identify determinants of their compatibility. We could establish that, when in direct contact, certain Pseudomonas strains produce lethality on Azospirillum brasilense cells using an antibacterial type 6 secretion system. When analyzing the effect of Pseudomonas spp. diffusible metabolites on A. brasilense growth on King's B medium, we detected strong inhibitory effects, mostly mediated by siderophores. On Congo Red medium, both inhibitory and stimulatory effects were induced by unidentified compounds. Under this condition, Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 produced a Gac/Rsm-regulated antibiotic which specifically inhibited A. brasilense Sp7 but not Sp245. This effect was not associated with the production of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The three identified antagonism determinants were also active in vivo, producing a reduction of viable cells of A. brasilense in the roots of wheat seedlings when co-inoculated with pseudomonads. These results are relevant to the understanding of social dynamics in the rhizosphere and might aid in the selection of strains for mixed inoculants."
17477777,1,a,"PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of psychosocial stressors, social support and socio-demographic variables on quality of life of breast cancer patients. TOOLS AND METHODS: The study was conducted between December 2004 and May 2005 and included 101 patients, treated in the Oncology Departments of Ege and Pamukkale University Hospitals and Denizli State Hospital. Patients' demographic data were collected by questionnaire. The methods used in the interviews were the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Psychosocial stressors were classified according to life events using the DSM-IV multi-axial diagnostic system. RESULTS: It was found that increase of cancer stage triggers a decrease in psychological quality of life (p<0,05); overall global life quality (p<0,001), perceived social support and performance status (p<0,05), all of these being negatively affected by family stressors. The patients with increased social support, better psychological and overall quality of life (p<0,01) and younger age had more physical wellness besides overall quality of life (p<0,05); lower incomes negatively affected overall global life quality (p<0,01) and working at a job decreased the psychological stressors (p<0,05). CONCLUSION: From these results, it can be postulated that psychosocial stressors, social support and some socio-demographic variables mostly affected quality of life of the breast cancer patients."
19068150,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Amidst a hunger-obesity paradox, the purpose of the present study was to examine the grocery shopping behaviour and food stamp usage of low-income women with children to identify factors influencing their food choices on a limited budget. DESIGN: Focus groups, which included questions based on Social Cognitive Theory constructs, examined food choice in the context of personal, behavioural and environmental factors. A quantitative grocery shopping activity required participants to prioritize food purchases from a 177-item list on a budget of $US 50 for a one-week period, an amount chosen based on the average household food stamp allotment in 2005. SUBJECTS: Ninety-two low-income women, with at least one child aged 9-13 years in their household, residing in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 37 years, and 76% were overweight or obese (BMI> or =25.0 kg/m2). Key findings suggest that their food choices and grocery shopping behaviour were shaped by not only individual and family preferences, but also their economic and environmental situation. Transportation and store accessibility were major determinants of shopping frequency, and they used various strategies to make their food dollars stretch (e.g. shopping based on prices, in-store specials). Generally, meat was the most important food group for purchase and consumption, according to both the qualitative and quantitative data. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve food budgeting skills, increase nutrition knowledge, and develop meal preparation strategies involving less meat and more fruits and vegetables, could be valuable in helping low-income families nutritionally make the best use of their food dollars."
29517192,0,a,"Background: The introduction and maintenance of healthy habits in the field of physical activity at the early stage of life is particularly important for public health. With increasing of public awareness in physical activity, researchers are increasingly questioning its determinants in different age groups. In this paper we focus on variables such as age, sex and place of residence. Objectives: To determine what selected socio-demographic factors influence the level of physical activity of school youth from the eastern region of Poland in different domains of daily life. Material and Methods: A random sample of 916 Polish school youth from Secondary Schools from Eastern Region of Poland aged 16-18 was interviewed in spring 2016 by diagnostic survey method with the use of the official Polish long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Results: Analysing the relationship between gender and the level of physical activity statistically significant differences were found in all domains in favour of boys. The level of total physical activity in girls was 5345.5 MET-min./week, whereas in boys - 6556.6 MET-min./week. In the area of total physical activity, the highest values were observed in pupils from small towns and villages, with lower values in the youth living in large and medium-sized cities. When the relationship of age with the level of physical activity in particular domains was examined, only the activity in the work/ school domain (p = 0.0129) spoke in favour of the youngest pupils (2578.7 MET-min./week) when compared to the oldest ones (2226.4 MET-min./week). Conclusions: The level of physical activity in young people from the Eastern region of Poland is decreasing with age, both in girls and boys. It is therefore important, especially for the group emerging adulthood, to offer a wide variety of updated, involving, age and gender-oriented school physical activity classes that could be easily practised outside the school environment to improve the level of physical activity in leisure domain"
17028277,1,a,"The expression of virulence determinants in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is coordinately regulated in response to both the social environment--commonly referred to as quorum sensing--and to environmental cues. In this study we have dissected the various independent regulation levels for pyocyanin production, which is influenced by the homoserine lactone- and Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS)-mediated quorum-sensing systems as well as by iron and phosphate availability. We demonstrate that the phosphate regulon is involved in the transcriptional activation of rhlR and the augmentation of PQS and pyocyanin production under phosphate limitation. However, we also observed an enhancement of rhlR transcription under low-iron medium conditions and after the addition of PQS that was independent of the phosphate regulon. These results highlight the complexity of secondary metabolite production in P. aeruginosa via environmental cues and the quorum-sensing system."
28804583,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Low birth weight (LBW) is one of the major health problems worldwide. It is important to identify the factors that play a role in the incidence of this adverse pregnancy outcome. This study aimed to develop a tool to measure mothers' lifestyles during pregnancy with a view to the effects of social determinants on health and develop a correlation model of mothers' lifestyles with LBW. METHODS: This study was conducted using methodological and case-control designs in four stages by selecting 750 mothers with infants weighing less than 4000 g using multistage sampling. The questionnaire contained 160 items. Face, content, criterion, and construct validity were used to study the psychometrics of the instrument. RESULTS: After psychometrics, 132 items were approved in six domains. Test results indicated the utility and the high fitness of the model and reasonable relationships adjusted for variables based on conceptual models. Based on the correlation model of lifestyle, occupation (-0.263) and social relationships (0.248) had the greatest overall effect on birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: The review of lifestyle dimensions showed that all of the dimensions directly, indirectly, or both affected birth weight. Thus, given the importance and the role of lifestyle as a determinant affecting birth weight, attention, and training interventions are important to promote healthy lifestyles."
10951443,1,a,"We have examined fatigue in myasthenia gravis (MG) by administering a measure of cognitive and physical fatigue to patients and control subjects before and after administration of a lengthy cognitive battery. Subjects also completed a scale that assessed the impact of fatigue on physical, social, and cognitive function. Results of the study revealed that MG patients experience significantly more cognitive and physical fatigue than do control subjects, and the patients' perceptions of both cognitive and physical fatigue increased significantly following completion of demanding cognitive work. Control subjects reported no significant change in fatigue. Furthermore, MG patients reported that fatigue produced mild to moderate effects on cognitive and social function and moderate effects on physical function. Results from this study indicate that cognitive fatigue is an important symptom of MG and that fatigue produces pervasive impairments in important aspects of patients' lives. Additional studies are needed to understand the neurobehavioral determinants of cognitive fatigue in this population."
31191073,0,a,"Background: Health care education is an important issue in the development of countries, and student's academic achievement plays an important role in this respect. Test anxiety can affect the academic performance of students. This study aimed to investigate the effect of study preparation on test anxiety and performance of public health students. Methods: This quasi-experimental study investigated the effect of study preparation on reducing test anxiety and improving the performance of public health students at Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran, in the academic year 2016-2017. All second- and third-year bachelor's students in public health major were assigned into the intervention (n=20) and control groups (n=25). The assignment was based on the study preparation items and the defined benchmark. Data on general stress and test anxiety were collected by subjective self-assessment via paper-and-pencil surveys in the first week of the semester and before the final exam, respectively. Results: No significant difference was found in the level of general stress between the two groups at the beginning of the semester (p=0.55) based on the study preparation items. The level of test anxiety in the intervention group (47.90) was lower than in the control group (34.64) at the end of the semester (p=0.001). The mean value of exam scores was higher in the intervention group (p=0.015). Conclusions: The intervention reduced the level of test anxiety and improved the performance of students. Faculty members and heads of the departments should help students learn about the study preparation over the semester with engagement in learning-oriented approaches and class activities."
25271947,0,a,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this pilot was to improve multidisciplinary coordination of care and patient education and foster self-management behaviors. The primary and secondary outcomes achieved from this pilot were to decrease the 30-day readmission rate and heart failure length of stay. PRIMARY PRACTICE SITE: The primary practice site was an inpatient medical-surgical nursing unit. FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS: The length of stay decreased from 6.05% to 4.42% for heart failure diagnostic-related group 291 as a result of utilizing the model. The length of stay decreased from 3.9% to 3.09%, which was also less than the national rate of 3.8036% for diagnostic-related group 292. In addition, the readmission rate decreased from 23.1% prior to January 2013 to 12.9%. Implementation of standards of care coordination can decrease length of stay, readmission rate, and improve self-management. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Implementation of evidence-based heart failure guidelines, improved interdisciplinary coordination of care, patient education, self-management skills, and transitional care at the time of discharge improved overall heart failure outcome measures. Utilizing the longitudinal model of care to transition patients to home aided in evaluating social support, resource allocation and utilization, access to care postdischarge, and interdisciplinary coordination of care. The collaboration between disciplines improved continuity of care, patient compliance to their discharge regimen, and adequate discharge follow-up."
29414489,0,a,"On a Northern Plains reservation where alcohol was prohibited, we investigated community members' views on the impacts of alcohol availability. Our methods combined elements of Tribal community participatory research with qualitative inquiry to elicit these perspectives. We used rapid appraisal techniques to conduct confidential interviews with 31 key leaders representing 7 relevant major community systems, and representing a variety of perspectives. Topics included respondents' understandings of the current systems of alcohol availability and use on the reservation, the impacts of these systems on reservation residents, and possible ways to measure these impacts. Respondents reported impacts on individuals, families, and the tribe overall. Alcohol-related problems shaped and were shaped by a constellation of social-ecological conditions: kinship, housing, employment, public/social service capacity, and the supply of alcohol in nearby off-reservation areas, as well as inter-governmental relationships and the spiritual life of reservation residents. A variety of social-structural determinants magnified alcohol impacts, so that the problem drinking of a small number of individuals could have broad effects on their families and the entire community. Our participatory qualitative methods enabled us to directly include the voices as well as the personal experiences and expertise of community members in this presentation. These methods may be broadly applied within policy analysis to identify ways to reduce harms related to alcohol and other drugs for Indigenous communities."
28462813,0,a,"PURPOSE: Significant racial disparities and continuing poor birth outcomes make adolescent pregnancy a significant public health concern in the United States despite declining pregnancy rates. Social determinants of health are associated with increased likelihood of pregnancy and poor maternal and child health outcomes. This study aims to characterize specific elements of social determinants of health in a cohort of predominantly Latina adolescent mothers. METHODS: Between February 2007 and August 2008, 106 pregnant adolescents participated in a study with assessments at 20 to 24 weeks of gestation, and at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Survey questions addressed residential mobility, financial support and childcare, and perceived need for and use of community resources. Comparative analysis assessed differences between adolescents by age (<16 vs. >/=16 years old) and ethnicity (Latina vs. non-Latina). FINDINGS: Adolescent mothers experienced high rates of residential mobility, with 59.4% moving at least once in the year before their prenatal survey. Participants relied primarily on public aid (94-96%) and their parents (81-85%) for financial support. Latina participants were more likely than non-Latinas to rely on public aid. Although many participants reported needing financial support and housing, few used available services. Younger adolescents relied less often on the father of the baby for support than older adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent mothers' high rates of residential mobility and increasing reliance on public assistance highlight resource gaps that potentially put them and their children at risk for poor outcomes. Targeted efforts to augment systemic support in these domains are a critical component of addressing health disparities for this population."
26300823,0,a,"Recent studies in late adolescents (age 17+) show that brain development may proceed till around the 25th year of age. This implies that study performance in higher education could be dependent upon the stage of brain maturation and neuropsychological development. Individual differences in development of neuropsychological skills may thus have a substantial influence on the outcome of the educational process. This hypothesis was evaluated in a large survey of 1760 first-year students at a University of Applied Sciences, of which 1332 are included in the current analyses. This was because of their fit within the age range we pre-set (17-20 years' old at start of studies). Student characteristics and three behavioral ratings of executive functioning (EF) were evaluated with regard to their influence on academic performance. Self-report measures were used: self-reported attention, planning, and self-control and self-monitoring. Results showed that students with better self-reported EF at the start of the first year of their studies obtained more study credits at the end of that year than students with a lower EF self-rating. The correlation between self-control and self-monitoring on the one hand, and study progress on the other, appeared to differ for male and female students and to be influenced by the level of prior education. The results of this large-scale study could have practical relevance. The profound individual differences between students may at least partly be a consequence of their stage of development as an adolescent. Students who show lower levels of attention control, planning, and self-control/self-monitoring can be expected to have a problem in study planning and study progress monitoring and hence study progress. The findings imply that interventions directed at the training of these (executive) functions should be developed and used in higher education in order to improve academic achievement, learning attitude, and motivation."
30849711,0,a,"Strategies to date have been ineffective in reducing high rates of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in Australian Aboriginal people; a disease caused by streptococcal infections. A remote Aboriginal community initiated a collaboration to work towards elimination of RHD. Based in 'both-way learning' (reciprocal knowledge co-creation), the aim of this study was to co-design, implement and evaluate community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) to achieve this vision. Activities related to understanding and addressing RHD social determinants were delivered through an accredited course adapted to meet learner and project needs. Theory-driven evaluation linking CBPAR to empowerment was applied. Data collection comprised focus groups, interviews, observation, and co-development and use of measurement tools such as surveys. Data analysis utilised process indicators from national guidelines for Aboriginal health research, and outcome indicators derived from the Wallerstein framework. Findings include the importance of valuing traditional knowledges and ways of learning such as locally-meaningful metaphors to explore unfamiliar concepts; empowerment through critical thinking and community ownership of knowledge about RHD and research; providing practical guidance in implementing empowering and decolonising principles / theories. Lessons learned are applicable to next stages of the RHD elimination strategy which must include scale-up of community leadership in research agenda-setting and implementation."
28486959,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Studies on alcohol consumption in rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and determinants of alcohol consumption in rural western Kenya. The study was conducted as a preliminary stage of a community-based intervention to reduce hazardous alcohol consumption. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 478 participants aged 18-65 years residing in Ikolomani Sub-county, Kakamega County was conducted in April 2015. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. We defined current drinkers as participants who consumed any alcoholic product in the preceding one month, and hazardous/high-risk drinkers as participants with an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of 8 and above. We summarised data using descriptive statistics and used logistic regression to explore for the correlates of each of current alcohol consumption and hazardous/high-risk alcohol consumption. RESULTS: The sex-standardized prevalence of current alcohol drinkers was 31.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 26.8%-37.2%). The prevalence was higher in men (54.6%) than in women (8.9%). The mean AUDIT score among current drinkers was 16.9 (SD 8.2) and the sex-standardized prevalence of hazardous/high-risk alcohol drinking was 28.7% (95% CI: 24.1%-34.0%). Traditional brews were the most commonly consumed types of alcohol and most drinkers took alcohol in the homes of alcohol sellers/brewers. In multivariate analyses, the number of drinkers in the family, the number of friends who are drinkers and the attitude towards alcohol intake were positively associated with current alcohol drinking status, and with hazardous/high-risk alcohol consumption. Women were less likely to be current drinkers and hazardous/high-risk drinkers than were men. Other socio-demographic factors were not significantly associated with alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of alcohol consumption in the study area was higher than the national level estimate of 13.3%. The results suggest that the social environment is the main determinant of alcohol consumption in this setting. These findings imply that interventions to mitigate alcohol consumption in this area will have to target the social networks of the alcohol consumers, change the drinkers' attitude towards alcohol, and tackle the issue of availability of unlicensed homemade brews."
28218688,0,a,"There is insufficient empirical evidence on the correlates of health care utilization of irregular migrants currently living in Turkey. The aim of this study was to identify individual level determinants associated with health service and medication use. One hundred and fifty-five Afghans completed surveys assessing service utilization including encounters with primary care physicians and outpatient specialists in addition to the use of prescription and nonprescription medicines. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to examine associations between service use and a range of predisposing, enabling, and perceived need factors. Health services utilization was lowest for outpatient specialists (20%) and highest for nonprescription medications (37%). Female gender and higher income predicted encounters with primary care physicians. Income, and other enabling factors such as family presence in Turkey predicted encounters with outpatient specialists. Perceived illness-related need factors had little to no influence on use of services; however, asylum difficulties increased the likelihood for encounters with primary care physicians, outpatient services, and the use of prescription medications. This study suggests that health services use among Afghan migrants in Turkey is low considering the extent of their perceived illness-related needs, which may be further exacerbated by the precarious conditions in which they live."
18631388,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Health professionals, policy-makers and researchers need to be able to explore potential associations between prevalence rates and quality of care with a range of possible determinants including socio-economic deprivation and morbidity levels to determine the impact of commissioning and service delivery. In the UK, data in England are only available nationally at practice postcode level. In Scotland, such data are available based on an aggregate of the practices population's postcodes. The use of data assigned to the practice postcode may underestimate the association between ill health and income deprivation. Here, we report on the impact of using data assigned to the practice population by comparing analyses using English and Scottish data. RESULTS: Income deprivation based on data assigned to the practice postcode under-estimated deprivation compared to using income deprivation data assigned to the practice population for the five least deprived deciles, and over-estimated deprivation for the five most deprived deciles. The biggest differences were found for the most deprived decile. A similar trend was found for limiting long-term illness (LLTI). Differences between the QOF prevalence rates of the least and most deprived deciles using practice postcode data were similar (0.2% points or less) in England and Scotland for 8 out of 10 clinical domains. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences in the prevalence rate between the least and most deprived deciles increase for all clinical domains. A similar trend was again found for LLTI. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences for population achievement increase for all CHD quality indicators with the exception of beta-blockers (CHD10). With practice postcode assigned deprivation, significant differences between the least and most deprived deciles were found for 2 out 8 indicators, compared to 5 using practice population assigned deprivation. For LLTI differences between the lowest and most deprived deciles increased for all indicators when ill health assigned to the practice population was used. CONCLUSION: We have found, through comparing deprivation and ill health data assigned to either the practice postcode or the practice population postcode in Scotland, that analyses based on practice postcode assigned data under-estimated the relationship between deprivation and ill health for both prevalence and quality care. Given the importance of understanding the effect of deprivation and ill health on a range of determinants related to health care, policy makers should ensure that practice population data are available and used at national level in England and elsewhere where possible."
19034049,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variability and determinants of menopause age in two European cohort studies, the European Respiratory Health Survey and the Swiss Air Pollution and Lung Disease in Adults Cohort. METHODS: Age at menopause was estimated in 5,288 women, aged 30 to 60 years, randomly selected in nine European countries between 1998 and 2002. Determinants of natural and surgically induced menopause were investigated by Cox regression and heterogeneity by meta-analysis. Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were assessed in a subsample. RESULTS: A quarter of the women were postmenopausal by age 50.8 years. Median age of natural menopause was 54 years. Hormone levels were within expected ranges for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Surgically induced menopause was highly prevalent (22%-47%), associated with earlier timing of menopause. Determinants of earlier menopause were current smoking (hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.27-1.98), body mass index greater than 30 kg/m (HR, 1.32; 95%, CI, 1.02-1.70), and low physical activity (HR, 1.37; 95%, CI, 1.12-1.67). The determinant for later menopause was multiparity (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89). Predictors were similar for naturally and surgically induced menopause. Oral contraceptive use yielded heterogeneous effects on timing of menopause. Later birth was associated with later menopause (HR, 0.934; 95% CI, 0.91-0.96). This evidence of a secular trend is heterogeneous across countries. CONCLUSIONS: Age at menopause varies across Europe, shifting toward higher ages. This secular trend seems paradoxical because several adult determinants, that is, overweight, smoking, sedentarity, and nulliparity, associated with early menopause are on the rise in Europe. The heterogeneity of the secular trend suggests additional country-specific factors not included in the study, such as improved childhood nutrition and health, that have an influence on reproductive aging."
20617585,0,a,"Cultural explanations of economic phenomena have recently enjoyed a renaissance among economists. This article provides further evidence for the salience of culture through an in-depth case study of one of the fastest-growing economies in the world during the last 50 years-Botswana. The unique culture that developed among the Tswana before and during the early days of colonialism, which shared many features with those of western nation-states, appears to have contributed significantly to the factors widely seen as determinants of Botswana's post-colonial economic success: state legitimacy, good governance and democracy, commercial traditions, well-established property rights, and inter-ethnic unity. Neighbouring Southern African cultures typically did not exhibit these traits."
15230050,1,a,"Atherosclerosis is a common disease in parrots. The disease is found in all common parrot species, but especially in African Grey parrots and Amazons. It is a disease of older birds that is seen in both males and females. The most common sign is sudden death, but clinical symptoms that can be found include dyspnea, lethargy and nervous signs, such as paresis and collapses. Because the clinical signs are seldomly seen, it is difficult to diagnose atherosclerosis and therefore it is mostly an unexpected finding at necropsy. Age and species are determinants of atherosclerosis in parrots. Suggested risk factors include an elevated plasma cholesterol level, diet composition, social stress and inactivity, but research is needed to confirm this."
10960532,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Health policymakers are concerned about the proportion of people who say they are unwilling to receive a blood transfusion. This article examines how social, cultural, and political factors affect the perceived risk of transfusions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected as part of a large national telephone survey of 1204 people conducted in the United States in 1997 and 1998. The survey elicited images associated with blood transfusions and contained questions about the perceived risk of the blood supply, sensitivity to stigma, world views, trust, and demographics. RESULTS: The results showed that a substantial proportion of people do not consider the US blood supply to be safe and say they would not accept blood if hospitalized. The images evoked most frequently by the stimulus phrase ""blood transfusions"" were related to AIDS or HIV. The people who tend to perceive the greatest personal and public risk from blood transfusions are female, nonwhite, and less educated, and they have not previously received a transfusion. Sensitivity to stigma, mistrust, one's perceived inability to control hazardous activities and technologies, and fatalistic and egalitarian world views tend to be associated with heightened concern about the risk of blood transfusions. CONCLUSION: Risk perceptions need to be monitored to anticipate and deal with problems of public acceptance. Risk management strategies should be tailored to the specific characteristics of individuals that are important determinants of the perceived risk of transfusions."
26729766,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of motor disability in children and is often accompanied by sensory and/or cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to characterise visual acuity impairment, perceptual visual dysfunction (PVD) and physical disability in a community-based sample of Bangladeshi children with CP and to assess the impact of these factors on the quality of life of the children. METHODS: A key informant study was used to recruit children with CP from Sirajganj district. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels and visual impairment were assessed by a physiotherapist and an optometrist, respectively. Assessments of visual perception were performed and standardised questionnaires were administered to each child's main carer to elicit indicators of PVD and parent-reported health-related quality of life. A generalised linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the determinants of the quality of life scores. RESULTS: 180 children were recruited. The median age was 8 years (IQR: 6-11 years); 112 (62%) were male; 57 (32%) had visual acuity impairment and 95 (53%) had some parent-reported PVD. In analyses adjusted for age, sex, GMFCS and acuity impairment, visual attention (p<0.001) and recognition/navigation (p<0.001) were associated with total health-related quality of life, and there were similar trends for total PVD score (p=0.006) and visual search (p=0.020). CONCLUSIONS: PVD is an important contributor in reducing quality of life in children with CP, independent of motor disability and acuity impairment. Better characterisation of PVD is important to help design interventions for affected children, which may improve their quality of life."
31679378,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the challenges and opportunities of the Communicable Diseases Surveillance System (CDSS) in Iran. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) with 64 participants from October 2016 to April 2017. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit participants. The collected data were analyzed via the content analysis method. Data analysis was performed using MAXQDA10 software. RESULTS: The results of this qualitative study were categorized in two parts: Challenges and opportunities. The CDSS is facing challenges in the fields of stewardship, reporting, information analysis, information, interventions, and education. Good infrastructures and structure, the technical support provided by the Centre for Communicable Disease Control (CCDC), the achievements of the CDSS, and the suitable electronic systems are among the opportunities of CDSS. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that CDSS has several major challenges. Authorities and policymakers must not ignore communicable diseases and their management tools, including CDSS because of their focus on non-communicable diseases. Some important strategies to overcome the challenges of CDSS can be the following: motivating policy makers to put emphasis on communicable diseases as a national security issue, the ratification and modification of laws and regulations on reporting, the involvement of the CDSS in the accreditation of hospitals and the renewal of the license for healthcare professionals, and motivating organizations outside the health sector to participate in the programs through inter-institutional agreements."
25006080,0,a,"The idea of a Framework Convention for Global Health (FCGH), using the treaty-making powers of the World Health Organization (WHO), has been promoted as an opportunity to advance global health equity and the right to health. The idea has promise, but needs more thought regarding risks, obstacles, and strategies. The reform of global health governance must be based on a robust analysis of the political economy out of which the drivers of inequality and the denial of the right to health arise. Some of the published commentary has focused on using the proposed FCGH to institutionalize a paradigm change regarding international aid for health care, i.e., reconceptualizing such aid as obligatory, based on human solidarity rather than strategic considerations, based on global stability and national security. We warn against limiting the project to questions of inter-governmental financial transfers because of the risk of neglecting the underlying structural determinants of health injustice. Such neglect would help to legitimize an unjust and unsustainable global economic regime. We raise further questions about the strategic logic informing any campaign for a FCGH. The governments of the United States and Europe have put considerable effort into weakening WHO through tight donor controls, and it would require heavy pressure to persuade them to sign on to a FCGH. Generating such pressure would require strong popular mobilization around the local and diverse priorities of different communities across the globe, and recognition of a common need for effective regulation at the global level. We argue for a broad-based campaign from which the need for more effective global health regulation (and a FCGH) would emerge as a common theme arising from myriad more specific claims. This type of campaign would respond to local needs, and would also be understood within a global, political, and economic perspective."
20198904,1,a,"Drug use is a complex behavior with multidimensional determinants, including social, psychological, cultural, economic, and biological factors. Blood borne viral infections including hepatitis C virus are transmitted when an uninfected intravenous drug user (IVDU) uses injection equipment, especially syringes, that have previously been used by an infected person. The transmission can also result from sharing other injection equipment such as 'cookers' and 'cottons'. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse have declined substantially since the introduction of needle exchange. Infection with hepatitis C may spontaneously resolve during the acute stage and never progress to chronic infection, or the infection may become chronic without medical complications, or the infection may become chronic with progressive medical complications. Regular testing for infection is an important strategy for secondary prevention of chronic hepatitis C infection. Care for hepatitis C is a vital component of a comprehensive health program for persons using illicit drugs. Such care includes screening for transmission risk behavior, prevention counseling and education, testing for HCV antibody and RNA. IDUs found to have chronic HCV infection should be assessed for the presence and degree of liver disease and evaluated for treatment for HCV Hepatitis C care also requires providing access to treatment for substance use and abuse. Therapy with opioid agonists, including methadone maintenance treatment, has been shown to diminish and often eliminate opioid use and reduce transmission of infection. Approval of buprenorphine makes office-based pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction possible. When considering treatment for hepatitis C, particular attention must be paid to mental health conditions. As a group, IDUs exhibit higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders than the general population. IFN-based regimens for hepatitis C are often complicated by neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including depression, insomnia, and irritability. Strong linkages with mental health services, whether on-site or within the community, are a vital component of comprehensive health programs for IDUs and are particularly important during treatment for hepatitis C. Past episodes of depression or other psychiatric disorders are not absolute contraindications for the treatment for HCV infection. Some authors recommend prophylactic antidepressant therapy before initiating treatment for HCV in patients thought to be at a high risk of depression."
21294858,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The evaluation of interventions and policies designed to promote resilience, and research to understand the determinants and associations, require reliable and valid measures to ensure data quality. This paper systematically reviews the psychometric rigour of resilience measurement scales developed for use in general and clinical populations. METHODS: Eight electronic abstract databases and the internet were searched and reference lists of all identified papers were hand searched. The focus was to identify peer reviewed journal articles where resilience was a key focus and/or is assessed. Two authors independently extracted data and performed a quality assessment of the scale psychometric properties. RESULTS: Nineteen resilience measures were reviewed; four of these were refinements of the original measure. All the measures had some missing information regarding the psychometric properties. Overall, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Resilience Scale for Adults and the Brief Resilience Scale received the best psychometric ratings. The conceptual and theoretical adequacy of a number of the scales was questionable. CONCLUSION: We found no current 'gold standard' amongst 15 measures of resilience. A number of the scales are in the early stages of development, and all require further validation work. Given increasing interest in resilience from major international funders, key policy makers and practice, researchers are urged to report relevant validation statistics when using the measures."
12971112,1,a,"As we move forward in the new century, epidemiologists and public health practitioners are faced with the challenge of reviewing the current direction of epidemiology and its links with public health. While the history of epidemiology has been a successful and productive one, there is a danger that modern epidemiology is becoming too narrow in its scope, concerned primarily with the analysis of risk factors in individuals, while ignoring sociological and ecological perspectives of health. We argue that a theoretical framework to guide the practice of epidemiology is needed which encompasses a role for social determinants of health while simultaneously also acknowledging the importance of behaviour and biology, and the inter-connectedness of all these factors. This paper presents a public health model of social determinants of health, which provides a framework for testing the causal pathways linking social determinant variables with health care system attributes, disease inducing behaviours and health outcomes. This approach provides an improved opportunity to identify and evaluate evidence-based public health interventions, and facilitates stronger links between modern epidemiology and public health practice."
24066987,0,a,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the development and implementation of promotion of physical activity in a rural community by applying the principles of social marketing and to determine participation behaviour in a physical activity programme in a community setting. METHODS: The intervention targeted 485 people, 20-49 years of age, residents of Periakattupalayam and Rangareddipalayam villages, Tamil Nadu. This community-based participatory research was based on the principles of 'social marketing'. Health education by one-to-one counselling, written materials and community events were used to popularize moderate intensity physical activity (brisk walking for 30 minutes on 4 days/week). We formed 30 walking groups under four coordinators, in a home-based setting with professional supervision and guidance. A log of physical activity sessions for the 10-week intervention period was maintained in the form of group attendance record. Village leaders, self-help groups and youth clubs were involved in promoting physical activity. RESULTS: Of the 485 subjects, 265 people (54.6%) engaged in brisk walking >4 days a week, while 156 subjects (32.2%) performed walking on 1-4 days per week during the intervention. The drop-out rate was 13.2% (64 subjects). Age, occupation and educational status were important determinants of participation and adherence to the physical activity programme. CONCLUSION: Application of social marketing techniques in an intervention to promote physical activity was successful in a rural Indian community. Studying the determinants of adoption of a physical activity programme and addressing the barriers to behaviour change are essential for designing relevant policies and effective programmes."
17461334,1,a,"Understanding the determinants of individuals' perceptions of their risk of becoming infected with HIV and their perceptions of acceptable strategies of prevention is an essential step toward curtailing the spread of this disease. We focus in this article on learning and decision-making about AIDS in the context of high uncertainty about the disease and appropriate behavioral responses. We argue that social interactions are important for both. Using longitudinal survey data from rural Kenya and Malawi, we test this hypothesis. We investigate whether social interactions--and especially the extent to which social network partners perceive themselves to be at risk--exert causal influences on respondents' risk perceptions and on one approach to prevention, spousal communication about the threat of AIDS to the couple and their children. The study explicitly allows for the possibility that important characteristics, such as unobserved preferences or community characteristics, determine not only the outcomes of interest but also the size and composition of networks. The most important empirical result is that social networks have significant and substantial effects on risk perceptions and the adoption of new behaviors even after we control for unobserved factors."
15727964,1,a,"Clinical medicine and health policy planning find common cause as they seek to define the determinants of health. There is substantial recent interest in the social ecology in which health is embedded. However, biology is where these contributing environmental factors are translated. I provide a new conceptual framework for the biological determinants of health. The old public health rubric of host, agent, and environment as the features that define the root elements of health is an impoverished scheme, because it does not represent our new appreciation of genetic and aging contributions to phenotypic health. I propose genes, external agency, internal agency, and aging as more operationally helpful determinants that effectively describe the biological experience of the organism. This scheme has the advantage of differentiating those agencies that are practically approachable, and therefore deserving of increased attention and investment, and those that are currently intractable."
24261639,0,a,"BACKGROUND: An estimated 358,000 maternal deaths still occur worldwide each year. The place of delivery is of great significance to the reduction of maternal mortality. Moreover, socio-economic factors, cultural traits, and local customs are associated with health-seeking behavior. This study aimed to explore determinants of association between social support and place of delivery. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from September to November 2011 at Sosiot Health Center, Kericho West District, Kenya. Participants were 303 mothers who brought their babies to the health center for immunization within their first year of life. Women underwent a structured interview using a questionnaire on demographic characteristics and their experiences of delivery including place of delivery and social support. RESULTS: The proportion of deliveries at health facilities was significantly higher in unmarried than married women (93% and 78%, respectively; P = 0.008). Unmarried women whose mothers supported them in housework and whose sisters helped them fetch water were more likely to deliver at health facilities (P = 0.002 and 0.042, respectively) than those without this support. However, married women whose husbands supported them in farming and whose neighbors helped them fetch water were less likely to deliver at health facilities (P = 0.003 and 0.021, respectively) than those without this support. Married women who were advised to deliver at a health facility by their mother-in-law or health staff were more likely to deliver at health facilities (P = 0.015 and 0.022, respectively) than those who did not receive this advice. Multivariate analysis revealed that married women were more likely to deliver at health facilities if they were highly educated (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5); had financial capability (OR = 4.3); had medical insurance (OR = 4.2); were primiparous (OR = 3.5); did not have the support of sisters-in-law for fetching water (OR = 2.2); or were advised to deliver at a health facility by family or neighbors (OR = 2.5). CONCLUSIONS: Promotion of delivery at health facilities requires approaches that consider women's social situation, since factors influencing place of delivery differ for married and unmarried women."
12720254,1,a,"In many countries, social health insurance systems are being reformed in favor of more competition among insurers, while premiums are community rated by regulation. The implicit incentives for insurers to engage in risk selection can only be curtailed using appropriate systems of risk-adjusted equalization payments among insurers. To develop these systems, predictors of individual utilization patterns have to be identified, e.g. via regression analysis using previous utilization data. In some countries such as Germany, such data are hardly ever available. In the early nineties, a number of sickness funds participated in an experiment in which individual utilization data were collected. Our data set covers more than 70,000 members of company sickness funds over a 5-year period. We analyze socio-demographic determinants of utilization which could be used as risk adjusters in a risk equalization scheme. Our results suggest that besides age and sex, the set of risk adjusters should include income, family status and a dummy for the last year of life."
16019275,1,a,"The purpose of this study is to examine racial/ethnic differences in the change of psychological distress as measured by CES-D over time and its associated factors between older Korean immigrants and non-Hispanic White elders, based on a social stress perspective. Data come from a two-wave panel survey of 172 older Korean immigrants and 157 non-Hispanic White elders, with a follow-up period of 12 to 15 months. The sample was drawn from a three-stage probability sampling method. Ordinary least square regressions in a hierarchical process and change score method were used to analyze the two-wave panel data. Older Korean immigrants reported higher levels of psychological distress than the non-Hispanic White elderly at both Time 1 and Time 2. Changes in self-assessed health status and functional limitations were significantly associated with change in psychological distress for both ethnic groups. Increased social support significantly decreased psychological distress at Time 2, for older Korean immigrants only. This study discusses practice and policy implications for service and interventions for older immigrants to assist their adjustment to a host society."
12512223,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Psychological resources and social support are important determinants of health, but brief and validated scales measuring these dimensions in French are lacking. METHODS: Instruments measuring self-esteem and mastery, and affective and confident social support were administered by mail to 1257 university students. Factor analysis, internal consistency statistics, and correlations with related variables were used to derive abbreviated scales and confirm their validity. RESULTS: Factor analysis and item reduction yielded four brief scales: mastery (4 items), self-esteem (4 items), affective social support (2 items), and problem-solving social support (4 items). All four scales had few missing items and adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.70). All scores were associated with self-reported general health, and with visits to mental health specialists. Scores of self-esteem and mastery were also associated with physician visits (inversely), and confidence in finishing studies and finding a job. Scores of affective and confident social support correlated with the intensity of social activities and the number of people the respondent could count on. CONCLUSIONS: The abbreviated scales retained adequate psychometric properties and may be usefully applied in health research among similar French-speaking populations."
17279444,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This study examined health related quality of life (HRQOL) and its predictors among African-, Asian-, Latina-, and European American breast cancer survivors (BCS) using a socio-ecologically and culturally contextual theoretical model of HRQOL. METHODS: We employed a case-control, cross sectional design with a population-based sample from the California Cancer Registry. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The sample included 703 BCS: 135 (19%) African-, 206 (29%) Asian-, 183 (26%) Latina-, and 179 (26%) European Americans. Latinas reported the lowest HRQOL (p < 0.0001). The final regression model explained 70% of variance in HRQOL. Years since diagnosis, number of comorbidities, role limitation, emotional wellbeing, quality of doctor-patient relationship, social support, and life stress are significant HRQOL determinants. Exploratory regression analyses indicate ethnic differences in significant predictors for HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL among this multiethnic sample ranged from fair to good. Bivariate analysis suggests that ethnic differences in HRQOL exist. However, regression analyses demonstrated that socio-ecological factors in conjunction with medical characteristics are more salient to HRQOL outcomes, and that ethnic group membership may be a proxy for socio-ecological context. Furthermore, the influence of ethnicity, culture, and social-ecology are complex; research with large, population-based samples are necessary to disentangle the impact of contextual factors on HRQOL."
17945162,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacy is a dynamic, growing, and increasingly diverse profession. It has a new patient orientation, especially in developed countries. There is a paucity of work examining pharmacists' satisfaction and professionalization in developing nations, such as Lebanon. OBJECTIVE: The purpose this study is to explore the Lebanese pharmacists' professional satisfaction and applicable needs regarding their profession. Specific objectives aimed to examine Lebanese pharmacists' satisfaction and determine whether the Lebanese Order of Pharmacists helps pharmacists to meet their professional needs. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of Lebanese pharmacists working in all pharmacy practicing environments in Lebanon. A random sample was drawn from the list of registered pharmacists provided by the Lebanese Order of Pharmacists. Selected individuals were visited and interviewed in their workplace. Pharmacists who had no registered address were contacted and interviewed face to face. RESULTS: Newly graduated pharmacists seemed more likely to work in community pharmacies or as medical representatives. Most interviewed pharmacists had no difficulty finding a job, but they all thought that the Order of Pharmacists should get more involved in advising and providing job opportunities, because the market is currently saturated. Most were financially satisfied, especially owners of community pharmacies. Although half of the pharmacists were psychologically satisfied, a great number of community, hospital, and medical representative pharmacists were not physically satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is necessary for a thorough evaluation of Lebanese pharmacists' professional satisfaction and its specific determinants, with the ultimate goal of finding adequate solutions for their needs."
16948157,1,a,"BACKGROUND: A significant and growing number of people work long hours. Research examining impacts is limited, but raises concerns about risks to the worker, the family, the employer, and the community. The purpose of this report, which is authored by the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) Long Work Hours Team, is to motivate and guide future research by proposing a framework for studying long work hours and discussing research gaps. METHODS: The NORA Long Work Hours Team examined research reports and literature reviews, and gathered input from a conference on long work hours organized by the Team and faculty from University of Maryland. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A framework is proposed for long work hours, including determinants, outcomes, and moderating factors of long work hours, suggesting that studies need to include more clear and complete descriptions of work schedules, worker characteristics, and the work environment, and need to consider a wider range of possible health, safety, social and economic outcomes for workers, families, employers, and the community. Additional studies are needed on vulnerable employee groups and those critical to public safety. More studies are also needed to develop interventions and test their effectiveness."
30065758,0,a,"Background: A surgical operation in pediatric patients is a rather stressful experience for both children and their parents. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of specific demographic characteristics in parent's and children's preoperative anxiety. Methods: The sample was composed of 128 Greek-speaking children (1-14 years of age) who had to undergo minor surgery in a University General Hospital. Before surgical operation, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire and a questionnaire for the social-demographic characteristics were completed by the parents. Children's preoperative anxiety was evaluated using the Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS). Results: The independent predictors of increased anxiety levels in parents are child's age (p=0.024) and gender (girls: p=0.008), living in rural areas (parents: p < 0.001; children: p=0.009), being a mother (p=0.046), high or low education level (p=0.031), a no premedicated child (p=0.007), and high baseline parental anxiety (p=0.003). Previous hospitalization (p=0.019), high situational parental anxiety (p < 0.001), no premedication (p=0.014), and being the only child in the family (p=0.045) are found to be the main determinants of preoperative anxiety control in children. Conclusions: This study identifies possible risk factors of preoperative anxiety in parents and their children, which are high parental anxiety, child's age, no premedication, being the only child in the family, living in rural areas, education level, and previous hospitalization."
16872670,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the motivational determinants of the continuation of breast-feeding until 3 months postpartum. METHODS: A prospective cohort study using the Integrated Change Model in 341 women in 5 child health care centers. RESULTS: At birth, 73% of the mothers started with breast-feeding and 39% of them continued at least 3 months postpartum. Mothers who continued for 3 months differed in almost all the motivational determinants from mothers who discontinued. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, social support for formula feeding from significant others and situational self-efficacy for breast-feeding made a significant independent contribution to the continuation of breast-feeding. Among the predisposing determinants, the strongest positive predictor of continuation was the intention to return to work at 1 month postpartum. CONCLUSION: The Integrated Change Model is valid to explain and predict the continuation of breast-feeding. Hence, the results may be used to tailor future interventions aimed at promoting breast-feeding. In the discussion, we use the results to target interventions."
15081204,1,a,"This new study goes beyond the well-established correlation between mortality differentials and occupational status, to focus on the impact of professional careers on mortality risk. It shows heterogeneity in the mortality risks within occupational classes, strongly related to the type of occupational moves experienced. The occupational data are taken from the French longitudinal census sample-using 1968 and 1975 census records-and mortality risks are estimated over the 1975-1980 period, for both occupational classes and pathways between classes. Results show a close relationship between occupational mobility and mortality. For men, favorable occupational moves-e.g. from clerks to upper class-put them less at risk of mortality than their counterparts who remained in their class. An inverse relationship is found for unfavorable moves. In most cases, the mortality risks of the movers are in between the risks in the class left and in the class joined. Similar patterns apply to specific groups of women only (upper classes, manual workers, clerks) for which occupational moves are probably driven, as for most men, by mortality related determinants (level of education, qualifications, health, etc.). The findings strongly support the use of a dynamic approach, based on individuals' experiences, to improve our understanding of mortality differentials."
25905077,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although theoretically peace affects health, few published evidence for such an association was empirically available. This study aimed to explore the association between peace and life expectancy (LE) among the world countries. METHODS: In an ecological study and using random effects regression model, we examined the association between peace and LE among world countries between 2007 and 2012. The LE at birth and global peace index (GPI: a score between 1 and 5, higher score means lower peace) were selected as outcome and main predictor variables, respectively. We adjusted their association for the gross national income (GNI) per capita and education index (EI). Data were obtained from the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) and UNDP (United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Numbers of included countries were 158 based on the available data. RESULTS: GPI had a negative, considerable, and statistically significant effect on LE (standardized coefficient -0.039; 95% CI: -0.058, -0.019). This association was also significant even after the adjustment for EI (-0.019; 95% CI: -0.035, -0.003), GNI (-0.035; 95% CI: -0.055, -0.015), and both EI and GNI (-0.017; 95% CI: -0.033, -0.001). The full model showed that around 0.61 of the variation of LE among countries may be explained by the GPI, EI and GNI per capita. CONCLUSION: The contribution of peace as a global determinant of LE was empirically considerable even after the adjustment for the economic and education levels of countries. This implies that governments should make efforts to settle peace through implementing good governance based on interactions with both public and other countries."
18771064,1,a,"Using data from a 2005 national survey of working adults in the United States, we examine the effects of the gender composition of the superordinate-subordinate role-set on mental and physical health measures. Subordinates' and superordinates' genders are important determinants. Men who work in gender-mixed superordinate contexts (i.e., with one male and one female superior) report lower levels of distress and physical symptoms than men who work with one male superior. Women who work with one male superior report less distress and fewer physical symptoms compared to women who work with one female superior or in gender-mixed superordinate contexts. With a few exceptions, these observations generally hold net of occupation, job sector, and an array of work-related conditions. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of predictions derived from the similarity-attraction and role congruity theories. We also outline ways that theoretical development in relational demography can be refined by a more specific focus on the demographic characteristics--especially gender--of the superordinate-subordinate role-set."
16155281,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Although smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer, much is unknown about lung cancer etiology, including risk determinants for nonsmokers and modifying factors for smokers. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that alcohol consumption contributes to lung cancer risk. DESIGN: We conducted a pooled analysis using standardized exposure and covariate data from 7 prospective studies with 399,767 participants and 3137 lung cancer cases. Study-specific relative risks (RRs) and CIs were estimated and then combined to calculate pooled multivariate RRs by using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We found a slightly greater risk for the consumption of > or = 30 g alcohol/d than for that of 0 g alcohol/d in men (RR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.61; P for trend = 0.03) and in women (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.43; P for trend = 0.03). In male never smokers, the RR for consumption of > or = 15 g alcohol/d rather than 0 g alcohol/d was 6.38 (95% CI: 2.74, 14.9; P for trend < 0.001). In women, there were few never-smoking cases and no evidence of greater risk (RR: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.64, 2.87). Because of possible residual confounding by smoking, we performed sensitivity analyses by reclassifying the never smokers in the highest drinking category as former smokers. Resulting associations for alcohol consumption were somewhat attenuated, but P for trend = 0.05 for men, which was near the original P = 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: A slightly greater risk of lung cancer was associated with the consumption of > or = 30 g alcohol/d than with no alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption was strongly associated with greater risk in male never smokers. Residual confounding by smoking may explain part of the observed relation."
24778781,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The health of elderly population in the world has been an important issue in recent century and the use of appropriate or inappropriate medications is challenging among them. The purpose of this study was to assess the pattern of medication in elderly population in Amirkola, northern of Iran. METHODS: This study was conducted on 1534 elderly subjects who participated in Amirkola Health and Ageing Project (AHAP) in 2013. The number of drugs that was used regardless of their indication in terms of age, level of education, disease, cognitive or depression and social support were recorded and compared in both sexes. RESULTS: The mean number of drugs used in men and women was 2.1+/-2.45 and 3.59+/-2.75, respectively (P=0.000). Concurrent use of > 4 drugs was seen in 16.5% of men and in 35.12% of women (P=0.000). The difference for using the number of drugs was significant between sexes with low educational level, but was similar in educated individuals. The use of polypharmacy was associated with the number of concurrent diseases (r=0.58, P=000), cognitive status (r=0.065, P=0.012), social support (r=-0.1, P=0.008), and depression (r=0.273, P=0.000). CONCLUSION: The results show that the use of polypharmacy in the elderly population in Amirkola is relatively high and they need to be educated. Considering the other indices, this problem highly manifested more in the elderly women."
17955705,1,a,"This paper analyses the determinants of self-reported health in Ireland, conditioning self-reported health on a set of socio-economic, labour market and social capital variables. Ireland has the highest self-reported health rate in Europe, a finding backed-up by other studies. Data were derived from the 2002 and 2005 European Social survey. The full 87,915 observations from both rounds were pooled and used to estimate mean self-rated health across Europe. The Irish data were isolated, totalling 2,049 individuals for 2002 and 2,286 individuals for 2005. The 2002 data were used to analyse the determinants of subjective health state, as it had a richer array of social capital variables. The results demonstrate statistically significant effects of income on self-reported health that are robust to different statistical specifications and statistically significant though modest effects of social capital variables such as associational membership and frequency of social meeting and labour market variables such as being on a limited as opposed to permanent contract."
28989816,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To describe how select Social Determinants of Health (SDH) are associated with the burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among foreign-born persons residing in the United States. METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) 2010 Risk Factor Survey data to investigate the independent relationship between SDH and HBV testing and access to care. RESULTS: HBV infected persons with insurance were more likely to see a physician than those without. Respondents worried about money to pay rent or mortgage were more likely to report HBV infection than individuals who reported they never worry. Compared to English speakers, Spanish-speakers were less likely to report HBV infection, Vietnamese-speakers were more likely to see a physician for HBV infection, and Khmer-speakers were less likely to be tested. CONCLUSIONS: Health insurance coverage, worries about paying rent, and language of interview all differentially affect HBV testing and linkages to care among foreign-born persons. Multi-sectorial stakeholder collaborative efforts should integrate resources to provide culturally sensitive health promotion campaigns which may improve HBV related outcomes."
17273563,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the health-related quality of life of patients submitted to resection of the pulmonary parenchyma due to neoplasia. METHODS: The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey was used to evaluate patients in the preoperative period and on postoperative days 30, 90 and 180. We used the GEE statistical model, in which the dependent variable (quality of life) changes for each patient over the course of the evaluation. Independent variables were gender, age, educational level, type of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, forced vital capacity and 6-minute walk test. The level of significance adopted was 5%. RESULTS: The final study sample comprised 36 patients, 20 of whom were men. Of those 36 patients, 17 were submitted to lobectomy, 10 to pneumonectomy, 6 to segmentectomy, and 3 to bilobectomy. Chemotherapy was used in 15 patients, radiotherapy in 2, and a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in 2. Improved quality of life was seen in the following domains: social (on postoperative day 90); physical/functional (some patients presenting better forced vital capacity and 6-minute walk test performance); and physical (in patients undergoing smaller resections). Lowered quality of life was seen in the following domains: social (for female patients); physical/social (resulting from radiotherapy, chemotherapy or both); and physical/functional (by postoperative day 30). CONCLUSIONS: It is important that studies evaluating the various determinants of quality of life, as well as the impact that cancer treatment modalities have on such variables, be conducted. The knowledge provided by such studies can contribute to improving the quality of life of patients undergoing pulmonary resection due to neoplasia."
17905053,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Sickness absence is a major occupational health problem, but evidence for associations between potentially modifiable psychosocial work factors and sickness absence is still scarce. We studied the impact of relational justice and effort-reward imbalance on subsequent rates of sickness absence. METHODS: The Whitehall II prospective cohort study of British civil servants, 10,308 men and women, was established between 1985 and 1988. Indicators of effort-reward imbalance and the relational component of organizational justice were constructed from questions included at baseline. Participants were classified into three groups (low, intermediate, and high) for both effort-reward imbalance and relational justice. Short (< or =7 days) and long (>7 days) spells of sickness absence during 1985-1989 and 1991-1995 were used to study immediate and longer term effects of work characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, employment grade, and baseline health, men and women with low relational justice had increased risks of long spells of sickness absence of 14% and 28% in comparison to men and women experiencing high levels of justice. Similar effect sizes (25% and 21%) were found for high vs. low effort-reward imbalance. Both work measures also predicted short spells of sickness absence. Effort-reward imbalance (men and women) and relational justice (women only) each predicted long spells of sickness absence independently of the other. CONCLUSIONS: Both relational justice and effort-reward imbalance are important determinants of sickness absence. Workplace interventions to improve these aspects of working conditions have the potential to reduce levels of sickness absence."
19770127,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This study explores the current patterns of reproductive health service use among young women in the USA and the changing influence of socio-demographic factors on the types of services used over time. METHODS: The study population, drawn from the two last cycles of the National Survey of Family Growth, consists of women aged 15-24 (n = 2543 in 1995, n = 2157 in 2002). We examined trends in use of 'contraceptive services' and 'other reproductive health services for preventive care' and tested for changes in the patterns of use of these services over time. Logistic regression models were used to further clarify the factors associated with the use of the two types of services in 2002. RESULTS: Results show no difference in the overall use of reproductive health services in the past year but did reveal changes in the type of service sought. Use of services for contraception increased by 10 percentage points (39.3% in 1995 to 49.7% in 2002, P < 0.001), although the use of other services remained stable (53.2% in 1995, 50.2% in 2002, P = 0.14). The patterns of use varied over time, exhibiting growing social disparities. In 2002, the use of contraceptive services depended on women's age, number of partners, personal and mother's level of education, and menstrual problems. The use of other reproductive health services for preventive care varied across women's socio-economic background. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates increasing social differentials in the use of reproductive health services for preventive care among young women in the USA between 1995 and 2002, a finding which calls for careful monitoring in the context of limited resources."
31909079,0,a,"Excessive alcohol use is a significant public health problem globally. Alcohol use typically begins in adolescence or early adult life, and effective prevention strategies focused on this age group are needed to avoid development of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). AUD is a worldwide problem resulting in millions of deaths, including hundreds of thousands of young lives lost. It is not only a causal factor in many diseases, but also a precursor to injury and violence. Furthermore, its' negative impacts can spread throughout a community or a country, and beyond, by influencing levels and patterns of alcohol consumption across borders [1]. This study sought to ascertain the influence of socio-cultural factors in AUD among adults. The study adopted a descriptive cross-sectional study design. Stratified random sampling techniques were used to sample alcohol users across the county. Both descriptive (frequencies and percentages) and inferential (chi-square test) statistics were employed in data analysis. Content analysis was used to identify emerging themes in the interviews conducted. The study established that 65% of alcohol users in Muranga County have symptoms of AUD. Socio-cultural factors were found to influence AUD. Based on the findings, it was recommended that the Ministry of health and NACADA should organize sensitizations and awareness drives on alcohol abuse on the worrying trends of AUD together with their associated morbidities. The study also recommended deliberate efforts towards implementation of sound policies aimed at curbing the growth of the AUD."
23093718,0,a,"BACKGROUND: We examine the influence of social circumstances early in life on changes in cognitive function from young adulthood to middle age, and we explore the impact of birth characteristics, childhood activities, education and adult social class on the expected relationship. METHODS: A cohort of 11 532 men born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1953-7906, 10 246 and 2483 participants-had completed assessments of cognitive function at ages 12, 18 and 57 years, respectively. Linear regression was used to investigate the association of early-life characteristics with cognitive test scores at these ages and with score changes from early to mid-adulthood. RESULTS: The cognitive scores at age 57 years had high correlations with scores at ages 12 (r = 0.67) and 18 years (r = 0.70), and these two scores also showed bivariate correlation (r = 0.69). Having a father from the working class at birth was associated with lower cognitive function at ages 12, 18 and 57 years. The latter relation was attenuated when educational status at age 18 years and adult social class were adjusted for, while birth characteristics and childhood activities had minor influence. Having an unskilled father at birth, low education, few intellectual and many social activities in childhood as well as low adult social class were associated with decline in cognitive function. CONCLUSION: Adverse social circumstances early in life were associated with lower cognitive function at ages 12, 18 and 57 years, as well as with a decline between these ages. Educational status at age 18 years and adult social class seemed to account for most of the associations, whereas childhood activities were independent predictors that did not explain the social inequality."
19583043,1,a,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between cognitive and behavioural factors of preadolescents and those of their mothers, assessed in terms of self-efficacy beliefs and toothbrushing among Turkish and Finnish population in the framework of Social Cognitive Theory. The specific objective was to test if this possible association worked regardless of cultural differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires for Finnish (n = 338) and Turkish (n = 611) pre-adolescents and their mothers were used to collect the information on cognitive (pre-adolescent and maternal self-efficacy) and behavioural factors (toothbrushing frequencies). RESULTS: Turkish mothers and pre-adolescents reported lower levels of self-efficacy and toothbrushing than did their Finnish counterparts (P < 0.005). Finnish pre-adolescents reporting high self-efficacy were more likely to have mothers with high levels of self-efficacy (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.16 to 3.93), (P = 0.014). Similar positive associations emerged between Turkish (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.70 to 3.52), (P = 0.001) and Finnish (OR = 6.76, 95% CI = 2.21 to 20.65), (P = 0.001) pre-adolescent self-efficacy and maternal recommended (twice daily) level of toothbrushing behaviour. For pre-adolescents' toothbrushing, their own self-efficacy was the common explanatory variable. Binary logistic regression models revealed that the maternal toothbrushing accounted for the Turkish pre-adolescents' toothbrushing behaviour, whereas maternal self-efficacy did so for the Finnish pre-adolescents' (P < 0.001) toothbrushing behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: This study underlines the need for integration of pre-adolescent self-efficacy and maternal cognition and behaviour into oral health intervention programmes because of their relation to recommended toothbrushing behaviour among pre-adolescents, regardless of cultural differences. These findings seem to fit with the Social Cognitive Theory, which emphasises the significance of cultural factors and cognition as the determinants of behaviour."
30709095,0,a,"This commentary discusses the interesting and surprising findings by Hagen and colleagues, focusing on the role of the public health coordinator as a Health in All Policies (HiAP) tool. The original article finds a negative association between the employment of public health coordinators in Norwegian municipalities and consideration of a fair distribution of social and economic resources between social groups in local policymaking and planning. The commentary contemplates whether this surprising negative association should be interpreted as a failure of implementation, as suggested by the authors, or whether it might be the theory of change that has failed. On this basis, it is suggested that the very notion of HiAP could be flawed by the assumption that health should function as an overarching aim across government sectors. Potentially, the social determinants of health (SDH) might be more efficiently addressed by means of sectoral action by the corresponding sectors, emphasizing equity rather than health."
27423320,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a community based participatory research (CBPR) developed, multi-level smoking cessation intervention among women in subsidized housing neighborhoods in the Southeastern US. METHODS: A total of n=409 women in 14 subsidized housing neighborhoods in Georgia and South Carolina participated in this group randomized controlled trial conducted from 2009 to 2013. Intervention neighborhoods received a 24-week intervention with 1:1 community health worker contact, behavioral peer group sessions, and nicotine replacement. Control neighborhoods received written cessation materials at weeks 1, 6, 12, 18. Random coefficient models were used to compare smoking abstinence outcomes at 6 and 12months. Significance was set a p<0.05. RESULTS: The majority of participants (91.2%) were retained during the 12-month intervention period. Smoking abstinence rates at 12months for intervention vs. control were 9% vs. 4.3%, p=0.05. Additional analyses accounting for passive smoke exposure in these multi-unit housing settings demonstrated 12month abstinence rates of 12% vs. 5.3%, p=0.016. However, in the multivariate regression analyses, there was no significant effect of the intervention on the odds of being a non-smoker (OR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.18-1.07). Intervention participants who kept coach visits, attended group sessions, and used patches were more likely to remain abstinent. CONCLUSIONS: This CBPR developed intervention showed potential to engage smokers and reduce smoking among women in these high-poverty neighborhoods. Effectiveness in promoting cessation in communities burdened with fiscal, environmental and social inequities remains a public health priority."
31712820,0,a,"There is broad agreement that religion is a social determinant of health. In the article by Chen and VanderWeele (Am J Epidemiol. 2018;187(11):2355-2364), the authors took an outcome-wide approach to demonstrate associations between religious practices early in the life-course (regular service attendance and prayer/mediation) and a wide range of health endpoints and behaviors later on. Is religion a panacea? The study adds to the evidence that religious practices are correlated with a broad swath of health outcomes. However, more work is needed to translate that evidence into practicable advice for individuals and for society. The following tasks remain: (a) sharpening our understanding of which elements of religious practices promote health (specifically, is it service attendance, or prayer, or both? And could a non-religious person achieve the same benefit via regular participation in a secular group, like a choir?); and (b) improving our understanding of the different contexts in which religion is likely to have beneficial as well as potentially harmful effects."
28192033,0,a,"In 2016, Keyes and Galea issued 9 foundational principles of population health science and invited further deliberations by specialists to advance the field. This article presents 7 foundational principles of population health policy whose intersection with health care, public health, preventive medicine, and now population health, presents unique challenges. These principles are in response to a number of overarching questions that have arisen in over a decade of the authors' collective practice in the public and private sectors, and having taught policy within programs of medicine, law, nursing, and public health at the graduate and executive levels. The principles address an audience of practitioners and policy makers, mindful of the pressing health care challenges of our time, including: rising health-related expenditures, an aging population, workforce shortages, health disparities, and a backdrop of inequities rooted in social determinants that have not been adequately translated into formal policies or practices among the key stakeholders in population health. These principles are meant to empower stakeholders-whether it is the planner or the practitioner, the decision maker or the dedicated caregiver-and inform the development of practical tools, research, and education."
25821029,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have focused on syndromic data to determine levels of alarm thresholds to detection of meningitis outbreaks. The purpose of this study was to determine threshold levels of meningitis outbreak in Hamadan Province, west of Iran. METHODS: Data on both confirmed and suspected cases of meningitis (fever and neurological symptom) form 21 March 2010 to 20 March 2012 were used in Hamadan Province, Iran. Alarm threshold levels of meningitis outbreak were determined using four different methods including absolute values or standard method, relative increase, statistical cutoff points and upper control limit of exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) algorithm. RESULTS: Among 723 reported cases, 41 were diagnosed to have meningitis. Standard level of alarm thresholds for meningitis outbreak was determined as incidence of 5/100000 persons. Increasing 1.5 to two times in reported cases of suspected meningitis per week was known as the threshold levels according to relative increase method. An occurrence four cases of suspected meningitis per week that equals to 90th percentile was chosen as alarm thresholds by statistical cut off point method. The corresponding value according to EWMA algorithm was 2.57 i.e. three cases. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and staff of syndromic surveillance systems are highly recommended to apply the above different methods to determine the levels of alarm threshold."
19962809,0,a,"Recall data from a representative sample of 3080 adults in Ireland in 2003 is used to investigate transitions into and out of regular participation in sports and exercise--an important contributor to overall physical activity. The method produces a continuous picture of participation across the life-course, allowing key transition periods in the life-course to be identified and the determinants of transitions to be analysed with multivariate models. Late adolescence emerges as an important period, when many people drop out from team sports, especially females. Participation in adulthood mostly involves taking up individual sports and exercise activities. The likelihood of making this transition is strongly associated with socio-economic status. Transitions in activity during adulthood do not display significant sex differences, suggesting that the gender gap for involvement in sports and exercise has its roots in childhood. The method also allows age and cohort effects to be distinguished, revealing higher participation among more recent cohorts. The findings must be interpreted carefully, since they are reliant on the accuracy of personal recall. Yet they have implications for how physical activity policy applies over the life-course, suggesting possible returns to targeting lower socio-economic groups in early adulthood, to offering a broader range of activities to young females, and to researching and promoting those activities most likely to be of interest to current young adults as they age."
22536583,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Increased daytime sleepiness is an important symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is frequently underdiagnosed, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) can be a useful tool in alerting physicians to a potential problem involving OSA. OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence and determinants of daytime sleepiness measured using the ESS in a rural community population. METHODS: A community survey was conducted to examine the risk factors associated with ESS in a rural population in 154 households comprising 283 adults. Questionnaire information was obtained regarding physical factors, social factors, general medical history, family medical history, ESS score, and self-reported height and weight. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis based on the generalized estimating equations approach to account for clustering within households was used to predict the relationship between a binary ESS score outcome (normal or abnormal) and a set of explanatory variables. RESULTS: The population included 140 men (49.5%) and 143 women (50.5%) with an age range of 18 to 97 years (mean [+/- SD] 52.0+/-14.9 years). The data showed that 79.2% of the study participants had an ESS score in the normal range (0 to 10) and 20.8% had an ESS score >10, which is considered to be abnormal or high sleepiness. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that obesity was significantly associated with an abnormal or high sleepiness score on the ESS (OR 3.40 [95% CI 1.31 to 8.80). CONCLUSION: High levels of sleepiness in this population were common. Obesity was an important risk factor for high ESS score."
15522793,1,a,"Voles of the genus Microtus represent one of the most speciose mammalian genera in the Holarctic. We established a molecular phylogeny for Microtus to resolve contentious issues of systematic relationships and evolutionary history in this genus. A total of 81 specimens representing ten Microtus species endemic to Europe as well as eight Eurasian, six Asian and one Holarctic species were sequenced for the entire cytochrome b gene (1140 bp). A further 25 sequences were retrieved from GenBank, providing data on an additional 23, mainly Nearctic, Microtus species. Phylogenetic analysis of these 48 species generated four well-supported monophyletic lineages. The genus Chionomys, snow voles, formed a distinct and well-supported lineage separate from the genus Microtus. The subgenus Microtus formed the strongest supported lineage with two sublineages displaying a close relationship between the arvalis species group (common voles) and the socialis species group (social voles). Monophyly of the Palearctic pitymyid voles, subgenus Terricola, was supported, and this subgenus was also subdivided into two monophyletic species groups. Together, these groupings clarify long-standing taxonomic uncertainties in Microtus. In addition, the ""Asian"" and the Nearctic lineages reported previously were identified although the latter group was not supported. However, relationships among the main Microtus branches were not resolved, suggesting a rapid and potentially simultaneous radiation of a widespread ancestor early in the history of the genus. This and subsequent radiations discernible in the cytochrome b phylogeny, show the considerable potential of Microtus for analysis of historical and ecological determinants of speciation in small mammals. It is evident that speciation is an ongoing process in the genus and that the molecular data provides a vital insight into current species limits as well as cladogenic events of the past."
26239039,0,a,"The broad spectrum of economic and cultural diversity in the U.S. population correlates with and affects the study of behavioral aspects of health. The purpose of this article is to provide a selective overview of research findings from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), which covers a socio-demographically diverse population in Chicago, with a focus on role-related psychosocial factors and observed racial/ethnic differences in aging outcomes. CHAP is a longitudinal, epidemiological study of common chronic conditions of aging with an emphasis on medical, psychosocial, and environmental risk factors for the decline in cognitive function across the older adult lifespan. We briefly summarize the study design and methods used in the CHAP study and characterize the study population and describe the psychosocial data, noting black-white associations as they relate to three common brain health outcomes: cognitive function and Alzheimer's Disease, stroke, and subclinical vascular disease as noted on neuroimaging."
20522271,0,a,"This study examines the prevalence and determinants of adolescents' unintended pregnancy and induced abortion in Owerri, Nigeria. A pre-coded questionnaire was used to obtain information from 540 female adolescents of mean age 15.8 years. In addition, four FGDs were held with female adolescents in selected localities and in-depth interviews held with fifteen health-care service providers. Almost all the adolescents (99.8%) were Christians, with 70.3% being Catholics and 68.2% living with their parents. Over half (57.2%) of the adolescents had had sex. Contraceptives were rarely used owing to deep-seated cultural values. The data show that 31.6% of those who had ever had sex had an unintended pregnancy. Of these, 78.9% had recurrent pregnancies and 20.2% had an abortion. Of the latter, 41.8% had a recurrent abortion and 72.7% a post-abortion problem, for which 70.2% never sought treatment, increasing the risk of infertility in later life. The abortion seekers mostly went to patent medicine operators. A more acceptable and cost-effective contraceptive campaign involving use of local vernacular and traditional/local opinion leaders should be explored."
16414146,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of contextual (social capital and administrative/neo-materialist) and individual factors on lack of access to a regular doctor. METHODS: The 2000 public health survey in Scania is a cross-sectional study. A total of 13,715 persons answered a postal questionnaire, which is 59% of the random sample. A multilevel logistic regression model, with individuals at the first level and municipalities at the second, was performed. The effect (intra-class correlations, cross-level modification and odds ratios) of individual and municipality (social capital and health care district) factors on lack of access to a regular doctor was analysed using simulation method. The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) was used as information criterion for the models. RESULTS: The second level municipality variance in lack of access to a regular doctor is substantial even in the final models with all individual and contextual variables included. The model that results in the largest reduction in DIC is the model including age, sex and individual social participation (which is a network aspect of social capital), but the models which include administrative and social capital second level factors also reduced the DIC values. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that both administrative health care district and social capital may partly explain the individual's self reported lack of access to a regular doctor."
27764969,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Australian Indigenous children experience some of the most substantial health inequalities globally. In this context, research regarding their health and well-being has overemphasised physical illnesses with limited exploration of a diverse range of dimensions and determinants, particularly those based on Indigenous holistic understandings of health and well-being. This deficit-based approach has thus missed many strengths and assets of Indigenous children. This research aimed to gain insight into the perspectives of Indigenous children about their health and well-being in an urban setting in Australia. It joins a limited international literature examining views and experiences of non-majority children. DESIGN: Participatory and qualitative child-friendly research methods were utilised. The project was developed in partnership with Indigenous community organisations and members. Photo-elicitation activities and focus groups were conducted with 31 Indigenous children aged 8-12 years. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, combining focus group and interview data. RESULTS: It was evident an urban Indigenous child perspective of health and well-being includes rich understandings of the interconnectedness of physical, social-emotional and cultural dimensions of holism, as well as the integral importance of family and community relationships. The study also found that specific worries regarding loss of loved ones and racism were highly salient in Indigenous children's lives. CONCLUSION: The overwhelming conclusion to be drawn from this research is that Indigenous children in urban areas need ongoing recognition of both their agency and resilience in the face of adversity, within a wider context of historical and contemporary racialisation and racism."
18269370,1,a,"Aim To examine the association of socio-economic position (education, income and employment status) with cigarette consumption, intention to quit and self-efficacy to quit among male smokers in Thailand and Malaysia. Design and setting The data were based on a survey of adult smokers conducted in early 2005 in Thailand and Malaysia as part of the International Tobacco Control-South-East Asia (ITC-SEA) project. Participants A total of 1846 men in Thailand and 1906 men in Malaysia. Measurement Participants were asked questions on daily cigarette consumption, intention to quit and self-efficacy to quit in face-to-face interviews. Findings Analyses were based on multivariate regression models that adjusted for all three socio-economic indicators. In Thailand, higher level of education was associated strongly with not having self-efficacy, associated weakly with having an intention to quit and was not associated with cigarette consumption. Higher income was associated strongly with having self-efficacy, associated weakly with high cigarette consumption and was not associated with having an intention to quit. Being employed was associated strongly with having an intention to quit and was not associated with cigarette consumption or self-efficacy. In Malaysia, higher level of education was not associated with any of the outcomes. Higher income was associated strongly with having self-efficacy, and was not associated with the other outcomes. Being employed was associated moderately with higher cigarette consumption and was not associated with the other outcomes. Conclusion Socio-economic and cultural conditions, as well as tobacco control policies and tobacco industry activities, shape the determinants of smoking behaviour and beliefs. Existing knowledge from high-income countries about disparities in smoking should not be generalized readily to other countries."
17488897,1,a,"We used geographic information systems and a spatial analysis approach to explore the pattern of Ross River virus (RRV) incidence in Brisbane, Australia. Climate, vegetation and socioeconomic data in 2001 were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Brisbane City Council and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. Information on the RRV cases was obtained from the Queensland Department of Health. Spatial and multiple negative binomial regression models were used to identify the socioeconomic and environmental determinants of RRV transmission. The results show that RRV activity was primarily concentrated in the northeastern, northwestern, and southeastern regions in Brisbane. Multiple negative binomial regression models showed that the spatial pattern of RRV disease in Brisbane seemed to be determined by a combination of local ecologic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors."

12623523,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Although behaviours regarded as unhealthy are widespread, behaving in an unhealthy manner in several respects is relatively uncommon. However, people with multiple unhealthy behaviours exist and their number is larger than expected if the behaviours were not related to each other. The aim of this study was to examine sociodemographic determinants of multiple unhealthy behaviours, with special reference to independent and combined effects of the determinants. METHODS: Data on unhealthy behaviours were derived from nationwide surveys among Finnish adults. The mean number of unhealthy behaviours practised on a daily basis and the probability of reporting three or four of these behaviours was examined across sociodemographic groups. RESULTS: Age, educational level and marital status predicted reporting of three or four unhealthy behaviours. Interactions were observed between education and age in both genders as well as between marital status and age in men and educational level and living area in women. Mean numbers of unhealthy behaviours showed similar patterns to having three or four unhealthy behaviours but few differences between the means were statistically significant and there were no interactions. CONCLUSION: The influence of each sociodemographic determinant on multiple unhealthy behaviours was relatively independent from the other sociodemographic determinants. As the effect of these determinants tends to be cumulative, engaging in multiple unhealthy behaviours is common in population subgroups with several unfavourable characteristics. In health promotion initiatives special attention should be paid to such population groups and their social circumstances."
15128709,1,a,"The aim of this study was to identify socioeconomic factors associated with mortality among cities in Japan. Sex-specific and age-adjusted mortality rates for 1990 and 1995 were calculated by 779 local administrative units across the nation. One hundred indicators related to socioeconomic factors were compiled and divided into eight categories: economy, education, living conditions, vegetation and open space, transport, preventive activities, medical care and demography. Composite socioeconomic indices were formulated using factor analysis of the socioeconomic indicators by category, and the association between the indices and mortality rates was examined by correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. Nineteen composite socioeconomic indices were obtained from factor analysis, and all indices except educational expenditure-related index were significantly correlated with mortality rates. Unemployment, old housing, primary health resources and density were independently positively associated, and higher education, public library activity, health check-up participation and population growth were independently negatively associated with both 1990 and 1995 male mortality rates. For female mortality, higher income, unemployment, spacious dwelling, old housing, less vegetation, road facility, numbers of cars per population, primary health resources and density were independently positively associated, and higher education, public library activity and health check-up participation were independently negatively associated. The relationship between mortality and socioeconomic conditions was stronger in males than in females, and higher income and less vegetation were associated with higher mortality only for females. The present study demonstrated a close link between mortality and a wide range of socioeconomic conditions by using a number of indicators compiled from various data sources. The results promote a deeper understanding of socioeconomic health determinants and development of multi-sectoral health policy to improve population health."
11988815,1,a,"AIMS: The objective of this study was to determine the extent that psychosocial and clinical variables influence parental compliance with occlusion therapy (eye patching) in children with amblyopia. METHODS: Children (n = 151) receiving occlusion therapy (eye patching) for the treatment of amblyopia were recruited from five orthoptic clinics in Bristol, UK. Parents completed a questionnaire based on Rogers' (1983) Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). The parents (n = 105) were also followed up 2 months later. Clinical data, including measures of visual acuity, were also recorded. Compliance with eye patching was assessed through self-report accounts of parents. Stepwise regression analyses were used to determine the factors predictive of compliance with eye patching. RESULTS: Self-reported compliance with eye patching at study entry revealed that only 54% of parents were achieving orthoptists' recommendations to patch their child. Perceived self-efficacy was positively associated with compliance and perceived prohibition of the child's activities were negatively associated with compliance. At follow-up, past behaviour accounted for the largest proportion of explained variance in patching behaviour followed by response efficacy, and prohibition of the child's activities. CONCLUSION: The present findings may serve to inform interventions aimed at enhancing current orthoptic practice to improve compliance in amblyopic children. The importance of 'self-efficacy' and past behaviour suggests that consultations with parents exhibiting higher levels of success with patching may elicit strategies that could be shared with parents experiencing difficulties with patching their children. In addition, it is possible that the perceived efficacy of the treatment could be enhanced if orthoptists emphasised evidence of improvements in visual acuity which may, in turn, foster the maintenance of eye patching."
31292184,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the employment rate among kidney and liver transplant recipients in Poland and identify the predictors of employment. SETTINGS: The study was based on a self-prepared questionnaire containing five parts: demographic data and professional, medical, physical and psychological factors. This is a multicentre study involving four hospitals in Poland. PARTICIPANTS: The investigated group consisted of 285 individuals (92 women and 185 men; 8 no sex given) aged between 18 and 45 years who underwent kidney or liver transplantation 1-5 years prior. Because of missing data, 279 questionnaires were considered regarding employment status after transplantation and 277 when sex differences were considered. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients (43%) worked full-time, 42 (15%) part-time and 117 (42%) remained unemployed, with a higher employment rate post-transplantation among men than women (60% vs 55%, p=0.04). More women performed white collar work (74% vs 41%, p=0.0003) and had to modify their working position than men (22% vs 7%, p=0.0118). Factors determining employment after transplantation included higher level of education (OR=27.08; p=0.0096), employment 1 year prior to transplantation (OR=11.05; p<0.001) and good psychological adaptation (OR=4.23; p<0.001). Men working the year before transplantation had higher education (OR=9.66; p=0.0356). Among men, more kidney recipients worked compared with liver recipients (OR=3.567; p=0.0417). Among women, age determined employment status (OR=0.89; p=0.0234). CONCLUSION: Higher education is the most important predictor of employment after transplantation. Therefore, rehabilitation programmes including vocational activity should be directed to increase the level of education, both pretransplantation and post-transplantation if possible."
29969304,0,a,"Accelerating the fight against HIV globally and achieving the goals of the U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy will require an integrated health system that addresses all dimensions of wellness and is not limited to disease diagnosis and treatment or to monolithic prevention strategies. Since the HIV/AIDS epidemic was first recognized in 1981, HIV prevention strategies have evolved from early, information-based efforts to theory-informed and evidence-based approaches. More recently, the growing recognition that social and economic factors play a major role in shaping population health outcomes has driven HIV prevention and care programs in the direction of ""people-centered health systems,"" as called for in the 2016 United Nations General Assembly declaration to end AIDS by 2030. This commentary examines recent innovations in HIV program design and implementation (e.g., using data in novel ways to improve HIV health outcomes, providing incentives to promote integrated HIV prevention and care, and developing mechanisms to proactively address the social determinants affecting health) that embrace a comprehensive vision of health that is much broader than the absence of detectable virus."
31212101,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health impact the delivery of care and outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer. We explored the relationship between social determinants of health and presentation, treatment, and outcomes of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma at an urban safety-net medical center. DESIGN: A single-institution retrospective chart review of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma was conducted. Demographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics were obtained. Median overall survival, stage-specific survival, receipt of curative operation, and receipt of perioperative therapy were analyzed. Chi-square tests were used for categorical variables. Survival was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: We identified 240 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated between January 2006 and December 2017. Median age was 66 years, 51% were female, 48% were non-white, 22% were non-English-speaking, 16% were Hispanic, and 40% were Medicaid/uninsured. There were 74 (31%) patients with early-stage (I/II) disease. There were no statistically significant differences between race, primary language, or ethnicity and receipt of surgical therapy or receipt of perioperative therapy. Relatively more patients with private insurance (100%) received perioperative therapy compared with Medicaid/uninsured (64%) and Medicare-insured (50%) patients (p = 0.018). Nearly 30% of patients with operable disease either declined having an intervention or were found to be too frail to undergo surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistically significant relationships between examined social determinants of health and use of operation or perioperative therapy. Patients treated at an urban safety-net hospital with a focus on vulnerable patient populations are able to provide outcomes similar to national averages. Additional exploration of factors affecting outcomes for pancreatic cancer in these patients will be important, as many centers absorb higher immigrant and indigent populations."
26330115,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In a national perinatal health programme, we observed striking heterogeneity in the explanation of the most prominent risks across municipalities. Therefore we explored the separate contribution of several socio-demographic risks on perinatal health inequalities between municipalities and neighbourhoods. The study aims to identify perinatal health inequalities on the neighbourhood level across the selected municipalities, and to objectify the contribution of socio-demographic risk factors on pregnancy outcomes in each municipality by the application of the population attributable risk concept. METHODS: Population based cohort study (2000-2008). Perinatal outcomes of 352,407 single pregnancies from 15 municipalities were analysed. Odds ratios and population attributable risks were calculated. Main outcomes were combined perinatal morbidity (small-for-gestational age, preterm birth, congenital anomalies, and low Apgar score), and perinatal mortality. RESULTS: Perinatal health inequalities existed on both the municipal and the neighbourhood level. In municipalities, combined perinatal morbidity ranged from 17.3 to 23.6%, and perinatal mortality ranges from 10.1 to 15.4 per thousand. Considerable differences in low socio-economic status between municipalities were apparent, with prevalences ranging from 14.4 to 82.5%. In seven municipalities, significant differences between neighbourhoods existed for perinatal morbidity (adjusted OR ranging from 1.33 to 2.38) and for perinatal mortality (adjusted OR ranging from 2.06 to 5.59). For some municipalities, socio-demographic risk factors were s a strong predictor for the observed inequalities, but in other municipalities these factors were very weak predictors. If all socio-demographic determinants were set to the most favourable value in a predictive model, combined perinatal morbidity would decrease with 15 to 39% in these municipalities. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial differences in perinatal morbidity and mortality between municipalities and neighbourhoods exist. Different patterns of inequality suggest differences in etiology. Policy makers and healthcare professionals need to be informed about their local perinatal health profiles in order to introduce antenatal healthcare tailored to the individual and neighbourhood environment."
26234965,0,a,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to test the usefulness of social cognitive theory (SCT) in explaining breakfast consumption in a sample of primary male students. METHODS: Participants in this cross-sectional study were 358 male students (3rd, 4th and 5th grades) from eight public primary schools of Ilam city. Data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire based on components of SCT. Bivariate correlations and multiple logistic regression analysis using an Enter method were used to identify social cognitive correlates and determinants of breakfast consumption. RESULTS: A total of 358 participants ranging in age from 8-12 years (M=10.06) were studied. The result of the study showed that the SCT significantly predicted breakfast consumption. SCT variables explained 41.4% of the variance in breakfast consumption behaviors, though, self-regulation was found to be the strongest predictor of breakfast consumption behaviors. There was the strongest correlation between behaviors and self-regulation, (r=0.561; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings support the usefulness of SCT in explaining breakfast consumption behaviors. These results suggest an essential role for self-regulation, self-efficacy and social support in the breakfast consumption behaviors of primary male students."
24469555,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The observation that features of the social environment, including family, school, and neighborhood characteristics, are associated with individual-level outcomes has spurred the development of dozens of multilevel or ecological theoretical frameworks in epidemiology, public health, psychology, and sociology, among other disciplines. Despite the widespread use of such theories in etiological, intervention, and policy studies, challenges remain in bridging multilevel theory and empirical research. METHODS: This paper set out to synthesize these challenges and provide specific examples of methodological and analytical strategies researchers are using to gain a more nuanced understanding of the social determinants of psychiatric disorders, with a focus on children's mental health. To accomplish this goal, we begin by describing multilevel theories, defining their core elements, and discussing what these theories suggest is needed in empirical work. In the second part, we outline the main challenges researchers face in translating multilevel theory into research. These challenges are presented for each stage of the research process. In the third section, we describe two methods being used as alternatives to traditional multilevel modeling techniques to better bridge multilevel theory and multilevel research. These are (1) multilevel factor analysis and multilevel structural equation modeling; and (2) dynamic systems approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Through its review of multilevel theory, assessment of existing strategies, and examination of emerging methodologies, this paper offers a framework to evaluate and guide empirical studies on the social determinants of child psychiatric disorders as well as health across the life course."
19628202,1,a,"This study provided controlled observations of a potential mechanism for the determination of the repetitive, aberrant perceptions or interpretations of everyday events that figure prominently in a range of psychological disorders: the adventitious reinforcement of acts of cognition by the actual consequences of concurrent motor acts. Adults made a series of two-choice brightness discriminations; on 60% of trials, choosing the brighter stimulus produced a ""correct"" signal while errors produced an aversive sound. On 40% of trials, the choice stimuli did not in fact differ in brightness; the consequences of responding on these ""identical stimuli"" trials differed across blocks of trials. Thus, on these trials perceptual judgments were directly followed by events that they did not produce. When all choices on identical stimuli trials were punished with the ""error"" sound, subjects showed little preference for the left-side or right-side identical stimuli, but when all choices of identical stimuli were reinforced with the ""correct"" light, individual preferences for the left-side or the right-side stimuli substantially increased. As the consequences of responding on identical stimuli trials were independent of the stimuli chosen, these findings provide evidence for superstitious perception, the reinforcement of perceptual acts by events that do not depend upon their occurrence."
11029135,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to predict and explain nurses' adherence to Universal Precautions (UPs) when performing venipunctures. METHODS: Data were gathered from 156 registered nurses working at a regional hospital. A self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial variables (intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived control, etc) was completed at baseline, and behavior was self-reported 3 months later. RESULTS: The regression of intention on the variables yielded an adjusted R(2) of 0.68, with perceived barriers (beta =.62, P <.001), social norm (beta =.17, P <.01), and personal normative belief (beta =.19, P <.01) being the significant variables. With respect to the 3-month follow-up, 28% of the variance associated with UPs adherence was explained by intention (beta =.37, P <.001) and perceived behavioral control (beta =.23, P <.05). Moreover, high (n = 116) and low intenders (n = 40) differed on several normative beliefs (P =.0003) and perceived barriers (P =.0001). CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that perception of control, assessed either globally or by means of a belief-based measure, is a key factor in adherence. Specifically, the perceived difficulties associated with adherence to UPs appear to be related to a nurse's training on UPs and to the existence of suboptimal working conditions."
26116931,0,a,"The Lancet-University of Oslo Commission on Global Governance for health correctly concluded that: 'with globalization, health inequity increasingly results from transnational activities that involve actors with different interests and degrees of power'. At the same time, taking up that Commission's focus on political determinants of health and 'power asymmetries' requires recognizing the interplay of globalization with domestic politics, and the limits of global influences as explanations for policies that affect health inequalities. I make this case using three examples - trade policy, climate change policy, and the domestic politics of poverty reduction and social policy - and a concluding observation about the 2015 UK election."
31002554,0,a,"BACKGROUND: peripheral intravenous cannulation is the most prevalent invasive procedure performed on patients admitted to hospital. The procedure is not always easy to undertake and can lead to problems for the patient and nurse. Alongside various procedures, local warming is one technique that could be used to increase the diameter of superficial veins. This prospective non-randomised trial aimed to determine the effect of local warming on vein diameter in the antecubital area in adults aged 20-40 years. METHOD: the subjects included 55 volunteers who were in good health. The cephalic vein diameter of the right arm cubital area was measured for each participant using ultrasound guidance. The arm was warmed for 10 minutes using a heating device maintained at 42 masculineC. A second ultrasound scan was then undertaken immediately afterwards and cephalic vein diameter measured. RESULTS: local warming increased the cephalic vein diameter in the cubital area by 0.43+/-0.4 mm. There was no significant relationship between change in cephalic vein diameter and participants' gender, age or body mass index. CONCLUSION: the results indicate that the application of heat is an effective technique for venodilation and could be considered in emergencies or in cases when other veins are difficult to access."
15652683,1,a,"The social determinants of intellectual disability (ID) are poorly understood, particularly in Australia. This study has investigated sociodemographic correlates of ID of unknown cause in Western Australian born children. Using record linkage to the Western Australian Maternal & Child Health Research Database, maternal sociodemographic characteristics of children with ID (of unknown cause) born between 1983 and 1992 (n = 2871) were compared with those of children without ID (n = 236,964). Socioeconomic indices for areas based on the census district of mother's residence were also included in the analysis. Aboriginal mothers (OR = 2.83 [CI: 2.52, 3.18]), teenagers (OR = 2.09 [CI: 1.82, 2.40]) and single mothers (OR = 2.18 [CI: 1.97, 2.42]) were all at increased risk of having a child with mild or moderate ID. Children of mothers in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged 10% had more than five times the risk of mild and moderate ID compared with those in the least disadvantaged 10% (OR = 5.61 [CI: 4.42, 7.12]). Fourth or later born children were also at increased risk (OR = 1.82 [CI: 1.63, 2.02]). The results of the study have implications both for further aetiological investigation as well as service provision for children with ID. Furthermore, many of the sociodemographic correlates identified in this study, particularly in the mild/moderate category of ID, are potentially modifiable, opening up opportunities for primary prevention."
14686137,1,a,"Although relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient."
17876483,1,a,"More than any other low- and middle-income country, Brazil has the longest research tradition of establishing, maintaining and exploiting birth cohort studies. This research pedigree is highlighted in the present issue of the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research, which contains a series of twelve papers from the Ribeirao Preto and Sao Luis birth cohort studies from the Southeast and Northeast of Brazil, respectively. The topics covered in this raft of reports vary and include predictors of perinatal health and maternal risk factors, early life determinants of cardiovascular risk factors in childhood and adolescence, use of health services, and a description of dietary characteristics of young adults, amongst other topics. There is also a guide to the background, objectives, sampling and protocols employed across these studies, which, together with similar pieces published in past issues of the Brazilian Journal, serve as a very useful starting point, particularly for potential collaborators. In the fervent hope that further follow-up of these cohorts will take place--we provide our own justification for cohort maintenance and extension in this issue--future data collection could include: genetic material, atherosclerosis, ascertained, for instance, by intima-media thickness, and IQ testing in children--scores from which are emerging as potentially important predictors of adult health outcomes up to six decades later."
22976386,0,a,"The objective was to examine the role of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking in the incidence of oral cavity cancer by subsite in France, a high-incidence area. We analysed detailed data on lifelong tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking from 772 oral cavity cancer cases and 3555 controls included in a population-based case-control study, the ICARE study. Tobacco smoking increased the risk of oral cavity cancer even for the smaller quantities and durations, whereas alcohol drinking increased this risk only in heavy drinkers who were also ever smokers. The combined effect of smoking and drinking was greater than multiplicative. The floor of the mouth was the subsite that was the most affected by the harmful effects of tobacco and alcohol, whereas the gums were less susceptible. The risk associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption did not differ between intraoral cavity and subsites usually included in the oropharynx (soft palate and base of the tongue). Population-attributable risks for oral cavity cancer were 78.6% for tobacco smoking, 7.3% for alcohol drinking and 80.7% for tobacco and/or alcohol consumption. These results indicate that regular oral check-ups should be targeted at smokers and heavy drinkers, and that prevention efforts should be focused on smoking cessation."
18181819,1,a,"This paper is based on a critical discourse content analysis of 40 stories from the 20 highest circulating English-language mass magazines available in Canada and published in Canada or the USA in 2001. It examines the presence or absence of the social determinants perspective in the portrayal of the two most significant causes of morbidity and mortality in these countries: cancer and heart disease. The media analysis documents an absence of reflection of the social determinants viewpoint on these, the most important causes of disease and death. Thus, magazine stories ignore the role of such considerations as income, education level, ethnicity, visible minority or, Aboriginal status, early life experiences, employment and working conditions, food accessibility and quality, housing, social services, social exclusion, or unemployment and employment security in explaining health. Instead, the magazine articles underscore an individualistic approach to disease that assumes that health care is accessible and available to all, and that these diseases are preventable and treatable through individual lifestyle choices in combination with the measures prescribed through conventional medicine. Although cancer and heart disease are framed by a medical discourse, articles tended to emphasise the independence, freedom and power of the individual within the medical care system. The research documents a continuation of the dominance of conventional medicine buttressed by individualism in media stories. Theoretical and methodological issues are discussed. Some of the practical consequences for policy-makers and professionals are noted."

The quantitative values were received concerning widespread of disposal to Russian workers of various industries of social benefits on partial and full payment of treatment, degree of participation of workers in programs of voluntary medical insurance. It is demonstrated that besides sectorial characteristics the determinants of widespread of granting additional medical insurance are positioned as individual characteristics of workers and such obstacles as length of service, education, salary of worker, type of residence settlement, harmful and dangerous conditions of labor, type of property of enterprise (public/non-public)."
11673127,1,a,"The objectives of this study were to to identify maternal characteristics associated with traditional food consumption and to examine food items associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury body burden in pregnant Inuit women from Northern Quebec. We interviewed women from three communities at mid-pregnancy and at 1 and 11 months postpartum. We measured PCBs, Hg, and selenium in maternal blood; Hg was also measured in maternal hair. The women reported eating significant amounts of fish, beluga muktuk/fat, seal meat, and seal fat. Although consumption of fish and seal was associated with lower socioeconomic status, consumption of beluga whale was uniform across strata. Fish and seal meat consumption was associated with increased Hg concentrations in hair. Traditional food intake during pregnancy was unrelated to PCB body burden, which is more a function of lifetime consumption. This study corroborated previous findings relating marine mammal and fish consumption to increased Hg and selenium body burden. Despite widespread knowledge regarding the presence of these contaminants in traditional foods, a large proportion of Inuit women increased their consumption of these foods during pregnancy, primarily because of pregnancy-related changes in food preferences and the belief that these foods are beneficial during pregnancy."
30753161,0,a,"Background Adolescents should be empowered to improve their reproductive and sexual health needs. The present study aimed to investigate effects of protection motivation theory-based education on student girls' reproductive and sexual health self-care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted in parallel on 90 female students living in dormitories of the Alborz University of Medical Sciences in Iran. The data collection lasted from January 2017 to May 2018. Convenience sampling was performed, and samples were put into intervention and control groups by block randomization. The intervention group received six educational sessions based on the protection motivation theory(PMT). The data collection tool of this research consisted of the protection motivation theory and reproductive health self-care questionnaires. Results There was no significant difference between control and intervention groups in demographic characteristics. The results of the repeated measures test indicated that the reproductive health self-care variable had a significant change (p = 0.000), and there was a significant difference between groups (p = 0.000). The total score of the Protection Motivation Theory Questionnaire was not changed over time (p = 0.54) and there was no significant difference between groups (p = 0.51) according to results of the repeated measures test. Conclusion According to effects of an educational intervention based on the protection motivation theory, it is suggested to utilize this model as an educational framework for adolescents' reproductive and sexual health by healthcare providers, schools and universities as well as holding periodic courses educating adolescents within short-term intervals in order to achieve the higher sustainability of the educational results."
26294093,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Reducing health inequalities involves the identification and characterization of social and exposure factors and the way they accumulate in a given area. The areas of accumulation then allow for prioritization of interventions. The present study aims to build spatial composite indicators based on the aggregation of environmental, social and health indicators and their inter-relationships. METHOD: Preliminary work was carried out firstly to homogenize spatial coverage, and secondly to study spatial variation of environmental (EI), socioeconomic (SI) and health (HI) indicators. The aggregation of the different indicators was performed using several methodologies for which results and decision-makers' usability were compared. RESULTS: Four methodologies were tested: 1) A simple summation of normalized HI, EI and SI indicators (IC), 2) the sum of the normalized HI, EI and SI indicators weighted by the first principal component of a Principal Component Analysis (IC PCA), 3) the sum of normalized and weighted indicators of the first principal component of Local Principal Component Analysis (IC LPCA), and 4) the sum of normalized and weighted indicators of the first principal component of a Geographically Weighted Principal Component Analysis (IC GWPCA). CONCLUSION: The GWPCA is particularly adapted to taking into account the spatial heterogeneity and the spatial autocorrelation between SI, EI and HI. This approach invalidates the basic assumptions of many standard statistical analyses. Where socioeconomic indicators present high deprivation and where they are associated with potential modifiable health determinants, decision-makers can prioritize these areas for reducing inequalities by controlling the socioeconomic and health determinants."
28572858,0,a,"Ecological studies, when the school is the unit of analysis, may help to design and evaluate school intervention programs. The paper discusses selected contextual determinants of bullying, using data collected in Poland in 2015 and aggregated to school level (4085 students; 70 junior high schools). The main hypothesis is related to the neighborhood social capital as protective factor and the type of community as a modifier. The main dependent variable was the combined index of bullying which included three perspectives (victim, perpetrator, bystander). Student delinquent behavior was taken into account as potential determinant, along with selected characteristics of the school and neighborhood. The analyses were adjusted for the percentage of the surveyed boys. The overall bullying index ranged, depending on the school, from 0.88 to 4.07 points (out of 12 possible); intraclass coefficient ICC = 2.8%. In the entire sample, the main predictors of bullying were student delinquent behaviors as a risk factor and the school social climate as a protective factor (R(2) = 56.3%). The stratification of schools due to their location influences the inference regarding those main determinants. The dominating influence of delinquent behavior is visible only in big cities where bullying index showed the highest dispersion. In smaller towns and rural areas, the neighborhood social capital becomes an important protective factor; highly correlated with the school climate. We can conclude that strong social bonds in the community are supportive for school climate and can reduce the level of bullying at schools."
20603713,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Outpatient antibiotic consumption widely varies across Europe. The investigation of the causes of such variation may help to identify interventions that would improve the efficient use of antibiotics. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of socioeconomic determinants and the role played by information about bacterial resistance. METHODS: Comparable data on systemically administered antibiotics and socioeconomic determinants in 17 European countries were available between 2000 and 2005. We estimated an ad hoc econometric model by means of a hybrid log-log functional form and random effects generalised least squares regressions. Lagged values and the instrumental variable method were applied to address endogeneity of bacterial resistance and infections. Bacterial resistance was measured by the rate of penicillin non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (PNSP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). RESULTS: The population income, demographic structure, density of general practitioners and their remuneration method appeared to be significant determinants of antibiotic consumption. Although countries with higher levels of bacterial resistance exhibited significantly higher levels of per capita antibiotic use, ceteris paribus, the responsiveness of antibiotic use to changes in bacterial resistance was relatively low (0.09-0.18). CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that socioeconomic factors should be taken into account while explaining differences in outpatient antibiotic use across countries. The impact of supply-side factors and incentives attached to payment schemes for physicians need to be considered in government interventions to reduce inequalities and improve effectiveness in antibiotic utilisation."
31664939,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Early, regular prenatal care utilization is an important strategy for improving maternal and infant health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to better understand contributing factors to disparate prenatal care utilization outcomes among women of different racial/ethnic and social status groups before, during, and after the Great Recession (December 2007-June 2009). METHODS: Data from 678,235 Washington (WA) and Florida (FL) birth certificates were linked to community and state characteristic data to carry out cross-sectional pooled time series analyses with institutional review board approval for human subjects' research. Predictors of on-time as compared to late or non-entry to prenatal care utilization (late/no prenatal care utilization) were identified and compared among pregnant women. Also explored was a simulated triadic relationship among time (within recession-related periods), social characteristics, and prenatal care utilization by clustering individual predictors into three scenarios representing low, average, and high degrees of social disadvantage. RESULTS: Individual and community indicators of need (e.g., maternal Medicaid enrollment, unemployment rate) increased during the Recession. Associations between late/no prenatal care utilization and individual-level characteristics (including disparate associations among race/ethnicity groups) did not shift greatly with young maternal age and having less than a high school education remaining the largest contributors to late/no prenatal care utilization. In contrast, individual maternal enrollment in a supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC) exhibited a protective association against late/no prenatal care utilization. The magnitude of association between community-level partisan voting patterns and expenditures on some maternal child health programs increased in non-beneficial directions. Simulated scenarios show a high combined impact on prenatal care utilization among women who have multiple disadvantages. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a compelling picture of the important roles that individual characteristics-particularly low education and young age-play in late/no prenatal care utilization among pregnant women. Targeted outreach to individuals with high disadvantage characteristics, particularly those with multiple disadvantages, may help to increase first trimester entry to utilization of prenatal care. Finally, WIC may have played a valuable role in reducing late/no prenatal care utilization, and its effectiveness during the Great Recession as a policy-based approach to reducing late/no prenatal care utilization should be further explored."
18032810,1,a,"Poverty and social exclusion are important socio-economic variables which are often taken for granted while considering ill-health effects. Social exclusion mainly refers to the inability of our society to keep all groups and individuals within reach of what we expect as society to realize their full potential. Marginalization of certain groups or classes occurs in most societies including developed countries and perhaps it is more pronounced in underdeveloped countries. In the Indian context, caste may be considered broadly as a proxy for socio-economic status and poverty. In the identification of the poor, scheduled caste and scheduled tribes and in some cases the other backward castes are considered as socially disadvantaged groups and such groups have a higher probability of living under adverse conditions and poverty. The health status and utilization patterns of such groups give an indication of their social exclusion as well as an idea of the linkages between poverty and health. In this review, we examined broad linkages between caste and some select health/health utilization indicators. We examined data on prevalence of anaemia, treatment of diarrhoea, infant mortality rate, utilization of maternal health care and childhood vaccinations among different caste groups in India. The data based on the National Family Health Survey II (NFHS II) highlight considerable caste differentials in health. The linkages between caste and some health indicators show that poverty is a complex issue which needs to be addressed with a multi-dimensional paradigm. Minimizing the suffering from poverty and ill-health necessitates recognizing the complexity and adopting a perspective such as holistic epidemiology which can challenge pure technocentric approaches to achieve health status."
31148748,0,a,"Owing to a shift in social attitudes and human rights standards, health inequities experienced by gender minorities are gaining an increasing spotlight globally. Transgender (trans) is an umbrella term used to describe individuals who have a dissimilar sex, gender identity and/or gender expression than what was designated at birth. Recently, studies have sought to identify health disparities and barriers to care among this population. While oncology-focused research remains limited, the social determinants of trans health elicits a significant impact on transgender people across the cancer continuum and, thus, requires further examination. The purpose of this paper is to explore the issue of trans health inequity in the context of Canadian cancer care highlighting current clinical practice, as well as gaps in research, provider education and health care policy. The paper will conclude with recommendations for policy development and a reflection on the oncology nurse's role in advocating for change."
10813470,1,a,"The objective of this study is to determine the effect of permethrin insecticide-treated bed net (PITN) use on the incidence of febrile episodes and on household malaria expenses in Benin. Over the course of one year, 208 randomly selected PITN user and non-user households were visited weekly to determine expenditures on febrile morbidity and its treatment, and to monitor spending on malaria prevention. Multivariate analyses were performed to distinguish the effects of PITN use from other important determinants of morbidity, such as malaria-related beliefs and practices, income, and other socio-economic variables. Results from the logistic regression analysis show that the use of PITNs decreases the risk of febrile episodes by 34% in children living in the rural zone. Multiple regression analysis reveals that PITN use does not reduce prevention and treatment expenses. These expenses are significantly associated with women's income. This report also discusses other factors associated with febrile morbidity and malaria-related expenditures."
18314472,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Wage losses after breast cancer may result in considerable financial burden. Their assessment is made more urgent because more women now participate in the workforce and because breast cancer is managed using multiple treatment modalities that could lead to long work absences. We evaluated wage losses, their determinants, and the associations between wage losses and changes for the worse in the family's financial situation among Canadian women over the first 12 months after diagnosis of early breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study among women with breast cancer from eight hospitals throughout the province of Quebec. Information that permitted the calculation of wage losses and information on potential determinants of wage losses were collected by three pretested telephone interviews conducted over the year following the start of treatment. Information on medical characteristics was obtained from medical records. The main outcome was the proportion of annual wages lost because of breast cancer. Multivariable analysis of variance using the general linear model was used to identify personal, medical, and employment characteristics associated with the proportion of wages lost. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Among 962 eligible breast cancer patients, 800 completed all three interviews. Of these, 459 had a paying job during the month before diagnosis. On average, these working women lost 27% of their projected usual annual wages (median = 19%) after compensation received had been taken into account. Multivariable analysis showed that a higher percentage of lost wages was statistically significantly associated with a lower level of education (P(trend) = .0018), living 50 km or more from the hospital where surgery was performed (P = .070), lower social support (P = .012), having invasive disease (P = .086), receipt of chemotherapy (P < .001), self-employment (P < .001), shorter tenure in the job (P(trend) < .001), and part-time work (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Wage losses and their effects on financial situation constitute an important adverse consequence of breast cancer in Canada."
18384491,1,a,"Two studies were conducted among elite young judokas to examine (a) whether those who persisted in national training centers (n=52) were different from dropouts (n=52) in their perceptions of coach-, parent-, and peer-induced motivational climates, goal orientations, self-perceptions, perceived competence, and intention of dropping out, and (b) whether these variables varied during the persisting athletes' (n=82) first 2 years in these centers. Compared with persisting athletes, dropouts perceived the roles of coaches, parents, and peers as less task-involving, were less task-oriented, and intended more to drop. The association of peer-, coach-, and parent-induced task-involving climates predicted athletes' persistence. During the 2 years, persisting athletes' perceptions of coach-, parent-, and peer-induced task-involving climates decreased, while perceptions of a coach-induced ego-involving climate and the intention of dropping out increased in spite of more positive self-perceptions. Gender differences favoring males were observed for self-perceptions only. These results stress the importance for all the agents of the athletes' social environment to promote task-involving climates, because such climates appear to be naturally prone to degradation in the context of elite competition. The results also shed light on some high-level athletes' characteristics regarding motivational dispositions and self-concept."
16539960,1,a,"Foreign migration in Spain is at present a priority in the social and demographic context the country. At a worldwide level, trends in the evolution of population and social, political and economical indicators, appear to maintain for the coming years, the present trends on migrations from poor countries to the rich ones. In the health area, considering migration as a relatively recent phenomena in Spain, and considering that is mainly constituted by young and healthy population, there are not still data available on the main health needs of migrants related to aging. Data from other countries with a longer migrant tradition, shows mental health disorders and social and cultural barriers for adaptation, as basic health determinants for older migrants. Related to the effects in the health system, the inclusion of the aging factor in general population and migrant needs, offer an optimistic panorama for future planning. Migrant aging in Spain, despite of its middle and long term perspective, do require a progressive adaptation of knowledge and resources to cover future needs. Considering this coming future, health professionals do need to be trained in intercultural skills and knowledge."
15571622,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Malnutrition in children can be a consequence of unfavourable socioeconomic conditions. However, some families maintain adequate nutritional status in their children despite living in poverty. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether family-related factors are determinants of stunting in young Mexican children living in extreme poverty, and whether these factors differ between rural or urban contexts. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in one rural and one urban extreme poverty level areas in Mexico. Cases comprised stunted children aged between 6 and 23 months. Controls were well-nourished children. Independent variables were defined in five dimensions: family characteristics; family income; household allocation of resources and family organisation; social networks; and child health care. Information was collected from 108 cases and 139 controls in the rural area and from 198 cases and 211 controls in the urban area. Statistical analysis was carried out separately for each area; unconditional multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to obtain the best explanatory model for stunting. RESULTS: In the rural area, a greater risk of stunting was associated with father's occupation as farmer and the presence of family networks for child care. The greatest protective effect was found in children cared for exclusively by their mothers. In the urban area, risk factors for stunting were father with unstable job, presence of small social networks, low rate of attendance to the Well Child Program activities, breast-feeding longer than six months, and two variables within the family characteristics dimension (longer duration of parents' union and migration from rural to urban area). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the influence of the family on the nutritional status of children under two years of age living in extreme poverty areas. Factors associated with stunting were different in rural and urban communities.Therefore, developing and implementing health programs to tackle malnutrition should take into account such differences that are consequence of the social, economic, and cultural contexts in which the family lives."
19577695,1,a,"The world's almost 400 million Indigenous people have low standards of health. This poor health is associated with poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, poor hygiene, environmental contamination, and prevalent infections. Inadequate clinical care and health promotion, and poor disease prevention services aggravate this situation. Some Indigenous groups, as they move from traditional to transitional and modern lifestyles, are rapidly acquiring lifestyle diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, and physical, social, and mental disorders linked to misuse of alcohol and of other drugs. Correction of these inequities needs increased awareness, political commitment, and recognition rather than governmental denial and neglect of these serious and complex problems. Indigenous people should be encouraged, trained, and enabled to become increasingly involved in overcoming these challenges."
19567981,1,a,"Development is defined sustainable when it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Pivoting on social, environmental and economic aspects of food chain sustainability, this paper presents the concept of sustainable food safety based on the prevention of risks and burden of poor health for generations to come. Under this respect, the assessment of long-term, transgenerational risks is still hampered by serious scientific uncertainties. Critical issues to the development of a sustainable food safety framework may include: endocrine disrupters as emerging contaminants that specifically target developing organisms; toxicological risks assessment in Countries at the turning point of development; translating knowledge into toxicity indexes to support risk management approaches, such as hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP); the interplay between chemical hazards and social determinants. Efforts towards the comprehensive knowledge and management of key factors of sustainable food safety appear critical to the effectiveness of the overall sustainability policies."
29675890,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of pelvic pain and model associations with potential demographic, obstetric, gynaecological and psychosocial determinants. DESIGN, SETTING AND SAMPLE: A cohort study of women born between 1972 and 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand, most recently assessed when aged 38 years (95% of survivors retained); 429 women were eligible for analysis. METHODS: Women self-completed reproductive health questionnaires at ages 21, 26, 32 and 38 years, with questions on dysmenorrhoea at ages 13 and 15, and on all pelvic pain at age 38. Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and Poisson regression used to model associations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prevalence of pain and adjusted relative risks (ARR) for potential explanatory factors. RESULTS: Over half (54.5%, 95% CI 49.7-59.3%) of women experienced pelvic pain in the past 12 months at age 38. Dysmenorrhoea was reported by 46.2% (41.3-51.3%), dyspareunia by 11.6% (8.7-15.2%) and other pelvic pain (OPP) by 17.3% (13.8-21.2%). After adjusting for multiple factors, pregnancy (ARR 0.60, 95% CI 0.32-1.13) and childbirth (ARR 0.52, 95% CI 0.25-1.09) were borderline protective for dyspareunia and OPP, respectively. However, childbirth was not associated with dysmenorrhoea (ARR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74-1.28). Dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia were strongly associated, and both were associated with endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that female pelvic pain is common, and suggest common gynaecological and obstetric causal pathways, but there was no strong evidence supporting a benefit of childbirth for dysmenorrhoea. Further research on obstetric events and pelvic pain is needed, with both being common experiences. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Pelvic pain was common at age 38, especially dysmenorrhoea (46.2%), and no improvement was detected following childbirth."
27783739,0,a,"Objective:: to analyze the intimate partner violence in adolescence from the perspective of gender and generation. Method:: Quantitative, descriptive, and exploratory research. 111 adolescents participated in this study, with ages from 15 to 19 years old. Results:: We found that 91% of participants have perpetrated and 90.1% have undergone at least one of the natures of violence. The intimate partner violence in adolescence constitutes a form of gender violence, and gender constructions have determined the suffered and perpetrated aggressions, possibly also determining the naturalization and legitimization of such aggressions. The inequality of power between generations may determine greater vulnerability of youngsters to the phenomenon. Conclusion:: The historical and social construction of masculinity and femininity and the power inequalities set by these constructions converge with the power inequality between generations. Thus, gender and generation are determinants of intimate partner violence in adolescence, as well as of the vulnerability of adolescents to this phenomenon."
20041974,0,a,"AIM: Because of the ageing of populations, disability has become an emergent problem from the clinical, social, and economic perspectives. Nevertheless, the determinants of disability in older subjects are still unclear. We assessed the association between self-assessed masticatory dysfunction (MD) and functional ability in older subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed data of all 350 subjects aged 75+ living in Tuscania (Italy). Functional ability was estimated using the Katz' activities of daily living (ADLs), and the Lawton and Brody instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) scales. RESULTS: MD was reported by 145 (41%) participants. Disability in the ADLs and IADLs was found in 37 (25%) and 53 (37%) of participants with MD, respectively, but only in 11 (5%) and 30 (15%) of the other participants (p<0.001). MD was associated with disability in the ADLs [odds ratio (OR)=2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.05-5.51], and IADLs (OR=2.77, 95% CI=1.07-7.16) in logistic regression, after adjusting. The association of MD with disability was stronger among subjects aged 80+. CONCLUSIONS: MD is independently associated with disability in community-dwelling elderly. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of early detection and correction of MD on the preservation of functional status in older populations."
29757122,0,a,"The practice of operating room (OR) clinicians - nurses, surgeons, and anesthetists - is fundamentally about preserving life. Some patients, however, die in the OR. Clinicians are therefore vulnerable to moral and emotional trauma. In this paper, we discuss three forces that shape clinicians' moral and emotional experiences in OR care: biomedical values, normative death discourse, and socially (un)sanctioned grief. We suggest how each of these forces increases clinicians' vulnerability to feel traumatized when their patients die. We hope this discussion will stimulate clinicians and researchers to engage with social and cultural determinants of clinicians' experiences when patients die."
30591989,0,a,"BACKGROUND: To determine the prevalence of parent-reported ethnic/racial discrimination, and to determine if children with special health care needs are more likely to experience ethnic discrimination than other children who have similar family income, age, sex, race, parental education and Hispanic ethnicity. METHODS: Using the National Survey of Children's Health 2011-2012 (n = 95,677), ethnic discrimination was measured by two questions that asked ""was child ever treated or judged unfairly because of his/her race or ethnic group?"" and if so, how often it occurred in the last 12 months prior to the survey. RESULTS: An estimated 3 million US children aged 0-17 years have experienced parent-reported ethnic discrimination (1.4% White, 9.1% Black, 9.9% other race, 4.7% Hispanic). The likelihood to experience ethnic discrimination is much higher for Black and other race children, compared to White children. Children with special health care needs were two times more likely to experience ethnic discrimination frequently in the 12 months prior to the survey than comparable children in terms of age, sex, race, family income, parental education, and social capital. Higher family income did not prevent the exposure to ethnic discrimination but was associated with fewer instances. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretical frameworks, such as social determinants of health, must account for the bidirectional nature of the relationship between health and ethnic discrimination. Pediatric care must assess if ethnic discrimination has occurred and whether trauma-informed approaches are needed."
19821997,1,a,"BACKGROUND: With African health-care systems facing exploding demand for HIV care, reliable methods for assessing adherence and its influencing factors are needed to guide effective public-health measures. This study evaluated individual patient characteristics determining antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and the predictive values of different measures of adherence on virological treatment failure in a cohort of patients in a routine-care setting in Cameroon. METHODS: Longitudinal study over 6-months following ART introduction, using patients questionnaires and hospital and pharmacy records. RESULTS: At the end of the 6 months study period, 219 of 312 patients (70%) returned to the pharmacy to refill their medication, 17% (51) were lost to follow-up, 9% (28) were dead and 4% (14) were transferred to other care centres. Virological treatment failure at 6 months was experienced by 26 patients, representing 13% of patients with available viral load value. Pharmacy refill irregularity was the most powerful predictor (odds ratio 12.4; P < 0.001) of virological treatment failure, compared with CD4 cell count increase at 6 months (odds ratio 7.8; P = 0.002) or self-reported adherence at one month (odds ratio 1.1; P = 0.85). Low intensity of ART side-effects after one month was strongly associated with survival (odds ratio 0.11; P = 0.001). Patients starting ART with CD4 cell count <100 cells/mm3 had a greater risk of dying during the follow-up period (odds ratio 2.69; P = 0.02). Compared with asymptomatic CDC stage A patients, CDC stage B (odds ratio 5.72) and CDC stage C patients (odds ratio 16.9) had higher risk of becoming lost to follow-up (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analyses, pharmacy non-adherence was less frequent in women (adjusted odds ratio 0.56; P = 0.05) but more frequent in patients with high monthly income (odds ratio 3.24; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Pharmacy-refill adherence might be considered as an alternative to CD4 count monitoring for identification of patients at risk of virological failure, especially in resources-scarce countries. The study confirmed the difficulty in demonstrating clear associations of individual patient factors and treatment outcomes. The substantial loss to follow-up and deaths occurring within 6 months after initiating ART emphasise the need to understand the best timing of ART initiation and further elucidate and educate on the underlying reasons for delaying initiation of ART in resource-limited countries."
29180552,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although treatment for new back pain is heavily guideline driven, deviations occur frequently. Neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) may contribute to these deviations. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether nSES is associated with type of treatment provided for patients seeking treatment for new back pain in primary care clinics. METHODS: This retrospective cohort was conducted in academic internal and family medicine practices. Data were examined from the Primary Care Patient Data Registry. Eligibility criteria included age >/=18 years, free of HIV and cancer, and presenting to primary care with a new diagnosis of back pain, resulting in1646 patients included. Patients' nSES was determined using ZIP code and calculating a validated index of 7 census-tract variables. Multinomial logistic regression was used to measure the association between nSES and 3 treatment outcomes compared with no pharmacologic management. Outcomes included opioid prescription, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID)/muscle relaxant prescription, or combined opioid/nonopioid treatment within 90 days of initial presentation. Covariates included age, sex, race, high clinic utilization (HCU), depression, anxiety, substance use, obesity, comorbidities, smoking, number of pain conditions, and physical therapy (PT) referral. RESULTS: The cohort was 67.9% female with an average age of 55.72 years (Standard Error [SE] = 0.387). Compared with no pharmacologic treatment, individuals in the low nSES group had 63% higher odds of receiving an opioid only compared with the high nSES group (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 2.62). There was no significant association between nSES and odds of nonopioid or combined treatment compared with no pharmacotherapy (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.50), (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.78), respectively. Covariates associated with increased odds of opioid only included HCU, ever smoker, and increasing comorbidity index. PT referral was associated with NSAID/muscle relaxant only, and increasing age and comorbidity index were inversely associated with odds of NSAID/muscle relaxant only. Finally, covariates associated with increased odds of receiving both therapies included high clinic utilizusation, ever smoking, and PT referral. CONCLUSIONS: These data characterize a possible association between low nSES and increased risk of receiving an opioid only when being treated for new back pain. This may be evidence that patients of low nSES are at increased risk of receiving guideline-noncompliant treatment for new back pain."
17706756,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Smoking increases the risk for influenza and pneumococcal disease, but vaccination uptake is lower among smokers than non-smokers. We therefore aimed to determine reasons for not complying with vaccination among smokers and non-smokers. METHOD: In 2005 a self-administered questionnaire was sent to a random sample of Dutch patients (n=4,000) assessing medical, social and behavioural determinants. Independent factors associated with not complying with influenza and pneumococcal vaccination among smokers and non-smokers were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In all, 1,725 of 4,000 patients returned the questionnaire (response rate: 43%), 426 (25%) were smokers. Among smokers self-reported flu vaccine uptake was 42% and among non-smokers 52% among both only 0,2% received both vaccines. Most important predictors of not complying in smokers and non-smokers were patient's beliefs not to be susceptible to disease (odds ratio (OR) 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0, 8.0 and OR 2.8, CI: 2.0, 3.9), finding it difficult to go to the GP for vaccination (OR 2.5, CI: 1.3, 4.8 and OR 1.8, CI: 1.3, 2.6) and being against vaccination (OR 2.4 CI: 1.3, 4.4 and OR 1.8, CI: 1.3, 2.6), respectively. CONCLUSION: There are no substantial differences in determinants associated with not complying with influenza and pneumococcal vaccination between smokers and non-smokers but there is a trend towards stronger associations in smokers."
15896895,1,a,"Almost a third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the organism that causes tuberculosis disease. Most of those infected never fall ill, but individuals who do can recover if they have access to effective therapies. This paper discusses certain ethical and ethnographic issues raised by cases in which patients are infected with M. tuberculosis strains resistant to at least the two most powerful drugs on which therapy is usually based. In most poor countries, people with such multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were, until very recently, considered ""untreatable."" In addition to being consigned to a permanent state of ill health, they were also at risk of transmitting their resistant strain to others. In this paper we discuss the logic of ""cost-effectiveness,"" which international health policy-makers utilized to make the case that treatment of MDR-TB is not feasible in resource poor settings. These analyses, which have held sway in public health policy for many years, are flawed, we argue, because they ignore and conceal the social determinants of access to health services and often rely on assumptions rather than evidence. We propose that policies based solely on analyses of cost-effectiveness of specific interventions for individual settings can be short-sighted and, because they do not pay sufficient attention to the social, political, economic, epidemiological and pathophysiological factors influencing the production of health, will ultimately hinder progress toward effective global TB control."
30021752,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Overweight and obesity among young people are high and rising. Social stressors and sleep are independently associated with obesity, but are rarely studied together or examined for gender-specific effects. The literature regarding adolescent populations is especially lacking. This review assesses whether experiencing stressful life events results in greater adiposity in young women and young men compared with those who do not experience stressful life events, and whether the relationship is modified by sleep problems. DESIGN: We systematically searched six bibliometric databases (Web of Science, Embase Ovid, PsycINFO, CINHAL, PubMed, ProQuest Dissertations) supplemented by hand searches. Longitudinal prospective studies or reviews were eligible for inclusion when they examined gender-specific changes in adiposity in young adults (age 13-18 years) as a function of stressful life event alone or in combination with sleep problems. RESULTS: We found one study eligible for inclusion reporting mixed impact of stressful life events on body mass index (BMI) between genders. The study assessed specific life events and showed significantly lower BMI at follow-up among young men who experienced a residence change, but significantly higher BMI among young women who experienced setting up a family and who reported internal locus of control. CONCLUSIONS: Despite ample research on social stressors or sleep problems and weight, we still know little about the role of stressful life events, or combined effects with sleep, on obesity risk in adolescents from a gender perspective. Existing evidence suggests specific life events affect weight differently between the genders. Robust, high-quality longitudinal studies to decipher this dual burden on obesity during adolescence should be prioritised, as firm conclusions remain elusive."
11522812,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined factors associated with unmet need for care among persons aged 18 and older who need help with daily living tasks. The analysis focused on two types of unmet need: not enough (or inadequate) help and no help at all. METHODS: The authors used multinomial logistic regression to examine differences between persons with long-term care needs who (a) had all their needs met; (b) received inadequate help; and (c) received no help at all. Data were from the Adult Followback to the National Health Interview Survey on Disability (NHIS-D) for 1994 and 1995. RESULTS: The determinants of inadequate care versus no care differed with respect to age, gender, level of impairment, and insurance status. Whereas age and gender were important in determining inadequate care, insurance coverage and availability of social support were key factors related to a situation of no care. DISCUSSION: The present study demonstrates that the characteristics of groups reporting inadequate care versus no care, and the factors associated with these situations, are quite different. Nevertheless, the most important demographic risk factors for both types of unmet need mirror demographic groups currently on the increase in the U.S. population."
24812563,0,a,"Background. Inconsistent data exist about the role of probiotics in the treatment of constipated children. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of probiotics in childhood constipation. Materials and Methods. In this placebo controlled trial, fifty-six children aged 4-12 years with constipation received randomly lactulose plus Protexin or lactulose plus placebo daily for four weeks. Stool frequency and consistency, abdominal pain, fecal incontinence, and weight gain were studied at the beginning, after the first week, and at the end of the 4th week in both groups. Results. Forty-eight patients completed the study. At the end of the fourth week, the frequency and consistency of defecation improved significantly (P = 0.042 and P = 0.049, resp.). At the end of the first week, fecal incontinence and abdominal pain improved significantly in intervention group (P = 0.030 and P = 0.017, resp.) but, at the end of the fourth week, this difference was not significant (P = 0.125 and P = 0.161, resp.). A significant weight gain was observed at the end of the 1st week in the treatment group. Conclusion. This study showed that probiotics had a positive role in increasing the frequency and improving the consistency at the end of 4th week."
15808930,1,a,"Psychosocial stress is a potent activator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. While the physiological mechanisms of HPA axis responses to stress as well as its short and long-term consequences have been extensively examined, less is known why someone elicits an acute neuroendocrine stress response, i.e. what are the psychological processes involved and how are they related to the acute neuroendocrine stress response. To examine this question, a questionnaire to assess anticipatory cognitive appraisal processes was developed and administered to 81 male healthy subjects in a standardized psychosocial stress situation (Trier social stress test). Cortisol stress responses were assessed with repeated measurement of salivary free cortisol. Hierarchical regression analyses show that anticipatory cognitive appraisal, in contrast to general personality factors and retrospective stress appraisal is an important determinant of the cortisol stress response, explaining up to 35% of the variance of the salivary cortisol response. The reported results emphasize the importance of psychological stress processing for the understanding of psychobiological stress responses. Since stress and its biological consequences have been shown to be associated with the onset and the maintenance of somatic illnesses and psychiatric disorders, psychological processes are prime targets for prevention and intervention."
19803115,1,a,"This study assesses the importance of customer-contact intensity at the service encounter level as a determinant of service quality assessments. Using data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, it shows that performance-driven human resources practices play an important role as determinants of employee customer orientation and service capability in both high-contact (outpatient healthcare) and low-contact (benefits claim processing) human service contexts. However, there existed significant differences across service delivery settings in the salience of customer orientation and the congruence between employee and customer perceptions of service quality, depending on the intensity of customer contact. In both contexts, managerial attention to high-performance work systems and customer-orientation has the potential to favorably impact perceptions of service quality, amplify consumer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency."
11144870,1,a,"The purpose of the present investigation was to study prevalence of periodontal disease among 30 to 39-years-old from Oporto in the north of Portugal. In addition, an attempt was made to elucidate possible periodontal disease determinants in this population. A random sample consisting of a total of 322 individuals was drawn based on electoral lists. The attendance rate was 61%. The CPITN index was used and the results indicate a high prevalence of periodontal disease and a substantial need for periodontal treatment in this population, with 41% of the individuals investigated having one or more sites with a CPITN score 4 (pockets deeper than 5.5 mm). Dental visiting habits, gender (lower CPITN scores for females) and oral hygiene were the determinants most significantly associated with variation in CPITN scores."
29930967,0,a,"Context: Care continuity during transitions between the hospital and home requires reliable communication between providers and settings and an understanding of social determinants that influence recovery. Case Description: The coordinating transitions intervention uses real time alerts, delivered directly to the primary care practice for complex chronically ill patients discharged from an acute care setting, to facilitate nurse care coordinator led telephone outreach. The intervention incorporates claims-based risk stratification to prioritize patients for follow-up and an assessment of social determinants of health using the Patient-centered Assessment Method (PCAM). Results from transitional care are stored and transmitted to qualified healthcare providers across the continuum. Findings: Reliance on tools that incorporated interoperability standards facilitated exchange of health information between the hospital and primary care. The PCAM was incorporated into both the clinical and informational workflow through the collaboration of clinical, industry, and academic partners. Health outcomes improved at the study practice over their baseline and in comparison with control practices and the regional Medicaid population. Major Themes: Current research supports the potential impact of systems approaches to care coordination in improving utilization value after discharge. The project demonstrated that flexibility in developing the informational and clinical workflow was critical in developing a solution that improved continuity during transitions. There is additional work needed in developing managerial continuity across settings such as shared comprehensive care plans. Conclusions: New clinical and informational workflows which incorporate social determinant of health data into standard practice transformed clinical practice and improved outcomes for patients."
15978130,1,a,"CONTEXT: The Kenya Partnership for Health (KPH) program began in 1999, and is currently one of the 12 field projects participating in the WHO's 'Towards Unity for Health initiative' implemented to develop partnership synergies in support of the Primary Health Care (PHC) approach 1. CONTENT: This paper illustrates how Program-linked Information Management by Integrative-participatory Research Approach (PIMIRA) as practised under KPH has been implemented within Trans-Nzoia District, Kenya to enhance community-based health initiatives. It shows how this model is strategically being scaled-up from one community to another in the management of political, social, cultural and economic determinants (barriers and enhancers) of health. OBJECTIVE: Target rural communities in the development of a community-based health information management and feedback initiatives that can provide insights on the social, cultural, political and economic determinants of health for utilization in informed health service management. KEY FINDINGS AND ACHIEVEMENTS: 1. Cues for health seeking and health service utilization are determined by the social, cultural, political and economic factors as seen by the individual and as defined by the community but not due to the pathological nature of the illness. 2. Establishment of community-based health surveillance and health action initiatives as the best practices in transferring health as a resource that can be 'owned and guarded' by the community. 3. Establishment of Healthy Villages Initiative (HVI) through which health service delivery and scale-up can be sustained at the community level. 4. Provision of actionable health information necessary for health planning and evaluation of preventive health programs thorough PIMIRA. CONCLUSION: It has been realized that for every one person who visits a health facility for medication, there are nine others who had the same condition but sought health care from other sources including self-medication and five others who never sought health care. Innovative means of involving the community in health information management and utilization such as PIMIRA are hence the best ways of guaranteeing equitable delivery of health services that are accessible and sustainable by the community."
28129546,0,a,"Long workhours erode health, which the setting of maximum weekly hours aims to avert. This 48-h limit, and the evidence base to support it, has evolved from a workforce that was largely male, whose time in the labour force was enabled by women's domestic work and care giving. The gender composition of the workforce has now changed, and many women (as well as some men) combine care-giving with paid work, a change viewed as fundamental for gender equality. However, it raises questions on the suitability of the work time limit and the extent it is protective of health. We estimate workhour-mental health thresholds, testing if they vary for men and women due to gendered workloads and constraints on and off the job. Using six waves of data from a nationally representative sample of Australian adults (24-65 years), surveyed in the Household Income Labour Dynamics of Australia Survey (N = 3828 men; 4062 women), our study uses a longitudinal, simultaneous equation approach to address endogeneity. Averaging over the sample, we find an overall threshold of 39 h per week beyond which mental health declines. Separate curves then estimate thresholds for men and women, by high or low care and domestic time constraints, using stratified and pooled samples. We find gendered workhour-health limits (43.5 for men, 38 for women) which widen further once differences in resources on and off the job are considered. Only when time is 'unencumbered' and similar time constraints and contexts are assumed, do gender gaps narrow and thresholds approximate the 48-h limit. Our study reveals limits to contemporary workhour regulation which may be systematically disadvantaging women's health."
11811637,1,a,"Using a longitudinal field design, this study tested the dynamics of an integrative model of social identity theory (SIT) and relative deprivation theory (RDT) with regard to relations between perceived socio-structural characteristics, perceived in-group identification, perceived fraternal deprivation (i.e., resentment) and identity-management-strategy preference. Trait-state analyses revealed that the dynamic relationship among constructs in the model can best be explained in terms of trait-dependent variation rather than sequentially ordered processing. The trait components of the variables replicate previous findings concerning SIT and RDT. However. stable functional relations between variables and their traitlike character contradict the notion that their underlying processes are linear and sequential. Rather, variables and their relations can be regarded as the product of parallel processes. The authors discuss the results as a challenge to core assumptions of SIT."
17029939,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Although social disparities in survival for patients with cancer are documented in an increasing number of papers, knowledge on the underlying mechanisms concerning screening, diagnosis, treatment or follow-up, is relatively poor. Our study was aimed at investigating the social determinants of access to reference cancer care centres for surgery for colorectal cancer in France. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted on population-based data from a specialised cancer registry (County of Calvados, France). The population consisted of 5156 patients with surgical treatment for colorectal cancer recorded between January 1st 1981 and December 31st 2000. RESULTS: The probability of being cared for in a reference care centre was 1.3-fold lower for people living in a deprived district (mean income < 15000 euros) and 3-fold lower for people living in a district where more than 7% of houses were devoid of bath and shower in comparison with districts where this rate was under 2%. After adjustment for distance from reference care centre, the probability of being cared for in a reference care centre was still over one third lower for people living in a district with more than 7% of houses devoid of bath and shower. Social disparities in management of patients with colorectal cancer have increased in the last decade. The reduction of access to reference care with distance was stronger in elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a social and geographical determination of type of treatment centre for care management of colorectal cancer in France. Special attention needs to be paid to the high quality of care management in non-specialised care centres in order to avoid an increased social gradient in cancer mortality in France."
27388459,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Most of the research investigating the effect of social context on individual health outcomes has interpreted context in terms of the residential environment. In these studies, individuals are nested within their neighbourhoods or communities, disregarding the intermediate household level that lies between individuals and their residential environment. Households are an important determinant of health yet they are rarely included at the contextual level in research examining association between body mass index (BMI) and the social determinants of health. In this study, our main aim was to provide a methodological demonstration of multilevel analysis, which disentangles the simultaneous effects of households and districts as well as their associated predictors on BMI over time. METHODS: Using both two- and three-level multilevel analysis, we utilized data from all four cross-sections of the Indonesian Family life Survey (IFLS) 1993 to 2007-8. RESULTS: We found that: (i) the variation in BMI attributable to districts decreased from 4.3 % in 1993 to 1.5 % in 1997-98, and remained constant until 2007-08, while there was an alarming increase in the variation of BMI attributable to households, from 10 % in 2000 to 15 % in 2007-08; (ii) ignoring the household level did not change the relative variance contribution of districts on BMI, but ignoring the district level resulted in overestimation of household effects, and (iii) households' characteristics (socioeconomic status, size, and place of residence) did not attenuate the variation of BMI at the household-level. CONCLUSIONS: Estimating the relative importance of multiple social settings allows us to better understand and unpack the variation in clustered or hieratical data in order to make valid and robust inferences. Our findings will help direct investment of limited public health resources to the appropriate context in order to reduce health risk (variation in BMI) and promote population health."
24473609,0,a,"The scope of this article is to analyze and describe the risk factors and determinants linked to 24 suicides in the city of Palmas in the state of Tocantins between 2006 and 2009. The psychological and psycho-social autopsy method was used in order to investigate the consummated suicides by interviewing family members. It contextualized the subjects' life characteristics to understand the family dynamics and the affective, social, economic and cultural background, based on the reconstruction of the history and personality of the individuals. The associated socio-economic factors were: being male, aged between 20 and 40, single, with mixed ethnicity and basic education. The major risk factors identified were: mental disorder, alcohol and other drug abuse, disturbed family relationship and a history of previous suicide attempts. An attempt was made to contextualize and reflect on some cases reported by family members, as well as on the response of the health care teams to the demands of the families. The need to implement prevention programs and to train the primary health care professionals was considered a priority."
31434585,0,a,"Little is known about intimate partner abuse (IPA) among couples during pregnancy in Iran. This study aimed to compare the rates of IPA by pregnant women towards their husbands (perpetration), and women's experience of IPA from their husbands (victimization) and determine the predictors of the two behaviours. The cross-sectional study was conducted on 525 pregnant women at 24-30 weeks of gestation visiting governmental health care centres/posts in Tabriz, Iran, in 2014. The study sample was selected using random cluster sampling. The Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) was used to assess IPA perpetration and victimization. The McNemar test was employed to compare the prevalences of IPA perpetration and victimization, and adjusted logistic regression was utilized to determine the socio-demographic predictors of overall IPA perpetration and victimization. The overall rates of women's reported abuse of their husbands (perpetration) and women's experience of abuse from their husbands (victimization) were 70% and 67%, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.086). The prevalence of psychological aggression perpetrated by women towards their husbands was significantly higher than that experienced by the women from their husbands (65% vs 58%, p<0.001). The prevalences of sexual coercion (15% vs 30%) and injury (8% vs 16%) perpetrated by women on their husbands were significantly lower those they experienced by the women from their husbands (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of perpetration of physical violence towards husbands by women (19%) and that experienced by women from their husbands (22%) (p=0.072). Women's and husbands' satisfaction with their own occupations were predictors of both perpetration and victimization of IPA. The observed high rates of IPA perpetration by, women and victimization of, women during pregnancy, and the significantly higher rate of violence towards women compared with that perpetrated by women, especially for sexual coercion and injury, require health policymakers and care providers to make serious efforts to identify such violence, and take appropriate measures to reduce it, during pregnancy in women in Iran."
17961687,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the quality of life of children with cerebral palsy from the parents' and children's perspectives. STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-five children were recruited; a parent, and when feasible, the child also completed the Child Health Questionnaire and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. A range of predictor variables was measured relating to impairments, activity limitations, personal and environmental factors. RESULTS: Mean age was 9.3 +/- 2.1 years; 63.2% were male, and almost half had mild motor impairment (47% Gross Motor Function Classification System level I). Mean physical well-being (Child Health Questionnaire) was 39.6 +/- 16.9 with 50% <40; and mean psychosocial well-being was 43.0 +/- 11.3 with 53.8% <40. Similarly, with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, 61% had summary scores <1 SD. Scores of parents and their children were significantly correlated (physical: r = .59, P < .0001; psychosocial: r = .39, P = .01); however, children rated themselves higher. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that quality of life is highly variable in children with cerebral palsy, with about half experiencing a life quality similar to typically developing children. Motor and other activity limitations are indicators of physical but not psychosocial well-being. Family functioning, behavioral difficulties, and motivation are important predictors of social-emotional adaptation. Determinants of life quality may guide resource allocation and health promotion initiatives to optimize health of the child and family."
11966887,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the perceived oral health status and to explore its relationship with clinically assessed dental fluorosis among school children in Arusha town, Tanzania. METHODS: A total of 478 students (mean age 15.7 years) completed questionnaires administered in the schools during May to July 2000. Clinical photos of the upper and lower incisors were taken under field conditions. A total of 461 slides were rated under laboratory conditions. The severity of dental fluorosis in the permanent maxillary central incisors was assessed using the Thylstrup & Fejerskov Index (TFI). RESULTS: The prevalence of dental fluorosis at TFI score > or = 2 was 74%. A total of 67% of boys and 70% of girls rated their teeth as yellow to brown, 58% of boys and 68% of girls (P < 0.05) confirmed dissatisfaction with their dental appearance. Kappa values of 0.40-0.44 were obtained between dental fluorosis (TFI > or = 2) and self-reported discoloration. The proportion of school children reporting dissatisfaction with oral condition and dental appearance increased with increasing TFI scores. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis explained 21% and 32% of the variance in the dissatisfaction with oral condition and dental appearance scores; TFI scores 11% and 15% of variation in points, and social and psychological variables 11% and 17%. CONCLUSION: Whereas dental fluorosis at different diagnostic cut-off points impacts self-rated oral health negatively, social and personal factors are as important in shaping the responses of school children to oral condition and dental appearance."
28386989,0,a,"AIM: In the present study, we evaluated the direct and mediating (indirect) effects of clinical oral conditions, dental anxiety, sense of coherence (SOC), and socioeconomic variables on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and general health-related quality of life (GHRQoL) in Iranian adolescents. METHODS: A longitudinal design was used with a sample of 1052 (694 males, mean age=15.05 years) schoolchildren from Qazvin, Iran. Each participant completed a background information sheet and the following scales at baseline: Modified Dental Anxiety Scale, SOC, PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scale, and PedsQL Oral Health Scale. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core and Oral Health scales were recompleted at the 18-mo follow up. RESULTS: Father's education, monthly family income, dental anxiety, Community Periodontal Index (CPI), decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT), and SOC significantly and directly predicted OHRQoL at 18 mo. Father's education had indirect effects on OHRQoL through CPI and DMFT, family income had indirect effects through DMFT, and dental anxiety had indirect effects through CPI. OHRQoL at 18 mo (beta=0.499) and SOC (beta=0.084) had significant and direct and mediating effects through OHRQoL on GHRQoL, while father's education, monthly family income, dental anxiety, CPI, and DMFT only showed mediating effects. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical oral indicators had direct effects on OHRQoL, but mediated the effects of dental anxiety and socioeconomic status on both OHRQoL and GHRQoL."
16299386,1,a,"Myxococcus xanthus has two different mechanisms of motility, adventurous (A) motility, which permits individual cells to glide over solid surfaces, and social (S) motility, which permits groups of cells to glide. To identify the genes involved in S-gliding motility, we mutagenized a delta aglU (A-) strain with the defective transposon, magellan-4, and screened for S- mutants that form nonmotile colonies. Sequence analysis of the sites of the magellan-4 insertions in these mutants and the alignment of these sites with the M. xanthus genome sequence show that two-thirds of these insertions lie within 27 of the 37 nonessential genes known to be required for social motility, including those necessary for the biogenesis of type IV pili, exopolysaccharide, and lipopolysaccharide. The remaining insertions also identify 31 new, nonessential genes predicted to encode both structural and regulatory determinants of S motility. These include three tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, several regulators of transcription that may control the expression of genes involved in pilus extension and retraction, and additional enzymes involved in polysaccharide metabolism. Three insertions that abolish S motility lie within genes predicted to encode glycolytic enzymes, suggesting that the signal for pilus retraction may be a simple product of exopolysaccharide catabolism."
17903047,1,a,"BACKGROUND: To assess the inequity in seeking needed outpatient services in Iran and to investigate its influential factors. METHOD: The data were taken from a nation-wide Iranian health survey conducted in 2003. This study is based on individuals aged 15 years and over who had mentioned their need to seek outpatient care within two weeks prior to the day of the interview. The outcome was seeking needed outpatient care. The independent variables included respondents' age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, index of household economic status, health insurance status and residential place (urban vs. rural). RESULTS: Sixty-nine point five percent of those in need sought outpatient care. The rich (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.64 - 3.43) and the health insured (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.25 - 2.08), the pensioners and the retired (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.22 - 4.20), the housewives (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.07 - 2.95) were more likely to seek outpatient care than other occupations. On the other hand, people living in remote rural areas (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28 - 0.57) were less likely to seek their needed outpatient care than those living in main rural areas and urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: As in different parts of the world, differences in seeking needed healthcare still exist across different groups in Iran. Indeed, seeking outpatient care in Iran is related not only to health system functions--like health insurance and health facilities--but also on factors beyond the scope of health authorities such as economic status and occupation. This study can be instrumental for the recent five-year Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan of Iran which identified the reduction of inequalities in social determinants of health [corrected]"
25343647,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Parents are a common source of alcohol for adolescent drinking. Few studies have examined the possible determinants of parental alcohol supply. We investigated the associations between parents' supply of alcohol, their attitudes concerning the supply of alcohol (personal norms), and their beliefs about other parents' attitudes and behavior (injunctive and descriptive social norms). METHOD: A web-based survey was completed by 490 parents of 12- to 18-year-olds from Australia (n = 251) and Canada (n = 239). Path analysis was used to test a conceptual model of the relationships between social norm constructs and supply of alcohol at home and for unsupervised consumption. RESULTS: Personal norms were the most important factor in parents' decisions to supply alcohol to adolescents for consumption both at home and in unsupervised settings. Descriptive and injunctive proximal norms were directly associated with supply of alcohol at home. Injunctive and descriptive proximal norms were indirectly associated with unsupervised supply through their positive association with personal norms. CONCLUSIONS: The path models identify personal norms relating to adolescent alcohol consumption as the variable most strongly associated with decisions to supply alcohol to adolescents both at home and in unsupervised settings, with associations between injunctive and descriptive norms operating via this pathway. Proximal norms have a more powerful influence on parents' personal norms than do distal norms. These associations have important implications for the design of interventions to reduce parental supply of alcohol and adolescent risky drinking."
11264431,1,a,"The compelling evidence linking small size at birth with later cardiovascular disease has renewed and amplified a clinical and scientific interest in the determinants of fetal growth. Although the effects of maternal nutrition on fetal growth have been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about the effects of maternofetal hypoxia. This study tested the hypothesis that in highland regions, high altitude rather than maternal economic status is associated with reduced and altered fetal growth by investigating the effects of high altitude versus economic status on birth weight and body shape at birth in Bolivia. Bolivia is geographically and socioeconomically unique. It contains several highland (>3500 m above sea level) and lowland (<500 m) cities that are inhabited by very economically divergent populations. Birth weight, body length, and head circumference were compared between a high- (n = 100) and low- (n = 100) income region of La Paz (3649 m; largest high-altitude city) and a high- (n = 100) and low- (n = 100) income region of Santa Cruz (437 m; largest low-altitude city). In addition, the frequency distribution across the continuum of birth weights was plotted for babies born from high- and low-income families in La Paz and Santa Cruz. Mean birth weights were lower in babies from La Paz than in babies from Santa Cruz in both high- and low-income groups. The cumulative frequency curve across all compiled birth weights was shifted to the left in babies from La Paz compared with those from Santa Cruz, regardless of economic status. The frequency of low birth weight (<2500 g) was higher in babies from La Paz than from Santa Cruz in both high- and low-income groups. In addition, at high altitude but not at low altitude, high income was associated with an increase in the head circumference:birth weight ratio. These findings suggest that high altitude rather than economic status is associated with low birth weight and altered body shape at birth in babies from Bolivia."
30375304,0,a,"ABSTRACTBackground:Given the rate of the undiagnosed cases of dementia and the consequences of inappropriate care, understanding the factors that explain the use of medical and health care in dementia is a critical concern. Our objective was to identify the psychosocial and medical determinants of use of care in dementia. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 308 participants: the persons with dementia (n = 99) selected from three French population-based cohorts (i.e. PAQUID, 3C, AMI), their family caregivers (primary, n = 96, and secondary, n = 51), and their general practitioners (n = 62). Use of care in dementia was considered according to two indicators: (1) recourse to secondary care, (2) number of community and health services used. RESULTS: Multiple logistic models including sociodemographics and psychosocial variables revealed that the determinants of nonuse of care are similar both for the recourse to secondary care and for the number of community and health services used: lack of education and the contribution of the people with dementia to the decisions regarding their own care and dementia care services in the community area. In addition, satisfaction of the primary caregiver with the services used by his/her relative is associated with non-recourse to secondary care. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results highlight the predominant role of psychosocial factors in the use of care in dementia and the importance of addressing this issue through an integrative approach including psychological, social, medical, and family dimensions."
21070316,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To examine associations between psychosocial profile (psychological distress and social support) and changing oral health status (dental caries and periodontal disease), among a group of immigrants from Ethiopia to Israel. METHODS: Three hundred and forty immigrants, aged 18-75 years, with a mean age of 38.4+/-13.5 years, comprised the study population and were followed over a 5-year period. Dental caries was recorded employing the DMFT index. Periodontal health status was recorded employing the Community Periodontal Index (CPI). Participants were interviewed using a structured written questionnaire which included two validated psychosocial scales, for psychological distress and social support. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Among subjects with psychological distress, the adjusted mean caries (DMFT) increment in 2004-2005, since baseline (1999-2000), was 3.52+/-0.19 when compared to 0.35+/-0.15 among subjects with no psychological distress (P<0.001). Correspondingly, the percentage of people with increased periodontal pockets was 40%, when compared to 7%, respectively (P<0.001). In multiple linear regression analysis employing the DMFT as a continuous variable, and in multiple logistic regression analysis employing the DMFT as a dichotomous variable (% caries versus % caries-free), the four variables that reached statistical significance as predictors of caries status were previous caries experience, psychological distress, social support, and age. Gender, income, and education were not significantly related to current caries prevalence. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the three variables that reached statistical significance as predictors of periodontal disease (shallow and deep pockets) were previous periodontal disease experience, psychological distress, and age. Social support, gender, income, and education were not significantly associated with periodontal disease prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents persuasive evidence that supports the role of psychological distress and social support as determinants of changing oral health levels, among a low socioeconomic, relatively homogenous immigrant minority population."
17159594,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate, patterns and predictors of HIV disclosure in the French Antilles and French Guiana. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among a 15% random sample (n=398) of the hospital caseload in hospitals providing HIV care. Determinants of disclosure to a steady partner and other members of the individual's social network were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: From the time of diagnosis, 84.6% of those in a couple (n=173) disclosed their HIV-positive status to their steady partner, 55.6% disclosed to others, and 30.3% did not tell their status to anyone. Disclosure within a steady partnership was less likely among non-French individuals [Haitians: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.72; other nationalities: AOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.68]; and among those diagnosed with HIV after 1997 (AOR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.86). Determinants of disclosure to others were found to be sex (women: AOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.24-3.36), age at diagnosis (>or=50 versus<30 years: AOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.90), nationality (Haitians versus French: AOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.77), transmission route (non-sexual versus sexual: AOR 3.38, 95% CI 1.12-10.23) and hospital inpatients (hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients: AOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.17-3.37). After disclosing, social and emotional support from confidants was common and discrimination was infrequent. CONCLUSION: One third of PLWHA had kept their HIV status secret. Interventions targeting the general population and social institutions, and support for PLWHA by healthcare staff are needed to improve the situation."
15778630,1,a,This study examined the relationship between early childhood caries (ECC) and measures of socioeconomic status as environmental determinants of oral health inequalities. Dental caries and quality of oral hygiene were reported on 384 young inner-city children (24-35 months) by clinical examination. Early childhood caries was diagnosed in 18.5% of children. Ethnicity (P < 0.001) and neighborhood (P < 0.001) were the social variables significantly predictive of ECC in a logistic regression model. Living in a deprived neighborhood and the mother being of East European descent were the social variables with strongest association with ECC. These variables can be considered adequate criteria to identify groups at risk within the overall population.
26607939,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Studies of the role of dietary factors in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) development have been limited, and no specific dietary factors have been consistently associated with EOC risk. OBJECTIVE: We used a nutrient-wide association study approach to systematically test the association between dietary factors and invasive EOC risk while accounting for multiple hypothesis testing by using the false discovery rate and evaluated the findings in an independent cohort. DESIGN: We assessed dietary intake amounts of 28 foods/food groups and 29 nutrients estimated by using dietary questionnaires in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study (n = 1095 cases). We selected 4 foods/nutrients that were statistically significantly associated with EOC risk when comparing the extreme quartiles of intake in the EPIC study (false discovery rate = 0.43) and evaluated these factors in the NLCS (Netherlands Cohort Study; n = 383 cases). Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs. RESULTS: None of the 4 dietary factors that were associated with EOC risk in the EPIC study (cholesterol, polyunsaturated and saturated fat, and bananas) were statistically significantly associated with EOC risk in the NLCS; however, in meta-analysis of the EPIC study and the NLCS, we observed a higher risk of EOC with a high than with a low intake of saturated fat (quartile 4 compared with quartile 1; overall HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.41). CONCLUSION: In the meta-analysis of both studies, there was a higher risk of EOC with a high than with a low intake of saturated fat."
30514272,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Society demands a university education grounded on ethical principles. Education in ethics values is responsibility of universities but will not be viable unless also adopted by directly responsible agents, the teachers who work with the students. For this reason, our primary research objective was to conduct an in-depth analysis of how Health Sciences students self-perceive the ethical dimension. METHODS: A mixed research methodology with two phases, qualitative and quantitative, allowed us to address our research question from two complementary viewpoints. Conversational interviews were conducted in an intentional and purposive sample to identify a wide range of discursive representations. A questionnaire was designed based on previous studies and the topics of qualitative research. The response format for the questionnaire followed a Likert scale and modulators such as sex, age, degree and the score of a social desirability test were examined. RESULTS: After 24 conversational interviews, three main thematic blocks (coinciding with the three subscales of the questionnaire) were identified: ""attitudes for harmony in human relations"", ""construction of the self"" and ""rules and regulations"". A total of 246 students completed a questionnaire with 39 items. The total scores ranged from 93 to 152 points, with an average score of 122.72 +/- 10.64 points. Responsibility, the basic rules of education and respect were perceived as the two most important values, whereas solidarity and social participation as the least important. Results showed a significant positive linear correlation between total score on the questionnaire and age and social desirability. Age was also a significant predictor for the total score and the subscale score ""rules and regulations"". The students responses seemed to be conditioned by the degree of social desirability that they present. CONCLUSIONS: The ad-hoc questionnaire captured the maintenance of high ethical values in our college undergraduate students, which may be directly related to enhanced social desirability. The scores obtained on the questionnaire were correlated with the students' age, which may indicate that values might tend to acquire progressively more importance as students grow older. Further research is warranted to delve deeper on the determinants of professionalism and ethical decision-making in college students."
18434246,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the personal, social and cultural factors likely to explain recourse to the Internet as a preferred source of personal health information. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a population of 2923 Internet users visiting a firmly established website that offers information on personal health. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the determinants of site use. MEASUREMENT: The analysis template comprised four classes of determinants likely to explain Internet use: beliefs, intentions, user satisfaction and socio-demographic characteristics. Seven-point Likert scales were used. An analysis of the psychometric qualities of the variables provided compelling evidence of the construct's validity and reliability. A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the correspondence with the factors predicted by the theoretical model. FINDINGS: The regression analysis explained 35% of the variance in Internet use. Use was directly associated with five factors: perceived usefulness, importance given to written media in searches for health information, concern for personal health, importance given to the opinions of physicians and other health professionals, and the trust placed in the information available on the site itself. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the importance of the credibility of information on the frequency of Internet use as a preferred source of information on personal health. It also shows the potentially influential role of the Internet in the development of personal knowledge of health issues."
16580567,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) can be one of the major determinants of high blood pressure (BP), but there has been no study on SDB with an emphasis on shift workers. The objective of this study was to examine whether a relationship between SDB and blood pressure/hypertension is more evident among shift workers than among day workers. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we measured BP levels and oxygen desaturation index (by nocturnal pulse oximetry) among 253 male shift workers and 206 male day workers aged 30 to 62 years at nuclear power plants in Japan. RESULTS: The prevalence of SDB (3% oxygen desaturation index >or=10 and >or=15 per hour) in all subjects was 11.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 8.4-14.2) and 6.1% (95% CI 3.9-8.3), respectively, with no statistical difference between shift and day workers. Systolic and diastolic BP levels were correlated with 3% oxygen desaturation index in all subjects after adjustment for potential confounding variables. This association was primarily observed among workers aged >or=40 years, more specifically older shift workers. CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between SDB severity and diastolic BP levels among shift workers aged >or=40 years suggests the importance of screening for SDB among shift workers for BP control."
11965528,1,a,"All available polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentration data in ambient air obtained over the past 10 years in Germany were evaluated to clarify whether it is justified to use benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) as a marker compound for the total PAH exposure. The data basis comprises annual mean concentrations from 1990 to 1998 supplied by the emission protection authorities of the federal states with additional information on the region, year and site of measurement. The data are very heterogeneous with respect to sample size, the number of individual PAHs analyzed, place of origin and year. Nine of 25 individual compounds with sufficient sample size (74<N<518) were submitted to an explorative descriptive analysis and multiple regression analysis. Six compounds were selected for factor analysis to evaluate whether associations can be related to one or several background determinants. The concentration data of BaA, BeP, BaP, DBA, BghiP, COR, BbF, BkF and INP are not normally distributed and demonstrate great variability. Location, East-West differences persisting after the German reunion and time characterize the distributive patterns, e.g., from 1991 to 1997, a significant decrease in BaP could be determined based on the data from North Rhine-Westphalia (1991, N=51, median 1.6 ng/m(3); 1997, N=45, median 0.7 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). The BaP concentrations in the new federal states in the East (N=80, median 2.2 ng/m(3)) are about twice as high compared to the ones in the old federal states in the West (N=438, median 1.1 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). BaP measurements taken at sites characterized by traffic (1.8 ng/m(3)), industrial (1.3 ng/m(3)) or urban environment (1.3 ng/m(3)) rank significantly higher compared to measurements taken at rural sites (0.92 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). Factor analysis of the intercorrelation matrix of BaA, BeP, BaP, DBA, BghiP and COR yields one factor to explain 92% of the variability of the six individual PAHs. BaP shows the highest factor loading. These results confirm the common practice to use BaP as marker compound for the PAH exposure in ambient air."
16004700,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Little work has been published on short-term inpatient treatments combining the virtues of inpatient treatments and short-term psychotherapy. The purposes of this study are to (a) determine the outcomes of short-term psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy from patients' and therapists' perspectives, (b) assess the stability of changes, and (c) identify predictors of long-term outcome. METHODS: 83 consecutive inpatients (76% of those eligible) were assessed at intake, discharge, and 1 year follow-up by standardized questionnaires regarding symptoms (SCL-90R), interpersonal problems (IIP), object relationships (IPO), and the therapeutic relationship (HAQ). Diagnoses and functioning (GAF) were assessed by the therapists. RESULTS: Psychological distress (effect size S = 1.14) and physical complaints (ES = 1.03) decreased strongly from intake to discharge, the majority of patients moving from the pathological to the normal range of the global severity index GSI (SCL-90R). At follow-up, average distress remained at a low level, and the majority of patients, and their therapists and physicians, regarded their well-being as improved. In a multivariate approach, a substantial proportion of variance of the distress at follow-up (42%) was explained by an infantile object relationship pattern (IPO), social avoidance (IIP), negative vocational changes, and a lack of a confidant at follow-up. A delayed start of subsequent ambulatory psychotherapy was another negative outcome predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Attention should be given to maladaptive interpersonal relationship patterns, to vocational reintegration, and a confiding relationship as potential predictors of long-term outcome. Also, patterns of ambulatory after-care following inpatient treatment need further scrutiny."
26728042,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that the built environment with high numbers of fast food restaurants and convenience stores and low numbers of super stores and grocery stores are related to obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, and other chronic diseases. Since few studies assess these relationships at the county level, we aim to examine fast food restaurant density, convenience store density, super store density, and grocery store density and prevalence of type II diabetes among counties in South Carolina. METHODS: Pearson's correlation between four types of food outlet densities- fast food restaurants, convenience stores, super stores, and grocery stores- and prevalence of type II diabetes were computed. The relationship between each of these food outlet densities were mapped with prevalence of type II diabetes, and OLS regression analysis was completed adjusting for county-level rates of obesity, physical inactivity, density of recreation facilities, unemployment, households with no car and limited access to stores, education, and race. RESULTS: We showed a significant, negative relationship between fast food restaurant density and prevalence of type II diabetes, and a significant, positive relationship between convenience store density and prevalence of type II diabetes. In adjusted analysis, the food outlet densities (of any type) was not associated with prevalence of type II diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: This ecological analysis showed no associations between fast food restaurants, convenience stores, super stores, or grocery stores densities and the prevalence of type II diabetes. Consideration of environmental, social, and cultural determinants, as well as individual behaviors is needed in future research."
20028669,1,a,"In parallel with the neo-liberal retrenchment of the welfarist state, an increasing emphasis on the responsibility of individuals in managing their own affairs and their well-being has been evident. In the health arena for instance, this was a major theme permeating the UK government's White Paper Choosing Health: Making Healthy Choices Easier (2004), which appealed to an ethos of autonomy and self-actualization through activity and consumption which merited esteem. As a counterpoint to this growing trend of informed responsibilization, constrained choices (constrained agency) provides a useful framework for a judicious balance and sense of proportion between an individual behavioural focus and a focus on societal, systemic, and structural determinants of health and well-being. Constrained choices is also a conceptual bridge between responsibilization and population health which could be further developed within an integrative biosocial perspective one might refer to as the social ecology of health and disease."
23803435,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Precarious employment is becoming an increasingly important social determinant of health inequalities among workers. The way in which contemporary employment arrangements and their health consequences are addressed in empirical research is mostly based on the contract-related or employment instability dimension. A broader conceptual approach including various important characteristics of the degrading of employment conditions and relations is needed. OBJECTIVE: The general objective of this paper is to empirically test a new multidimensional construct for measuring precarious employment in an existing database. Special focus is on the social distribution of precarious employment. METHODS: A subsample of 21,415 participants in the EU-27 from the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey-2005 was analysed. A cross-sectional study of the social distribution of precarious employment was conducted through the analysis of proportional differences according to gender, social class and credentials for the European Union as a whole and within each country. The 8 dimensions of the employment precariousness construct were represented by 11 indicators. RESULTS: In general, women, workers without supervisory authority, those with fewer credentials, and those living in Eastern and Southern European countries suffer the highest levels of precarious employment. Exceptionally, men, workers with supervisory authority and those with the highest credentials suffer the highest levels of long working hours, schedule unpredictability and uncompensated flexible working times. CONCLUSIONS: This article offers the first validation for an innovative multidimensional conceptualisation of employment precariousness applied to the analysis of existing survey data, showing the unequal distribution of precarious employment across the European labour force. This set of indicators can be useful for monitoring precarious employment."
27349200,0,a,"Aging is a prominent topic in global health. The purpose of this report is to document progress in two of our research projects in Japan, which currently is the most aged society in the world. The Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) is one of the largest nation-wide research projects on aging, with more than 100 000 participants in 2010 and 2013. One of the notable findings is that community participation is a significant determinant of older people's health. We have also made progress in the development of the JAGES Health Equity Assessment and Response Tools (HEART), which is a management tool for developing age-friendly cities. This progress suggests that community perspective and management of health promotion in the communities are valuable and require further research."
23125998,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Four main clinical issues need to be considered for HIV-positive individuals and couples with respect to pregnancy planning and counselling: (1) pre-conceptional health; (2) transmission from mother to infant, which has been significantly reduced by combined antiretroviral therapy; (3) transmission between partners during conception, which requires different prevention and treatment strategies depending on the status and needs of those involved; and (4) management of infertility issues. The objective of the Canadian HIV Pregnancy Planning Guidelines is to provide clinical information and recommendations for health care providers to assist HIV-positive individuals and couples with their fertility and pregnancy planning decisions. These guidelines are evidence- and community-based and flexible, and they take into account diverse and intersecting local/population needs and the social determinants of health. OUTCOMES: Intended outcomes are (1) reduction of risk of vertical transmission and horizontal transmission of HIV, (2) improvement of maternal and infant health outcomes in the presence of HIV, (3) reduction of the stigma associated with pregnancy and HIV, and (4) increased access to pregnancy planning and fertility services. EVIDENCE: PubMed and Medline were searched for articles published in English or French to December 20, 2010, using the following terms: ""HIV"" and ""pregnancy"" or ""pregnancy planning"" or ""fertility"" or ""reproduction"" or ""infertility"" or ""parenthood"" or ""insemination"" or ""artificial insemination"" or ""sperm washing"" or ""IVF"" or ""ICSI"" or ""IUI."" Other search terms included ""HIV"" and 'horizontal transmission"" or ""sexual transmission"" or ""serodiscordant."" The following conference databases were also searched: Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International AIDS Conference, International AIDS Society, Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, the Canadian Association of HIV/AIDS Research, and the Ontario HIV Treatment Network Research Conference. Finally, a hand search of key journals and conferences was performed, and references of retrieved articles were reviewed for additional citations. Subsequently, abstracts were categorized according to their primary topic (based on an outline of the guidelines) into table format with the following headings: author, title, study purpose, participants, results and general comments. Finally, experts in the field were consulted for their opinions as to whether any articles were missed. VALUES: The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Recommendations for practice were ranked according to the method described in that report (Table) and through use of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation instrument for the development of clinical guidelines.

12162837,1,a,"This piece presents evidence that inequities in information are an important determinant of health inequities and that eliminating these inequities in access to information, especially by using new information and communication technologies (ICTs), could represent a significant advance in terms of guaranteeing the right to health for all. The piece reviews the most important international scientific research findings on the determinants of the health of populations, emphasizing the role of socioeconomic inequities and of deteriorating social capital as factors that worsen health conditions. It is noteworthy that Latin America has both socioeconomic inequities and major sectors of the population living in poverty. Among the fundamental strategies for overcoming the inequalities and the poverty are greater participation by the poor in civic life and the strengthening of social capital. The contribution that the new ICTs could make to these strategies is analyzed, and the Virtual Health Library (VHL) is discussed. Coordinated by the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME), the VHL is a contribution by the Pan American Health Organization that takes advantage of the potential of ICTs to democratize information and knowledge and consequently promote equity in health. The ""digital gap"" is discussed as something that can produce inequity itself and also increase other inequities, including ones in health. Prospects are discussed for overcoming this gap, emphasizing the role that governments and international organizations should play in order to expand access to the global public good that information for social development is."
17471524,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine health disparities as a function of ethnicity using data from LUpus in MInorities, NAture versus nurture (LUMINA), a longitudinal study of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); to build an explanatory model of how ethnic disparities occur in this setting; and to suggest appropriate interventions. METHODS: LUMINA patients (meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE) ages >/=16 years of African American, Hispanic (from Texas), Hispanic (from Puerto Rico), or Caucasian ethnicity were studied. In addition to examining the basic features of the cohort, we examined, by univariable and multivariable analyses, the factors associated with disease activity, damage accrual, lupus nephritis, and mortality. An empiric model based on the data presented (and the literature reviewed) was derived to explain the disparities observed. RESULTS: There were substantial differences in the socioeconomic/demographic, clinical, and genetic features among patients from the different ethnic groups, with Texan Hispanic and African American patients exhibiting overall a lower socioeconomic status, different genetic associations, more serious disease at a younger age, and worse intermediate and final outcomes than the Caucasian and Puerto Rican Hispanic patients. A model of disease outcome as a function of the disparities observed was created. CONCLUSION: Ethnic disparities occur in SLE. Environmental, socioeconomic/demographic, psychosocial, genetic, and clinical factors play an important role as determinants of the ethnic differences observed. Measures aimed at eliminating these disparities are suggested while further research is conducted to elucidate the basis of these disparities and their changes at the societal level and to eliminate the gap between the rich and the poor."
26463522,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The objectives of the study were to explore the effect of the economic crisis on child health using Spain as a case study, and to document and assess the policies implemented in response to the crisis in this context. METHODS: Serial cross-sectional data from Eurostat, the Spanish Health Interview Survey, and the database of childhood hospitalisation were analysed to explore impacts on child health, and key determinants of child health. A content analysis of National data sources/government legislation, and Spanish literature was used to describe policies implemented following the crisis. RESULTS: Unemployment rates in the general population (8.7% in 2005 and 25.6% in 2013), and children living in unemployed families (5.6% and 13.8%) increased in the study period. The percentage of children living under the poverty line, and income inequalities increased 15-20% from 2005 to 2012. Severe material deprivation rate has worsened in families with Primary Education, while the number of families attending Non-Governmental Organisations has increased. An impact on children's health at the general population level has not currently been detected; however an impact on general health, mental health and use of healthcare services was found in vulnerable groups. Investment in social protection and public policy for children showed a reduction as part of austerity measures taken by the Spanish governments. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the impact on social determinants, a short-term impact on child health has been detected only in specific vulnerable groups. The findings suggest the need to urgently protect vulnerable groups of children from the impact of austerity."
30497404,0,a,"The area of ""deprescribing"" has rapidly expanded in recent years as a positive intervention to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy and improve health outcomes for (older) people with multimorbidity. While our understanding of deprescribing as a process has greatly improved and existing approaches all have patient-centered elements, there is still limited literature exploring the importance of the individual patient context in deprescribing decision-making. This is clearly an important consideration to ensure that any deprescribing approach is ethical, respectful, and successful. To address this gap in the literature, we have developed a conceptual framework in the form of a rainbow - with five different deprescribing determinants - and place the person at the center of the deprescribing process. This framework is informed by literature on patient-centered care for older people and people with multimorbidity. We illustrate the potential application of this framework to a complex patient case to highlight the importance of the different clinical, psychological, social, financial and physical deprescribing determinants, and how this approach could be adopted by those working in clinical practice."
19477880,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Early family-level and social-level stressors are both assumed to be the components of two main path models explaining the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and its long-term consequences on mental health explored through life-course epidemiological studies. AIMS: To investigate the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and mental health outcomes in adulthood when taking into account early family and social stressors. METHODS: A retrospective French cohort study of 3023 adults representative of the general population in the Paris metropolitan area was conducted in 2005 through at-home, face-to-face interviews. The outcomes measures were current depression and lifetime suicide attempt, intimate partner violence, violence against children and alcohol dependence. RESULTS: The adults exposed to interparental violence during childhood had a higher risk of psychosocial maladjustment. After adjusting for family- and social-level stressors in childhood, this risk was, respectively, 1.44 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.00) for depression, 3.17 (1.75 to 5.73) for conjugal violence, 4.75 (1.60 to 14.14) for child maltreatment and 1.75 (1.19 to 2.57) for alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: The adult consequences of parental violence in childhood-and this independently of the other forms of domestic violence and the related psychosocial risks-should lead to intensifying the prevention of and screening for this form of maltreatment of children."
18777671,1,a,"There exists a lot of research on the reservation wages of the unemployed as a determinant of unemployment duration. Little is known about the reservation wages of those who are not in the labor force but might be potential labor force returnees, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries. The main objective of this article is to assess what can be learned from the subjective reservation wages of DI beneficiaries. Using the New Beneficiary Data System (NBDS), the article assesses the magnitudes of reservation wages compared to the last wage earned and the benefit amount, as well as the determinants of reservation wages in a regression framework. The NBDS is unique in that it provides the reservation wages and the work history of DI beneficiaries before and after joining the DI rolls. The article has several noteworthy results and policy implications: *Data show that a significant portion of beneficiaries report being likely to accept a job if offered one. Based on the NBDS, 13 percent of DI beneficiaries who did not work since joining the rolls in 1981-1982 reported in 1991 that they would be willing to work if offered a job and provided their reservation wages. *DI beneficiaries do not appear to price themselves out of the labor market. Half of them would want a wage that is 80 percent or less of the last wage earned before receiving DI. It is estimated that approximately 7 percent of long-term DI beneficiaries may potentially return-to-work if they search for jobs and have a wage offer distribution with a mean at 80 percent of their last wage. *The nonlabor income in addition to the benefit is positively and significantly associated with the reservation wage, while the benefit amount per se is not. However, this result needs to be treated with caution given that nonlabor income is endogenous to the model. *Heterogeneity exists between persons still under the DI program and those that have moved to the Old-Age program. The subsamples of persons who have shifted to the Old-Age program and those who are still under the DI program have median reservation wage to the last wage ratios of 0.69 and 0.93, respectively. A significantly lower reservation wage for persons who have moved to the Old-Age program was also found in a regression framework. This heterogeneity between the two groups may result in part from the different program characteristics both groups face, for instance, in terms of benefit termination and Medicare eligibility rules. *Subjective reservation wage data can be useful to study populations that are out of the labor force. This article is innovative in that it focuses on a group of persons who are typically considered as being out of the labor force, and therefore are not asked reservation wages in general household surveys such as the Current Population Survey. It would be of great interest to collect more reservation wage data for DI beneficiaries in a longitudinal data set to expand this analysis, for instance, to assess conclusively the effects of changing program characteristics on reservation wages and return-to-work outcomes as beneficiaries transition to the Old-Age program or as new return-to-work programs are put in place."
23013288,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Experiencing positive consequences of one's physical activity is supposed to facilitate further activity. This motivational outcome might be generated by an increase in perceived self-efficacy. In addition to such a mediator effect, we examine whether this applies generally or only under conditions of volitional control. For this purpose, perceived action control was considered as a putative moderator. DESIGN AND METHOD: N = 193 students participated in a study with three measurement points in time. At baseline, positive experience with previous physical activity was measured as a predictor of physical activity. Two weeks later, self-efficacy and action control variables were assessed as putative mediator and moderator, respectively. After another 2 weeks, physical activity was measured as the outcome. A moderated mediation model was specified with baseline physical activity and sex as covariates. RESULTS: Self-efficacy was found to mediate between initial positive experience and later physical activity, and this mediation was moderated by action control. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' perceptions of positive experience were associated with their subsequent self-efficacy fostering physical activity. However, persons with low levels of action control did not translate positive experience into physical activity via self-efficacy. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Numerous studies have shown that exercise-specific self-efficacy predicts subsequent physical activity. Prior positive experience with physical activity is suggested to be associated with exercise-specific self-efficacy. Furthermore, action control was found to be beneficial for the maintenance of physical activity. What does this study add? This study unveils the mechanisms between these social-cognitive determinants: our longitudinal results suggest that the mediation of positive experience and subsequent physical activity via self-efficacy is moderated by action control. Persons with low levels of action control did not translate positive experience into physical activity via self-efficacy."
11556777,1,a,"The contamination of blood products by HIV in the early 1980s resulted in thousands of deaths among people with hemophilia in the United States and elsewhere. In the US, industry, government, physicians, and advocacy groups were implicated in this tragedy. In response to pleas from members of the US hemophilia community, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Science convened a public hearing to identify the institutional determinants of the HIV/AIDS epidemic among US hemophilia patients. The resulting IOM Report (1995) established a narrative of the crisis and indicated necessary improvements to the management of the US blood supply. The Report, however, failed to address the hemophilia community's demands for accountability and retribution. In this paper we explore the moral and social dimensions of this tragedy through narrative analysis of the original testimonies of hemophilia sufferers, interviews with some patients and their families, and a re-examination of the text of the IOM Report itself. We examine the process by which this crisis was addressed--through the discourses of science and law--and how it was ultimately framed as a failure of management and oversight rather than a moral failure of the for-profit health-care system. Thus, while the Report and its aftermath demonstrate powerfully how testimonials of suffering can influence public policy, by not addressing what is at stake for the victims--failure to protect patients in an era of increasingly commodified health care--it led to an exculpatory solution that obfuscated the moral dimensions of suffering."
19265552,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the patterns and influences of physical activity change in mid-aged adults. This study describes the design, sampling, data collection, and analytical plan of HABITAT, an innovative study of (i) physical activity change over five years (2007-2011) in adults aged 40-65 years at baseline, and (ii) the relative contribution of psychological variables, social support, neighborhood perceptions, area-level factors, and sociodemographic characteristics to physical activity change. METHODS/DESIGN: HABITAT is a longitudinal multi-level study. 1625 Census Collection Districts (CCDs) in Brisbane, Australia were ranked by their index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage score, categorized into deciles, and 20 CCDs from each decile were selected to provide 200 local areas for study inclusion. From each of the 200 CCDs, dwellings with individuals aged between 40-65 years (in 2007) were identified using electoral roll data, and approximately 85 people per CCD were selected to participate (N = 17,000). A comprehensive Geographic Information System (GIS) database has been compiled with area-level information on public transport networks, footpaths, topography, traffic volume, street lights, tree coverage, parks, public services, and recreational facilities Participants are mailed a questionnaire every two years (2007, 2009, 2011), with items assessing physical activity (general walking, moderate activity, vigorous activity, walking for transport, cycling for transport, recreational activities), sitting time, perceptions of neighborhood characteristics (traffic, pleasant surroundings, streets, footpaths, crime and safety, distance to recreational and business facilities), social support, social cohesion, activity-related cognitions (attitudes, efficacy, barriers, motivation), health, and sociodemographic characteristics. Analyses will use binary and multinomial logit regression models, as well as generalized linear latent growth models. DISCUSSION: HABITAT will provide unique information to improve our understanding of the determinants of physical activity, and to help identify ""people"" and ""place"" priority targets for public policy and health promotion aimed at increasing physical activity participation among mid-aged men and women."
27537330,0,a,"UNLABELLED: Over the last decade, there has been a great improvement in the oral health of Brazilians. However, such a trend was not observed among five-year-old children. Dental caries are determined by the interplay between biological and behavioral factors that are shaped by broader socioeconomic determinants. It is well established that dental disease is concentrated in socially disadvantaged populations. To reduce social and health inequalities, the Brazilian government created Family Health Program (ESF), and the Bolsa Familia Program, the Brazilian conditional cash transfer program (Bolsa Familia Program). The aim of this study was to examine the oral health care and promotion provided by the Family Health Teams to children and caregivers covered by the Bolsa Familia Program. Data was collected through interviews with three groups of participants: 1) dentists working for the Family Health Program; 2) Family Health Program professionals supervising the Bolsa Familia Program health conditionalities (Bolsa Familia Program supervisors); and 3) parents/caregivers of children covered by the Bolsa Familia Program. A pretested questionnaire included sociodemographic, Bolsa Familia Program, oral health promotion, dental prevention and dental treatment questions. The results showed that most dentists performed no systematic efforts to promote oral health care to children covered by the Bolsa Familia Program (93.3%; n = 69) or to their parents/caregivers (74.3%; n = 55). Many dentists (33.8%) did not provide oral health care to children covered by the Bolsa Familia Program because they felt it was beyond their responsibilities. Nearly all Bolsa Familia Program supervisors (97.3%; n = 72) supported the inclusion of oral health care in the health conditionality of the Bolsa Familia Program, but 82.4% (n = 61) stated they did not promote oral health activities to children covered by the Bolsa Familia Program. Children in the routine care setting were more often referred to dentists than children covered by the Bolsa Familia Program (p</=0.001). Parents/caregivers (99.2%; n = 381) agreed that oral health care is important and 99.5% (n = 382) would like their children to be seen regularly. CONCLUSIONS: No collaboration was observed between the Bolsa Familia Program and the Family Health Program with regard to the provision of oral health care. Making oral health care a Bolsa Familia Program conditionality may reduce oral health care inequalities for extreme poor children under seven in Brazil."
20044965,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Societies that foster socially supportive networks produce healthier populations. Social support is a significant determinant of health among Canada's Inuit population; however, little is known about the characteristics that provide access to social support among Inuit. This exploratory analysis describes how 4 types of social support (namely, positive social interaction, emotional support, tangible support and affection and intimacy) differ in relation to various determinants of health. STUDY DESIGN: Micro-data from the Arctic Supplement of the 2001 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (n = 26,290) was used. METHODS: Cross-tabulations and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine levels (high/low) of the 4 types of social support among the full Inuit sample (n = 26,290) as they relate to age, gender, geographic region, marital status, Aboriginal language use and participation in traditional harvesting activities. RESULTS: Certain subsegments of the Inuit population were less likely to report high levels of social support, including men, the elderly (aged 55+) and the unmarried. Some Inuit-relevant determinants were also found to decrease the odds of reporting high levels of social support, including being unable to speak or understand an Aboriginal language, not participating in traditional harvesting activities and living in Nunavik. CONCLUSIONS: Research that frames Inuit health within the social determinants of health is in its relative infancy; however, evidence from the social epidemiological literature indicates that those with diminished access to social support also suffer poorer health outcomes. Future research should build on the findings of this study to examine how the relationship between various health outcomes (e.g., respiratory disease, suicide attempts, self-rated health) and social support may respond along a social gradient. Such analysis will build on the paucity of literature specific to Inuit health and social conditions and set priorities for policy and programming efforts that will improve the social determinants of Inuit health."
23864907,0,a,"Recent epidemiological reports of associations between socioeconomic status and epigenetic markers that predict vulnerability to diseases are bringing to light substantial biological effects of social inequalities. Here, we start the discussion of the moral consequences of these findings. We firstly highlight their explanatory importance in the context of the research program on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) and the social determinants of health. In the second section, we review some theories of the moral status of health inequalities. Rather than a complete outline of the debate, we single out those theories that rest on the principle of equality of opportunity and analyze the consequences of DOHaD and epigenetics for these particular conceptions of justice. We argue that DOHaD and epigenetics reshape the conceptual distinction between natural and acquired traits on which these theories rely and might provide important policy tools to tackle unjust distributions of health."
31576083,0,a,"Context: Subfertility affects about 15% of couples worldwide. There are several factors that affect subfertility called social determinants of health (SDH): biological factors as age, ethnic origin, and body mass index; behavioral factors as alcohol intake, smoking, coffee, dietary restriction, physical activity, and psychological state; and contextual factors as education, work activity, and income level. Aims: The aim of the study is to evaluate the distribution's relevance of the SDH in subfertile women versus nonsubfertile women. Settings and Design: A prospective comparative study with two groups of women recruited over 1 year at hospital consultation: one group with subfertile women excluding women without a male partner or with a previous child and another one formed by primigravidae, excluding those receiving assisted reproduction techniques to become pregnant. Subjects and Methods: We compare the different factors between subfertile and nonsubfertile women one by one. Second, a multivariate analysis was conducted with logistic regression. In all cases, informed consent was obtained. Results: Regular physical exercise 3-4 times/week (odds ratio [OR]: 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15-0.71) or healthy food products such as fish 1-2 times/week (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.17-0.95) were associated with nonsubfertile women. Conclusions: The distribution of SDH in natural fertility is not altogether homogeneous. Weight control by means of restricting calorie intake, greater consumption of healthy foods such as fish, regular physical exercise, and lower age are positively associated with fertility. Population-level intervention is possible to improve women's health, as these are modifiable factors. Ethnic origin can be considered as a relevant factor, as it may condition the distribution of other determinants."
17963491,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The fulfilment of expectations, labour pain, personal control and self-efficacy determine the postpartum evaluation of birth. However, researchers have seldom considered the multiple determinants in one analysis. To explore to what extent the results can be generalised between countries, we analyse data of Belgian and Dutch women. Although Belgium and the Netherlands share the same language, geography and political system and have a common history, their health care systems diverge. The Belgian maternity care system corresponds to the ideal type of the medical model, whereas the Dutch system approaches the midwifery model. In this paper we examine multiple determinants, the fulfilment of expectations, labour pain, personal control and self-efficacy, for their association with satisfaction with childbirth in a cross-national perspective. METHODS: Two questionnaires were filled out by 605 women, one at 30 weeks of pregnancy and one within the first 2 weeks after childbirth either at home or in a hospital. Of these, 560 questionnaires were usable for analysis. Women were invited to participate in the study by independent midwives and obstetricians during antenatal visits in 2004-2005. Satisfaction with childbirth was measured by the Mackey Satisfaction with Childbirth Rating Scale, which takes into account the multidimensional nature of the concept. Labour pain was rated retrospectively using Visual Analogue Scales. Personal control was assessed with the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire and Pearlin and Schooler's mastery scale. A hierarchical linear analysis was performed. RESULTS: Satisfaction with childbirth benefited most consistently from the fulfilment of expectations. In addition, the experience of personal control buffered the lowering impact of labour pain. Women with high self-efficacy showed more satisfaction with self-, midwife- and physician-related aspects of the birth experience. CONCLUSION: Our findings focus the attention toward personal control, self-efficacy and expectations about childbirth. This study confirms the multidimensionality of childbirth satisfaction and demonstrates that different factors predict the various dimensions of satisfaction. The model applies to both Belgian and Dutch women. Cross-national comparative research should further assess the dependence of the determinants of childbirth satisfaction on the organisation of maternity care."
11450925,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to identify 'non-medical' datasets holding routinely collected information that might be used to measure and monitor the wider determinants of community health and well-being. METHODS: An expert panel discussion, involving public health and environmental health academics and professionals with expertise in a variety of backgrounds (including environmental health, housing, transport, community safety, public health, primary and secondary care), and interrogation of the Office for National Statistics database were carried out for the West Midlands region. The aim was to identify routinely collected 'non-medical' datasets containing information on the following factors: physical environment, crime, housing and homelessness, social services, socio-economic environment including employment, lifestyles, education, leisure and culture, transport and accidents. RESULTS: Fifty-six datasets were identified. Although 43 (77 per cent) were collected at least annually, few (17; 30 per cent) held data that were disaggregated and routinely available at the sub-local authority level. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a number of datasets that hold information relevant to health. However, no single dataset is likely to provide information on all dimensions of health and the determinants of health, and local agencies should consider carefully the strengths and weaknesses of each. Through the development of inter-sectoral working and multi-agency involvement at the local level there is now considerable scope to improve the quality of many of these datasets and to promote their use in the measurement and monitoring of community health."
15798074,1,a,"With the growing problem of childhood obesity, recent research has begun to focus on family and social influences on children's eating patterns. Research has demonstrated that children's eating patterns are strongly influenced by characteristics of both the physical and social environment. With regard to the physical environment, children are more likely to eat foods that are available and easily accessible, and they tend to eat greater quantities when larger portions are provided. Additionally, characteristics of the social environment, including various socioeconomic and sociocultural factors such as parents' education, time constraints, and ethnicity influence the types of foods children eat. Mealtime structure is also an important factor related to children's eating patterns. Mealtime structure includes social and physical characteristics of mealtimes including whether families eat together, TV-viewing during meals, and the source of foods (e.g., restaurants, schools). Parents also play a direct role in children's eating patterns through their behaviors, attitudes, and feeding styles. Interventions aimed at improving children's nutrition need to address the variety of social and physical factors that influence children's eating patterns."
15256519,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Stature is an important determinant of several reproductive and non-reproductive health problems. Documentation of secular trends in stature has been based primarily on cross-sectional studies of special populations, primarily of men. The objective of this study is to determine how growth and socio-economic status (SES) factors relate to stature changes among lineal female relatives, maternal grandmothers to mothers. METHODS: The study base was derived from a population-based intergenerational cohort which linked several statewide databases to data from the mothers' own birth certificates: the Washington State Intergenerational Cohort. Mothers in these ethnic groups were separately studied: non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics. We generated simple, partial, and multiple correlation coefficients to investigate the association between stature and other growth and SES factors. RESULTS: A mother's stature is determined partly by her own mother's stature and partly by her birthweight. These two measures are individually stronger predictors of stature than are several available SES factors considered in combination-grandmother's age, parity, marital status, and mother's age. The maximal multiple correlation models yielded R2 values from 18% to 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Growth measures are stronger predictors of intergenerational changes in stature than are the several available socio-economic factors. However, socio-economic factors are partly responsible for the level of achieved prenatal and postnatal growth. Since grandmother's stature is a determinant of mother's birthweight, which in turn is a determinant of infant birthweight, some environmentally influenced determinants of some birth outcomes are already established before a prospective mother is conceived or born."
29914438,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Stigma and discrimination remains a barrier to uptake of HIV/AIDS counselling and treatment as well as effective HIV reduction programmes. Despite ethnic diversity of Nigeria, studies on determinants of HIV stigma incorporating the ethnic dimension are very few. This paper provides empirical explanation of the ethnic dimension of determinant of HIV stigma and discrimination in Nigeria. METHODS: Nationally representative data from Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey 2013 (Individual recode) was analysed to explore ethnic differentials and homogeneity in the determinants of HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination among women in multi-ethnic Nigeria. RESULTS: Result shows that determinants of HIV stigma and discrimination varies by ethnicity in Nigeria. Significant ethnic differentials in HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination by Secondary school education exist among Hausa and Igbo respectively (OR = 0.79; CI: 1.49-2.28 and OR=1.62; CI: 1.18-2.23, p<0.05). Wealth status significantly influenced HIIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination among Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba ethnic groups (p<0.05). Knowledge of HIV/AIDS was significantly associated with lower odds of discriminating attitudes among the Hausa and Fulani ethnic groups (OR = 0.45; CI: 0.30-0.67 and OR=0.36; CI: 0.16-0.83, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Identifying ethnic differential and homogeneity in predictors of HIV/AIDS stigma is key to reducing HIV/AIDS prevalence in Nigeria and countries with similar settings."
11472446,1,a,"AIMS: Many psycho-social factors can affect the glycaemic control of children with Type 1 diabetes, but the influence of the intelligence of the child and their parents has not been reported. METHODS: Seventy-eight children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes and their mothers performed standardized tests to assess psychometric intelligence. The children were aged (median (range)) 12.0 (5-17) years with duration of diabetes 5.0 (1.0-13.0) years and required an insulin dose of (mean +/- SD) 1.0 +/- 0.3 U/kg per day. The children completed the Wide Range Achievement Test 3 reading test (WRAT3) and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM). A mean annual HbA1c was calculated for each subject (8.6 +/- 1.4%). The mothers performed the National Adult Reading Test (NART) and provided details of the occupation of the main wage-earner in the family from which social class (SC) was derived. RESULTS: The HbA1c of the child correlated with their age (r = 0.26, P = 0.02), SC (Kendall's rank correlation, tau = 0.17, P = 0.03) and with the NART error score of their mother (r = 0.28, P = 0.01), but no correlation was observed with the child's WRAT3 or RSPM score. Stepwise regression revealed that age and NART error score were the strongest independent determinants of glycaemic control (total adjusted r2 = 0.117). CONCLUSIONS: Parental intelligence appears to have a significant influence on the glycaemic control of a child with Type 1 diabetes, accounting for 7.6% of the reliable variance in HbA1c."
26420183,0,a,"The effects of patient characteristics on reported adherence to dietary self-care behaviours in 184 Taiwanese outpatients 40 years or older with type 2 diabetes was assessed. Patient characteristics included the presence of predisposing factors affecting diabetes adherence (knowledge and attitudes about the disease, self-efficacy, and the absence of psychological problems), enabling factors (understanding of diabetes and environmental factors affecting it), and reinforcing factors (presence of medical and social support) which were evaluated using a 72 item self-administered questionnaire with 8 subscales. Adherence was assessed by patients' reports of carrying out 7 self-care behaviours (following a diabetic meal plan, following the diabetes exchange system, eating meals providing the same amount of carbohydrate every day, counting carbohydrates, reducing dietary fat, consuming high fiber foods, and keeping a daily food record). Reported adherence ranged from 17% to 74%. No single predisposing, enabling, or reinforcing factor predicted adherence to all of the dietary self-care behaviours. However, more self-efficacy, better understanding, and a better attitude toward diabetes were associated with performing five or more of the dietary self-care behaviours examined. With respect to specific self-care behaviours, women were more likely than men to count carbohydrates (OR=5.75) and reduce fat in their diets (OR=2.57). Patients who attended more nutrition education sessions were more likely to follow diabetes meal plans (OR=2.11) and the diabetes exchange system (OR=3.07). Efforts are needed to encourage providers to teach diabetes self-care behaviours to patients and to capitalize upon demographic and psychosocial characteristics that can enhance patient adherence."
25617353,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Adverse health-related behaviours (HRBs) have been shown to co-occur in adolescents. Evidence lacks on factors associated with these co-occurring HRBs. The Theory of Triadic Influence (TTI) offers a route to categorize these determinants according to type (social, cultural and intrapersonal) and distance in the causal pathway (ultimate or distal). Our aims were to identify cultural, social and intrapersonal factors associated with co-occurring HRBs and to assess the relative importance of ultimate and distal factors for each cluster of co-occurring HRBs. METHODS: Respondents concerned a random sample of 898 adolescents aged 12-18 years, stratified by age, sex and educational level of head of household. Data were collected via face-to-face computer-assisted interviewing and internet questionnaires. Analyses were performed for young (12-15 years) and late (16-18 years) adolescents regarding two and three clusters of HRB, respectively. RESULTS: For each cluster of HRBs (e.g. smoking, delinquency), associated factors were found. These accounted for 27 to 57% of the total variance per cluster. Factors came in particular from the intrapersonal stream of the TTI at the ultimate level and the social stream at the distal level. Associations were strongest for parenting practices, risk behaviours of friends and parents and self-control. CONCLUSION: Results of this study confirm that it is possible to identify a selection of cultural, social and intrapersonal factors associated with co-occurring HRBs among adolescents."

21885727,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The burden of disease in children with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis is unknown. Our study aimed to identify the determinants of quality of life (QOL) and parental mental health in this group of patients and their parents and to evaluate the effect of exacerbations on these parameters. METHODS: Parents of 69 children (median age 7 years) with non-CF bronchiectasis prospectively completed two questionnaires (parent-proxy cough-specific quality of life [PC-QOL] and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale [DASS]) at stable and exacerbation states. Data on clinical, investigational, and lung function parameters were also collected. RESULTS: During the stable state, the median interquartile range (IQR) PC-QOL score was 6.5 (5.3-6.9) and the DASS 21-item questionnaire score was 6 (0-20). Being of a young age correlated with a worse QOL (r(5) = 0.242, P = .04) but radiologic extent, lung function, underlying cause, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and chronic upper-airway disease did not influence these scores. Exacerbations caused significant worsening in the PC-QOL scores (median [IQR], 4.6 [3.8-5.4]; P = .001) and DASS scores (median [IQR], 22 [9-42]; P < .001; 38% with elevated anxiety, 54% with abnormal depression/stress scores during exacerbation). The presence of viral infection, hypoxia, and hospitalization did not influence the exacerbation PC-QOL and DASS scores. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant burden of disease, especially during exacerbation, on parents of children with bronchiectasis. Prevention, early detection, and appropriate treatment of exacerbations are likely to reduce psychologic morbidity in this group."
15273261,1,a,"It is well known that there are social inequalities in health. Following the ecological approach, unemployment has been one of the most used indicators to study social inequalities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between indicators of extreme poverty and social unrest, along with unemployment, and mortality in Barcelona, during the years 1989 to 1993. A cross-sectional ecological study was carried out using Primary Health Care Areas (PHCAs) as the unit of analysis. The study population consisted of residents in Barcelona City. The indicators studied as dependent variables were the age-standardized mortality rates of the following causes of death: total mortality; lung cancer; bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma; cirrhosis; cerebrovascular disease; ischemic heart disease; breast cancer; traffic accidents; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); and drug overdose. Independent variables were male unemployment rate of the primary health care areas and indicators of extreme poverty and social conflict. A descriptive analysis, a bivariate analysis using Spearman correlation coefficients, and a multivariate analysis fitting Poisson regression models were carried out. For the main results, one group of causes of death was associated only with unemployment: bronchitis, emphysema and asthma, cerebrovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease (both men and women); lung cancer (only among men); total mortality and cirrhosis (only among women). Among men, another group of causes of death was associated with extreme poverty and/or social unrest, as well as unemployment: total mortality, cirrhosis, and drug overdose. AIDS in men was only associated with extreme poverty and social unrest. We concluded that we see different types of relationships between deprivation and mortality. Unemployment has been related to mortality because of pathologies with socially accepted risk factors (tobacco and alcohol). Causes of death with risk factors not socially accepted (illegal drug use) have been related to indicators of marginality as well as unemployment."
11493044,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Low-energy fractures among the elderly may be prevented by measures aimed at reducing the risk of falling or increasing the strength of the skeleton. Acceptance of these interventions in the target population is necessary for their success. METHODS: The total elderly population in a Danish municipality 7,543 community-dwelling persons aged 66+ years, were offered participation in one of three intervention programs: 2,550 persons were offered a home safety inspection, evaluation of prescribed medicine, and identification of possible health and food problems (Program I); 2,445 persons were offered 1000 mg of elemental calcium and 400 IU (10 microg) of vitamin D(3) per day in combination with evaluation of prescribed medicine (Program II); and 2,548 persons were offered a combination of the two programs (Program III). Acceptance was defined as willingness to receive an introductory visit by a nurse. RESULTS: Acceptance of Program I was 50%; of Program II, 56% (P < 0.00005 as contrasted with Program I); and of Program III, 46% (P < 0.005). Acceptance was associated with gender (females, 53%; males, 47%) and did not change from ages 66 to 84 but decreased significantly after the age of 85. Widows aged 66-84 had the highest acceptance (57%) and never married males aged 66-84 the lowest (30%). An important determinant, however, was the individual social service center that communicated the specific program. Acceptance varied from 39 to 66% between the social centers. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of a fall and fracture prevention program varies with intervention type; with gender, age, and social status of the target population; and with the motivation and attitude of the health workers involved in the implementation of the program."
26744912,0,a,"Previous research examining labour migration in sport focused on athletes in professional team sports. The purpose of this study is to analyse the factors influencing the migration probability of elite sport coaches in Germany (i.e. national coaches, state coaches, and coaches at Olympic training bases). From a theoretical perspective, labour migration of athletes is affected by economic, social, political, competitive, geographic and cultural factors. This study examines whether these factors can be applied to coaches. Primary data were collected using an online survey of elite sport coaches in Germany. Applying a conjoint design, respondents were presented with 10 migration scenarios leading to a sample size of n = 1860 for the empirical analysis. In the scenarios, the coaching position openings abroad differed in terms of income level, contract length, weekly workload, responsibility for personnel, reputation of coaching job, career perspectives, sporting performance of athletes, distance from Germany, and predominant job language. Coaches were asked for their migration probability contingent on the specific scenario. On average, migration probability was 24.2%. The results of regression analysis showed that higher income, contracts of longer duration, responsibility for personnel and speaking the respective language significantly increased the migration probability, while distances of nine flight hours and more, lower reputation and career perspectives reduced it. The findings have implications for policy-makers: they indicate in what areas the situation of coaches needs improvement to increase the likelihood of retaining elite sport coaches in the German sport system."
16510888,1,a,"Affective factors are likely to play a major role in determining the extent to which offenders are able to engage with, and benefit from, treatment. In this article, it is argued that the relationship between affect and treatment engagement may be understood in three ways: the access the client has to emotional states, the ability to express such states, and the willingness of the client to do this in the therapeutic session. It is suggested that affective determinants of treatment readiness can be understood with reference to models of emotional regulation and that attention to these affective factors in the early stages of treatment is likely to promote engagement, reduce attrition, and consequently improve treatment outcomes for violent offenders."
16880215,1,a,"There is an extensive literature within anthropology, sociology and psychology about lay concepts of determinants of health and illness. Many of these studies have used single sex or social class samples, often in narrow age bands, and many are qualitative in approach. We asked respondents in a health survey to say how important (on a five-point scale) they thought seven potential influences on health (habits, self-care, the environment, family relationships, one's constitution, money and luck) were. The first three were regarded as very important, the second three as less important and luck as least important. Responses were consistent with current public health and epidemiological knowledge; these respondents endorsed prevailing views about personal responsibility for health and about the role of the physical and social environment in influencing health. In mutually adjusted models, there were no significant gender differences, social class differences and neighbourhood differences in three out of seven influences, and age differences in four out of seven influences. Thus, socio-demographic differences were less marked than might be inferred from studies of specific social groups, indicating a need for caution in health education and health promotion practice against always assuming socio-demographic differences."
21644184,0,a,"This was an exploratory pilot study forming part of a programme of work to develop and trial an effective web-based intervention to reduce the risk of transmission of respiratory infections by promoting hand washing and other preventive behaviours in pandemic and non-pandemic contexts. The main purpose of this study was to confirm that the behavioural determinants we had identified from theory were related as predicted to intentions and to establish the validity of our measures of behavioural intentions. Participants (N = 84) completed a self-report web-delivered questionnaire measuring intentions to engage in hand washing and the hypothesised behavioural determinants of intentions, based on the theory of planned behaviour and protection motivation theory. In a factorial 2 x 2 design, half of the participants were first randomised to receive messages about potential negative consequences of pandemic flu (the ""high-threat"" condition) and half were assigned to receive ""coping"" messages describing the rationale and effectiveness of hand washing for reducing the risk of infection. A substantial proportion of variance in intentions was explained by measures of attitudes (instrumental and affective), social norms (descriptive and injunctive), perceived behavioural control (especially, access to hand gel) and perceived risk (in particular, the likelihood of catching pandemic flu). Our measures of intentions were sensitive to between-group differences, and although our design did not permit causal inference (particularly in view of selective dropout among those required to read most web pages), the pattern of differences was in the expected direction, that is, hand-washing intentions tended to be stronger in those receiving the high-threat message and coping messages. This study provided encouraging confirmation that our intervention development was proceeding correctly. Measures of intentions proved sensitive to group differences, and the behavioural determinants included in the study explained a substantial proportion of the variance in intentions. The study also provided useful indications that our high-threat message might increase hand-washing intentions, that providing hand gel might be beneficial and that it would be necessary to actively manage the risk of selective dropout in the intervention group."
16153480,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: The social stigma of tuberculosis is much less studied than those of other diseases such as AIDS or mental problems. However, it has important implications on the affected person's well being and on the epidemic's control. Our study aims at exploring this social stigma in five local health systems of Nicaragua, prior to implementing interventions to reduce it. METHODS: Through in-depth interviews and focus groups involving stakeholders in the care of people affected by tuberculosis (PATBs), we analysed interactions between PATBs and family members, first line government health services' personnel, and community members. RESULTS: According to our results, the interaction between stakeholders and PATBs can be described as the intersection between two sets of contradictory feelings and attitudes: (a) feelings of affection and supportive attitudes toward PATBs opposed to the fear of being infected or that PATBs will infect others and, (b) confidence in PATBs considered to be unlucky opposed to mistrust of PATBs considered to be negligent. PATBs react against this mainly by hiding their condition which leads them to a, loss of confidence and depression. This intricate group of feelings and attitudes is influenced by two sets of determinants related to domination and power between stakeholders and issues of knowledge and information. CONCLUSION: Analysing tuberculosis-related social stigma as a social process enabled us to better understand some key social structural factors of health care system's organisation and identify locally acceptable interventions to reduce such stigma. The fact of analysing, in a more thorough study, some interventions in the currently changing social structural context of health care systems in Nicaragua will give us a better insight into the relevance of our analysis and the interventions' effectiveness in reducing the social stigma of tuberculosis."
29689054,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Community health worker (CHW) interventions are a successful strategy to promote health among HIV-negative and persons living with HIV (PLWH). Psychosocial factors are critical dimensions of HIV/AIDS care contributing to prognosis of the disease, yet it is unclear how CHW interventions improve psychosocial outcomes in PLWH. The purpose of this study was to critically appraise the types, scope, and nature of CHW interventions designed to address psychosocial outcomes in PLWH. METHODS: We performed database searches-PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane-to identify randomized controlled trials published in English before April 2017. Fourteen articles met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Half of the studies were conducted in the United States. Social cognitive theory was used more than once in nine theory-guided studies. CHW interventions were largely focused on reducing depression (n = 6) or stigma related to HIV (n = 4), or promoting quality of life (n = 4), social support (n = 4), and self-efficacy (n = 4). Didactic methods and role-playing were used to train CHWs. CHWs played multiple roles in delivering intervention, including a counselor and a supporter (n = 10), educator (n = 5), or a navigator (n = 3). CHW intervention fidelity was assessed in 4 studies. Five studies found positive changes in six psychosocial outcomes including quality of life (2 of 4) and self-efficacy (2 of 4). CHW interventions had no effect on social support in 2 of 4 studies, and stigma in 3 of 4 studies. None of the CHW interventions were successful in reducing depressive symptoms among PLWH. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence partially supported the use of CHWs in promoting psychosocial outcomes in PLWH. Future CHW intervention should be expanded in scope to address key psychosocial determinants of HIV/AIDS outcomes such as health literacy. Further, fidelity measures should be incorporated into intervention delivery."
28413421,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This study intended to determine the effects of Vitamin D and calcium-Vitamin D in treating leg cramps in pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted as a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial on 126 participants, 18-35-year-old pregnant women with a minimum of two leg cramps per week who were referred to health-care centers in Tabriz-Iran in 2013. The participants were allocated to three 42 member groups using a randomized block design. For 42 days, the intervention groups took a 1000 unit Vitamin D pill or 300 mg calcium carbonate plus a 1000 unit Vitamin D pill, and the control group received a placebo pill every day. The participants were evaluated with regard to the frequency, length, and pain intensity of leg cramps during the week before and during the 3(rd) and 6(th) week of the intervention. The ANCOVA and repeated measurement test were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Results showed that controlling for the effects before the intervention, calcium-Vitamin D, and Vitamin D supplements had no effect on the frequency, length, and pain intensity of leg cramps. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the calcium-Vitamin D and the Vitamin D supplements have no effect on the frequency, length, and pain intensity of leg cramps during the 6 weeks of the study."
22218587,0,a,"This paper was prepared for the Employment Conditions and Health Inequalities Knowledge Network (EMCONET), part of the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. We describe the Brazilian context of employment conditions, labor conditions and health, their characteristics and causal relationships. The social, political and economic factors that influence these relationships are also presented with an emphasis on social inequalities, and how they are reproduced within the labor market and thereby affect the health and wellbeing of workers. A literature review was conducted in SciELO, LILACS, Google and Google Scholar, MEDLINE and the CAPES Brazilian thesis database. We observed that there are more workers operating in the informal sector than in the formal sector and these former have no social insurance or any other social benefits. Work conditions and health are poor in both informal and formal enterprises since health and safety labor norms are not effective. The involvement of social movements and labor unions in the elaboration and management of workers' health polices and programs with universal coverage, is a promising initiative that is underway nationwide."
17371603,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Subjective risk factor perception is an important component of the motivation to change unhealthy life styles. While prior studies assessed cardiovascular risk factor knowledge, little is known about determinants of the individual perception of stroke risk. METHODS: Survey by mailed questionnaire among 1483 participants of a prior public stroke campaign in Germany. Participants had been informed about their individual stroke risk based on the Framingham stroke risk score. Stroke risk factor knowledge, perception of lifetime stroke risk and risk factor status were included in the questionnaire, and the determinants of good risk factor knowledge and high stroke risk perception were identified using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Overall stroke risk factor knowledge was good with 67-96% of the participants recognizing established risk factors. The two exceptions were diabetes (recognized by 49%) and myocardial infarction (57%). Knowledge of a specific factor was superior among those affected by it. 13% of all participants considered themselves of having a high stroke risk, 55% indicated a moderate risk. All major risk factors contributed significantly to the perception of being at high stroke risk, but the effects of age, sex and education were non-significant. Poor self-rated health was additionally associated with high individual stroke risk perception. CONCLUSION: Stroke risk factor knowledge was high in this study. The self perception of an increased stroke risk was associated with established risk factors as well as low perception of general health."
19077263,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The former soviet Republic of Armenia entered a turbulent and long-lasting economic transition when it declared its independence in 1991. This analysis sought to identify the determinants of poor self-rated health as an indirect measure of health status and mortality prognosis in an adult female population during a period of socio-economic transition in Armenia. METHODS: Differences in self-rated health in women respondents were analyzed along three main dimensions: social, behavioral/attitudinal, and psychological. The data used were generated from cross-sectional household health surveys conducted in Armavir marz in 2001 and 2004. The surveys utilized the same instruments and study design (probability proportional to size, multistage cluster sampling with a combination of interviewer-administered and self-administered surveys) and generated two independent samples of households representative of Armavir marz. Binary logistic regression models with self-rated health as the outcome were fitted to the 2001 and 2004 datasets and a combined 2001/2004 dataset. RESULTS: Overall, 2 038 women aged 18 and over participated in the two surveys (1 019 in each). The rate of perceived ""poor"" health was relatively high in both surveys: 38.1% in 2001 and 27.0% in 2004. The sets of independent predictors of poor self-rated health were similar in all three models and included severe and moderate material deprivation, probable and possible depression, low level of education, and having ever smoked. These predictors mediated the effect of women's economic activity (including unemployment), ethnicity, low access to/utilization of healthcare services, and living alone on self-rated health. CONCLUSION: Material deprivation was the most influential predictor of self-rated health. Thus, social reforms to decrease the gap between the rich and poor are recommended as a powerful tool for reducing health inequalities and improving the health status of the population."
16963673,1,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible role of low socioeconomic status (SES) as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) among obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients requiring treatment. DESIGN: Polysomnographic and demographic characteristics and associated morbidity were measured in 686 prospectively recruited adult OSAS patients from two regions in Israel. SETTING: Two university-affiliated sleep laboratories. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The multiple logistic regression (after adjusting for gender, body mass index [BMI], and smoking) revealed that the following are independent determinants for CVD in OSAS patients requiring treatment: each decrease in income level category (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 1.7), age > or = 1 year (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.1), hypertension (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.1), and hyperlipidemia (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 5.8); area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) = 81.9%. The multivariate determinants describing the low-SES OSAS patients included: minorities and immigrants combined (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 12), female gender (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.9), increased BMI (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.9), unmarried status (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.1), and years of education (> or = 1 year) [OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7 to 0.8]; area under the ROC = 78.1%. CONCLUSION: In addition to the already known traditional risk factors, low SES was found to be a novel independent risk factor for CVD among adult OSAS patients requiring treatment."
23131600,0,a,"Cognitive reserve is thought to reflect life experiences. Which experiences contribute to reserve and their relative importance is not understood. Subjects were 652 autopsied cases from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study. Reserve was defined as the residual variance of the regressions of cognitive factors on brain pathology and was captured in a latent variable that was regressed on potential determinants of reserve. Neuropathology variables included Alzheimer's disease markers, Lewy bodies, infarcts, microinfarcts, and brain weight. Cognition was measured with six cognitive domain scores. Determinants of reserve were socioeconomic status (SES), education, leisure cognitive activities at age 40 (CA40) and at study enrollment (CAbaseline) in late life. The four exogenous predictors of reserve were weakly to moderately inter-correlated. In a multivariate model, all except SES had statistically significant effects on Reserve, the strongest of which were CA40 (beta = .31) and CAbaseline (beta = .28). The Education effect was negative in the full model (beta = -.25). Results suggest that leisure cognitive activities throughout adulthood are more important than education in determining reserve. Discrepancies between cognitive activity and education may be informative in estimating late life reserve."
20879964,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although limited health literacy is a barrier to disease management and has been associated with poor glycemic control, the mechanisms underlying the relationships between health literacy and diabetes outcomes are unknown. We examined the relationships between health literacy, determinants of diabetes self-care, and glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Patients with diabetes were recruited from an outpatient primary care clinic. We collected information on demographics, health literacy, diabetes knowledge, diabetes fatalism, social support, and diabetes self-care, and hemoglobin A1c values were extracted from the medical record. Structural equation models tested the predicted pathways linking health literacy to diabetes self-care and glycemic control. RESULTS: No direct relationship was observed between health literacy and diabetes self-care or glycemic control. Health literacy had a direct effect on social support (r = -0.20, P < 0.05) and through social support had an indirect effect on diabetes self-care (r = -0.07) and on glycemic control (r = -0.01). More diabetes knowledge (r = 0.22, P < 0.05), less fatalism (r = -0.22, P < 0.05), and more social support (r = 0.27, P < 0.01) were independent, direct predictors of diabetes self-care and through self-care were related to glycemic control (r = -0.20, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest health literacy has an indirect effect on diabetes self-care and glycemic control through its association with social support. This suggests that for patients with limited health literacy, enhancing social support would facilitate diabetes self-care and improved glycemic control."
31526508,0,a,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to assess housing and food-related stress in transgender and cisgender adults in the United States. METHODS: Data from the 2014 and 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analyzed for 53,060 adults who responded to the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity module and the Social Context module. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the association of gender identity with housing and food-related stress. RESULTS: There were no significant differences by gender identity in the odds of experiencing housing or food-related stress. A sensitivity analysis revealed that with a broader definition of food-related stress, transgender individuals had higher odds of experiencing food-related stress compared with cisgender individuals. The sample of transgender individuals who experienced food-related stress were young, single, racially diverse, sexual minorities, and the majority had a high school degree or less. Similarly, most transgender individuals who experienced housing-related stress were single, sexual minorities, and had a high school degree or less. CONCLUSIONS: More precise assessments of housing and food insecurity among probability-based samples of transgender individuals are needed to fully understand housing and food-related instability and the stress associated with these experiences."
19288341,1,a,"In this paper, we investigate the intersections of gender, health and human rights in sites of political exclusion. We apply the political theory of Giorgio Agamben on 'states of exception', seeking to better understand how the recent 'war on terror', that seemingly knows no limits of time or space, is driving health outcomes in refugee and Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps. Reproductive health, militarization, and gender-based violence in camps are explored in depth. The evidence presented reveals a number of contradictions of refugee and IDP camps, further highlighting the need for a more rights based humanitarianism. We conclude that foregrounding states of exception, as a way of understanding current gender dynamics in the social determinants of health, is both epidemiologically necessary and conceptually useful. We find that, in these sites of exclusion, the indispensability of a human rights approach to gender and health equity issues is revealed most directly. Furthermore, we are able to make new connections between the 'crisis of humanitarianism', gender, and health."
15772506,1,a,"Distance education offers many advantages to students, faculty, and educational institutions. Despite these advantages, distance education classes historically have higher dropout rates than do the courses taught in the traditional, face-to-face setting. Current research includes information related to technology, teaching tips, and resources for these extended learning opportunities. However, information related to student success in distance education is limited and success indicators are poorly defined. Current studies on success indicators often lack a defining framework that provides an opportunity for study replication and strengthens the credibility of study findings. An empirical model developed by Powell et al divides potential determinants of success into three categories. This literature review identifies indicators in each category and indicates a need to revise the current framework to include technology as a fourth category. The revised framework should provide a basis for additional research in this rapidly growing area."
16953359,1,a,"The article provides an overview of the contemporary literature on the social and psychological factors which are associated with migration. Derived from the operationalisation of ""migration"" and an examination of the methodological peculiarities of migration research, a (transactional) stress model of migration is proposed incorporating potentially stress-eliciting influences of migration including occupational pressures, social isolation and/or family-related problems and their impact on psychological and physical health. There are inconsistencies in the findings regarding psychological health, which can in part be explained through the phenomena of the ""healthy migrant effect"", duration of stay in the host culture or the culture-specificity. Moreover, a discussion is provided of the extent that disorders associated with differentially stressed migrants will be manifested in the health care system. Finally, concluding remarks are offered together with a short discussion of the implication of these findings for future research and social and health policy decision-making."
30901698,0,a,"This research study focused on the optimization of the synthesis of carbon-doped nano-MgO (C-MgO) and the investigation of its catalytic capacity in a catalytic ozonation process (COP) for the removal of humic acid (HA). Characterization analyses, including SEM, EDX, XRD, BET, and photoluminescence test showed that the C-MgO was successfully synthesized. L8 orthogonal arrays according to the Taguchi methodology optimized the synthesis of the C-MgO as follows: sucrose to MgO ratio=0.5, sonication time=15min, calcination temperature=400 degrees C and pH=10.5. A central composite design based on response surface methodology was employed to optimize and model the COP in the removal of HA. A quadratic polynomial model with p-value < 0.0001 and R(2)=0.9988 showed a better fit to experimental responses. The optimum levels of the studied parameters in the COP based on the predictive model were obtained as follows: pH=9.5, reaction time=12min, catalyst dose=1g/L, and HA concentration=5mg/L. The HA mineralization was determined to be 86.8% at the 100min reaction time. Additionally, the COP exhibited 34% synergistic effect and the kinetic rate constant of 0.1898 min(-1) in the HA removal. The presence of tert-butanol, methanol, salicylic acid, and some anions did not significantly affect the removal of the HA in the COP. From a practical view, this report indicated that the C-MgO catalyst could be potentially applied in the COP for the treatment of the water having high concentrations of HA substances."
18718651,1,a,"BACKGROUND: It is currently discussed whether allergic sensitization may start in utero under the influence of the maternal immune system and environmental determinants. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between allergen-specific cord blood (CB) IgE levels, parental sensitization, CB cytokine production, and environmental influences. METHODS: As part of an ongoing multicenter birth cohort study, allergen-specific IgE antibodies against 20 common seasonal, perennial, and food allergens were measured in blood samples from 922 neonates, 922 mothers, and 835 fathers. Supernatants from stimulated CB cells were assessed for the production of IL-5, IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TNF-alpha. RESULTS: Allergen-specific IgE antibodies were detectable in 23.9% of newborns. Contamination with maternal serum was excluded by several means of analyses, including the absence of IgA antibodies. Clear correlation between maternal and fetal IgE was found only for hen's egg, cow's milk, and soybean allergen. Fetal IgE correlated negatively with the level of IFN-gamma production, but not with IL-5 and IL-10. CONCLUSION: Allergen-specific IgE antibodies most probably of fetal origin are detectable in CB and correlate with a lowered CB IFN-gamma production."
29254546,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In 2010 Mexican health authorities enacted an antibiotic sale, prescription, and dispensation bill that increased the presence of a new kind of ambulatory care provider, the doctors adjacent to private pharmacies (DAPPs). OBJECTIVES: To analyze how DAPPs' presence in the Mexican ambulatory care market has modified health care seekers' behavior following a two-stage health care provider selection decision process. METHODS: The first stage focuses on individuals' propensity to captivity to the health care system structure before 2010. The second stage analyzes individuals' medical provider selection in a health system including DAPPs. This two-stage process analysis allowed us not only to show the determinants of each part in the decision process but also to understand the overall picture of DAPPs' impact in both the Mexican health care system and health care seekers, taking into account conditions such as the origins, evolution, and context of this new provider. We used data from individuals (N = 97,549) participating in the Mexican National Survey of Health and Nutrition in 2012. RESULTS: We found that DAPPs have become not only a widely accepted but also a preferred option among the Mexican ambulatory care providers that follow no specific income-level population user group (in spite of its original low-income population target). Our results showed DAPPs as an urban and rapidly expanded phenomenon, presumably keeping the growing pace of new communities and adapting to demographic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals opt for DAPPs when they look for health care: in a nearby provider, for either the most recent or common ailments, and in an urban setting; regardless of most socioeconomic background. The relevance of location and accessibility variables in our study provides evidence of the role taken by this provider in the Mexican health care system."
26636498,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore possible environmental factors behind the regional differences in the incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: All of the patients diagnosed with IBD who were aged 0 to 14 years in Finland between 1987 and 2003 were identified from the Social Insurance Institution database. Finland was divided into squares of 250 x 250 m, and spatial variations of incidence rates were evaluated accordingly. The role of the environmental determinants (pediatric population density, agricultural industry, chemical contaminants of tap water and proximity to the sea or paper mills) in the geographic variations of the incidence rates was evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period, the overall incidence of pediatric IBD was 6.5 of 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.1-6.9). The incidence in very sparsely populated areas (</=10 person-years per 250 x 250 m) was 9.2 of 100,000 (95% CI 6.3-13.1) and 5.6 of 100,000 (95% CI 4.8-6.4) in the districts with the highest population density (>800 person-years per 250 x 250 m). A nonsignificant trend toward the same direction was also seen for ulcerative colitis (trend P = 0.09). Chemical contaminant concentrations of tap water, residence near the seaside, or proximity to paper mills were not associated with the incidence of pediatric IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest higher incidence rates of pediatric IBD in the districts with low compared with high density of child population, but the differences cannot be explained by variations in the environmental exposures evaluated here."
31619204,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Neck and shoulder pain is relatively common among children and teenagers and has a negative impact on their physical and psychological health. This study was carried out to assess the prevalence of neck and shoulder pain among elementary school students, and to investigate the relationship between this pain and its risk factors. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 693 elementary school students aged 7 to 12 years from Hamadan city, located in western Iran, were selected through the multistage cluster random sampling method. Data were collected through interviews and questionnaires. For the social and psychological variables, the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used. For assessing each student's posture, an observational checklist, the Rapid Upper Limbs Assessment (RULA), was used. The data was analyzed using the unadjusted (univariate) and adjusted (multivariate) logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of the neck pain was slightly higher than that of shoulder pain. The prevalence reported over a month was 35.8 and 30.9% for neck and shoulder pain, respectively. The logistic regression analyses showed that, very high desk height (odds ratio (OR) =1.96, 95% confidence interval CI: 1.02-3.74), backward seat pan inclination (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.37-3.24), forward seat pan inclination (OR = 3.12, 95% CI:1.46-6.68), difficulty in viewing the board (OR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.10-5.84), too much homework (OR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.49-4.51), RULA score at level III (OR = 2.88, 95% CI:1.64-5.05), and RULA score at level IV (OR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.72-5.63) increased the risk of neck pain independently. On the other hand, sitting on desk and seat (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.39-0.91) and laying position for doing homework (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.34-0.81) reduced the related risk. Very short desk height (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.26-4.61) and too much homework (OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.10-3.42) increased the risk of shoulder pain. CONCLUSION: The elementary school students reported a high prevalence of shoulder and neck pain. This study found that improper sitting positions, as well as physical factors such as the school furniture, too much homework, and difficulty in viewing the classroom board, were associated with pain. Proper interventions considering the risk factors assessed in this study, are suggested."
19067262,1,a,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the use of psychotropic drugs and alcohol among non-institutionalised elderly adults in Germany. METHODS: Using data from the 1998 German National Health Interview and Examination Survey, we analysed patterns of current psychotropic drug and alcohol use among 726 male and 879 female survey participants between the ages of 60 and 79. Multivariable regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with alcohol consumption and psychotropic drug use. RESULTS: The overall weighted last-week prevalence was 20.1% for the use of psychotropic drugs, 47.3% for the use of alcohol, 15.1% for risky drinking, and 7.6% for combined psychotropic drug and alcohol use. Factors significantly related to psychotropic drug use included female sex, older age, poor health status and polypharmacy. Male sex, smoking, higher social status, better health status and living alone were determinants of alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other European countries, overall psychotropic drug use among the elderly in Germany is slightly lower, whereas alcohol use as risky drinking and concurrent use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs are highly prevalent. It should be of particular concern to health professionals that people at high risk for psychotropic drug use include the most vulnerable subgroups among the elderly."
17242835,1,a,"Agriculture and health are linked in many ways. First, agriculture is essential for good health: it produces the world's food, fibre and materials for shelter; in many countries it is also an important source of livelihood among the poor. At the same time, agriculture can be linked with poor health, including malnutrition, malaria, foodborne illnesses, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), livestock-related diseases, chronic diseases and occupational ill-health. Health also affects agriculture: people's health status influences the demand for agricultural outputs, and in agricultural communities, poor health reduces work performance, reducing income and productivity and perpetuating a downward spiral into ill-health. This paper presents an overview of the bidirectional links between agriculture and health with a focus on the developing world. It develops a conceptual framework that brings together the various links between agriculture and health into a single broad framework. The framework comprises the core components of the agricultural supply chain (producers, systems and outputs), key health concerns and the mechanisms of common interaction between the agricultural and health components: income, labour, environment and access -- all key social determinants of health. These links between agriculture and health present an opportunity for the two sectors to work together to find solutions to each other's problems. Yet the health and agricultural sectors remain poorly coordinated. Leadership from global health and agricultural institutions is needed to build policies and good governance to facilitate integration, while capacity building is needed at all levels to help translate the conceptual links into comprehensive action on the ground. Health and agricultural researchers likewise need to work more closely together to achieve common goals."
28625554,0,a,"Rates of maternal morbidity and mortality are rising in the United States. Non-Hispanic Black women are at highest risk for these outcomes compared to those of other race/ethnicities. Black women are also more likely to be late to prenatal care or be inadequate users of prenatal care. Prenatal care can engage those at risk and potentially influence perinatal outcomes but further research on the link between prenatal care and maternal outcomes is needed. The objective of this article is to review literature illuminating the relationship between prenatal care utilization, social determinants of health, and racial disparities in maternal outcome. We present a theoretical framework connecting the complex factors that may link race, social context, prenatal care utilization, and maternal morbidity/mortality. Prenatal care innovations showing potential to engage with the social determinants of maternal health and address disparities and priorities for future research are reviewed."
18093027,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Empirical research suggests that social disadvantage has a negative effect on the development of language, and related cognitive skills such as reading. There is, however, no corresponding body of research on the impact of social disadvantage on motor development. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of social disadvantage on motor development in young children. In addition, we explored a possible link between an early neuromotor indicator and attainments in language, and reading. METHODS: The Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure was used to identify two contrasting districts based on a composite measure of social disadvantage. We investigated the effect of social disadvantage on the motor attainments of a sample of 239 children aged 4-5 years, and 276 children aged 7-8 years attending mainstream schools in each district using a standardised motor assessment battery, and a motor neurodevelopmental measure. We used standardised receptive language and reading assessments to evaluate possible associations between motor and language/reading attainments. RESULTS: There was a significant negative effect of social disadvantage on motor skills, for both age groups, and for both males and females. A similar negative effect of social disadvantage on attainments in language, and reading was also found. Children from areas of social disadvantage had significant deficits in motor and receptive language attainments relative to their more advantaged peers. In addition, we revealed a significant predictive relationship between a neurodevelopmental measure of early motor development and reading attainment. CONCLUSIONS: Children growing up in socially disadvantaged areas may be at particular risk of motor, including neurodevelopmental, delay, as well as language and reading difficulties. The determinants of motor and neuromotor deficits in children from disadvantaged backgrounds should be explored, and the relationship between early neuromotor development and language/reading development requires further investigation."
19628619,1,a,"The term 'social vaccine' is designed to encourage the biomedically orientated health sector to recognize the legitimacy of action on the distal social and economic determinants of health. It is proposed as a term to assist the health promotion movement in arguing for a social view of health which is so often counter to medical and popular conceptions of health. The idea of a social vaccine builds on a long tradition in social medicine as well as on a biomedical tradition of preventing illness through vaccines that protect against disease. Social vaccines would be promoted as a means to encourage popular mobilization and advocacy to change the social and economic structural conditions that render people and communities vulnerable to disease. They would facilitate social and political processes that develop popular and political will to protect and promote health through action (especially governments prepared to intervene and regulate to protect community health) on the social and economic determinants. Examples provided for the effects of social vaccines are: restoring land ownership to Indigenous peoples, regulating the advertising of harmful products and progressive taxation for universal social protection. Social vaccines require more research to improve understanding of social and political processes that are likely to improve health equity worldwide. The vaccine metaphor should be helpful in arguing for increased action on the social determinants of health."
18030822,1,a,"BACKGROUND: In 2006, the city of Milwaukee ranked worse than any Wisconsin county for health outcomes and worse than all but 1 county for health determinants. METHODS: To further examine disparities in health, Milwaukee city ZIP codes were stratified into 3 groups (lower, middle, and upper) by socioeconomic status (SES). Health determinants (15 measures) and health outcomes (2 measures) were compared across these ZIP code groups, and to the rest of Wisconsin. RESULTS: The risk ratio for the lower SES group in comparison to the upper SES group was at least 2.0 for 5 of the 17 measures examined, and was at least 1.5 for 13 of the 17 measures. The upper SES group in Milwaukee, while the healthiest in the city, was worse than the state average in 6 measures. CONCLUSIONS: Large health disparities within the city of Milwaukee are associated with geographic regions of differing socioeconomic status. As the state's largest urban center, Milwaukee's relatively poor health and significant health disparities have a considerable impact on the overall health of the state. To improve population health in Wisconsin, substantial efforts and resources are needed to address these disparities, and their related upstream factors."
10795960,1,a,"This paper is an introduction to the various contributions in this special issue of Social Science & Medicine which are an attempt to synthesise the main debates of the 2nd European Conference on Social and Behavioural Research on AIDS held in Paris, in January 1998. The paper discusses how the recent advent of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) and new trends in the epidemic (its concentration in the socially most vulnerable groups and countries) have affected the research agenda of European social and behavioural sciences (SBS) in HIV/AIDS. Questions which had already been thoroughly studied by SBS (like determinants of HIV-related risk behaviours, or impact of gender and socio-economic inequities as well as discrimination on the diffusion of HIV) will have to be ""revisited"" in light of these recent changes. New issues (such as risk behaviours among already infected patients. impact of therapeutic advances on psychosocial and daily life management of their disease by people living with HIV/AIDS, adherence to treatment, or ""normalisation"" of AIDS public policies) will have to be strongly and quickly dealt with, in order for SSB to keep the pace with the rapid evolution of the epidemic and of the societal responses to it. Finally, the paper argues that to face these challenges, new theoretical and methodological advances will have to go beyond the classical oppositions in internal debates among SSB between individualistic and holistic approaches, or between radical criticism of the existing state of the world and practical involvement in public health decision-making."
15627221,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Social context (demographic, socioeconomic, macroeconomic, and sociopolitical features of the environment) influences the epidemiology and consequences of individual behaviors that affect health outcomes. This article examines the role of social context in heterosexual networks that facilitate the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), particularly in relation to persistent racial disparities in rates of STIs in the United States. METHODS: Review of the medical, public health, and social science literature. RESULTS: Contextual factors, such as poverty, discrimination, epidemiology of illicit drug use in the community, ratio of men to women, incarceration rates, and racial segregation, influence sexual behavior and sexual networks directly and indirectly through a variety of mechanisms. Disparities in these contextual features likely contribute substantially to the persistence of marked racial disparities in rates of STIs. CONCLUSIONS: Given the importance of contextual factors and the sharply contrasting social contexts for blacks and whites, exclusive emphasis on individual risk factors and determinants is unlikely to produce solutions that will significantly decrease HIV rates among blacks. Effective HIV prevention in this population will require multidisciplinary research to address the contextual factors that promote patterns of sexual networks that facilitate transmission of STIs."
26849539,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Research on physical activity in relation to obesity gradually becomes more focused on environmental determinants, which can potentially influence people's health choices. The present article addresses the topic of physical activity from a wider sociological perspective. Our pilot study was designed with the objective of testing the applicability of a method included in the EC 6th Framework Programme EURO-PREVOB, in the Czech context. The method examines specific determinants of the built environment that can have an impact on physical activity at the population level. In addition, the study aims to analyze possible differences in built environment indicators and their relation to the physical activity of people living in neighbourhoods with areas of varying socioeconomic status. METHODS: The field study was carried out in the city of Brno, Czech Republic, in 5 neighbourhood quintiles, i.e. areas divided according to the socioeconomic status of local residents. In each quintile, we evaluated the quality of the built environment according to the quality, aesthetics and safety of segregated cycle facilities, playgrounds/playing areas, public open spaces, marked road crossings and pavements as well as signs of incivilities and devastation. RESULTS: Between the five quintiles, significant differences were found in the quality of parks and playgrounds/playing areas, pavements, marking of pedestrian crossings, and in general aesthetics, i.e. signs of incivilities and devastation of the built environment. No differences were found in the quality and use of cycle facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The method we used for the evaluation of the built environment proved highly applicable in Czech populated areas. Monitoring of built environment indicators in the Czech Republic should provide a basis for health maps, showing potential associations between the prevalence of high-incidence, non-infectious diseases and various social determinants of physical activity. This information might help in achieving an improvement in these determinants at a community level and promoting an increase in physical activity at the population level."
19573222,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Identification of subpopulations at high risk of overweight and obesity is crucial for prevention and management of obesity in different socioeconomic status (SES) categories. The objective of the study was to describe disparities in the prevalence of overweight and obesity across socioeconomic status (SES) groups in 18-74 year-old French adults. METHODS: Analyses were based on a multistage stratified random sample of non-institutionalized adults aged 18-74-years-old from the French Nutrition and Health Survey (ENNS), a cross-sectional national survey carried out in 2006/2007. Collected data included measured anthropometry (weight, height and waist circumference (WC)), demographic and SES data (occupation, education and frequency of holiday trips as a marker of family income). SES factors associated with overweight (BMI > or = 25) and central obesity (WC above gender-specific references) were identified using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Almost half (49.3%) of French adults were overweight or obese and 16.9% were obese. In men, the risk of overall overweight or obesity was associated with occupation (p < 0.05), whereas the risk of central obesity was independently associated with occupation (p < 0.05) and frequency of holiday trips (p < 0.01). In women, both overall and central overweight and obesity were independently associated with educational level (respectively p < 10(-3) and p < 10(-3)) and frequency of holiday trips (respectively p < 0.05 and p < 10-3). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was found to be similar to that of several neighbouring western European countries, and lower than the UK and eastern Europe. Risk of being overweight or obese varied across SES groups both in men and women, but associations were different between men and women, indicating differing determinants."
19482785,1,a,"Two fundamental determinants of men's health are confronted-racism and sexism-that the authors believe underlie many of the health disparities documented between women and men and place men of color at particular disadvantage in U.S. society. In doing so, the authors contend that race and gender, as well as racism and sexism, are social constructs and, therefore, amenable to change. They hope to allay concerns that gains in the health of men will come at the expense of continued advances in the health of women. Instead, by better understanding how the harsh intersections of racism and sexism have contorted roles for men of color and damaged their social ties, a healing process in intimate relationships, extended families, and entire communities may be fostered. Only by reforming historical injustices and reuniting men with their partners, families, and communities will sustained improvements in their health and well-being be realized."
28433993,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Associations of specific types of stress with increased food intake and subsequent weight gain have been demonstrated in animal models as well as in experimental and epidemiological studies on humans. This study explores the research question of to what extent potentially obesity-related factors determine perceived stress in individuals with obesity. METHODS: N = 547 individuals with obesity participated in a cross-sectional study assessing perceived stress as the outcome variable and potential determinants of stress related to obesity. Based on the available evidence, a five factorial model of 'obesity-related obesogenic stressors' was hypothesized, including the dimensions, 'drive for thinness', 'impulse regulation', 'ineffectiveness', 'social insecurity', and 'body dissatisfaction'. The model was tested using multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: The five factorial model of 'potentially obesity-related stressors' resulted in a total variance explanation of adjusted R(2) = 0.616 for males and adjusted R(2) = 0.595 for females for perceived stress. The relative variance contribution of the five included factors differed substantially for the two sexes. CONCLUSION: The findings of this cross-sectional study support the hypothesized, potentially obesity-related factors: 'drive for thinness', 'impulse regulation', 'ineffectiveness', 'social insecurity', and 'body dissatisfaction' as relevant determinants of perceived stress in individuals with obesity."
28451549,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Mixed health care systems to work simultaneously on both public and private facilities, is common today. This phenomenon referred to as dual practice (DP), has potential implications for access, quality, cost and equity of health services. This paper aimed to review systematically studies that assess the implications of DP among health workers. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane library were searched for obtaining published literature between Feb 1990 and May 2014. Google and Google Scholars, organizational websites, and reference lists of relevant papers searched to get grey literature. Only studies concentrated on consequences and impacts of DP among health professionals and conducted using ""randomized controlled trials"", ""non-randomized controlled trials"", ""controlled before and after studies"", or ""interrupted time series"" were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: From 3242 records, we focused on 19 studies, which aimed to assess effects and impacts of dual practice. After that, the current understanding of DP positive and negative implications was categorized and discussed based on two perspectives. CONCLUSION: There has been a propensity to over-reliance on theoretical methods in predicting the implications of this phenomenon. Almost all of the mentioned implications are based on theoretical predictions undermined in the broader literature. Furthermore, assessing the current literature showed positive and negative impacts of DP on different parts of the health system and various dimensions of service delivery. These implications are contexted specific and may vary from system to system."
29177050,0,a,"Objective: The effects of regular exercise on the health promotion of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been well documented. The present study investigated the long-term effects of regular exercise training on biological indicators among these patients. Methods: In this quasi-experimental trial with pretest-post-test design, 65 patients with T2DM aged 33-69 years (experiment (35), control (30)) participated. After 8 years of conducting the program, the data on 30 patients (experiment (15), control (15)) were entered into analysis. The training program included aerobic exercise three sessions per week, 90 min, 50%-80% VO2max. Before and after the intervention, the biological indicators (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI) and VO2max) were measured. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of covariance. Results: Our long-term exercise training program had a significant effect on HbA1C, BMI and Vo2max (P<0.05). Compared with patients in the control group, HbA1c was significantly reduced and BMI and VO2max were significantly improved among the experiment group. Conclusions: Long-term regular physical activity training was found to be helpful in improving glycemic control, body composition and cardiovascular fitness among patients with T2DM. Long-term continuous physical activity offsets the deteriorations of biological indicators found in the control group. Further research, with a particular focus on practical and real-world programming, is needed to determine the responsive health outcomes of such long-term programs on the patients."
12027273,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to characterise the epidemiological and nutritional transition and their determinants in Mexico. DESIGN: Age-adjusted standardised mortality rates (SMRs) due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), diabetes mellitus and hypertension were calculated for 1980-1998. Changes in the prevalences of overweight and obesity in women and children and of dietary intake from 1988 to 1999 were also used in the analysis. Quantities of food groups purchased by adult equivalent (AE) and food expenditures away from home between 1984 and 1989 were used to assess trends. All information was analysed at the national and regional levels, and by urban and rural areas. RESULTS: SMR for diabetes, AMI and hypertension increased dramatically parallel to obesity at the national and regional levels. Fat intake in women and the purchase of refined carbohydrates, including soda, also increased. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that obesity is playing a role in the increased SMRs of diabetes, AMI and hypertension in Mexico. Total energy dietary intake and food purchase data could not explain the rise in the prevalence of obesity. The increases in fat intake and the purchase of refined carbohydrates may be risk factors for increased mortality. Information on physical activity was not available. CONCLUSION: SMRs due to diabetes, hypertension and AMI have increased dramatically in parallel with the prevalence of obesity; therefore actions should be taken for the prevention of obesity. Reliable information about food consumption and physical activity is required to assess their specific roles in the aetiology of obesity."
11310574,1,a,"Although older persons' engagement in postretirement employment has been perceived to foster successful aging, the relationship between postretirement employment and elders' perceived quality of life has not been empirically tested. This article analyzes the effects of postretirement employment on older women's life satisfaction by comparing those who continued to work or (re)entered the labor market with those who did not engage in paid work after the receipt of their first Social Security benefits. The findings show that postretirement employment in itself does not contribute to older women's life satisfaction, but financial resources and especially the older women's concerns about their own financial situation are potent determinants of their life satisfaction. The need to incorporate the role of financial resources and subjective financial satisfaction in the theoretical framework for elders' perceived quality of life is discussed."
28278017,0,a,"We present findings of a qualitative study exploring what constitutes relevant health promotion initiatives for immigrant mothers of children with developmental disabilities. We apply a social ecological approach, with a focus on gender-specific and transformative health promotion, to examine factors impacting mothers' health and wellbeing. Twenty-eight semi-structured and open-ended interviews were conducted with immigrant mothers in the greater Toronto area, Canada. Mothers identified facilitators, challenges, and strategies for their health promotion, providing relevant insights for meaningful intervention. Our findings show that immigrant mothers' health is influenced by intersecting social determinants of health, including migration status, gender, and disability."
12038742,1,a,"The authors describe the use of a stress process model by the East Side Village Health Worker Partnership (ESVHWP), a project of the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center, as a framework for understanding social determinants of health. Specifically, the authors describe the development by the ESVHWP Steering Committee of a context-specific stress process model for east side Detroit residents. The authors examine data from in-depth interviews to illuminate actions taken by community members to reduce stressors or minimize their impact on health. Finally, the authors describe the use of this context-specific stress process model and data gathered regarding actions to address community stressors to inform the development of interventions by the ESVHWP to reduce stressors or strengthen the conditioning factors that reduce the impact of stress on health. On the basis of these results, the authors discuss opportunities and challenges for partnership approaches to addressing social determinants of health in urban communities."
28693602,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Socio demographic factors besides dietary factors play important role in determining the health status of an individual. Health and nutritional Intervention programs stand a greater chance of success if planned, keeping the socio demographic characteristics of a certain population in focus. The present study was conducted to identify those socio demographic determinants which have a significant association with poor nutritional status in adolescent girls belonging to economically deprived households of Lahore. METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical study of 140 adolescent girls living in the peri urban communities of Lahore was conducted. Socioeconomic and demographic data of the participants was recorded through a pretested questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI), a commonly used anthropometric measurement was taken as an indicator of nutritional status. Below normal (<18.5 m2) BMI was considered a benchmark of malnutrition in adolescent girls. Frequencies and percentages for socio demographic variables were calculated and Fisher Exact test was used to find out the association of nutritional status with socio-demographic predictors. Stepwise backward logistic regression analysis was then run to identify the most significant determinants associated with poor nutritional status in the adolescents. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Chronic energy deficiency was highly prevalent among adolescent girls, 58% had BMI < 18.5 m2. Binary regression analysis result showed that the participants who lived in rented houses (AOR = 3.513; 95% CI = 1.366 to 9.031) who fell ill frequently (AOR = 2.996; 95% CI = 1.198 to 7.491) whose fathers were illiterate (AOR = 2.941; 95% CI = 1.187 to 7.287) were at greater odds of having poor nutritional status. Interestingly, the participants who lived in joint families (AOR = 0.411; 95% CI = 0.145 to 1.168) and were more frequently food insecure (AOR = 0.431; 95% CI = 0.164 to 1.133) had lesser odds of having poor nutritional status than those who lived in nuclear families and were food secure. CONCLUSION: Frequency of illness, house ownership and fathers' education are the determinants positively associated with poor nutritional status of adolescent girls. Food insecurity and joint family structure were negatively associated with poor nutritional status. The study will help in planning interventions for improving nutritional status of adolescent girls by targeting the significant socio demographic determinants of poor nutritional status among this group."
18808396,1,a,"This article reports a study on consumer attitudes to 21 food and nonfood technologies in Canada. The study involves repertory grid interviews with 36 food consumers, the data from which are analyzed using generalized Procrustes analysis. Results highlight the role of perceived risk and perceived benefit in determining the acceptability of the technologies, with individual technologies lying along a continuum between the two. For technology as a whole and the 21 specific technologies, the perceived risk and perceived benefit constructs were the dominant determinants of consumer acceptability. While perceptions of perceived risk and perceived benefit differed between individual respondents, there were very limited consistent relations with a range of sociodemographic variables."
31384279,0,a,"In 2014, there were 480 000 new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) around the world, but only 25% of them were diagnosed and reported. Drug resistance in TB is necessarily a laboratory diagnosis. An urgent priority in everyday practice is to diagnose tuberculosis and rule out drug resistance as quickly and as accurately as possible. However, worldwide, only 12% of new bacteriologically confirmed TB cases and 58% of previously treated TB cases were tested for drug resistance in 2014. New tools for diagnosis of TB and drug-resistant TB have been introduced for clinical practice during the past decade. Those new tools can detect and identify drug resistance to antituberculosis drugs in less than 24 hours, and they should be urgently integrated into clinical practice, especially in high-burden regions. Ongoing transmission of TB generates new infections, and this infected population is the inexhaustible source of new TB cases. If we are really determined to stop the global TB epidemic, we need to treat active cases and also halt the transmission of the infection. The only strategy for preventing the development of active disease in individuals with subclinical infection is to give treatment for this latent infection. Global control of TB requires a huge investment of funds to address current detection and treatment gaps. We must reconsider our current strategy and combine social components with biomedical interventions. This will require the development of alliances between government and civil society, as well as leadership and true political commitment at the highest level of government."

12200506,1,a,"Most studies of psychopathology following disasters are concerned with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present analyses sought to assess the rate and determinants of depression in adult survivors of the 1988 earthquake in Armenia. Unlike previous studies of earthquakes, the present analyses derive from a well-defined cohort of survivors who underwent diagnostic interviewing to characterize psychiatric morbidity. As part of a cohort study of 32,743 survivors of the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, a stratified population sample of 1,785 persons was interviewed about 2 years following the disaster using a special questionnaire based on the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Disaster Interview Schedule/Disaster Supplement. 52% met the criteria for major depression. Of these, a total of 177 cases of depression with no other psychiatric diagnosis or comorbidity were compared with 583 controls from the same interviewed group who did not fulfill the criteria for any psychiatric disorder. Cases and controls were compared as to data obtained independently at the aftermath of the disaster on a number of exposures and characteristics related to the earthquake. More of the cases involved females (odds ratio [OR] for males 0.7 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-0.9]) and from the city of Gumri, which had some of the worst destruction (OR for residents of Gumri 5.9 [95% CI 4.0-8.8]). Being with someone in the same building at the moment of the earthquake was protective for depression (OR for presence of other people 0.5 [95% CI 0.3-0.6]), and the risk of depression increased with the amount of loss that the family sustained as a result of the earthquake (OR for highest level of loss 2.5 [95% CI 1.3-4.8]). The use of alcohol was protective for depression (OR for those who drink 0.5 [95% CI 0.3-0.8]). In various models of multivariate adjustment and analysis, the increased risk of depression with loss, geographic location, and female gender was maintained. Also, being with someone during the disaster, receiving assistance and support after the earthquake, and alcohol use were protective for depression in these multivariate analyses. Depression is a common sequel to an earthquake. As with our previous study of PTSD, we were able to relate intensity of the disaster and loss to the risk of depression in a general population sample. The role of social support during and after the disaster as a protective mechanism against adverse psychological outcome was highlighted again. Whereas alcohol use in our previous study was not related to PTSD outcome, it is noteworthy that in the present analyses it emerged as a protective factor for depression."
18833350,1,a,"As we have seen a global increase in asthma in the past three decades it has also become clear that it is a socially patterned disease, based on demographic and socioeconomic indicators clustered by areas of residence. This trend is not readily explained by traditional genetic paradigms or physical environmental exposures when considered alone. This has led to consideration of the interplay among physical and psychosocial environmental hazards and the molecular and genetic determinants of risk (i.e., biomedical framing) within the broader socioenvironmental context including socioeconomic position as an upstream ""cause of the causes"" (i.e., ecological framing). Transdisciplinary research strategies or programs that embrace this complexity through a shared conceptual framework that integrates diverse discipline-specific theories, models, measures, and analytical methods into ongoing asthma research may contribute most significantly toward furthering our understanding of socially patterned disease. This paper provides an overview of a multilevel, multimethod longitudinal study, the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment and Social Stress (ACCESS), as a case study to exemplify both the opportunities and challenges of transdisciplinary research on urban asthma expression in the United States."
11673127,1,a,"The objectives of this study were to to identify maternal characteristics associated with traditional food consumption and to examine food items associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury body burden in pregnant Inuit women from Northern Quebec. We interviewed women from three communities at mid-pregnancy and at 1 and 11 months postpartum. We measured PCBs, Hg, and selenium in maternal blood; Hg was also measured in maternal hair. The women reported eating significant amounts of fish, beluga muktuk/fat, seal meat, and seal fat. Although consumption of fish and seal was associated with lower socioeconomic status, consumption of beluga whale was uniform across strata. Fish and seal meat consumption was associated with increased Hg concentrations in hair. Traditional food intake during pregnancy was unrelated to PCB body burden, which is more a function of lifetime consumption. This study corroborated previous findings relating marine mammal and fish consumption to increased Hg and selenium body burden. Despite widespread knowledge regarding the presence of these contaminants in traditional foods, a large proportion of Inuit women increased their consumption of these foods during pregnancy, primarily because of pregnancy-related changes in food preferences and the belief that these foods are beneficial during pregnancy."
23442574,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Disappointing results from clinical trials of disease-modifying interventions for Alzheimer's dementia (AD), along with reliable identification of modifiable risk factors in mid life from epidemiological studies, have contributed to calls to invest in risk-reduction interventions. It is also well known that AD-related pathological processes begin more than a decade before the development of clinical signs. These observations suggest that lifestyle interventions might be most effective when targeting non-symptomatic adults at risk of AD. To date, however, the few dementia risk-reduction programs available have targeted individual risk factors and/or were restricted to clinical settings. The current study describes the development of an evidence-based, theoretically-driven multidomain intervention to reduce AD risk in adults at risk. METHOD: The design of Body Brain Life (BBL) is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a 12-week online AD risk-reduction intervention. Eligible participants with several modifiable risk factors on the Australian National University (ANU) AD Risk Index (ANU-ADRI) are randomly allocated to an online only group, an online and face-to-face group, or an active control group. We aim to recruit 180 participants, to undergo a comprehensive cognitive and physical assessment at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up assessment. The intervention comprises seven online modules (dementia literacy, risk factor education, engagement in physical, social, and cognitive lifestyles, nutrition, and health monitoring) designed using contemporary models of health behavior change. DISCUSSION: The BBL program is a novel online intervention to reduce the risk of AD in middle-aged adults at risk. The trial is currently under way. It is hypothesized that participants in the intervention arms will make lifestyle changes in several domains, and that this will lead to a reduction in their AD risk profile. We also expect to show that health behavior change is underpinned by changes in psychological determinants of behavior. If successful, the findings will contribute to the development of further dementia risk reduction interventions, and thus contribute to the urgent need to lower dementia risk factors in the population to alter future projections of disease prevalence. Longer follow-up of BBL participants and replications using large samples are required to examine whether reduction in AD risk factors will be associated with reduced prevalence.

29525936,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Factors such as ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status may play a role in both access to and attrition from bariatric programs before surgery is undertaken. New Zealand (NZ) has high rates of obesity in its Pacific population and the indigenous Maori. These groups also experience poorer health outcomes and therefore have the greatest need for surgery. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective cross-sectional study of 704 people referred for and accepted onto a publicly funded bariatric surgery from 2007 to 2016. The demographic and clinical features of two groups were compared: those that completed surgery successfully (n = 326) and those that dropped out of the program before surgery (n = 378). We also attempted to identify factors associated with attrition. RESULTS: The attrition rate was high (54%), with a significant difference according to gender (men 66% vs 45% women, p < 0.001) and ethnicity (39% in NZ Europeans, 50% in Maori, and 73% in Pacific patients, p < 0.001). Two out of three European women proceeded to surgery, but fewer than one in seven Pacific men. Attrition was associated with having a higher mean BMI and being a smoker. Logistic regression modeling showed that while employment seemed to be protective against attrition for NZ Europeans (p < 0.004), it was not for Pacific patients. CONCLUSIONS: While there was no obvious bias in rates of referral, there is clearly a need for better ways to support Maori and Pacific people, and men in particular, to complete bariatric surgery. Further research is needed to clarify the socio-economic and cultural barriers that underlie this phenomenon."

31213332,0,a,"This paper examines the determinants of unmet healthcare needs in Europe. Special emphasis is put on the impact of social capital. Data come from the European Social Survey, 2014. Our study includes 32,868 respondents in 20 countries. Because unmet needs are observed only in those individuals who are exposed to, and recognise, the need of medical care, sample selection can be an issue. To address it, we analyse the data using the bivariate sample selection model. When there is no need, there is no assessment of access to healthcare. Accordingly, in this situation, our model assumes that unmet need is unobserved. The magnitude and statistical significance of the error correlation support our modelling strategy. A high proportion (18.4%) of individuals in need in Europe reported unmet needs. Informal connections seem to mitigate barriers to access as well as trust in other people and institutions, particularly in health services. Financial strain still is a strong predictor of unmet needs. Other vulnerable groups include informal carers, minorities and individuals feeling discriminated. Unmet needs might also arise due to persistent needs of healthcare as it seems to be the case of individuals with lower health status and chronic conditions. A result that merits further research concerns the positive impact of civic engagement on unmet needs."
27284704,0,a,"Canadian research indicates that individuals with lower incomes, less education or lower occupational skill levels tend to be less healthy than those who enjoy greater advantages in these areas. This uneven distribution of health across different socioeconomic status (SES) groups is referred to as ""socioeconomic inequality in health."" Evidence of the economic cost of health inequalities helps us understand the benefits of reducing these inequalities. However, the data needed to generate such evidence is difficult to obtain. A lack of Canadian data linking health costs and socioeconomic characteristics means that assessment of the degree to which health costs are associated with socioeconomic inequalities at the national level is limited. In order to build evidence on the cost of socioeconomic health inequalities, the Public Health Agency of Canada worked with Statistics Canada to test the feasibility of a ""bottom-up"" approach to compiling national health cost data. A bottom-up approach relies on individual-level data, which allows costs to be calculated by individual-level characteristics not always found in other data sources. This includes indicators of SES such as level of education or income. In this study, the population was divided into quintiles based on income, and the health care costs incurred by these five income groups were examined for a single year (2007-2008)."
30740179,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity is one of the most important self-care approaches to controlling complications of type 2 diabetes. According to Bandura's social theory, factors such as social support are effective factors in the incidence of the behaviour. AIM: This study aims to determine the level of physical activity, social support and their determinants. METHODS: This descriptive study was performed on 250 patients with type 2 diabetes by Cluster-Random Sampling method in Rafsanjan City. Data were collected using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Social Support Questionnaire for Sport, that their validity and reliability were confirmed. The results were analysed by t-test, ANOVA and logistic regression. RESULTS: This study showed that 46.8% of the patients were in the inactive group. Social support score for exercise was low in this group. The results indicated that social support and gender are predictors of physical activity, and with an increase in the social support score, the odds of having minimal physical activity increased 1.17 fold (OR = 1.167) and men were 4.18 times more likely to have minimal physical activity (OR = 4.183). CONCLUSION: Considering the low level of physical activity and social support in diabetic patients, and the effect of social support on the prediction of physical activity, interventions are recommended to increase social support in this group."
11759165,1,a,"This paper considers actual German trends of impact factors contributing to hygienic risks in domestic settings: Have there been or are there still alterations which may be relevant and which should have consequences for hygiene behavior?

Each of the alterations of hygiene determinants described below may appear to be marginal when looked at separately, thus disregarding any relationship to hygiene. However, as a whole to anticipate the conclusion they have clearly altered the hygiene risks in the household; some risks have decreased but others have grown worse. The author intends to initiate an objective discussion on home hygiene in Germany. The intention is not creating a sterile environment in the home but to realize the ""hot spots"" of hygiene in modern domestic settings in order to develop a targeted hygiene."
16783115,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to examine the demographic, medical, and social cognitive determinants of exercise intentions in a population-based sample of multiple myeloma cancer survivors. Using a cross-sectional survey, 70 multiple myeloma cancer survivors completed a questionnaire that assessed their medical and demographic characteristics, past exercise behavior, and social cognitive exercise beliefs using the theory of planned behavior. Seventy participants provided valuable data. Descriptive statistics indicated that participants had quite positive instrumental attitude, intentions, and subjective norms and moderate levels of perceived behavioral control and affective attitudes for exercise. Forced entry multiple regression showed that the theory of planned behavior explained 43% of the variance in exercise intentions. Instrumental attitude and perceived behavioral control were both independent predictors of exercise intentions. No demographic or medical variable moderated the association between the theory of planned behavior constructs and exercise intentions. The results of the present investigation support the growing body of evidence confirming the utility of the theory of planned behavior to understand the salient determinants of exercise in cancer survivors. Knowledge gained from this study provides important information to oncology practitioners who are responsible for delivering supportive care interventions, including exercise, to patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma."
15582347,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to describe changes in physical activity and determinants in youngsters treated for obesity. Self-reported physical activity and determinants were assessed at start, during and after an intervention in 24 obese patients (mean age 13.5+/-2.1 years). Participation in activities of moderate to high intensity increased during treatment, but 6-months after treatment this decreased again to pre-treatment levels. Participation in activities of low intensity and television watching decreased during treatment and increased following treatment. Very little change was found in perceived benefits, barriers or self-efficacy scores. Modelling of siblings decreased after treatment, whereas there was no evolution in modelling of parents. Social support by family members increased during treatment, but decreased following treatment. We can conclude that the intervention was successful in activating obese youngsters to move at the desirable exercise intensity and frequency; however, maintenance of the exercise habit after treatment was not successful."
21044343,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The problem of accessibility and affordability of health care is reported to be a major social concern in modern China. It is pronounced in rural households which represent 60% of China's population. There are a few large scale studies which have been conducted into socioeconomic inequalities in health care utilisation for rural populations. Those studies that exist are mainly bivariate analyses. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between socioeconomic characteristics and health service utilisation among rural counties, using aggregated data from a nationally representative dataset, within a multivariate regression analysis framework. METHODS: Secondary data analysis was conducted on China's National Health Services Survey (NHSS) 2003. Aggregated data on health care utilisation, socioeconomic position, demographic characteristics and health status were used. The samples included 67 rural counties. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The results of the ecological multivariate analyses showed a positive relationship between private insurance coverage and the use of outpatient care (p-value < 0.05, standardised coefficient = 0.22). Annual income was positively correlated with annual medical expenditure (p-value < 0.01, standardised coefficient = 0.56). A rural county's area socioeconomic stratum, a composite measure frequently used in bivariate studies including the NHSS analysis report, could not explain any association with the use of health care. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that richer rural households with a greater ability to pay are more able to use health services in China. The findings suggest that the scope of medical insurance might be restrictive, or the protection provided might be limited, and the health care costs might still be too high. Additional efforts are required to ensure that poorer Chinese rural households are able to utilise health care according to their needs, regardless of their income levels or private insurance coverage. This would require targeted strategies to assist low income families and a broad spectrum of interventions to address the social determinants of health."
22640447,0,a,"SETTING: Two towns in Campo de Gibraltar, southern Spain, with a small foreign population and higher tuberculosis (TB) incidence and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence than the national average. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between HIV-TB and non-HIV-TB incidence and social deprivation and other potential individual and contextual determinants. METHODS: In a cross-sectional longitudinal study, individual TB case variables were identified from three sources--routine surveillance, laboratory and hospital discharge records--from 1997 to 2007. Community variables were obtained at the census tract level. A deprivation index was calculated based on percentages of unemployment, low educational level and unskilled labour. Multilevel Poisson models were estimated for TB incidence rates for patients with and without HIV. RESULTS: A total of 490 TB cases were included. Sex and age at individual level and deprivation and residence in the port area at census tract level were associated both with HIV-related TB and with non-HIV-TB. Household crowding contextual variables were also associated with HIV-related TB incidence. Full models account for 78.9% and 51.7% reductions in second-level variance. CONCLUSION: Socio-economic deprivation is associated with higher rates of HIV-TB and non-HIV-TB. Diverse individual and contextual potential risk factors suggest different pathways of transmission. It is necessary to extend the framework for intervention beyond individual-based strategies to the socio-economic contexts in which people live."
30603742,0,a,"Objective: To examine obesity and diabetes associations with United States hospital use and healthcare costs for African American women, to explore the relationship between co-morbidities of interest (obesity and diabetes) and hospital resources [length of stay (LOS) and costs]. Methods: A retrospective, correlation, quantitative analysis for lengths of hospital stay and cost among adult African American women categorized according to their weight status with type 2 diabetes. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) data which contains the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used. Focused on 803,163 African American, female inpatients between the ages of 21 and 55 in the United States from 2008 to 2010. Researcher explored the relationship between individual health factors of interest (obesity and diabetes) and the effects on hospital LOS and healthcare costs. All statistical analysis will be performed using Stata v12. All inferential tests will be two-sided and will utilize a 95% significance level. Two separate multiple regressions will be used. Results: A total of 758,874 records were retained for analysis. The patients in the weighted population ranged in age from 21 to 55 years. The patient LOS ranged from 0 to 333 days. The patients had approximately 2 procedures on average, and presented with approximately 3 chronic conditions on average. The total charges (Cost) ranged from 106 to over 1 million US dollars. The size and direction of the relationship between LOS, healthcare costs and the independent variables of diabetes and obesity suggests that both LOS and health care cost decreased for African American female patients with diabetes or obesity. There is a statistically significant relationship between at least one of the individual health factors of interest (obesity and diabetes) and hospital LOS (F = 13,394.00, P < 0.0005, R (2) = 0.440) and hospital costs (F = 10,171.23, P < 0.0005, R (2) = 0.502). Conclusions: There is evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in health care quality in hospital treatment of African American patients. After accounting for social determinants and insurance statuses, African Americans may receive lower-quality care than the population at large. African Americans are admitted to the hospital, but services and LOS are shorter than the general population partially due to disparities in evaluating and offering treatment."
17151800,1,a,Engagement is a core component of effective educational programs for children with autism. Analysis of 711 naturalistic goal-directed classroom behaviors of four school-age children with autism and four comparable children with Down syndrome (DS) was conducted. The definition of engagement was expanded to include child compliance and congruence. A main finding was both child and environmental factors influenced type of engagement. Children with DS produced 20% more goal-directed behaviors that were both congruent and compliant compared to children with autism. Large group instruction was associated with less congruent engagement but more compliant engagement for children with autism. These findings suggest specific types of engagement which may lead to advances in developing evidence-based practices for specific developmental disorders.
19936550,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: Characterize diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in Bogota, Colombia and examine the extent and determinants of patient delay. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a census approach we identified 1 106 women with breast cancer. Information was gathered through personal interviews and the review of medical records. Patient delay was defined as the time elapsed from first symptoms to initial consultation. RESULTS: More than 80% of the women (902) consulted due to symptoms; the majority had advanced-stage disease. Patient delay was established in 20.3% and the main related factors were older age, lack of social security and advanced clinical stage. Higher education in patients was associated with reduced delays. DISCUSSION: Women do not recognize breast cancer symptoms. Patient delay and related factors are similar to those found in other studies. There is an urgent need to develop communication and education strategies regarding breast cancer symptoms and early detection."
29251226,0,a,"The theory of fundamental causes is one of the more influential attempts to provide a theoretical infrastructure for the strong associations between indicators of socioeconomic status (education, income, occupation) and health. It maintains that people of higher socioeconomic status have greater access to flexible resources such as money, knowledge, prestige, power, and beneficial social connections that they can use to reduce their risks of morbidity and mortality and minimize the consequences of disease once it occurs. However, several key aspects of the theory remain underspecified, compromising its ability to provide truly compelling explanations for socioeconomic health inequalities. In particular, socioeconomic status is an assembly of indicators that do not necessarily cohere in a straightforward way, the flexible resources that disproportionately accrue to higher status people are not clearly defined, and the distinction between socioeconomic status and resources is ambiguous. I attempt to address these definitional issues by infusing fundamental cause theory with features of a well-known theory of socioeconomic stratification in the sociological literature-Pierre Bourdieu's theory of symbolic power."
25023491,0,a,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the key social determinants of physical activity among six Asian-American subgroups using public access 2007 California Health Interview Survey data. Physical activity was defined as meeting the American College of Sports Medicine recommendation of 450 metabolic equivalent-minutes per week. Factors positively associated with meeting physical activity recommendations included being bilingual among Chinese and Vietnamese, and increasing age for Chinese only. On the other hand, being middle aged, currently married, and low neighborhood safety were significantly associated with lower odds of meeting physical activity recommendations, as were being female for Japanese and Koreans, and living above the poverty level for Vietnamese. Such results highlight the heterogeneity among Asian-Americans and need for health messages targeted at specific subgroups. Additionally, the role of built environment, particularly in areas with high Filipino residents, should be a public health priority for increasing physical activity outcomes."
16040212,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the determinants of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use and possible health-related outcomes in Germany. METHODS: 827 current HRT users (age range 31-78 years, who had taken HRT products in the last 7 days before the medical interview) and 2371 age-matched nonusers were identified from five population-representative National Health Surveys performed from 1984 to 1999 in Germany. Cross-sectional comparisons between HRT users and nonusers were performed for socioeconomic factors and possible health-related outcomes. Regression models were used to obtain odds ratios of HRT use. RESULTS: HRT use increased dramatically from 3% in 1984/1985 to 21% in 1998/1999 among German women aged 40-69. Regression analysis and comparison between HRT users and nonusers suggested that HRT use was closely associated with socioeconomic factors and personal lifestyle that may favor better health. In HRT users, however, we did not observe any health-related benefits in satisfaction with life or health. While HRT users appeared superior to nonusers with respect to the glycemic status, histories of cardiovascular diseases, despite a favorable lipid profile, occurred not less than in the group of nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: In the settings of our cross-sectional studies in Germany HRT did not improve users' health benefits and did not show cardioprotective effects. The better glycemic status should be balanced against the higher risks of cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer."
22539559,0,a,"This investigation aims to explore determinants of exposure to particle size-specific welding fume. Area sampling of ultrafine particles (UFP) was performed at 33 worksites in parallel with the collection of respirable particles. Personal sampling of respirable and inhalable particles was carried out in the breathing zone of 241 welders. Median mass concentrations were 2.48 mg m(-3) for inhalable and 1.29 mg m(-3) for respirable particles when excluding 26 users of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). Mass concentrations were highest when flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) with gas was applied (median of inhalable particles: 11.6 mg m(-3)). Measurements of particles were frequently below the limit of detection (LOD), especially inside PAPRs or during tungsten inert gas welding (TIG). However, TIG generated a high number of small particles, including UFP. We imputed measurements <LOD from the regression equation with manganese to estimate determinants of the exposure to welding fume. Concentrations were mainly predicted by the welding process and were significantly higher when local exhaust ventilation (LEV) was inefficient or when welding was performed in confined spaces. Substitution of high-emission techniques like FCAW, efficient LEV, and using PAPRs where applicable can reduce exposure to welding fume. However, harmonizing the different exposure metrics for UFP (as particle counts) and for the respirable or inhalable fraction of the welding fume (expressed as their mass) remains challenging."
21431819,1,a,"This paper introduces a series of research projects designed to fulfill the societal role of environmental health studies by investigating (1) the dynamic and complex relationships between environmental conditions and (2) health in an urban setting. Research in this first category has revealed the existence of the combined influence of multiple physical environmental factors on health and its mechanisms. In the second category, there have been a number of studies of the integrated influence of social environmental factors on health employing an aggregate modeling of multiple determinants of health and studies of individual topics related to social determinants of health. These research projects have contributed to the formulation of specific remedies and the development of comprehensive health policies. Participatory approaches have been used to enhance capacity building opportunities and to ensure that research results reflect the actual conditions in urban societies. Healthy Cities projects and programs have been developed in close collaboration with this type of research. Urban societies have become interdependent and share the same issues globally. Further research into the relationships between health and the environment in the context of urbanization will expand the base of evidence applicable to the complex realities in modern societies."
30031657,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To describe and analyse the factors associated with the use of health services (emergency departments, admissions and primary care) in women survivors of breast cancer diagnosed or treated in four university hospitals of Barcelona (Spain) between 2003 and 2013, within the framework of the Cohort DAMA project. METHOD: Descriptive design nested in a mixed cohort (Cohort Dama). We obtained sociodemographic information and information on the use of health services through a questionnaire, and on the tumour from the clinical history. Logistic regression models were performed, calculating the odds ratio of the use of health services (emergency departments, hospital admissions and primary care) raw and adjusted (aOR) by diagnostic method, the characteristics of the tumour and of the women and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The presence of chronic diseases was associated with greater use of the three levels of care. A disadvantaged economic level increases the risk of use of emergency departments and primary care but not of hospital admissions, while a higher tumour stage is associated with a greater risk of admission. By age, those under 50 had a higher risk of using emergency departments and admissions. CONCLUSIONS: The factors associated with the use of health services differ according to the level of care (aOR: 3.53 emergency departments, 1.67 admissions, 3.89 primary care) and treatment-derived complications (aOR: 1.35 emergency departments, 1.43 primary care). The presence of chronic disorders, younger age, disadvantaged social class, increases the risk of using services more than the tumour stage and treatment-derived complications. Neither the diagnostic method nor the survival time, nor the use of non-conventional therapies influence this."
18410815,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to (1) determine whether level of social support and living situation predicted emergency department (ED) use among older adults and (2) identify correlates of ED visits according to whether the patient was admitted to the hospital. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a longitudinal, prospective study was conducted. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, subjects who lived alone were 60% more likely to visit the ED than those who lived solely with their spouse. Neither type nor level of social support as measured by the Duke Social Support Index predicted ED use. Indicators of poor physical health (prior hospitalization, poorer self-rated health, and functional disability) were predictors of ED visits that resulted in hospitalization; however, these were not significantly associated with outpatient ED visits. DISCUSSION: Older adults who live alone are more likely to visit the ED. Additional study is needed to understand the determinants of outpatient ED visits."
16986650,1,a,"The purpose of this study is to examine the association between lacking emotional support from parents early in life and adult alcohol abuse. A series of logistic regression models were run with data collected from a nationally representative sample of over 2500 adults ages 25-74. The findings reveal a linear relationship between level of deficiency in early maternal support and odds of alcohol abuse during adulthood, with even moderate deficiencies being associated with elevated risk. Further examination suggests that this association persists throughout adulthood. This association does not appear to be explained by the early initiation of alcohol use, but poor psychological well-being during adulthood does account for a large portion of this association. These findings expand our understanding of the risks associated with poor parental support during childhood, and underscore the importance of adopting a life course perspective in studying the social determinants of alcohol problems among adults."
26660049,0,a,"Consumer's attitudes to, and acceptance of, emerging technologies and their applications, are important determinants of their successful implementation and commercialisation. Understanding the range of socio-psychological, cultural and affective factors which may influence consumer responses to applications of nanotechnology will help ""fine-tune"" the development of consumer products in line with their expectations and preferences. This is particularly true of applications in the food area, where consumer concerns about technologies applied to food production may be elevated. This research applied systematic review methodology to synthesise current knowledge regarding societal acceptance or rejection of nanotechnology applied to agri-food production. The objective was to aggregate knowledge derived from different research areas to gain an overall picture of consumer responses to nanotechnology applied to food production. Relevant electronic databases of peer-reviewed literature were searched from the earliest date available, for peer-reviewed papers which reported primary empirical data on consumer and expert acceptance of agri-food nanotechnology, using a formal systematic review protocol. Inclusion criteria for papers to be included in the review were: empirical peer-reviewed papers written in English; a population sample of adults aged 18 years and over used in the research; a research focus on consumer and expert acceptance of agri-food nanotechnology; and research on attitudes towards, and willingness to pay for, different applications of agri-food nanotechnology. Two researchers independently appraised the papers using NVivo 10 QSR software. Studies examining consumer and expert acceptance were thematically analysed, and key information was collated. The results were synthesised in order to identify trends in information relevant to consumer acceptance of nanotechnology applied to food production. Eight key themes were identified from the 32 papers which were extracted from the literature. These themes were applied to understand the determinants of consumer acceptance of agri-food nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is more likely to be accepted by consumers when applied to development of novel packaging with distinct benefits rather than when integrated directly into agri-food products. Trust and confidence in agri-food nanotechnology and its governance need to be fostered through transparent regulation and development of societally beneficial impacts to increase consumer acceptance."
19027442,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study was to examine the need for psychosocial support in a consecutive sample of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). Out of an initial sample of 250 patients, 239 patients could be assessed at the beginning of their RT. Two hundred eight patients were reassessed at the end of RT 4-8 weeks later. METHODS: Measures comprised the Hornheide Screening Instrument, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, the Resilience Scale, and the Short Form 12 as a measure of health-related quality of life (QoL). Medical and radiological data were continuously registered. RESULTS: Within the sample, the need for psychosocial support as reflected in the screening instrument was high (>70%). Patients with the need for psychosocial support revealed significantly higher fatigue scores than patients who where not identified as needing psychosocial support. Furthermore, a negative correlation of the need for psychosocial support and QoL as well as resilience could be observed. QoL turned out to be the strongest predictor for the need of psychosocial support. CONCLUSION: The study confirmed that the need for psychosocial support is an important aspect in the treatment of cancer patients undergoing RT, which appeared to be powerfully predicted by the patients' health-related QoL. Fatigue turned out to be an important illness- and treatment-related factor that affects QoL. Psychological interventions for cancer patients should explicitly focus on decreasing patients' fatigue and increasing their resilience, thus improving their QoL."
11271751,1,a,"The authors investigate the relative importance of actor and interaction partner as determinants of dyadic behavior. Using the social relations model (D. A. Kenny, 1994a; D. A. Kenny & L. La Voie, 1984), the authors estimate the variance attributable to each determinant plus the reciprocity of behavioral responses from 7 studies. The authors find evidence for moderate behavioral consistency in a person's behavior across interaction partners, little or no evidence that people consistently engender the same behavioral response from others, and preliminary evidence of unique responding to particular partners. They also consider several methodological issues concerning behavioral measurement as well as the implications of the results for the study of accuracy."
29514629,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Prison health systems are subject to increasing pressures given the specific health needs of a growing and aging prison population. Identifying the drivers of medical spending among incarcerated individuals is therefore key for health care governance in prisons. This study assesses the determinants of individual health care expenditures within the prisons of the canton of Vaud, a large region of Switzerland. METHODS: We use a unique dataset linking demographic and prison stay characteristics as well as objective measures of morbidity to detailed medical invoice data. We adopt a multivariate regression approach to model total, somatic and psychiatric outpatient health care expenditures. RESULTS: We find that chronic infectious, musculoskeletal and skin diseases are strong predictors of total and somatic costs. Schizophrenia, neurotic and personality disorders as well as the abuse of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals drive total and psychiatric costs. Furthermore, cumulating psychiatric and somatic comorbidities has an incremental effect on costs. CONCLUSION: By identifying the characteristics associated with health care expenditures in prison, this study constitutes a key step towards a more efficient use of medical resources in prison."
15369573,1,a,"AIMS: To compare low-rate daily smokers (one to five cigarettes/day) with other daily smokers, using the Transtheoretical Model of Change as a framework. DESIGN: Mail survey with a follow-up after 7 months. SETTING: A randomly selected population sample in French-speaking Switzerland, in 1998. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2338 daily smokers aged 25 + years, including 95 smokers of one to five cigarettes/day, 324 smokers of six to 10 cigarettes/day, 399 smokers of 11-15 cigarettes/day and 1520 smokers of 16 + cigarettes/day, and 1765 people (75% of 2338) at 7-month follow-up. FINDINGS: Compared with smokers of 16 + cigarettes/day, low-rate smokers of one to five cigarettes/day included more women (67% versus 46%, P < 0.001), were 4 years younger (P < 0.001), were less motivated to quit smoking (62% versus 37% in the 'precontemplation' stage of change, P < 0.001), thought that quitting would be easier (-3.4 points on a 0-10 scale, P < 0.001) and were less bothered by the risk of smoking. Low-rate smokers were taking control more actively over their smoking, e.g. they more often stayed away from places where people smoked, sat in the no-smoking sections in public places and tried to delay as much as they could their first cigarette of the day. Only 45% of low-rate smokers were still in the same category 7 months later. CONCLUSIONS: For many smokers, low-rate smoking may result from a conscious effort to limit their cigarette consumption. Being a low-rate smoker was a temporary condition for most people. Low-rate smokers should be considered as a specific, although heterogeneous group."
19573222,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Identification of subpopulations at high risk of overweight and obesity is crucial for prevention and management of obesity in different socioeconomic status (SES) categories. The objective of the study was to describe disparities in the prevalence of overweight and obesity across socioeconomic status (SES) groups in 18-74 year-old French adults. METHODS: Analyses were based on a multistage stratified random sample of non-institutionalized adults aged 18-74-years-old from the French Nutrition and Health Survey (ENNS), a cross-sectional national survey carried out in 2006/2007. Collected data included measured anthropometry (weight, height and waist circumference (WC)), demographic and SES data (occupation, education and frequency of holiday trips as a marker of family income). SES factors associated with overweight (BMI > or = 25) and central obesity (WC above gender-specific references) were identified using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Almost half (49.3%) of French adults were overweight or obese and 16.9% were obese. In men, the risk of overall overweight or obesity was associated with occupation (p < 0.05), whereas the risk of central obesity was independently associated with occupation (p < 0.05) and frequency of holiday trips (p < 0.01). In women, both overall and central overweight and obesity were independently associated with educational level (respectively p < 10(-3) and p < 10(-3)) and frequency of holiday trips (respectively p < 0.05 and p < 10-3). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was found to be similar to that of several neighbouring western European countries, and lower than the UK and eastern Europe. Risk of being overweight or obese varied across SES groups both in men and women, but associations were different between men and women, indicating differing determinants."
26377522,0,a,"Background Antiobesity campaigns blaming individual behaviors for obesity have sparked concern that an emphasis on individual behavior may lead to stigmatization of overweight or obese people. Past studies have shown that perpetuating stigma is not effective for influencing behavior. Purpose This study examined whether stigmatizing or nonstigmatizing images and text in antiobesity advertisements led to differences in health-related behavioral intentions. Method Participants in this experiment were 161 American adults. Measures included self-reported body mass index, weight satisfaction, antifat attitudes, and intention to increase healthy behaviors. Results Images in particular prompted intention to increase healthy behavior, but only among participants who were not overweight or obese. Conclusion Images and text emphasizing individual responsibility for obesity may influence behavioral intention among those who are not overweight, but they do not seem to be effective at altering behavioral intentions among overweight people, the target audience for many antiobesity messages. Images in antiobesity messages intended to alter behavior are influential and should be selected carefully."
22992714,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To longitudinally examine gender and racial disparities in driving cessation among older adults. METHODS: Data came from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) Study (N = 1,789). Logistic generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to identify predictors of driving cessation; stratified analysis and interaction terms were used to determine whether factors differed by gender and race. RESULTS: Two hundred and five (11.5%) participants stopped driving over the study period. Education was associated with increased risk of cessation for men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.10 to 1.78), but decreased risk for women (AOR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.82-0.98). Being married was associated with lower risk of cessation for men (AOR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.06-0.56) but was unrelated to cessation for women (AOR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.56-1.80). Results were consistent with the hypothesis that racial disparities in cessation widen with increasing age. DISCUSSION: Factors predictive of driving cessation vary by gender. Racial disparities in cessation are wider at older ages. Transportation policies and programs should account for social determinants and aim to address social disparities in driving mobility among older adults."
26927655,0,a,"Analyzing the challenges and the future scenario of Family Medicine is a priority to address challenges such as the reduction of benefits granted by social security; to adapt their practice to the changing health profile; and to curb demand for specialized services and contain the high costs of care in the second and third level. The program is aimed at three professional roles: medical care, research, and education. It is imperative review these in the light of changing demographic conditions, the type of health needs arising from new social determinants, the public expectations for greater participation in their care, and the evolution of the health system itself with the advancement of technology and a variety of organizational options with frequently limited resources. For primary care, as the core of a health system that covers principles of equity, solidarity, universality, participation, decentralization, and intra- and inter-sectorial coordination, it is necessary to put at the center of the primary care team the family doctor and not an administrator, who plays an important role in supporting the care team, but can not take the lead."
25158032,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: A large and growing proportion of the world's population rely on shared sanitation facilities that have historically been excluded from international targets due to concerns about acceptability, hygiene and access. In connection with a proposed change in such policy, we undertook this study to describe the prevalence and scope of households that report relying on shared sanitation and to characterise them in terms of selected socio-economic and demographic covariates. METHODS: We extracted data from the most recent national household surveys of 84 low- and middle-income countries from Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. We describe the prevalence of shared sanitation and explore associations between specified covariates and reliance on shared sanitation using log-binomial regression. RESULTS: While household reliance on any type of shared sanitation is relatively rare in Europe (2.5%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (7.7%), it is not uncommon in the Americas (14.2%), Western Pacific (16.4%) and South-East Asia (31.3%), and it is most prevalent in Africa (44.6%) where many shared facilities do not meet the definition of 'improved' even if they were not shared (17.7%). Overall, shared sanitation is more common in urban (28.6%) than in rural settings (25.9%), even after adjusting for wealth. While results vary geographically, people who rely on shared sanitation tend to be poorer, reside in urban areas and live in households with more young children and headed by people with no formal education. Data from 21 countries suggest that most sharing is with neighbours and other acquaintances (82.0%) rather than the public. CONCLUSIONS: The determinants of shared sanitation identified from these data suggest potential confounders that may explain the apparent increased health risk from sharing and should be considered in any policy recommendation. Both geographic and demographic heterogeneity indicate the need for further research to support a change in policies."
28390822,0,a,"Approximately one-quarter of the variation in lifespan in developed countries can be attributed to genetic factors. However, even large population based studies investigating genetic influence on human lifespan have been disappointing, identifying only a few genes accounting for genetic susceptibility to longevity. Some environmental and lifestyle determinants associated with longevity have been identified, which interplay with genetic factors in an intricate way. The study of gene-environment and gene-gene interactions can significantly improve our chance to disentangle this complex scenario. In this review, we first describe the most recent approaches for genetic studies of longevity, from those enriched with health parameters and frailty measures to pathway-based and SNP-SNP interaction analyses. Then, we go deeper into the concept of ""environmental influences"" in human aging and longevity, focusing on the contribution of life style changes, social and cultural influences, as important determinants of survival differences among individuals in a population. Finally, we discuss the contribution of the microbiome in human longevity, as an example of complex interaction between organism and environment. In conclusion, evidences collected from the latest studies on human longevity provide a support for the collection of life-long genetic and environmental/lifestyle variables with beneficial or detrimental effects on health, to improve our understanding of the determinants of human lifespan."
22029554,1,a,"Because of increased concerns about terrorism around the globe, international organizations are very interested in understanding how safety and cultural issues impact their employees' willingness to relocate abroad. This has been especially true for international companies based in the United States, given the recent salience of US activities around the world. Additionally, questions remain regarding the efficacy of financial incentives to motivate individuals' willingness to relocate when the destination may be dangerous. Therefore, the factors impacting willingness to relocate from the US to another country were examined experimentally in this study. Based upon theory and research in social and organizational psychology, it was hypothesized that cultural similarity, destination safety, and financial incentives would have direct effects on individuals' willingness to accept relocation offers. It was also predicted that cultural similarity and destination safety would moderate the effects of incentives upon willingness to relocate. The study used a 2 x 2 x 3 between-subjects design manipulating destination similarity (similar, different), destination safety (safe, dangerous), and bonus for relocating (0% bonus, 20% bonus, 40% bonus). Results from 196 participants at a university in the northeastern part of the US revealed that financial incentives and safety perceptions directly impacted willingness to relocate. In line with moderator predictions, financial incentives had a stronger effect on willingness to relocate when the destination was culturally different from the United States than when it was similar. Against expectations, there was no interaction between financial incentives and safety. Destination safety perceptions were relatively strong determinants of willingness to relocate."
30497905,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Among people living with HIV, cardiovascular risk could be markedly reduced through lifestyle improvement. However, to date behavioral cardiovascular risk factors (other than tobacco smoking) have been poorly investigated among them. Additionally, although co-occurrence of risk factors might amplify the deleterious effects of each risk factor, little is known about such risk factors clustering in this population. We aimed to examine levels, determinants and clustering of the major behavioral cardiovascular risk factors in the French HIV-infected population, in order to better target individuals with high risk profiles. METHODS: The ANRS-Vespa2 survey was conducted among a national representative sample of HIV-infected people followed at hospital in France in 2011. Frequency and co-occurrence of tobacco smoking, alcohol intake, low physical activity and obesity were assessed in the HIV-infected population, overall and in each of the distinctive socio-epidemiological group composing it (men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, sub-Saharan African migrants, non-African heterosexuals). Individual characteristics associated with each of these indicators were investigated using multivariable Poisson regression models. RESULTS: The 2537 participants (median time since HIV-diagnosis: 12 years) included 39.4% men who have sex with men, 11.0% intravenous drug users, 23.5% sub-Saharan African migrants and 26.1% non-African heterosexuals. Overall, 29.4% were regular smokers, 13.8% were heavy drinkers, 14.8% lacked physical activity and 8.6% were obese. Half of the participants reported at least one risk factor with co-occurrence observed in 13.8% of the sample. However, those figures varied markedly across the groups. Main risk factors profiles were 1) regular smoking, heavy drinking, low physical activity alone or combined among intravenous drug users and men who have sex with men, 2) obesity and low physical activity usually alone among sub-Saharan African migrant women, 3) occurrence of the four risk factors separately or sometimes combined among sub-Saharan African migrant men and non-African heterosexuals. These risk factors were correlated with lower socioeconomic status and poorer health status. CONCLUSIONS: Those findings highlight the need to focus on all behavioral cardiovascular risk factors and co-occurrence (and not only on tobacco smoking) in HIV-infected people and to implement preventive approach tailored to the specific needs of the different socio-epidemiological groups."
16297230,1,a,"Experts contend that weather and climate forecasts could have an important role in risk management strategies for community water systems. Yet, most water managers make minimal use of these forecasts. This research explores the determinants of the use of weather and climate forecasts by surveying managers of community water systems in two eastern American states (South Carolina and the Susquehanna River Basin of Pennsylvania). Assessments of the reliability of weather and climate forecasts are not driving their use as water managers who find forecasts reliable are no more likely to use them than are managers who find them unreliable. Although larger systems and those depending on surface water are more likely to use forecasts for some (but not all) purposes, the strongest determinant of forecast use is risk perceptions. Water managers who expect to face problems from weather events in the next decade are much more likely to use forecasts than are water managers who expect few problems. Their expectations of future problems are closely linked with past experience: water managers who have had problems with specific types of weather events (e.g., flood emergencies) in the last 5 years are likely to expect to experience problems in the next decade. Feeling at risk, regardless of the specific source of that weather-related risk, stimulates a decision to use weather and climate forecasts."
28110222,0,a,"The health impacts of trade liberalization are often described in relation to access to medicines, changing dietary patterns, tobacco use and alcohol consumption. The impacts of trade liberalization on the social determinants of health (SDH), are by contrast, less well known. Missing is an account of how liberalizing processes identified across different research areas relate to each other and how the association between trade liberalization and health is conceptualized within each of them, especially with reference to SDH. This paper presents a systematic review which provides a more complete picture of the pathways between trade liberalization and health, with special attention to SDH pathways. This picture captures the interrelationships between different areas of investigation, along with current limitations of our understanding and recommendations for future research."
25643835,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: There are an estimated 165,000 indigenous Mexicans living in California, including Mixtec and Zapotec immigrant farm workers. Because many of these immigrants speak only their native non-written languages, there is little information about the needs of this community. An academic-community partnership research team developed a survey to assess basic needs that are known to be social determinants of health in the Mixtec and Zapotec community in Ventura County. METHODS: In summer 2013, Spanish-Mixteco and Spanish-Zapoteco bilingual promotoras conducted surveys in Spanish, Mixteco and Zapoteco in the greater Oxnard area in Ventura County, California to assess the following basic needs: ability of adults and children to obtain health services; household needs regarding work opportunities, food, housing, transportation, safety and education; and discrimination. Independent variables included respondent characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, living part of the year in another city, and household characteristics such as Spanish spoken in the household, number of household members and number of health care providers/agencies used. Several sets of analyses examined the relationship between basic needs and independent variables. RESULTS: Respondents (N = 989) reported insufficient employment opportunities (74%), food for the family (59%) or housing (48%), lack of transportation (59%), and discrimination or bullying (34%). Most reported access to medical care for children (90%), but only 57% of respondents were able to get health care for themselves. CONCLUSIONS: Many basic needs in the Mixtec and Zapotec community in Ventura County are unmet. It will require many different resources and services to address the needs of this community and to overcome longstanding inequities that are experienced by immigrant farm workers. Our findings will guide the development of future health programs and will serve as a baseline to evaluate the impact of services to improve the health conditions in this community."
18365511,1,a,"Loneliness is an indicator of social well-being and pertains to the feeling of missing an intimate relationship (emotional loneliness) or missing a wider social network (social loneliness). The 11-item De Jong Gierveld scale has proved to be a valid and reliable measuring instrument for overall, emotional and social loneliness, although its length has sometimes rendered it difficult to use the scale in large surveys. In this study, we empirically tested a shortened version of the scale on data from two surveys (N=9448). Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the specification of two latent factors. Congruent validity and the relationship with determinants (partner status, health) proved to be optimal. The 6-item De Jong Gierveld scale is a reliable and valid measuring instrument for overall, emotional and social loneliness, which is suitable for large surveys."
30075782,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In Sweden asylum seekers are offered a voluntary health examination, free-of-charge (HE). The HE coverage is low. The organization and implementation of the HE involves collaboration between different agencies with different roles within the provision of health information and service. This study aimed to assess their perspectives on the barriers and facilitators regarding implementation of the HE, as well as on the purpose, content and value of the HE. METHOD: Thematic analysis of focus groups, individual and group interviews conducted between 2016 and 17 with 41 participants from various authorities and healthcare professionals involved in the delivery of HE in Stockholm. RESULTS: Suggestions were taken from interviewees of how to facilitate the uptake and delivery of HE through improved outreach to the target group with better collaboration, coordination and continuity between authorities. Apart from control of specific communicable diseases, the perceived ultimate goal of HE varied and was often vaguely formulated. Respondents desired better monitoring to assess the effects of HE and predict needs among asylum seekers. This included standardized procedures to promote equitable health care access and more explicit inclusion of mental health and other health dimensions in the HE. CONCLUSION: There are several possible avenues for improving HE coverage and uptake. However, ambiguity exists concerning the benefits of such efforts given the uncertainty of the value of HE. Lack of available data on health status, determinants of health and impact of HE among asylum seekers emerged as barriers preventing optimal approaches for the assessment of health needs. Implementation of standardized guidelines, procedures and documentation would aid the understanding. A more holistic approach beyond infectious diseases is necessary. This would only be useful if there is value in screening for such conditions. More research is required to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HE and related screening policies in Sweden."
17003160,1,a,"PURPOSE: Students' idealism and desire to work with underserved populations decline as they progress from preclinical training through clerkships and residency. With an increasingly diverse population and increasing health disparities, academic health centers need to incorporate changes in their curricula to train socially responsible and idealistic physicians. International electives can provide valuable learning experiences to help achieve these goals. METHODS: Sixty-six preclinical medical students at the University of Texas Medical Branch participated in an international elective from 1997 to 2005. After 1 week of didactics, they spent 3 weeks as part of a multidisciplinary medical team in rural Nicaragua. Postelective questionnaires were administered. From students' responses, we identified common learning themes and grouped them under the categories of attitudes, awareness, and skills. Limitations included a self-selection bias, lack of a control group, and limited follow-up. RESULTS: After the elective, students had an increased interest in volunteerism, humanitarian efforts, and working with underserved populations both in the United States and abroad, as well as more compassion toward the underserved. Students also reported a heightened awareness of social determinants of health and public health, and a broadened global perspective, as well as increased self-awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate that a well-structured, mentored experience in international health can have a positive impact on preclinical students' attitudes, including their compassion, volunteerism, and interest in serving under-served populations, all measures of idealism."
27365954,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: People living with epilepsy continue to suffer from enacted or perceived stigma that is based on myths, misconceptions, and misunderstandings that have persisted for many years. In the last decade, there has been an increase in individual literacy rate and increased access to technology in rural population. However, it is unclear if this has any effect on knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) attitude toward epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim is to evaluate KAP toward epilepsy. In addition, we also estimated the prevalence of stroke and epilepsy in rural South India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a 14-item questionnaire, we assessed KAP toward epilepsy and identified determinants of inappropriate attitudes toward people with epilepsy and 10-item questionnaires to assess the prevalence of epilepsy and stroke among 500 randomly selected populations in a Pattaravakkam village (Tamil Nadu, India). RESULTS: About 87.7% of the people had heard or read about epilepsy. Negative attitudes appeared to be reinforced by beliefs that epilepsy is hereditary (23.1%), kind of insanity (22.6%), or as contagious (12.0%). The knowledge about the clinical characteristics and first aid to a person during a seizure was 25.8%. About 36.5% of people think that society discriminates people with epilepsy. Moreover, our prevalence study showed that 8.7% people are suffering from epilepsy and 3.7% had stroke previously and at the day of survey, the stroke prevalence is 3.3%. CONCLUSION: Even with increased literacy, technology, and communication devices, the KAP of people toward epilepsy is relatively low. General public education campaigns and specific school education campaigns children should be encouraged to increase the KAP toward epilepsy. The prevalence and pattern of epilepsy and stroke is on the higher side in the village of Pattaravakkam. Future research regarding the value of targeted education in improving KAP will be worthwhile."
18447989,1,a,"INTRODUCTION: Many factors have been reported as being responsible for starting smoking during school age, but it is still not well known which cognitive determinants may be used as predictive factors of tobacco use. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal, study, including 417 pupils from 12 to 17 years, was carried out over three years in two rural Secondary Education Institutes in Castilla y Leon. The ESFA questionnaire was used, which included scales on attitudes and beliefs, social influences, self-efficacy, intention to smoke in the future and smoker behaviour. RESULTS: Of the 417 pupils studied, 36.7 % were smokers (38.6 % females and 34.4 % males). The mean of starting smoking was 12 years (11.83-12.15). In the initial analysis there was a clear relationship between cognitive determinants and smoker behaviour. The advertising and peer pressure lost predictive value after 3 years. The multivariate analysis showed that the determining factors of tobacco use are, besides age (OR = 3.85; 95 % CI, 1.27-11.64), to have a favourable attitude to smoking, (OR = 4.47; 95 % CI, 2.15-9.32), and the conduct perceived among peers (OR = 5.05; 95 % CI, 2.50-10.19). CONCLUSIONS: The determining factors that demonstrates a clear relationship with smoker behaviour are, age, favourable attitude of pupils towards smoking, and the perceived behaviour by smoker friends. Smoking prevention programs should take these factors into accounts when designing their activities."
30738376,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown the adverse impact of exposure to community violence on adolescent health. However, most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries. This study aimed at assessing the community violence exposure and the determinants of mental health problems among adolescents in Ambon, a post-conflict area in Indonesia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, school-based study involving 511 of 10th-graders from six randomly selected high schools in Kotamadya Ambon. Our participants were assessed using a set of questionnaires including the Strength Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to measure mental health problems, and the child version of the Screen for Adolescent Violence Exposure (KID-SAVE) to measure community violence exposure. The hierarchical regression analyses were used to explore the determinants of mental health problems. RESULTS: In this study, boys reported more exposure to community violence (both in frequency and severity) than girls. Meanwhile, the girls reported higher emotional problems than boys. The hierarchical regression analyses revealed that in the total sample and among boys, the community violence exposure was associated with mental health problems. However, it was the perceived impact of community violence exposure which showed an association with mental health problems among girls. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the high community violence exposure among adolescents living in a post-conflict setting in Indonesia. The study also found gender differences in the determinants of mental health problems among adolescents who were exposed to CVE."
17446793,1,a,"Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) has changed from a disease of middle-aged men in the late 1970s to a disease of elderly women in the 2000s. Most clinical studies during the past three decades have been conducted with men. Cardiac rehabilitation programmes were also developed with special regard to improving the rate of return to work in middle-aged men. The rehabilitation needs of older patients and women in particular have been largely neglected. The aim of this review is briefly to outline our present knowledge on gender issues in cardiac rehabilitation, and to specify barriers with regard to physical activities especially in (older) women. Coping with a cardiac event, women tend to minimize or play down the impact of their health situation and avoid burdening their social contacts. After a first cardiac event, women report greater psychological distress and lower self-efficacy and self-esteem. In addition, older age, lower exercise levels and reduced functional capacity or co-morbid conditions such as osteoporosis and urinary incontinence are barriers to physical activities in women with IHD. Recent studies on psychosocial intervention revealed less favourable results in women compared with men. These findings have not yet been well explained. This emphasizes our current lack of knowledge about the processes and determinants of successful psychosocial interventions in men and women with IHD. A large (European) trial on gender-specific coping styles, needs, and preferences of older women, and the effects of psychosocial intervention is proposed."
26817422,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Attractive toxic baits are the prevailing method for managing leaf-cutting ants in the eucalypt forests planted for the production of pulp, paper, timber and charcoal. For successful use in these baits, the insecticidal compounds need to circumvent the typical defences of the eusocial leaf-cutting ants. The challenge is to have an insecticide in the bait that will not directly harm and/or compromise foraging workers, but that will eventually suppress the colony. These underlying mechanisms are poorly known, and here the potential mechanism of fipronil activity in toxic baits for leaf-cutting ants was assessed using colonies of the representative Neotropical Acromyrmex subterraneus subterraneus (Forel, 1893). RESULTS: Although forager activity was not directly impaired by fipronil, the insecticide affected forager nestmate interactions (auto- and allogrooming) and waste removal and, more importantly, greatly affected the minor workers, impairing their activities of fungus garden cultivation and progeny handling. The fast decay of the fungus garden compromised the sustainability of the colonies, ultimately leading to their demise within 8 days. CONCLUSION: The behavioural effects of sublethal insecticide exposure towards minor workers are the main determinants of insecticide activity as ant baits and should be targeted in developing such compounds.

24328986,0,a,"Most public health practitioners know that public health has relied on biomedical advances and administrative improvements, but it is less commonly understood that social movements in health have also been sources of motivation for population health advances. This review considers the impacts of social movements focused on urban conditions and health, on the health of children, and on behavioral and substance-related determinants of health and illustrates how these movements have significantly influenced public health activities and programs. We hope this review will motivate public health workers to make common cause with social activists and to encourage social activists to ally with public health professionals."
26289918,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Sense of belonging is recognized as an important determinant of psychological and physical well-being. Research in Canada has shown that sense of belonging has increased in recent years although important variations exist between regions and among certain ethnic groups. METHODS: The objective of this paper is to examine differences in sense of belonging to local community between Canadian-born and immigrant residents in three small-to-medium sized urban areas using primary data collected in: 1) Charlottetown, PEI; 2) Hamilton, Ontario, and 3) Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. A mixed method approach is used in the analysis. First, a household telephone survey (n = 1529) asked respondents to rate their sense of belonging. This data was analyzed by way of summary statistics and ordered logistic regression. Second, a series of focus groups with immigrants in the three cities included questions on belonging and well-being (n = 11). RESULTS: The research found that sense of belonging is very high in the overall sample and in the three study sites, particularly in Charlottetown, and that there are no significant differences in levels of belonging between Canadian-born and immigrant respondents. However, among immigrants, sense of belonging was significantly lower for those living in Canada for 5 years or less. Consistent with the literature, positive mental health was found to be strongly associated with a positive sense of belonging for both Canadian-born and immigrant respondents. For immigrants, positive sense of belonging was associated with full-time work and home-ownership, two factors not associated with the Canadian-born population. The paper also revealed that immigrants placed greater importance on knowing their neighbours on a first name basis and generally trusting people as determinants of a positive sense of belonging. Finally, the focus groups revealed that in addition to displaying a sense of belonging to their city of residence, immigrants also maintain strong feelings of belonging to their ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: The paper concludes by offering several public health recommendations on how belonging can be enhanced among recent immigrants in smaller Canadian cities; these include improved coordination of services in order to contribute to a less overwhelming settlement process for immigrants."
11962684,1,a,"Quality of life (QoL) is estimated from patients scores to items related to everyday life, including rest and activity. The rest-activity rhythm reflects endogenous circadian clock function. The relation between the individual rhythm in activity and QoL was investigated in 200 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients wore a wrist actigraph (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., New York. NY) for 3-5 d before chronotherapy, and completed a QoL questionnaire developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (QLQ-C30) plus the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The rest-activity circadian rhythm was characterized by the mean activity level (m), autocorrelation coefficient at 24h (r24), and the dichotomy index (I < O). a ratio between the amount of activity while in and out of bed. The distribution of the rest-activity cycle parameters and that of QoL scores was independent of sex, age, primary tumor, number of metastatic sites, and prior treatment. Both the 24h rhythm indicators were positively correlated with global QoL score as well as physical, emotional, and social functioning. Negative correlations were found between m, r24, or I < O and fatigue, appetite loss, and nausea. The rest-activity circadian rhythm appeared to be an objective indicator of physical welfare and QoL. This analysis suggests that circadian function may be one of the biological determinants of QoL in cancer patients."
21449865,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the level and determinants of job satisfaction between four groups of Australian doctors: general practitioners, specialists, specialists-in-training, and hospital non-specialists. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: National cross-sectional questionnaire survey as part of the baseline cohort of a longitudinal survey of Australian doctors in clinical practice (Medicine in Australia - Balancing Employment and Life [MABEL]), undertaken between June and November 2008, including 5193 Australian doctors (2223 GPs, 2011 specialists, 351 hospital non-specialists, and 608 specialists-in-training). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Job satisfaction scores for each group of doctors; the association between job satisfaction and doctor, job and geographical characteristics. RESULTS: 85.7% of doctors were moderately or very satisfied with their jobs. There were no differences in job satisfaction between GPs, specialists and specialists-in-training. Hospital non-specialists were the least satisfied compared with GPs (odds ratio [OR], 0.56 [95% CI, 0.39-0.81]). For all doctors, factors associated with high job satisfaction were a good support network (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.41-2.10]), patients not having unrealistic expectations (OR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.25-1.75]), and having no difficulty in taking time off work (OR,1.48 [95% CI, 1.20-1.84]). These associations did not vary across doctor types. Compared with GPs, on-call work was associated with lower job satisfaction for specialists (OR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.23-0.98]) and hospital non-specialists (OR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.08-0.83]). CONCLUSION: This is the first national survey of job satisfaction for doctors in Australia. It provides an important baseline to examine the impact of future health care reforms and other policy changes on the job satisfaction of doctors."
18479518,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The overall number of involuntary admissions is increasing in many European countries. Patients with severe mental illnesses more often progress to stages in which acute, coercive treatment is warranted. The number of studies that have examined this development and possible consequences in terms of optimizing health care delivery in emergency psychiatry is small and have a number of methodological shortcomings. The current study seeks to examine factors associated with compulsory admissions in the Amsterdam region, taking into account a comprehensive model with four groups of predictors: patient vulnerability, social support, responsiveness of the health care system and treatment adherence. METHODS/DESIGN: This paper describes the design of the Amsterdam Study of Acute Psychiatry-I (ASAP-I). The study is a prospective cohort study, with one and two-year follow-up, comparing patients with and without forced admission by means of a selected nested case-control design. An estimated total number of 4,600 patients, aged 18 years and over, consecutively coming into contact with the Psychiatric Emergency Service Amsterdam (PESA) are included in the study. From this cohort, a randomly selected group of 125 involuntary admitted subjects and 125 subjects receiving non-coercive treatment are selected for further evaluation and comparison.First, socio-demographic, psychopathological and network characteristics, and prior use of health services will be described for all patients who come into contact with PESA. Second, the in-depth study of compulsory versus voluntary patients will examine which patient characteristics are associated with acute compulsory admission, also taking into account social network and healthcare variables. The third focus of the study is on the associations between patient vulnerability, social support, healthcare characteristics and treatment adherence in a two-year follow-up for patients with or without involuntarily admittance at the index consultation. DISCUSSION: The current study seeks to establish a picture of the determinants of acute compulsory admissions in the Netherlands and tries to gain a better understanding of the association with the course of illness and patient's perception of services and treatment adherence. The final aim is to find specific patient and health care factors that can be influenced by adjusting treatment programs in order to reduce the number of involuntary admissions."
12406469,1,a,"While there is a large and growing literature investigating the relationship between an individual's employment status and health, considerably less is known about the effect on this relationship of the context in which unemployment occurs. The aim of this paper is test for the presence and nature of contextual effects in the ways unemployment and health are related, based on a simple underlying model of stress, social support and health using a large population health survey. An individual's health can be influenced directly by own exposure to unemployment and by exposure to unemployment in the individual's context, and indirectly by the effects these exposures have on the relationship between other health determinants and health. Based on this conceptualization an empirical model, using multi-level analysis, is formulated that identifies a five-stage process for exploring these complex pathways through which unemployment affects health. Results showed that the association of individual unemployment with perceived health is statistically significant. Nevertheless, this study did not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the association of unemployment with health status depends upon whether the experience of unemployment is shared with people living in the same environment. Above all, this study demonstrates both the subtlety and complexity of individual- and contextual-level influences on the health of individuals. Our results caution against simplistic interpretations of the unemployment-health relationship and reinforce the importance of using multi-level statistical methods for investigation of it."
18243207,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Although mission statements are one of the most popular management instruments, little is known about the nature and direction of the presumed relationship between mission statements and organizational performance. In particular, empirical insights into the degree of mission statement use by individual organizational members are insufficient. OBJECTIVES: We address the observed knowledge gap by (a) measuring the level of mission statement use (e.g., explaining the mission statement, making linkages to extant programs or practices, communicating enthusiasm, and adapting the mission statement to the personal work situation) by individual organizational members, and (b) identifying the antecedents that influence mission statement use. DESIGN: Questionnaires were used to collect data from a sample of 510 nurses from three Flemish hospitals. Mission statement use was measured by means of Fairhurst's Management of Meaning Scale. Antecedents of mission statement use were derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior and the mission statement literature. RESULTS: The findings indicate that mission statement use is low on average. Attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and formal involvement in mission statement communication proved to be significant determinants of mission statement use and accounted for 43% of the variance. The results of the conducted regression analyses indicate that nurses (a) who have a positive attitude towards the mission statement, (b) who perceive pressure from superiors and colleagues to use the mission statement, (c) who feel they are in control of performing such behavior, and (d) who are formally involved in the mission statement communication processes are more likely to use the mission statement. Furthermore, the results indicated that demographic characteristics are not associated with mission statement use. CONCLUSIONS: To effectively increase mission statement use, investments should focus on redesigning a work environment that stresses the importance of the organizational mission statement and provides detailed information on the ways that individual organizational members can contribute in realizing the mission statement."
20024760,1,a,"A life course approach was used to assess household level impacts and inform interventions around HIV risk and AIDS vulnerability across seven major age-related stages of life. Our focus was sub-Saharan Africa. We provided a qualitative review of evidence from published literature, particularly multicountry reviews on impacts of AIDS, on determinants of risk and vulnerability, and reports of large surveys. Areas of potential stress from birth to old age in households affected by AIDS, and interventions for dealing with these specific stresses were identified. While specific interventions for HIV are important at different stages, achieving survival and development outcomes demands a wider set of health, social security and development interventions. One way to determine the priorities amongst these actions is to give weighting to interventions that address factors that have latent impacts later in life, which interrupt accumulating risk, or that change pathways to reduce the risk of both immediate and later stress. This qualitative review suggested that interventions, important for life cycle transitions in generalised epidemics where HIV risk and AIDS vulnerability is high, lie within and outside the health sector, and suggested examples of such interventions."
14709709,1,a,"Individual behavior and social contexts are critical determinants of health. We surveyed commissioners or their designees in 22 departments of health serving US cities of at least 500,000 people to examine their use of scientific approaches to influence individual behavior and social contexts. Each department used behavioral or social science in its work, but only four departments were judged to have integrated these approaches throughout their operations, using both centralized and decentralized structures. Degree of integration was unrelated to collaboration with universities or communities but was related to use of explicit theories. Behavioral and social sciences were employed most frequently in the areas of HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health and in the service of changing individual behavior rather than larger contexts, although across departments many health problems and approaches were involved. Commissioners generally found the approaches valuable, but articulated barriers to more widespread adoption."
28616870,0,a,"This article investigates the determinants of flood risk perceptions in New Orleans, Louisiana (United States), a deltaic coastal city highly vulnerable to seasonal nuisance flooding and hurricane-induced deluges and storm surges. Few studies have investigated the influence of hazard experience, geophysical vulnerability (hazard proximity), and risk perceptions in cities undergoing postdisaster recovery and rebuilding. We use ordinal logistic regression techniques to analyze experiential, geophysical, and sociodemographic variables derived from a survey of 384 residents in seven neighborhoods. We find that residents living in neighborhoods that flooded during Hurricane Katrina exhibit higher levels of perceived risk than those residents living in neighborhoods that did not flood. In addition, findings suggest that flood risk perception is positively associated with female gender, lower income, and direct flood experiences. In conclusion, we discuss the implications of these findings for theoretical and empirical research on environmental risk, flood risk communication strategies, and flood hazards planning."
14698795,1,a,"Compliance with therapeutic regimens constitutes an important but infrequently studied precursor of treatment engagement and is a necessary condition of successful treatment. This study builds on recent treatment process research and provides a theory-driven analysis of treatment compliance. Five hypotheses are formulated to predict treatment noncompliance among criminal justice-mandated clients. These hypotheses tap different determinants of treatment progress, including physical prime, supportive social network, conventional social involvement, treatment motivation, and risk-taking propensity. Data from 150 addicted felons participating in a diversion program are analyzed to test the hypotheses. Predictors related to these hypotheses correctly identify 58% of the fully compliant clients and 55-88% of the noncompliant clients. Most hypotheses are at least partially corroborated and a few strong correlates emerge across analyses. Clients in their physical prime, those with poorer social support, and those lacking internal desires for change were found especially likely to violate treatment program rules. Clinical implications are discussed."
27247864,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The current study examines what factors contribute to higher injury risk among Aboriginal peoples, compared to the total British Columbia (BC) population. We explore socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural factors, and combinations of these factors, that contribute to increased injury risk for Aboriginal peoples. This follows from our previously reported findings of improvements in injury risk over time for both the total and Aboriginal populations. DATA AND METHODS: We use provincial population-based linked health care databases of hospital discharge records. We identify three population groups: total BC population, and Aboriginal populations living off-reserve, or on-reserve. For each group we calculate age and gender-standardized relative risks (SRR) of injury-related hospitalization, relative to the total population of BC, for two 5-year time periods (1999-2003, and 2004-2008). We use custom data from the 2001 and 2006 long-form Censuses that described income, education, employment, housing conditions, proportion of urban dwellers, proportion of rural dwellers, and prevalence of Aboriginal ethnicity. We use multivariable linear regression to examine the associations between the census characteristics and SRR of injury. RESULTS: The best-fitting model was an excellent fit (R(2) = 0.905, p < 0.001) among the three population groups within Health Service Delivery Areas of BC. We find indicators in all three categories (socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural) are associated with disparity in injury risk. While the socioeconomic indicators (income, education, housing, employment) were shown to be highly correlated, only living in housing that needs major repair and occupational hazardousness, along with rural residence and Aboriginal ethnicity, remained in the final model. Our data show that cultural density is not associated with injury risk for Aboriginal peoples, and that living off-reserve is associated with reduced injury by improving socioeconomic and geographic conditions (compared to living on-reserve). Finally, our analyses show that Aboriginal status itself is associated with injury risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm previous research indicating that geographical differences differentiate injury risk, including for Aboriginal populations, and that socioeconomic determinants are associated with health risks. Our analyses showing that Aboriginal status itself contributes to injury risk is new, but we can only speculate about pathway, and whether the causes are direct or indirect."
16731678,1,a,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Reproductive tract infections (RTI) present major health, social, and economic problems in developing countries. Our objective was to describe the prevalence and risk factors of RTIs in a population based sample of women aged 18-45 years. METHOD: 2494 women of 3000 randomly selected from the population defined by a primary health centre catchment area consented to participate. Participants were interviewed regarding complaints and risk factors. Laboratory specimens were collected for the diagnosis of RTIs. Analyses of risk factors were carried out separately for the outcomes of sexually transmitted infections: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis; and endogenous infections: bacterial vaginosis (BV) and candida. RESULTS: Endogenous infections were relatively common (BV 17.8%; candida 8.5%), and sexually transmitted infections (STI) were infrequent (4.2%). Factors indicative of poverty and marginalisation were associated with STIs and BV. Gender disadvantage, particularly spousal violence, was associated with BV, while concern about a husband's extramarital relationships, an indicator of sexual risk, was associated with STI. Husband's discharge was strongly associated with STI, and a non-white vaginal discharge was associated with both STI and BV. Condom use and oral contraceptive use were associated with a reduced risk of BV. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the population burden of RTIs is attributed to endogenous infections. Socioeconomic deprivation and gender disadvantage are associated with raised risk for BV, while the risk factors for STIs indicated that disadvantaged women were likely to be infected by their husbands."
28780876,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Tobacco smoking has a range of known and predictable adverse outcomes, and across the world sustained smoking reduction campaigns are targeted towards reducing individual and public risk and harm. Conversely, more than 87 million women, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, use smokeless tobacco, yet the research examining the effect of this form of tobacco exposure on women is remarkably scant. In central Australia, the chewing of wild <i>Nicotiana</i> spp., a tobacco plant, commonly known as <i>pituri</i> and <i>mingkulpa</i>, is practised by Aboriginal groups across a broad geographical area. Until recently, there had been no health research conducted on the effects of chewing <i>pituri. METHODS: This article reports on one component of a multidimensional <i>pituri</i> research agenda. A narrative approach utilising the methodology of the Learning Circle was used to interview three key senior central Australian Aboriginal women representative of three large geographical language groupings. The participants were selected by a regional Aboriginal women's organisation. With the assistance of interpreters, a semistructured interview, and specific trigger resources, participants provided responses to enable an understanding of the women's ethnobotanical <i>pituri</i> knowledge and practices around the use of <i>pituri</i> within the context of Aboriginal women's lives. Data were transcribed, and by using a constant comparison analysis, emergent themes were categorised. The draft findings and manuscript were translated into the participants' language and validated by the participants. RESULTS: Three themes around <i>pituri</i> emerged: (a) the plants, preparation and use; (b) individual health and wellbeing; and (c) family and community connectedness. The findings demonstrated similar participant ethnobotanical knowledge and practices across the geographical area. The participants clearly articulated the ethnopharmacological knowledge associated with mixing <i>pituri</i> with wood ash to facilitate the extraction of nicotine from <i>Nicotiana </i>spp., the results of which were biochemically verified. The participants catalogued the pleasurable and desired effects obtained from <i>pituri</i> use, the miscellaneous uses of <i>pituri</i>, as well as the adverse effects of <i>pituri</i> overdose and toxicity, the catalogue of which matched those of nicotine. The participants' overarching <i>pituri</i> theme was related to the inherent role <i>pituri</i> has in the connectiveness of people to family, friends and community. CONCLUSIONS: Central Australian Aboriginal women have a firmly established knowledge and understanding of the pharmacological principles related to the content of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. and the extraction of nicotine from the plant. Widespread use of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. as a chewing tobacco by Aboriginal populations in the southern, central and western desert regions of Australia is attested to by participants who assert that <i>everyone uses it</i>, with girls in these remote areas commencing use between 5 and 7 years of age. Central Australian Aboriginal people who chew <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. do not consider it to be a tobacco plant, and will strongly refute that they are tobacco users. Central Australian Aboriginal people do not consider that the Western health information regarding tobacco (as a smoked product) is applicable or aligned to their use of <i>pituri</i>. <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. users will deny tobacco use at health assessment. There is a requirement to develop and provide health information on a broader range of tobacco and nicotine products in ways that are considered credible by the Aboriginal population. Health messages around <i>pituri</i> use need to account for the dominant role that <i>pituri</i> occupies in the context of central Australian Aboriginal women's lives.<br /> Information for readers: A consultative organisation of Aboriginal women has as a strategic intent and operational agenda the improvement of Aboriginal women's and children's health across the research region. The group seeks opportunities to enhance their knowledge based on legitimate collaborative research; accordingly, they sought to participate in a range of research activities regarding the use of <i>pituri</i> and women's health outcomes. Of particular note, the group's participants chose to be identified by name in the publication of this research activity. In this article, the term 'Aboriginal' has been chosen by the central Australian women to refer to both themselves and the Aboriginal people in their communities; 'Indigenous' has been chosen to refer to the wider Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The term <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. is used when referring to the plants from a Western perspective; <i>pituri</i> is used when referring to the plants, the tobacco quid, and the practice of chewing from a general Aboriginal perspective; and <i>mingkulpa</i> is used when the participants are voicing their specific knowledge and practices."
28385465,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea was a serious threat to public health, and was exacerbated by the inappropriate responses of major institutions and the public. This study examined the sources of confusion during the MERS outbreak and identified the factors that can affect people's behavior. METHODS: An online survey of the risk perception of university students in South Korea was performed after the epidemic had peaked. The questionnaire addressed the major social determinants in South Korea during the MERS epidemic. The analysis included data from 1,470 subjects who provided complete answers. RESULTS: The students had 53.5% of the essential knowledge about MERS. Women showed higher risk perception than men, and trust in the media was positively associated with risk perception (P < .001). Additionally, risk perception was positively associated with overreaction by the public (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 2.17-3.60; P < .001). These findings suggest that media content affected the public's perception of MERS risk and that perception of a high level of risk led to overreaction. CONCLUSIONS: Risk perception was associated with most of the social factors examined and overreaction by the public. Therefore, providing accurate information and data to the public, establishing trust, and facilitating the development of an attitude will all be important in future crises."
18050152,1,a,"This paper contributes to analysing and understanding the demand for (social) health insurance of informal sector workers in Kenya by assessing their perceptions and knowledge of and concerns regarding health insurance and the Kenyan National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). It serves to explore how informal sector workers could be integrated into the NHIF. To collect data, focus group discussions were held with organized groups of informal sector workers of different types across the country, backed up by a self-administered questionnaire completed by heads of NHIF area branch offices. It was found that the most critical barrier to NHIF enrollment is the lack of knowledge of informal sector workers about the NHIF, its enrollment option and procedures for informal sector workers. Inability to pay is a critical factor for some, but people were, in principle, interested in health insurance, and thus willing to pay for it. In sum, the mix of demand-side determinants for enrolling in the NHIF is not as complex as expected. This is good news, as these demand-side determinants can be addressed with a well-designed strategy, focusing on awareness raising and information, improvement of insurance design features and setting differentiated and affordable contribution rates."
16846943,1,a,"Married women in India are increasingly at risk of HIV, often due to their husbands' extramarital sexual behaviour. Topical microbicides may provide protection to women who are unable to negotiate condom use. During the formative phase of a study to develop measures related to microbicide acceptability, we conducted in-depth interviews with 14 'high-risk' and 16 'low-risk' married women and 15 husbands. Some participants had recently completed a 2-week microbicide safety trial. A sequence of in-depth interviews with each participant explored the context of microbicide acceptability, including perceptions of couple harmony, vulnerability to HIV, sexual power, and ability to control life events. Women's perceptions of control and sexual power influenced attitudes towards microbicide use. HIV risk was most commonly associated with partner infidelity and easily detected, according to both men and women, by a lack of marital harmony. Despite this, high-risk women denied perceiving HIV risk until confronted with specific evidence of a husband's positive HIV or STI diagnosis. This study provides an in-depth examination of HIV risk for Indian married women, identifying potential determinants of microbicide use, and providing guidance for the development of psychometric scales to measure couple harmony, HIV risk perception, and sexual power and control."
15331814,1,a,"Each year, up to three million deaths due to malaria and close to five billion episodes of clinical illness possibly meriting antimalarial therapy occur throughout the world, with Africa having more than 90% of this burden. Almost 3% of disability adjusted life years are due to malaria mortality globally, 10% in Africa. New information is presented in this supplement on malaria-related perinatal mortality, occurrence of human immunodeficiency virus in pregnancy, undernutrition, and neurologic, cognitive, and developmental sequelae. The entomologic determinants of transmission and uses of modeling for program planning and disease prediction and prevention are discussed. New data are presented from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe on the increasing urban malaria problem and on epidemic malaria. Between 6% and 28% of the malaria burden may occur in cities, which comprise less than 2% of the African surface. Macroeconomic projections show that the costs are far greater than the costs of individual cases, with a substantial deleterious impact of malaria on schooling of patients, external investments into endemic countries, and tourism. Poor populations are at greatest risk; 58% of the cases occur in the poorest 20% of the world's population and these patients receive the worst care and have catastrophic economic consequences from their illness. This social vulnerability requires better understanding for improving deployment, access, quality, and use of effective interventions. Studies from Ghana and elsewhere indicate that for every patient with febrile illness assumed to be malaria seen in health facilities, 4-5 episodes occur in the community. Effective actions for malaria control mandate rational public policies; market forces, which often drive sales and use of drugs and other interventions, are unlikely to guarantee their use. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria is rapidly gaining acceptance as an effective approach for countering the spread and intensity of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, and other antimalarial drugs. Although costly, ACT ($1.20-2.50 per adult treatment) becomes more cost-effective as resistance to alternative drugs increases; early use of ACT may delay development of resistance to these drugs and prevent the medical toll associated with use of ineffective drugs. The burden of malaria in one district in Tanzania has not decreased since the primary health care approach replaced the vertical malaria control efforts of the 1960s. Despite decentralization, this situation resulted, in part, from weak district management capacity, poor coordination, inadequate monitoring, and lack of training of key staff. Experience in the Solomon Islands showed that spraying with DDT, use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), and health education were all associated with disease reduction. The use of nets permitted a reduction in DDT spraying, but could not replace it without an increased malaria incidence. Baseline data and reliable monitoring of key outcome indicators are needed to measure whether the ambitious goals for the control of malaria and other diseases has occurred. Such systems are being used for evidence-based decision making in Tanzania and several other countries. Baseline cluster sampling surveys in several countries across Africa indicate that only 53% of the children with febrile illness in malarious areas are being treated; chloroquine (CQ) is used 84% of the time, even where the drug may be ineffective. Insecticide-treated bed nets were used only 2% of the time by children less than five years of age. Progress in malaria vaccine research has been substantial over the past five years; 35 candidate malaria vaccines are in development, many of which are in clinical trials. Development of new vaccines and drugs has been the result of increased investments and formation of public-private partnerships. Before malaria vaccine becomes deployed, consideration must be given to disease burden, cost-effectiveness, financing, delivery systems, and approval by regulatory agencies. Key to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness will be collection and prompt analysis of epidemiologic information. Training of persons in every aspect of malaria research and control is essential for programs to succeed. The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) is actively promoting research capacity strengthening and has established networks of institutions and scientists throughout the African continent, most of whom are now linked by modern information-sharing networks. Evidence over the past century is that successful control malaria programs have been linked to strong research activities. To ensure effective coordination and cooperation between the growing number of research and control coalitions forming in support of malaria activities, an umbrella group is needed. With continued support for scientists and control workers globally, particularly in low-income malarious countries, the long-deferred dream of malaria elimination can become a reality."
11804992,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Although there is evidence that emotionally stressful behavior can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis, there is less data to support the notion that affiliative social behavior can slow disease progression. The present study examines the influence of social environment on the progression of atherosclerosis in the Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit, a model that spontaneously develops lesions because of a genetic defect in lipoprotein clearance. METHODS AND RESULTS: WHHL rabbits were assigned to 1 of 3 social or behavioral groups: an unstable group, in which unfamiliar rabbits were paired daily, with the pairing switched each week; a stable group, in which littermates were paired daily for the entire study; and an individually caged group. The stable group exhibited more affiliative social behavior and less agonistic behavior than the unstable group and significantly less aortic atherosclerosis than each of the other 2 groups. Although the unstable and individually caged groups had comparable aortic lesion areas, the severity of the disease progressed faster in the unstable group, as indexed by a larger area of calcification and increased fibrous cap thickness in complex lesions. The unstable group showed increased agonistic behavior and signs of chronic adrenocortical and gonadal activation, whereas the individually caged group was relatively sedentary, had low glucocorticoid levels, and was hyperinsulinemic compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that social environment can slow, as well as accelerate, the progression of atherosclerosis. It also emphasizes the importance of behavioral factors in atherogenesis, even in a model of disease with strong genetic determinants."
15715914,1,a,"BACKGROUND: About half of all newly presented episodes of shoulder complaints (SC) in general practice are reported to last for at least six months. Early interventions aimed at the psychological and social determinants of SC are not common in general practice, although such interventions might prevent the development of chronic SC. The Education and Activation Programme (EAP) consists of an educational part and a time-contingent activation part. The aim of the EAP is to provide patients with the proper cognitions by means of education, and to stimulate adequate behaviour through advice on activities of daily living. DESIGN: The article describes the design of a randomised clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an EAP in addition to usual care, compared to usual care only, in the prevention of chronic SC after six months. It also describes the analysis of the cost and effect balance. Patients suffering from SC for less than three months are recruited in general practice and through open recruitment. A trained general practitioner or a trained therapist administers the EAP.Primary outcome measures are patient-perceived recovery, measured by self-assessment on a seven-point scale, and functional limitations in activities of daily living. Questionnaires are used to study baseline measures, prognostic measures, process measures and outcome measures. DISCUSSION: The inclusion of patients in the study lasted until December 31st 2003. Data collection is to end in June 2004."
12975677,1,a,"OBJECTIVES: Senescence for some elderly people is a phase of with development and satisfaction, whereas for others is a negative stage of life. The determinants of a good quality of life in old age vary from person to person. The aims of this study were to identify 1) the prevalence of octogenarian people who evaluate their current life as being mainly characterized by a positive quality and 2) which were the domains that they identified as being the determinants of this positive quality. A same parallel study was conducted with subjects who evaluated senescence as a preponderantly negative experience. METHODS: A random and representative sample of 35% of the octogenarian people, living residing in the community, was selected among the dwellers of the city of Veranopolis, state of Rio Grande do Sul. A semi-structured questionnaire on quality of life quality was applied as well as the scale of depressive symptoms Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the index of general health Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). RESULTS: Slightly more than half of the studied sample (57%) defined their current quality of life with positive evaluations, whereas 18% presented a negative evaluation of it. A group 0f 25% defined their current lives as neutral or having both values (positive and negative). Those who were dissatisfied presented more health problems according to the CIRS and more depressive symptoms when evaluated by the GDS. Satisfied subjects ones had different reasons to justify this state, however, the dissatisfied had mainly the lack of health as a reason for their suffering. The main source of reported daily well-being was the involvement with rural or domestic activities. Among the interviewed, lack of health was the main source for not presenting well-being, although there was interpersonal variability regarding what each subject considered as loss of health. CONCLUSION: Possibly, for the elderly subjects a negative quality of life is equivalent to loss of health and a positive life quality is equivalent to a greater range of categories such as activity, income, social life and relationship with the family, categories which differed from subject to subject. Therefore, health seems to be a good indicator of negative quality of life, though an insufficient indicator of successful elderliness."
