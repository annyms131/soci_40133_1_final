19237481,"Editorial: media exploitation, racism and health.","The BBC comedy show ;Harry and Paul' sparked media controversy in the UK and around the world for inciting stereotyped racial discrimination, vulgarity and violation of human rights when it portrayed a Filipino domestic worker as a sex toy in Episode 4 of the series. This incident raises the issue concerning the media's role in framing social issues and how it affects the wider determinants of health. There is a need for health psychology as an academic discipline to engage more in these issues. The Journal of Health Psychology provides a unique platform for discussion and debate of perspectives on racism, the media and health.",Journal of health psychology,2009 Mar,England,2009,00
18775816,Does job strain mediate the effect of socioeconomic group on smoking behaviour? The impact of different health policies in Denmark and Sweden.,"AIMS: The aim was to compare the impact of socioeconomic groups (SEG) on the risk of being a daily smoker or quitter, and to investigate whether the potentially mediating effect of psychosocial working conditions was similar in the Danish and the Swedish populations. METHODS: The study populations consisted of 10,049 employed participants, aged 18-64 years, 51% women, randomly selected from the general populations in the Oresund region, 1999-2000. Odds ratios (OR) for daily-smokers and ""non-quitters'' were computed for two age-groups and two SEGs in gender specific models, stratified by country. The association between SEG, current smoking, quitting, and influence at work, job demand and jobstrain, respectively, was tested by means of logistic regression. RESULTS: The contextual determinants defined by country had a different effect on smoking prevalence among men and women and among age groups. Low influence and job strain seemed to have an effect on smoking among Danish women, but not among Swedish women. The OR of being a daily smoker were higher in men than women among younger Danes, but higher in women than men among Swedes. The prevalence of low influence, high demand and job strain was higher and more socially skewed among the Swedes, but did not mediate the effect of SEG on smoking behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The smoking prevalence was lower and the quit-rates higher among Swedes than Danes. Both countries had social differences in smoking that in absolute terms were rather similar, but in relative terms were higher in Sweden. The mediating effect of psychosocial working conditions was lacking. The determinants of smoking behaviours must be found somewhere else in the social and cultural context.",Scandinavian journal of public health,2008 Aug,Sweden,2008,00
10795931,Quo vadis neurohypophysial hormone research?,"Here we highlight just a few of the outstanding questions in the field of neurohypophysial hormones that we envisage will be addressed successfully in the new millennium. To begin, we focus on the regulation of receptors. Despite intensive investigation with new drugs, molecular modelling and transgenic models, the determinants of receptor selectivity remain elusive; there may even be more vasopressin or oxytocin receptor subtypes to be discovered. We discuss the controversy over the interesting studies that indicate modulation of oxytocin receptor-binding by steroids. Oxytocin and vasopressin release and action in the brain are discussed from several aspects. Dendritically released oxytocin acting locally is important for the milk ejection reflex, and similarly released vasopressin is important in regulating patterning of vasopressin neurone activity. Such dendritically released oxytocin and vasopressin is likely to be important in paracrine modulation of neural circuitry involved in neuroendocrine control, and for a range of behaviours. Is it possible that the whole range of behaviours that comprise 'social' (or 'anti-social') or 'maternal' behaviour can be engineered by modifying the expression of just these one or two peptides and their receptors? However, whether gene expression and knockout approaches will answer all the open questions about the real functions of oxytocin and vasopressin remains to be shown.",Experimental physiology,2000 Mar,England,2000,00
12243699,[Latin American social medicine: contributions and challenges].,"This piece presents and analyzes a number of issues related to social medicine: the context of the emergence of social medicine; the differences between social medicine and public health; the theories, methods, and debates in social medicine; the main subjects or problems considered in social medicine; and the difficulties of disseminating the concepts of social medicine among English-speaking persons and among medical and public health professionals in general. Latin American social medicine has challenged other views by contributing to an understanding of the determinants of the health-disease-health care process and by using theories, methods, and techniques that are little known in the field of public health. Introducing Latin American social medicine, especially among English speakers, will be difficult due to the conceptual complexity of this field for persons who are accustomed to the theoretical framework of public health and medicine and also due to skepticism concerning research coming from the Third World. A multidisciplinary team is facing this challenge through two primary initiatives: 1) the creation of an Internet portal and database where there are structured abstracts in English, Portuguese, and Spanish of books, book chapters, and articles on social medicine and 2) the electronic publication of two journals on Latin American social medicine.",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,2002 Aug,United States,2002,00
17991114,Employee entitlements during pregnancy and maternal psychological well-being.,"BACKGROUND: Antenatal psychological well-being is multifactorially determined, including by social circumstances. Evidence suggests that workplace conditions are salient determinants of mental health, but it is not known whether employment conditions influence antenatal psychological well-being. AIMS: To investigate the relationship between employment conditions and antenatal psychological well-being in Australian women. METHODS: A sociodemographically diverse consecutive cohort of employed nulliparous women was recruited in late pregnancy. Data were collected by a structured interview assessing sociodemographic characteristics, employment arrangements, experience of pregnancy-related discrimination, and access to maternity leave entitlements. Participants completed two standardised psychometric measures of maternal mood: the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) and the Profile of Mood States (PoMS). Comparisons of self-reported mood were made between women by experience of workplace adversity, using a composite measure of workplace events. RESULTS: Of 205 eligible women, 165 agreed to participate. Of these, 114 of 165 (69%) reported at least one form of workplace adversity during pregnancy. More women without private health insurance (78%) reported workplace adversity than those who were privately insured (57%) (chi2(1)=6.95, P=0.008). Women experiencing workplace adversity had significantly worse psychological well-being as indicated by the EDS score (7.7+/-5.1) than those who were experiencing no workplace adversity (5.5+/-3.4), mean difference (95% CI)=-2.2 (-3.7 to -0.8), P=0.003. Similar results were reported for the PoMS. CONCLUSIONS: Workplace adversity during pregnancy is associated with poorer maternal psychological well-being. Workplace conditions and entitlements are salient factors for consideration in assessments of antenatal psychosocial well-being.",The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,2007 Dec,Australia,2007,00
10942445,Determinants of leisure time physical activity in rural compared with urban older and ethnically diverse women in the United States.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Determinants of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) in rural middle aged and older women of diverse racial and ethnic groups are not well understood. This study examined: (1) urban-rural differences in LTPA by sociodemographic factors, (2) urban-rural differences in LTPA determinants, and (3) the pattern of relations between LTPA determinants and LTPA. DESIGN: A modified version of the sampling plan of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) was used. Zip codes were selected with 20% or more of each of the following race/ethnic groups: African American, American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN), and Hispanic. A comparison group of white women were also surveyed using standard BRFSS techniques. PARTICIPANTS: Rural (n=1242) and urban (n=1096) women aged 40 years and older from the US Women's Determinants Study. MAIN RESULTS: Rural women, especially Southern and less educated women, were more sedentary than urban women. Rural women reported more personal barriers to LTPA, cited caregiving duties as their top barrier (compared with lack of time for urban women), and had greater body mass indices. Rural women were less likely to report sidewalks, streetlights, high crime, access to facilities, and frequently seeing others exercise in their neighbourhood. Multivariate correlates of sedentary behaviour in rural women were AI/AN and African American race, older age, less education, lack of enjoyable scenery, not frequently seeing others exercise, greater barriers, and less social support (p<0.05); and in urban women, older age, greater barriers, less social support (p<0.05), and less education (p<0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Rural and urban women seem to face different barriers and enablers to LTPA, and have a different pattern of determinants, thus providing useful information for designing more targeted interventions.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2000 Sep,England,2000,00
11571013,Reducing social vulnerability to HIV/AIDS: models of care and their impact in resource-poor settings.,"There has been an increasing understanding of the social, economic, cultural and political factors that have shaped the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It has been widely recognized that in order to have effective prevention programmes for HIV/AIDS, the broader determinants of health must be addressed. Concurrently, a deeper understanding of personal and societal vulnerability to HIV/AIDS has emerged. Some prevention efforts have expanded their focus, addressing not only individual risk factors and behaviour, but also social justice and including community mobilization activities to address the wider context of the disease. However, the transition to an expanded approach to mitigating the effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has not been complete. There is little evidence that care and support strategies have systematically tried to address these concepts. While the role care plays in prevention is considered vital, viewing models of care in terms of their impact on the social vulnerability of certain groups to HIV/AIDS has been largely neglected. Yet appropriate care programmes that help reduce vulnerability will arguably also make the greatest contribution for prevention. Drawing on examples of the role social vulnerability has played in prevention efforts, this paper evaluates the impact of HIV/AIDS care models on socially vulnerable groups, such as women and children.",AIDS care,2001 Oct,England,2001,00
17049075,Determinants of cardiovascular disease and other non-communicable diseases in Central and Eastern Europe: rationale and design of the HAPIEE study.,"BACKGROUND: Over the last five decades, a wide gap in mortality opened between western and eastern Europe; this gap increased further after the dramatic fluctuations in mortality in the former Soviet Union (FSU) in the 1990s. Recent rapid increases in mortality among lower socioeconomic groups in eastern Europe suggests that socioeconomic factors are powerful determinants of mortality in these populations but the more proximal factors linking the social conditions with health remain unclear. The HAPIEE (Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe) study is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the effect of classical and non-conventional risk factors and social and psychosocial factors on cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases in eastern Europe and the FSU. The main hypotheses of the HAPIEE study relate to the role of alcohol, nutrition and psychosocial factors. METHODS AND DESIGN: The HAPIEE study comprises four cohorts in Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania; each consists of a random sample of men and women aged 45-69 years old at baseline, stratified by gender and 5 year age groups, and selected from population registers. The total planned sample size is 36,500 individuals. Baseline information from the Czech Republic, Russia and Poland was collected in 2002-2005 and includes data on health, lifestyle, diet (food frequency), socioeconomic circumstances and psychosocial factors. A short examination included measurement of anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, lung function and cognitive function, and a fasting venous blood sample. Re-examination of the cohorts in 2006-2008 focuses on healthy ageing and economic well-being using face-to-face computer assisted personal interviews. Recruitment of the Lithuanian cohort is ongoing, with baseline and re-examination data being collected simultaneously. All cohorts are being followed up for mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events. DISCUSSION: The HAPIEE study will provide important new insights into social, behavioural and biological factors influencing mortality and cardiovascular risk in the region.",BMC public health,2006 Oct 18,England,2006,00
17279404,Variations in activity and practice patterns: a French study for GPs.,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the different practice profiles of general practitioners (GPs) in order to test the hypothesis of heterogeneity in physician behaviour. DATA: For the year 2000, 4,660 GPs from two regions in France. VARIABLES: volume and structure of the physicians' medical activity, income level, personal characteristics, socioeconomic and geographical environment, characteristics of their patients. METHODS: A cluster analysis to identify different practice profiles and a regression analysis to display the determinants of the physicians' activity. RESULTS: Four different homogeneous groups can be identified, each one associating a physician's level of activity to his socioeconomic status. The level and the intensity of medical activity depend on individual factors, patients' characteristics as well as the socioeconomic context. CONCLUSIONS: There is no uniformity in the way GPs practice medicine. An immediate consequence is that any cost-containment measure that is applied uniformly to all GPs inevitably results in different outcomes according to the physicians' category type.",The European journal of health economics : HEPAC : health economics in prevention and care,2007 Sep,Germany,2007,00
17606277,Successful ageing in an area of deprivation: part 2--a quantitative exploration of the role of personality and beliefs in good health in old age.,"OBJECTIVES: This paper presents further analysis of a study aimed at examining the determinants of good health and successful ageing in an area of deprivation. In this paper we report findings from the quantitative data related to two of the original eight research questions: (1) To what extent can health in old age be attributed to psychological/personality variables? and (2) What is the role of religious beliefs and 'spirituality' in healthy ageing? STUDY DESIGN: In-depth interview study in which standardized measures of personality and beliefs were administered, along with measures of beliefs devised for the study. METHODS: One hundred matched pairs of healthy and unhealthy 'agers' were interviewed face-to-face. Healthy ageing was assessed in terms of hospital morbidity and self-reported health. The sample comprised 106 males and 94 females (53 male matched pairs and 47 female matched pairs) ranging in age from 70 to 90 years of age with the majority (n=165) falling into the 71-80 age group and the remaining 35 in the 81-90 age group. All study participants were survivors of the Paisley/Renfrew (MIDSPAN) survey, a longitudinal study commenced in 1972 with continuous recording of morbidity and mortality since. Questionnaires assessing extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism, health locus of control, sense of coherence, optimism, and religiosity were filled in by participants during the interviews. RESULTS: Compared to the unhealthy group, the healthy participants were less neurotic, more likely to endorse an internal locus of control belief and less likely to endorse a powerful others locus of control belief, and to report a greater sense of coherence. The unhealthy group scored higher on the religiosity/spirituality measure devised for this study. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are interesting in that, although they cannot address the issue of cause and effect, the very fact that the personality traits measured in this study were linked to health status in old age, further strengthens the argument that in general practice and hospital settings, an understanding of personality aids practitioners in dealing with patients. Finally, with the growing body of evidence that personality traits have a high degree of heritability, the routine gathering of information on personality traits would aid epidemiologists in their understanding of the determinants of healthy and successful ageing.",Public health,2007 Nov,Netherlands,2007,00
18575378,"Insight and psychosis: comparing the perspectives of patient, entourage and clinician.","BACKGROUND: The construct of insight in psychosis assumes congruence between patient and clinician views of the meaning of symptoms and experience. Current definitions and measures of insight do not give systematic attention to the impact of interpersonal, cultural and socio-economic contexts. AIMS: We hypothesized that socio-cultural factors influence insight in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: We tested this hypothesis through comparison of insight in 18 triads, each composed of a patient, a family member and a clinician. The sample consisted of patients who were first diagnosed with psychosis in the last two years, and who were either immigrants from Africa or the Caribbean Islands, or Canadian born. Insight was assessed by analysis of narratives collected from patients, family members and clinicians for a research project on the negotiation of treatment. Each narrative was scored for insight along multiple dimensions with the Extracted Insight Scale (EIS), developed for this project. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation of insight on the EIS between patients and family members (r= 0.51, p= 0.03) but not between patient and clinician or family and clinician. The mean levels of insight across the three groups were comparable. Qualitative analysis of the illness narratives suggested that insight was based on the meanings constructed around psychotic experiences and that the process of interpreting and attributing psychotic experiences reflected each person's cultural background, life experiences, and other social determinants, especially stigma. CONCLUSION: Forms of insight can occur in the context of discordance or disagreement with the clinician's opinion. We present a testable model of the sociocultural determinants of insight that can guide future studies.",The International journal of social psychiatry,2008 May,England,2008,00
17665706,Motuca healthy municipality project: building together a better future.,"The Brazilian Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Municipality of Motuca and the School of Public Health at the University of Sao Paulo set up in 2002 the Motuca Healthy Municipality project with the aim of improving the population's health and quality of life. The project used a participatory and holistic approach, which addressed the social determinants and structural inequities, and called for strategies of community empowerment, social participation, intersectoral networking and good governance. All local and public actors from rural and urban areas were consulted and participated in the project to collect information on the living conditions and challenges to better wellbeing. This participatory methodology allowed in turn developing cultural and socially appropriate initiatives to improve local governance and standards of living on a long-term basis. Although there is still the challenge to maintain the momentum and reenergize the efforts, the project serves as a model for further efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of participatory intervention and research methodologies to promote health and well-being in communities.",Promotion & education,2007,England,2007,00
11470388,Institutionalization in the elderly: the role of chronic diseases and dementia. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data from a population-based study.,"A population-based study of 1810 persons, aged 75+, was investigated to evaluate the role of dementia and other chronic diseases as determinants of institutionalization in the elderly. The study population was examined at baseline and after a 3-year interval. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, functional dependence, dementia, cerebrovascular disease and hip fracture were associated with living in an institution at baseline. Additionally, functional dependence, hip fracture and dementia were also associated with moving to an institution during the 3-year follow-up. In a similar analysis, including only nondemented subjects, the Mini-Mental State Examination emerged as one of the strongest determinants. The population attributable risk percentage of institutionalization during the 3-year follow-up due to dementia was 61%. This study confirms that dementia and cognitive impairment are the main contributors to institutionalization in the elderly, independently of their sociodemographic status, social network, or functional status.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,2001 Aug,United States,2001,00
19191821,Is there equity in oral healthcare utilization: experience after achieving Universal Coverage.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the socioeconomic-related (in)equality and horizontal (in)equity in oral healthcare utilization among Thai adults after Universal Coverage (UC) policy implemented nationwide, and to decompose the source of inequality in utilization. Further, to identify the determinants that effect to out-of-pocket payments for oral healthcare. METHODS: Using the data of 32748, Thai adults aged 15 years and over from nationally representative Health and Welfare Survey and Socio-Economic Survey in 2006. This study employs concentration index (CI) and horizontal inequity index (HI) to measure the socioeconomic-related inequality and horizontal inequity in oral healthcare utilization, respectively. Further, employing decomposition method to identify the sources of inequality comprising of a contribution of income, need determinants (i.e. self-assessed oral health, demographic characteristics), non-need determinants (i.e.working status, educational level attainment, type of insurance entitlement, geographic characteristics and marital status) and residual term. Two-part model is used to determine the factors effect to out-of-pocket payments for oral healthcare. RESULTS: There are the pro-rich inequality and inequity in oral healthcare utilization among Thais as indicated by significantly positive values of CI (=0.199) and HI (=0.206). The poor are more likely to access and utilize services at subsidized public facility particularly community hospital, as opposed to the better-off who tend to utilize services at private facility. Income and non-need determinants principally contribute to the pro-poor in public sector utilization, unlike pro-rich in private sector utilization. Need factors account for most of the pro-poor utilization. Type of treatment obtained and insurance used in the last visit are the substantial determinants effect to incurring out-of-pocket payments for oral healthcare. CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding the UC policy implementation made impressive strides toward improving of welfare coverage and an increase in accessibility of health services among Thais, inequality and inequity in oral healthcare utilization persist even when the country achieved universal coverage. Decomposition analyses demonstrate the association of each determinant to inequality in utilization which provides information for policy amendment to achieve the goal of equity in healthcare system.",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,2009 Feb,Denmark,2009,00
19373014,"Gender, sex, and HIV: how well are we addressing the imbalance?","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Heightened interest in sex and gender differences in HIV warrant a review of the status of current understanding of their determinants and progress in addressing them. RECENT FINDINGS: The proportion of women among people living with HIV continues to increase in most countries; however, women are proportionately more likely to be on antiretroviral treatment than are men. Inadequate representation of women in clinical trials is compounding the dearth of information on sex-based differences in response to life prolonging antiretroviral medication. Progress in addressing gender inequalities and inequities, though incremental, is too slow to reach Millennium Development Goal 6 of halting and reversing the HIV epidemic by 2015. Structural determinants, such as food insufficiency, poverty, decreased access to credit, and inequitable inheritance practices, continue to act with social gender norms to shape the increased risk of exposure to HIV that women and adolescent girls face in many settings. SUMMARY: Special measures should be taken to overcome barriers and facilitate enrolment and retention of women in biomedical HIV prevention and treatment trials. Law reform, economic empowerment, gender transformative work, and political mobilization are needed if women and men are to share the power, influence, rights, responsibilities, and opportunities that can create resilience to HIV.",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,2008 Jul,United States,2008,00

16904413,Contraceptive failures and determinants of emergency contraception use.,"OBJECTIVES: Two years after emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) were made available without prescription in France, we investigated the determinants of ECP use in a representative sample of women at risk for unintended pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This study is based on data collected from a population-based cohort exploring contraceptive practices and abortion (N=2863). RESULTS: Among the 706 women at risk for unintended pregnancy during the first year of follow-up (2001), only 11.1% used ECPs. Women in stable relationships or using the same contraceptive method during the year were less likely to use ECPs than other women. The study also demonstrates that detailed knowledge of ECPs increases the probability of its subsequent use. CONCLUSIONS: Given the low frequency of ECP use in cases of unintended pregnancy risk, these results suggest that information campaigns should be targeted not only at women with irregular contraceptive practices but also at women who experience errors in the use of their regular contraceptive method.",Contraception,2006 Sep,United States,2006,00
19157764,Preventing obesity: challenges and pitfalls for health promotion.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore challenges to health promotion strategies against obesity, with special attention to the Scandinavian context. METHODS: Analytic induction, a procedure for verifying theories and propositions, based on purposefully selected literature references, with subsequent critical reflection. RESULTS: Health promotion efforts against obesity face challenges related to the unequal distribution of vulnerability to weight gain within the population, and to the complex neuroregulatory determinants that explain why obesity is not just a simple matter of lifestyle. Cultural understandings of identity and morality may create victim blaming and disempowerment, thus obstructing clinical health promotion strategies for weight control. Finally, the conceptual validity of obesity measurements and their predictive power deserves attention. CONCLUSION: Preventing obesity is difficult. Awareness of individual vulnerability and neurobiological mechanisms that lead to weight gain must be taken into account when strategies for health promotion are developed. These strategies must transcend a simplistic energy balance view. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinical health promotion needs to be highly individualized and tailored. Preventing weight gain requires attention to the person's sociodemographic, cultural and genetic characteristics. Cultural trends such as sedentary lifestyles and the nutrition transition should be counteracted without turning body weight control into a question of morality and inferior identity.",Patient education and counseling,2009 Aug,Ireland,2009,00
16529167,[A search for psychobiological determinants of anxiety disorders].,"UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to search for measurable, objective, and reproducible biological factors such as gene polymorphisms that increase the risk of an anxiety disorder, distinguishing personality traits predisposing to the anxiety disorder. The material comprised 103 patients fulfilling criteria of an anxiety disorder (panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders, phobic disorders) and a control group of 100 subjects matched for age and free of neuropsychiaric disease. METHODS: The genes studied were: COMT (catechol-oxygen-methyltransferase), MAO-A (monoamine oxidase A), and 5-HTT-LPR (serotonine transporter). Isolation of human genomic DNA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis on agarose gel were part of the study protocol. Anxiety disorders were diagnosed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The following psychometric tests were applied: TCI (R. Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory), R. B. Cattell's Inventory, C. D. Spielberger's questionnaire, and Beck's depression scale. RESULTS: There were no associations of COMT, MAO-A, and 5-HTT-LPR gene polymorphisms with anxiety disorders in the study and control groups. A higher level of anxiety as a ""status"" and as a ""trait"" were revealed in both groups (p < 0.001). TCI scales and subscales, as well as Cattell's personality factors, demonstrated significant differences between patients with anxiety disorders and controls. Depression was more severe in patients with anxiety disorders (p < 0.001). An association of COMT gene polymorphism with simple phobia (p < 0.004) was revealed. Mutation of 5-HTT-LPR carr tended to be more frequent (p < 0.07) among patients with generalized anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Gene mutations that may account for increased risk of generalized anxiety, phobic disorder (simple and social), and agoraphobia were found, as well as gene variants determining temperament traits typical for patients with anxiety disorders. The depression level was higher in patients with anxiety disorders. TCI and Cattell's personality inventory distinguish personality traits typical for such patients.",Annales Academiae Medicae Stetinensis,2004,Poland,2004,00

Seventy-nine members (24%) and 26 coordinators (45%) were included in the study. Three incomplete questionnaires (from prenatal program members) were discarded. Sixty-one percent of members who reported income level and family size (n=61) had incomes below the low-income cut-off. Fifty-eight members (73%) reported improvements in their lives because of the program. Sixty-four members (81%) perceived they learned to feed their families healthier foods. The members reported their fruit and vegetable consumption before and since joining a collective kitchen, and the proportion of those consuming at least five fruit and vegetable servings a day rose from 29% to 47%. The most common reasons for joining this program concerned social interactions and support. Over 90% of the coordinators perceived that they were competent to coordinate a kitchen. The results indicate that the collective kitchens program addresses several health determinants, and may increase members' capacity to attain food security and to achieve improved nutritional health.",Canadian journal of dietetic practice and research : a publication of Dietitians of Canada = Revue canadienne de la pratique et de la recherche en dietetique : une publication des Dietetistes du Canada,2004 Summer,Canada,2004,00
18821987,"Linking oral health, general health, and quality of life.","The aim of this work was to assess the association among oral health, general health, and quality of life (QoL). The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-49) and the RAND-36 were distributed amongst 118 psychology freshmen. Additionally, two single items self-rated general health (SRGH) and self-rated oral health (SROH) - were administered. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to evaluate differences between SRGH and SROH categories, regarding OHIP subscale scores and RAND subscale scores. More than 75% of the subjects rated their oral and general health as good. Mean OHIP scores and RAND scores indicated a relatively good oral- and general health-related QoL respectively. The correlation between oral and general health was weak. Significant differences were found between SRGH categories regarding RAND subscale scores, except for the 'role emotional' and 'mental health' subscales. Significant differences were also found between SROH categories regarding OHIP subscale scores, except for the 'psychological disability' subscale. However, no significant differences were found between SRGH categories regarding OHIP subscale scores, or between SROH categories regarding RAND subscale scores. The findings suggest that oral health, general health, and QoL have different determinants. Furthermore, oral health and general health appear to be mostly unrelated in this seemingly healthy population. It is proposed that if no apparent disease is present, oral and general health must be regarded as separate constructs.",European journal of oral sciences,2008 Oct,England,2008,00
19005951,Continuing professional development and social accountability: a review of the literature.,"The idea that health professionals should be accountable to the society they serve is not a new concept and by the 1990 s, the continuing professional development (CPD) of health professionals was being seen as one way in which Canadians' level of health could be improved. The public was, and is still today, increasingly demanding a system that is more responsive to regional and community needs. As a result, there is a need for more health professional education at all stages of the education continuum - undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing professional development - that meets the health and social needs of the populations being served. The trend is now towards 'socially accountable' health care, meaning that the broader context of CPD must also include the personal, social, and political aspects of health care and as such, involve a widening of accountability to patients, the community, managers and policymakers. CPD planning must take into account local and national priorities as well as personal learning needs. However, the definition of social accountability and the stages at which it is addressed is sometimes vague and this added to the difficulty of identifying relevant studies in the literature. Nonetheless, there were some ""best practices"" evident via Canadian and American studies which focused on models of socially accountable CPD, as well as examples of interdisciplinary collaboration in Canada, the United States, Australia, Great Britain, and the United Arab Emirates. However, there is a definite need for increased research and publication of such ""best practice"" initiatives. There is also a need for Canadian health professional schools to facilitate this process by sharing their experiences and resources if possible. An extensive literature review was conducted between January and March 2004. Due to time constraints, it was limited to articles written in the English language. The databases/sources utilized included: Medline (now known as Pubmed), CINAHL, ERIC, PsychInfo, Canadian Business & Current Affairs (CBCA) Full-text Education (now known as CBCA Education), Research and Development Resource Base in Continuing Medical Education (RDRB/CME) at the University of Toronto, EMBASE (Excerpta Medica). This literature review was one of the first activities conducted under the auspices of ""Issues of Quality and Continuing Professional Development: Maintenance of Competence"", a national project funded by the Primary Health Care Transition Fund, Health Canada. The purposes of this review were to identify literature which focuses on aspects of continuing professional development, social accountability, and determinants of health; ""best practices"" of socially accountable CPD and inter/intra-disciplinary collaboration, and the critical success factors and challenges to implementing CPD, especially CPD that meets the needs of both health professionals and the populations they serve.",Journal of interprofessional care,2008,England,2008,00

The study was initiated in 1988, and follow-up continued through 2000, with semiannual visits. Patterns of self-reported drug injection (yes/no) were defined for each participant, based on the number of drug-use transitions. The effect of baseline factors was assessed using multinomial logistic regression models. Over the 12-year study period, four patterns were noted: 29% of participants remained persistent drug injectors, 20% ceased injection, 14% relapsed once, and 37% had multiple transitions. Persistent injectors had the shortest follow-up and the highest mortality. For persons who changed their behavior, 3.4 years elapsed before their first cessation attempt, on average. Factors differentiating the groups included history of incarceration, young age, participation in drug treatment programs, recent overdose, and commercial sex. The observed long-term injection patterns are consistent with the view of drug addiction as a chronic disease. This view emphasizes the need for prolonged efforts to sustain cessation and to prevent adverse health and social outcomes among injection drug users.",American journal of epidemiology,2003 Oct 1,United States,2003,00
11464617,[Epidemiologic and clinical aspects of Helicobacter pylori infection in children].,"Worldwide, H. pylori prevalence in children ranges from under 10% to almost 80%. Prevalence is low in developed countries; whereas high prevalence is observed in most developing countries. Documented risk factors for infection include socioeconomic status, household crowding, ethnicity, migration from high prevalence regions, and infection status of family members. H. pylori infection is not associated with specific symptoms in children; although it is consistently associated with antral gastritis, which clinical significance is unclear. H. pylori associated duodenal ulcers are seldom seen in children under 10 years of age. The role of the infection in recurrent abdominal pain is highly controversial. H. pylori-infected children demonstrate a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate, with a lack neutrophils, as compared with the response observed in adults. The importance of virulence determinants such as cagA and vacA, described as relevant for disease during H. pylori infection, has not been extensively studied in children. Sensitive and specific methods for the detection of H. pylori in children are needed, especially in infant populations where the colonization is in its early phases. Non-invasive, cheap, and simple methods are needed for epidemiologic studies. There is no consensus about criteria for the use of eradication treatment in H. pylori-infected children. Multicenter pediatric studies are needed to solve the many unanswered question on the natural history of H. pylori infection in children, including identification of risk factors for infection, identification of prognostic indicators for the development of gastroduodenal disease later in life, and the host response to infection.",Revista de gastroenterologia de Mexico,2000 Oct-Dec,Mexico,2000,00
17356902,Improving health and building human capital through an effective primary care system.,"To improve population health, one must put emphasis on reducing health inequities and enhancing health protection and disease prevention, and early diagnosis and treatment of diseases by tackling the determinants of health at the downstream, midstream, and upstream levels. There is strong theoretical and empirical evidence for the association between strong national primary care systems and improved health indicators. The setting approach to promote health such as healthy schools, healthy cities also aims to address the determinants of health and build the capacity of individuals, families, and communities to create strong human and social capitals. The notion of human and social capitals begins to offer explanations why certain communities are unable to achieve better health than other communities with similar demography. In this paper, a review of studies conducted in different countries illustrate how a well-developed primary health care system would reduce all causes of mortalities, improve health status, reduce hospitalization, and be cost saving despite a disparity in socioeconomic conditions. The intervention strategy recommended in this paper is developing a model of comprehensive primary health care system by joining up different settings integrating the efforts of different parties within and outside the health sector. Different components of primary health care team would then work more closely with individuals and families and different healthy settings. This synergistic effect would help to strengthen human and social capital development. The model can then combine the efforts of upstream, midstream, and downstream approaches to improve population health and reduce health inequity. Otherwise, health would easily be jeopardized as a result of rapid urbanization.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2007 May,United States,2007,00
18785182,Enclosure environment affects the activity budgets of captive Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata).,"Individuals adapt to changes in their environment, such as food availability and temperature, by adjusting the amount of time spent in different behavioral activities. These adjustments in behavior should vary across age-sex class according to specific physiological and social needs. We studied the activity budgets of three social Japanese macaque groups inhabiting either vegetated or nonvegetated enclosures in order to compare the effects of access with vegetation, as both food and substrate on resting, feeding, grooming and moving activities over a 12-month period. Daily access to natural foods for monkeys in the vegetated enclosure seems to be largely responsible for the differences in daily time budgets of these three groups. Resting time in all three groups was longer than the time devoted to other activities. Resting and moving time in the two nonvegetated enclosures was significantly longer than in the vegetated enclosure. In contrast, feeding and grooming time was significantly longer in the vegetated enclosure. Seasonal variation in time spent feeding, resting and grooming was significantly effected by enclosure type. In all three enclosures, immatures, particularly females, spent more time feeding and moving, whereas adults spent more time resting. Significant monthly variation in time spent by age-sex class was noted only for feeding and resting. Interestingly, in the vegetated enclosure, time spent feeding on natural vegetation was equal to the amount of time spent feeding on provisioned food. This suggests that factors other than energetic and nutritional needs may be important determinants of the activity budget of the species. These results have important implications for the enrichment of captive primates and our understanding of the maintenance of activity patterns by primates in the wild.",American journal of primatology,2008 Dec,United States,2008,00
17073130,[Limited impact of the harm-reduction policy on HCV among drug-users. The ANRS-Coquelicot survey example].,"BACKGROUND: In France, a harm-reduction policy was implemented in the late 1980s with the aim of reducing the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C virus infection among drug users. The ANRS-Coquelicot survey was designed to measure the prevalence of HIV and HCV infection among drug users, and to examine determinants of at-risk behaviors. METHODS: In 2002, information was collected from 166 drug users recruited in all types of services specializing in drug use and harm reduction in Marseille, France. Self-reported HIV and HCV serostatus was compared with the results of serological tests done on capillary blood collected on filter paper. RESULTS: The self-reported and biologically documented prevalence rates of HIV infection were identical (22 %). In contrast, the self-reported prevalence of HCV infection was 52 %, while the biologically documented prevalence was 73 %. Overall, 30 % of HCV-infected drug users were unaware of their status. Forty-four per cent of drug users under 30 years of age were HCV-seropositive, suggesting that they had been infected early during drug use. CONCLUSION: The harm-reduction policy seems to have had a marked impact on HIV transmission among drug users, but a much more limited impact on HCV transmission.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,2006 Jul,France,2006,00
18050152,Extending social health insurance to the informal sector in Kenya. An assessment of factors affecting demand.,"This paper contributes to analysing and understanding the demand for (social) health insurance of informal sector workers in Kenya by assessing their perceptions and knowledge of and concerns regarding health insurance and the Kenyan National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). It serves to explore how informal sector workers could be integrated into the NHIF. To collect data, focus group discussions were held with organized groups of informal sector workers of different types across the country, backed up by a self-administered questionnaire completed by heads of NHIF area branch offices. It was found that the most critical barrier to NHIF enrollment is the lack of knowledge of informal sector workers about the NHIF, its enrollment option and procedures for informal sector workers. Inability to pay is a critical factor for some, but people were, in principle, interested in health insurance, and thus willing to pay for it. In sum, the mix of demand-side determinants for enrolling in the NHIF is not as complex as expected. This is good news, as these demand-side determinants can be addressed with a well-designed strategy, focusing on awareness raising and information, improvement of insurance design features and setting differentiated and affordable contribution rates.",The International journal of health planning and management,2008 Jan-Mar,England,2008,00
10750165,"Aggression and the termination of ""rituals"": a new variant of the escape function for challenging behavior?","Aggression and stereotyped behaviors are not uncommon among people with intellectual disabilities and they are often treated separately as operant behaviors. In this single case study, it is argued that the function of a young woman's aggressive behavior appeared to be that of avoiding or escaping the termination of a chain of complex stereotyped behavior (or ""ritual""). She became aggressive only when this chain of stereotyped behavior was terminated and the aggression appeared to extinguish when it no longer led to escape from the termination of the ""ritual"". It is suggested that this is an example of a complex interaction between two behaviors and that it illustrates the need for very careful analysis of the functions of challenging behavior. Furthermore, it is proposed that the lengthening list of variables already documented as determinants of challenging behavior (provision of attention (verbal and physical), mechanical restraint, sensory or tangible events, escape from demands or from social attention, denials, escape from intrusive medical procedures, escape from task difficulty) be lengthened to include the possibility of escape from (or avoidance of) the interruption of a chain of complex stereotyped behavior or ""ritual"".",Research in developmental disabilities,2000 Jan-Feb,United States,2000,00
12512031,Determinants of the association of overweight with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase activity in the United States.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In the absence of other causes, overweight and obesity increase the risk of liver disease. We examined whether central adiposity and metabolic markers explain the association of body mass index (BMI as kg/m(2)) with abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity in a national, population-based study. METHODS: Adult participants (5724) in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) underwent anthropometric measures and phlebotomy after an overnight fast. Participants with excessive alcohol consumption, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, iron overload, or known diabetes were excluded. RESULTS: Elevated ALT levels were found in 2.8% of the population. In univariate analysis, factors associated with elevated ALT levels (P < 0.05) included younger age, male sex, Mexican-American ethnicity, and higher BMI, waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR), and fasting serum leptin, triglyceride, insulin, and glucose concentrations. The proportion of elevated ALT activity due to overweight and obesity (BMI > or =25 kg/m(2)) was 65%. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, control for WHR, demographic factors, and glucose concentration diminished but did not eliminate the association of higher BMI with elevated ALT activity. After adding leptin and insulin concentrations, abnormal ALT activity was most strongly associated with higher WHR (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.56) and leptin (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.24) and insulin (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01-1.60) concentrations, whereas BMI was not independently related. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, national, population-based study, central adiposity, hyperleptinemia, and hyperinsulinemia were the major determinants of the association of overweight with elevated serum ALT activity.",Gastroenterology,2003 Jan,United States,2003,00
19373014,"Gender, sex, and HIV: how well are we addressing the imbalance?","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Heightened interest in sex and gender differences in HIV warrant a review of the status of current understanding of their determinants and progress in addressing them. RECENT FINDINGS: The proportion of women among people living with HIV continues to increase in most countries; however, women are proportionately more likely to be on antiretroviral treatment than are men. Inadequate representation of women in clinical trials is compounding the dearth of information on sex-based differences in response to life prolonging antiretroviral medication. Progress in addressing gender inequalities and inequities, though incremental, is too slow to reach Millennium Development Goal 6 of halting and reversing the HIV epidemic by 2015. Structural determinants, such as food insufficiency, poverty, decreased access to credit, and inequitable inheritance practices, continue to act with social gender norms to shape the increased risk of exposure to HIV that women and adolescent girls face in many settings. SUMMARY: Special measures should be taken to overcome barriers and facilitate enrolment and retention of women in biomedical HIV prevention and treatment trials. Law reform, economic empowerment, gender transformative work, and political mobilization are needed if women and men are to share the power, influence, rights, responsibilities, and opportunities that can create resilience to HIV.",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,2008 Jul,United States,2008,00
18994666,Global health equity and climate stabilisation: a common agenda.,"Although health has improved for many people, the extent of health inequities between and within countries is growing. Meanwhile, humankind is disrupting the global climate and other life-supporting environmental systems, thereby creating serious risks for health and wellbeing, especially in vulnerable populations but ultimately for everybody. Underlying determinants of health inequity and environmental change overlap substantially; they are signs of an economic system predicated on asymmetric growth and competition, shaped by market forces that mostly disregard health and environmental consequences rather than by values of fairness and support. A shift is needed in priorities in economic development towards healthy forms of urbanisation, more efficient and renewable energy sources, and a sustainable and fairer food system. Global interconnectedness and interdependence enable the social and environmental determinants of health to be addressed in ways that will increase health equity, reduce poverty, and build societies that live within environmental limits.","Lancet (London, England)",2008 Nov 8,England,2008,00

Deficits across neurocognitive domains such as attention, working memory, language skills, and executive functioning tend to be moderate, with the most pronounced deficits found in verbal learning and memory. All these neurocognitive domains are related to adaptive and social skills, with executive functions and verbal learning and memory showing more variance across more domains than other neuro-cognitive variables. Negative symptoms and neurocognitive domains, although correlated, are distinct and have differential pathways of change with treatment.

19461935,Determinants of improvement in quality of life of alcohol-dependent patients during an inpatient withdrawal programme.,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the improvement in quality of life (QoL) of alcohol-dependent patients during a 3-week inpatient withdrawal programme, and to identify the sociodemographic, clinical and alcohol-related variables associated with baseline QoL on admission and with improvement of QoL during residential treatment. METHODS: This prospective, observational study included 414 alcohol-dependent patients, hospitalised for a period of 3 weeks. QoL was measured on admission and at discharge using the French version of the Medical Outcome Study SF-36. The mean scores for each dimension and for the Physical and Mental Component Summary scores were calculated. RESULTS: The mean scores per dimension and the mean Physical and Mental Component Summary scores were significantly lower on admission than at discharge; the lowest scores being observed for social functioning and role limitations due to emotional problems. At discharge, the mean scores per dimension were similar to those observed in the French general population. Female gender, age > 45 years, living alone, working as a labourer or employee, somatic comorbidity, and the existence of at least five criteria for alcohol dependence according to the DSM-IV classification were associated with a low Physical Component Summary score on admission; psychiatric comorbidity, the presence of at least five DSM-IV dependence criteria, smoking and suicidality were associated with a low Mental Component Summary score on admission. The increase in Physical and Mental Component Summary scores during hospitalisation was more marked when the initial scores were low. Apart from the initial score, the greatest improvement in Physical Component Summary score was seen in patients with a high alcohol intake and in those without a somatic comorbidity; the increase in Mental Component Summary score was greatest in patients without psychotic symptoms and in those who abused or were dependent on illegal drugs. CONCLUSION: QoL improvement after a residential treatment was related to low QoL scores at admission. Improvement in physical component of QoL was related to baseline alcohol intake and good somatic status. Improvement in mental component of QoL was related to other drugs abuse/dependence.",International journal of medical sciences,2009 May 18,Australia,2009,00

DESIGN: Inception cohort with 5 measurements over 3 years. PATIENTS: A total of 156 patients recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. METHOD: Performance of social roles was measured using the 2 role functioning and the social sub-scales of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36. Potential determinants (n = 43) were divided into the following clusters: patient and disease characteristics (n = 12), psychosocial characteristics (n = 10), basic functions (n = 18) and basic activities (n = 3). Multivariate longitudinal regression analyses were performed with generalized estimating equations. A backwards selection procedure for every cluster per outcome reduced the large number of potential determinants. In order to determine whether longitudinal associations are present the selected determinants were entered into an overall regression model. RESULTS: Twenty-three candidate determinants were selected. Vitality, measured with the SF36 sub-scale vitality, the T2-weighted supratentorial lesion load and the perceived amount of social support, measured with the Social Support List Discrepancies, were longitudinally associated with the performance of social roles in 2 or 3 of the models.

19131885,Test and tell: correlates and consequences of testing and disclosure of HIV status in South Africa (HPTN 043 Project Accept).,"BACKGROUND: As the numbers of HIV-positive diagnoses rise in South Africa, it is important to understand the determinants and consequences of HIV disclosure. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey from random community samples of men and women in urban and rural South Africa (n = 217 HIV-positive individuals, 89% female). RESULTS: Two thirds of all known HIV-infected adults in these communities had disclosed their status to sexual partner(s). On average, individuals who disclosed were 2 years older, higher in socioeconomic assets, and had known their HIV status 7 months longer than those who had not told their sexual partner(s). The ""need for privacy"" was the most cited reason (45%) for nondisclosure among those who had never disclosed. People who eventually disclosed their HIV status to sexual partner(s) were significantly more likely to report always or more frequently using condoms, reducing their number of sexual partners, and/or becoming monogamous. Among individuals who disclosed their HIV status, 77% reported increases in social support, with families providing the most support. CONCLUSIONS: Disclosure is associated with reports of consequent safer sexual behavior and greater social support. Interventions might be informed by the costs and benefits of disclosure and differences in disclosure to sexual partner vs. to one's social network.",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),2009 Feb 1,United States,2009,00
19099617,Small area variations and welfare loss in the use of outpatient antibiotics.,"This article seeks to explain local variations in the use of antibiotics in the community and to assess the welfare loss due to heterogeneous attitudes towards the risk of bacterial resistance. Quarterly data on antibiotic sales from 240 small areas in Switzerland over the course of one year are used. An econometric ad-hoc model with spatial lags is proposed in which the demand for antibiotics varies according to the socioeconomic characteristics of the population, the incidence of infections, antibiotic price and local health care supply. Using residual variations we then evaluate the welfare loss due to varying antibiotic prescription styles. Significant differences are observed in the per capita antibiotic consumption across local areas. Individual income, the demographic structure of the population, physician density and the price of drugs are all relevant determinants. We estimate that unexplained variations may account for 12% of the total antibiotic spending in the community, thus leading to a Euro 6.8 ml loss per year. Understanding the determinants of variations in outpatient antibiotic consumption may help to design more effective policies to counter the threat of bacterial resistance. Our estimate of the welfare loss due to heterogeneous attitudes towards antibiotic treatment is comparable to the expected cost of implementing measures to improve the dissemination of information on bacterial resistance among patients and doctors.","Health economics, policy, and law",2009 Jan,England,2009,00

Our study was aimed at investigating the social determinants of access to reference cancer care centres for surgery for colorectal cancer in France. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted on population-based data from a specialised cancer registry (County of Calvados, France). The population consisted of 5156 patients with surgical treatment for colorectal cancer recorded between January 1st 1981 and December 31st 2000. RESULTS: The probability of being cared for in a reference care centre was 1.3-fold lower for people living in a deprived district (mean income < 15000 euros) and 3-fold lower for people living in a district where more than 7% of houses were devoid of bath and shower in comparison with districts where this rate was under 2%. After adjustment for distance from reference care centre, the probability of being cared for in a reference care centre was still over one third lower for people living in a district with more than 7% of houses devoid of bath and shower. Social disparities in management of patients with colorectal cancer have increased in the last decade. The reduction of access to reference care with distance was stronger in elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a social and geographical determination of type of treatment centre for care management of colorectal cancer in France. Special attention needs to be paid to the high quality of care management in non-specialised care centres in order to avoid an increased social gradient in cancer mortality in France.","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2006 Nov,England,2006,00
17074838,Influence of socioeconomic status on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment in Indonesia.,"OBJECTIVE: A major reason for poor survival of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in developing countries is treatment refusal or abandonment. This can be associated with parental socioeconomic status and attitudes of health care providers. Our study examined the influence of 2 socioeconomic status determinants, parental income and education, on treatment in an Indonesian academic hospital. METHODS: Medical charts of 164 patients who received a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia between 1997 and 2002 were abstracted retrospectively. Data on treatment results and parental financial and educational background were collected. Open interviews were conducted with parents and health care providers. RESULTS: Of all patients, 35% refused or abandoned treatment, 23% experienced treatment-related death, 22% had progressive or relapsed leukemia, and 20% had an overall event-free survival. Treatment results differed significantly between patients with different socioeconomic status; 47% of poor and 2% of prosperous patients refused or abandoned treatment. Although poor and prosperous patients used the same protocol, the provided treatment differed. Poor patients received less individualized attention from oncologists and less structured parental education. Strong social hierarchical structures hindered communication with doctors, resulting in a lack of parental understanding of the necessity to continue treatment. Most poor patients could not afford treatment. Access to donated chemotherapy also was inadequate. Treatment refusal or abandonment frequently resulted. There was no follow-up system to detect and contact dropouts. Health care providers were not fully aware that their own attitude and communication skills were important for ensuring compliance of patients and parents. CONCLUSIONS: Children's survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in developing countries could improve if problems that are associated with parental financial and educational background and medical teams' attitudes to treatment and follow-up could be addressed better.",Pediatrics,2006 Dec,United States,2006,00

Our sample is drawn from the Zzzip survey, and contains 2,280 LGBs, of whom 1,565 are men and 715 are women. The traditional social stress model outlines the influence of general stressors on stress (Pearlin, 1989). Meyer (1995) has expanded Pearlin's model to include the concept of minority stress. This study focuses on aspects of personal characteristics and social structural arrangements. Our study confirms the importance of age and education as relevant determinants for mental health. Additionally, although most research establishes sex differences in depression, this study does not find significant differences in depression between men and women. In women, sexual identity is a significant determinant of depressive score, but we do not find the same in men. Finally, both general and minority stressors, especially the internal stressors, are found to have an important effect on depressive outcomes.",Journal of LGBT health research,2008,England,2008,00
18781489,Prevalence and determinants of fecal incontinence in premenopausal women in an Arabian community.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, awareness and determinants of fecal incontinence among Qatari women. METHOD: In the cross-sectional community-based study in primary health-care centers, using a multistage sampling design, a representative sample of randomly selected 776 Qatari women aged from 40 to 48 years were approached from January to August 2007; only 596 women, with a response rate of 76.8%, gave consent and were included in the analysis. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing fecal incontinence in the previous 12 months and health care-seeking behavior for fecal symptoms. Fecal incontinence, determined by self-report, was categorized by frequency. Females reported the level of bother of fecal incontinence and their general quality of life. Potential risk factors were assessed by self-report, interview, physical examination, and record review. RESULTS: Of the studied Qatari women, 62 (10.4%) were found to have fecal incontinence. There was a significant difference between fecal incontinent and continent groups with regard to menopause (p < 0.0001), surgical repair of genital prolapse (p < 0.0001) and constipation (p < 0.0001). Only 31 incontinent patients (50%) had sought medical advice. Of the fecal incontinent women, 77.4% felt embarrassment in consulting a doctor and 77.4% believed their condition was worth reporting to a doctor. Aging (51.6%) was the major cause of fecal incontinence in women, followed by childbirth (40.3%), then menopause (25.8%) and lastly paralysis (14.5%). Most of the sufferers were troubled by their inability to pray (64.5%). Their relationship with their husband (41.9%) was the significant consequence for fecal incontinent Qatari women (p = 0.02); 37.1% isolated themselves from social activities and going out to shop. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings revealed that fecal incontinence is a common symptom among women in the community. There was a correlation between fecal incontinence and menopause. Overall, most of the fecal incontinent women reported that fecal incontinence significantly affected quality of life and only half of the studied women had consulted a physician for the symptom.",Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,2008 Oct,England,2008,00

Dental visits were less frequent in subjects aged > or =70 years compared to those aged 18-29 years (ORadj = 0.66, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.45-0.98), and increased with education (from 23.8% in subjects with 0-3 school years to 67.9% in those with > 12 years of education, p < 0.001 for trend). The use of dental care services at least once in the previous year was more frequent in white-collar workers (ORadj = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52-0.91), when a private doctor was the usual source of medical care (ORadj = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.06-1.79) and in those who visited a medical doctor in the previous year (ORadj = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.57-2.45). Diabetics were less likely to seek dental care (ORadj = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.48-0.93). CONCLUSION: Nearly half the adults from Porto had not visited a dentist in the previous year. Education was the factor most strongly associated with dentist attendance. No differences were observed regarding the determinants of one or two or more dental visits in the previous year.",Oral health & preventive dentistry,2008,Germany,2008,00
18856224,Health-care access as a social determinant of health.,"The social determinants of health (SDH) are recognized as important indicators of health and well-being. Health-care services (primary, secondary, tertiary care) have not until recently been considered an SDH. Inequities in access to health care are changing this view. These inequities include barriers faced by certain population groups at point of care, such as the lack of cultural competence of health-care providers. The authors show how a social justice perspective can help nurses understand how to link inequities in access to poorer health outcomes, and they call on nurses to break the cycle of oppression that contributes to these inequities.",The Canadian nurse,2008 Sep,Canada,2008,00
16273992,Subjective appraisal of Alzheimer's disease caregiving: the role of self-efficacy and depressive symptoms in the experience of burden.,"Most studies investigating correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregiver burden have focused on the role of objective factors as opposed to subjective factors. Although objective variables (e.g., caregiver age, patient dementia severity, functional status) have been shown to be significantly associated with burden, the correlations generally are modest and explain relatively little of the variability in caregiver outcomes. Moreover, many of these objective variables are not modifiable and are of limited use in the development of caregiver interventions. Thus, there continues to be a need to identify powerful and modifiable determinants of caregiver burden. This study examined the role of two subjective factors-self-efficacy and depressive symptoms-as predictors of AD caregiver burden. Based on a sample of 80 AD caregivers, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that self-efficacy and depressive symptoms each had a significant independent effect on the experience of burden even after accounting for objective factors. These findings suggest that caregiver interventions aimed to reduce burden may benefit from the incorporation of specific strategies to increase self-efficacy and decrease depressive symptoms.",American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,2005 Sep-Oct,United States,2005,00
18576207,Suicidal ideation among Canadian youth: a multivariate analysis.,"A multivariate model was developed incorporating various socio-demographic, social-environmental, and social-psychological factors in an attempt to predict suicidal ideation among Canadian youth. The main research objective sought to determine what socially based factors elevate or reduce suicidal ideation within this population. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth-Cycle 5 (2003), a cross-sectional sample of 1,032 was used to empirically identify various social determinants of suicidal ideation among youth between the ages of 12 and 15. Results reveal statistically significant correlations between suicide ideation and some lesser examined socially based measures. In particular, ability to communicate feelings, negative attachment to parents/guardians, taunting/bullying or abuse, and presence of deviant peers were significant predictors of suicidal ideation. As expected, depression/anxiety, gender, and age were also correlated with thoughts of suicide. Research findings should help foster a better understanding toward the social elements of suicide and provide insight into how suicide prevention strategies may be improved through an increased emphasis on substance use education, direct targeting of dysfunctional families and deviant peer groups, and exploring more avenues of self-expression for youth.",Archives of suicide research : official journal of the International Academy for Suicide Research,2008,England,2008,00
16122570,"Cognition in schizophrenia: impairments, determinants, and functional importance.","Recent findings support and add to earlier findings of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Deficits across neurocognitive domains such as attention, working memory, language skills, and executive functioning tend to be moderate, with the most pronounced deficits found in verbal learning and memory. All these neurocognitive domains are related to adaptive and social skills, with executive functions and verbal learning and memory showing more variance across more domains than other neuro-cognitive variables. Negative symptoms and neurocognitive domains, although correlated, are distinct and have differential pathways of change with treatment. General psychopathology symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, may become important treatment targets as strategies are developed for translating cognitive enhancement to real-world functional performance.",The Psychiatric clinics of North America,2005 Sep,United States,2005,00
19089374,Screening of virulence traits in Legionella pneumophila and analysis of the host susceptibility to infection by using the Dictyostelium host model system.,"The social soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has been established as a host model for several human pathogens including Legionella pneumophila. The complete genome sequence, the genetic tractability, and the phagocytic characteristics of Dictyostelium generate many opportunities for the study of host-pathogen interactions. Important applications of this haploid model organism are (i) the use of Dictyostelium cells as a screening system for bacterial virulence, (ii) the use of Dictyostelium mutant cells to identify genetic host determinants of susceptibility and resistance to infection, and (iii) experiments that allow the dissection of the complex cross-talk with infectious agents. Accordingly, this chapter describes a plaque assay to identify attenuated pathogens, an infection assay for the analysis of host cell mutants and pathogens, and a screening method for the isolation of Legionella mutants that are defective in the reprogramming of the phagolysosomal maturation of the host.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2009,United States,2009,00
19761078,Relationships of exclusion and cohesion with health: the case of Bangladesh.,"The concept of social exclusion, applied widely in the European Union, has in recent years been gaining use in Bangladesh, mostly by international development agencies. Does this discourse of deprivation, developed in the welfare states of northern Europe, have salience in its application to deprivation in countries like Bangladesh where, for example, 31% of the rural population lives in chronic poverty? The concept of social exclusion has three principal components: a dynamic and relational perspective which requires the identification of who or what causes exclusion; an explicit recognition of multiple dimensions of deprivation; and a longitudinal perspective, recognizing that individuals and groups are dynamic intra- and intergenerationally. The Social Exclusion Knowledge Network of the World Health Organization Commission on Social Determinants of Health expanded the concept to include health status as a contributor to and an outcome of exclusion and to show that actors beyond the state or public sector can critically impact exclusionary processes. In the Bangladesh application, the relevance of the modified model was explored to find that while there are negative associations between social exclusion and health status, much stronger documentation is needed of the relationship. The modification of including multiple sectors, such as private enterprise and civil society, in addition to the state, as having potential to impact exclusionary processes is fundamental to the application of the social exclusion model in Bangladesh.","Journal of health, population, and nutrition",2009 Aug,Bangladesh,2009,00
19709014,Social accountability and accreditation: a new frontier for educational institutions.,"CONTEXT: An association with excellence should be reserved for educational institutions which verify that their actions make a difference to people's well-being. The graduates they produce should not only possess all of the competencies desirable to improve the health of citizens and society, but should also use them in their professional practice. Four principles enunciated by the World Health Organization refer to the type of health care to which people have a right, from both an individual and a collective standpoint: quality, equity, relevance and effectiveness. Therefore, social, economic, cultural and environmental determinants of health must guide the strategic development of an educational institution. DISCUSSION: Social responsibility implies accountability to society for actions intended to serve it. In the health field, social accountability involves a commitment to respond as best as possible to the priority health needs of citizens and society. An educational institution should verify its impact on society by following basic principles of quality, equity, relevance and effectiveness, and by active participation in health system development. Its social accountability should be measured in three interdependent domains concerning health personnel: conceptualisation, production and utilisability. An educational institution that fully assumes the position of a responsible partner in the health care system and is dedicated to the public interest deserves a label of excellence. CONCLUSIONS: As globalisation is reassessed for its social impact, societies will seek to justify their investments with more solid evidence of their impact on the public good. Medical schools should be prepared to be judged accordingly. There is an urgent need to foster the adaptation of accreditation standards and norms that reflect social accountability. Only then can educational institutions be measured and rewarded for their real capacity to meet the pressing health care needs of society.",Medical education,2009 Sep,England,2009,00
12048146,Recovery from psychosis in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder: symptoms and neurocognitive rate-limiters for the development of social behavior skills.,"Neurocognitive deficits are believed to be important predictors of functional outcome in chronic psychotic disorders, but few supporting studies have utilized prospective designs and adequate control. The aim of this study was to estimate the relative influence of symptoms and neurocognitive deficits on the development of social behavior skills in a cohort of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder recovering from acute symptom exacerbations. Forty-six individuals were recruited upon discharge from an inpatient unit and completed assessments of symptoms, neurocognitive function, and social behavior at 3-month intervals for 1 year. Correlational analyses and random regression models were used to model social behavioral capacities longitudinally. Social behavior improved modestly (10% improvements in ratings) over the follow-up period for the group as a whole. Disorganized and negative symptoms, as well as neurocognitive deficits in short-term and working memory predicted changes in social behavior over time. Individuals with better working memory function showed significantly greater abilities to recover social behavior skills, whereas those with working memory deficits showed no functional improvement over time. Both symptoms and neurocognitive deficits are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia. It is proposed that clinicians should consider neurocognitive thresholds for treatment response when developing rehabilitation plans.",Schizophrenia research,2002 Jun 1,Netherlands,2002,00
19951225,Prevalence and risk factors of domestic violence among Mongolian Women.,"AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and determinants of domestic violence in Mongolian women. METHODS: The survey was administered to 5500 people in 1000 households randomly selected from two districts of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. RESULTS: The response rate was 90.3% (total of 4967, and 3338 were women.). About 37.7% of respondents reported that they were affected by some type of domestic violence during the previous 6 months; 17.9% of all respondents reported physical violence, 21.9% reported emotional violence, 10% reported sexual abuse, and 6.9% reported financial violence. Major risk factors for violence against women included having only a primary education or less, low income, living in a rented house, and living with an unemployed partner who uses alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Domestic or intimate partner violence (IPV) is widespread in Mongolia and is usually committed in family circles, often away from public view. This study suggests that increasing employment for men may help reduce poverty and alcohol abuse and, thus, IPV.",Journal of women's health (2002),2009 Nov,United States,2009,00
16835337,Motives of Belgian adolescents for using sunscreen: the role of action plans.,"The first objective of this study was to analyze the differences between adolescents who use sunscreen frequently and those who do not. The second objective was to explore the importance of specific action plans when planning sunscreen use. Data was gathered among 602 Belgian secondary school students. Frequent and infrequent users of sunscreen were compared on several determinants related with sunscreen use, and a regression analysis on sunscreen use was done. Frequent users of sunscreen measures had significantly higher scores on attitudes, social influence, self-efficacy, some awareness factors, intention, and action plans. The integrated model for exploring motivational and behavioral change (I-Change model) explained 57% of the total variance of using sunscreen every 2 hours. Frequent sunscreen use was most strongly predicted by action plans, followed by positive intentions to use sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, seeking shade, attitude toward sunscreen use, education, social influence, and exposure to the sun. Our results suggest that skin cancer prevention programs aimed at promoting sunscreen use need to emphasize the advantages of sunscreen to infrequent users and to increase feelings of self-efficacy. Moreover, support by friends and parents should be stimulated. Finally, developing specific action plans for the use of sunscreen should be promoted to more effectively translate general intentions into actual sunscreen use.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2006 Jul,United States,2006,00
12084143,Gender differences in the psychological determinants of cigarette smoking.,"AIMS: To compare the distributions of smoking-related variables and the size of associations between these variables in men and women. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Mail survey in 2934 daily smokers (1533 women and 1401 men) who volunteered for a smoking cessation trial. Follow-up after 7 months in 2456 people (84%). SETTING: Community setting (French-speaking part of Switzerland, 1998). FINDINGS: Women smoked less than men (18 versus 22 cigarettes per day, p < 0.001), had lower confidence in their ability to refrain from smoking, used more frequently the strategy defined as 'coping with the temptation to smoke' and reported more drawbacks of smoking (gender differences ranged between 0.1 and 0.3 standard deviation units on these scales). There was no gender difference in the distribution of smokers by stage of change. At follow-up, smoking cessation rates were similar in men and women (6% versus 5%, p=0.3). Intention to quit, quit attempts in the previous year and a more frequent use of self-change strategies predicted smoking cessation and were associated with tobacco dependence in both sexes. A more frequent use by women of coping strategies suggests that some women are 'self-restrained' smokers who control their smoking permanently. This could explain lower smoking rates in women. The size of associations between smoking-related variables was similar in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Even though there were gender differences in the distributions of some smoking-related variables, associations between these variables were similar in men and women. This suggests that smoking behaviour is regulated by similar psychological mechanisms in men and women.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2002 Jun,England,2002,00

METHOD: The study had a randomized sample (n=4278; age: 75-105) stratified in four age groups. Factor analyses were performed to investigate the factor structure of the instrument, and convergent and discriminant validity was assessed by correlation between summary scores and by means of various measures (such as symptoms and ADL). Mean scores and Cronbach's alpha were computed for the total sample and for each stratum. Respondents and non-respondents to SF-12 were compared regarding various measures. A multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify determinants for respondents/non-respondents. RESULTS: Mean scores in the total sample were 37.5 SD 11.9 for the physical component summary score (PCS) and 50.3 SD 11.5 for the mental component summary score (MCS). Both PCS and MCS decreased significantly with higher age. The instrument showed acceptable convergent/discriminant validity and Cronbach's alpha, but the factor solution did not follow the intended structure of the instrument. Completion rate for all 12 items was 85.5% in the total sample, and the characteristics of non-respondents to SF-12 were higher age, being female, living alone, living in special accommodation, being worried about health, being in need of help with activities of daily living, reporting fewer symptoms, and having a smaller social network than respondents. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument generally showed acceptable validity and reliability, except for its factor structure. Furthermore, new determinants for non-respondents of SF-12 were found, such as type of living conditions, being worried about health, and social network.",Aging clinical and experimental research,2007 Dec,Germany,2007,00
16290129,Socioeconomic determinants of regional differences in outpatient antibiotic consumption: evidence from Switzerland.,"This paper investigates the determinants of regional variations in outpatient antibiotic consumption using Swiss data. The analysis contributes to the debate on appropriate antibiotic use by improving the understanding of its determinants, and may help to define more effective health care policies to reduce the resistance phenomenon. Findings suggest that Switzerland exhibits relatively low levels of consumption among European countries. There are significant differences between cantons both in the per capita antibiotic sales and defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants (DID). Econometric estimations suggest that DID are significantly related to per capita income, antibiotic price, the density of medical practices, demographic, cultural and educational factors. The incidence of bacterial infections is also relevant. Appropriate policies affecting antibiotic consumption in the community can be designed by looking at crucial determinants in the model and their related impact.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2006 Aug 22,Ireland,2006,00
12112993,Preventing chronic disease and improving health: broadening the scope of behavioral medicine research and practice.,"There has been much progress made over the past 50 years in developing and applying the behavioral medicine evidence base to improve the health of individuals and populations. In particular, there has been progress made in applying behavioral and social science research and theories to the challenge of promoting health and disease prevention. These gains notwithstanding, not all sections of the population have benefited equally, either within or between countries. The disparities in social, mental, and physical health between the most advantaged and the most disadvantaged population groups are in the main, as great as, if not greater, than ever. This represents a tremendous challenge to all of us as behavioral medicine practitioners, teachers, and researchers. Although understanding more about the so-called upstream determinants of health that generate such health disparities is clearly very important, this knowledge will only make a difference if it is used to generate appropriate multilevel intervention strategies over a long and sustained period of time. However, such outcomes will also be affected by diverse aspects of the global natural ecological environment, and by striving for what has been described as a health-sustaining environment. With the increasing impact of globalization on most aspects of our lives, including health, it is important to consider the implications of this for preventing disease and promoting health across traditional national borders. This should challenge us to think about the importance of appropriate dissemination and diffusion of effective interventions at an institutional or policy level not only within a single country, but also between countries. Given the rapid economic and social changes occurring globally, and the tremendous impact of global environmental change on health, there is a need to broaden the scope and practice of behavioral medicine.",International journal of behavioral medicine,2002,England,2002,00
15935621,Health related quality of life in adult patients with epilepsy compared with a general reference population in Taiwan.,"To compare the health-related quality of life (HRQL) for patients with epilepsy and health subjects, we collected the clinical and demographic data and information on health states by using the Taiwan version of World Health Organization quality of life (WHOQOL)-BREF questionnaire in 296 patients (aged 19-73 years) with confirmed active epilepsy visiting the clinic of National Taiwan University Hospital, and 296 age-, gender-, municipal- and education-matched Taiwanese healthy subjects sampled from a national health interview survey. Multiple regression analyses with stepwise selection strategy were conducted to study risk factors for impairment of HRQL. Patients with epilepsy have poorer HRQL than the healthy population in physical, psychological and social domains but not in environment domain (p<0.005). Patients with less than 4 attacks during the previous 1 month had a better score in the availability and quality of health and social care in environment domain than healthy subjects (p<0.05). After controlling other determinants, seizure frequency, and comobid with other diseases are the important factors in predicting HRQL for epilepsy patients. Patients with employment and married had a significantly better HRQL. Effective control of seizure frequency and thoughtful promotion of positive attitudes in community are essential to improve the HRQL of epilepsy patients.",Epilepsy research,2005 May,Netherlands,2005,00
18498677,Obesogenic environments--aspects on measurement and indicators.,"BACKGROUND: The focus in understanding the causes of and preventing obesity has broadened from the individual level to include the obesogenic environment. Proving a causal relationship between environmental factors and eating patterns poses a great challenge because randomised controlled trials are seldom possible or feasible to conduct. Interactions between the environment and individuals are beginning to be explored in multilevel studies and qualitative and sociological research. AIM: The aim is to give an overview of the wider environmental determinants of diet such as the national food supply, food availability and accessibility in different settings as well as the economic food environment and in relation to socio-economic status. RESULTS: The indicators suggested are based on the amount of data available in the scientific literature and the potential for intervention. They can be used to monitor societal interventions or evaluate 'natural' changes in the food environment. The indicators are of relevance to the Second WHO European Action Plan for Food and Nutrition Policy 2007-2012. CONCLUSION: The relatively weak empirical evidence does not imply the absence of causal relationships between environmental factors and diet. Potentially relevant factors have not been evaluated due to the complexity of the task and to lack of political will to change the food environment in a more healthy direction by use of legislation or economic instruments. Future intervention research, targeting the wider environmental determinants of diet, will give us better evidence to propose societal actions to counteract obesity and to strike the right balance between individual and societal action.",Public health nutrition,2009 Mar,England,2009,00

This study aimed at getting unprompted insight in the students' perceptions of their future profession in dimensions that may be determinants of study success and career choice. Undergraduate and graduated medical students were interviewed and asked to characterize the medical profession in general and four contrasting specialties in particular. Grounded Theory methodology was used to analyse the data. Participants were medical students at the start of their training (n = 16), during clerkships (n = 10) and after graduation (n = 37). Beginning students perceive the medical profession in limited dimensions: the activities of a physician, their relationship to patients and the physician's knowledge, skills and personality. They do not see many differences between specialties, in contrast with students with clinical experience and graduate students. Undergraduate students' perception is focussed more on social aspects of the profession compared to graduates.",Medical teacher,2005 Dec,England,2005,00
17159594,Factors correlated with disclosure of HIV infection in the French Antilles and French Guiana: results from the ANRS-EN13-VESPA-DFA Study.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate, patterns and predictors of HIV disclosure in the French Antilles and French Guiana. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among a 15% random sample (n=398) of the hospital caseload in hospitals providing HIV care. Determinants of disclosure to a steady partner and other members of the individual's social network were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: From the time of diagnosis, 84.6% of those in a couple (n=173) disclosed their HIV-positive status to their steady partner, 55.6% disclosed to others, and 30.3% did not tell their status to anyone. Disclosure within a steady partnership was less likely among non-French individuals [Haitians: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.72; other nationalities: AOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.68]; and among those diagnosed with HIV after 1997 (AOR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.86). Determinants of disclosure to others were found to be sex (women: AOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.24-3.36), age at diagnosis (>or=50 versus<30 years: AOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.90), nationality (Haitians versus French: AOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.77), transmission route (non-sexual versus sexual: AOR 3.38, 95% CI 1.12-10.23) and hospital inpatients (hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients: AOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.17-3.37). After disclosing, social and emotional support from confidants was common and discrimination was infrequent. CONCLUSION: One third of PLWHA had kept their HIV status secret. Interventions targeting the general population and social institutions, and support for PLWHA by healthcare staff are needed to improve the situation.","AIDS (London, England)",2007 Jan,England,2007,00

METHODS: The study was undertaken in the context of the World Health Organization collaborative Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children study. The representative samples were drawn from 10 European countries. A group of 14,287 (6716 boys and 7571 girls) 15-year-olds was surveyed. The data were collected by standardized questionnaires. Adolescents were asked about sexual behaviour, family structure, parent-child communication, and parental control. A logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the impact of determinants. RESULTS: Greenlandic adolescents were predominantly engaged in early sexual behaviour. Intact family was a key protective factor for adolescents' early sexual behaviour. It significantly decreased both boys' and girls' involvement in early sexual behaviour. Close parent-adolescent relationships and a high level of parental monitoring were found to be less protective factors than family structure. Easy communication with parents, especially with the mother, was more significant for girls' than for boys' early sexual behaviour. A low level of maternal monitoring had a higher impact on boys' early sexual behaviour, while a low level of paternal monitoring had a higher impact on girls. For both maternal and paternal monitoring, the strongest relationship was observed among Hungarian adolescents, but among Greenlanders it was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Many 15-year-olds in European countries are engaged in early sexual behaviour. A close parent- child relationship and a high level of parental monitoring are not as important for adolescents' early sexual behaviour as an intact family.",Scandinavian journal of public health,2008 Aug,Sweden,2008,00

The impact of HIV is considerable and threatens the survival and development of African societies. Although much has been attempted, the results still leave much to be desired. AIDS is an epidemic that needs to be addressed with much creativity and spirit of initiative. It is against this background that the 3rd African conference on the social aspects of HIV/AIDS brought innovations in the way international conferences are designed, activities implemented and results obtained. The innovations concerned the approach to international conferences and take into account reconceptualising HIV/AIDS so as to encourage holistic approaches and better visibility of vulnerable groups. The activities of the conference were organised in such a way as to get people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), grassroots communities and marginalised groups to play a focal role. The conference offered an opportunity for developing cultural activities that would translate the African cultural concepts that had been identified as important in the HIV situation and response analysis. Interaction at the conference created an opportunity to analyse the various dimensions of the political, cultural and economic determinants.

19332501,Changing trends in indigenous inequalities in mortality: lessons from New Zealand.,"BACKGROUND: We describe trends from 1951 to 2006 in inequalities in mortality between the indigenous (Maori) and non-indigenous (non-Maori, mainly European-descended) populations of New Zealand. We relate these trends to the historical context in which they occurred, including major structural adjustment of the economy from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s, followed by a retreat from neoliberal social and economic policies from the late 1990s onwards. This was accompanied by economic recovery and the introduction of health reforms, including a reorientation of the health system towards primary health care. METHODS: Abridged period lifetables for Maori and non-Maori from 1951 to 2006 were constructed using standard demographic methods. Absolute [standardized rate difference (SRD)] and relative [standardized rate ratio (SRR)] mortality inequalities for Maori compared with European/Other ethnic groups (aged 1-74 years) were measured using the New Zealand Census-Mortality Study (an ongoing data linkage study that links mortality to census records) from 1981-84 to 2001-04. The SRDs were decomposed into their contributions from major causes of death. Poisson regression modelling was used to estimate the extent of socio-economic mediation of the ethnic mortality inequality over time. RESULTS: Life expectancy gaps and relative inequalities in mortality rates (aged 1-74 years) widened and then narrowed again, in tandem with the trends in social inequalities (allowing for a short lag). Among females, the contribution of cardiovascular disease to absolute mortality inequalities steadily decreased, but was partly offset by an increasing contribution from cancer. Among males, the contribution of CVD increased from the early 1980s to the 1990s, then decreased again. The extent of socio-economic mediation of the ethnic mortality inequality peaked in 1991-94, again more notably among males. CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with a causal association between changing economic inequalities and changing health inequalities between ethnic groups. However, causality cannot be established from a historical analysis alone. Three lessons nevertheless emerge from the New Zealand experience: the lag between changes in ethnic social inequality and ethnic health inequality may be short (<5 years); both changes in the distribution of the social determinants of health and an appropriate health system response may be required to address ethnic health inequalities; and timely monitoring of ethnic health inequalities, based on high-quality ethnicity data, may help to sustain political commitment to pro-equity health and social policies.",International journal of epidemiology,2009 Dec,England,2009,00
20198904,[Prevention and treatment of hepatitis C in illicit drug users].,"Drug use is a complex behavior with multidimensional determinants, including social, psychological, cultural, economic, and biological factors. Blood borne viral infections including hepatitis C virus are transmitted when an uninfected intravenous drug user (IVDU) uses injection equipment, especially syringes, that have previously been used by an infected person. The transmission can also result from sharing other injection equipment such as 'cookers' and 'cottons'. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse have declined substantially since the introduction of needle exchange. Infection with hepatitis C may spontaneously resolve during the acute stage and never progress to chronic infection, or the infection may become chronic without medical complications, or the infection may become chronic with progressive medical complications. Regular testing for infection is an important strategy for secondary prevention of chronic hepatitis C infection. Care for hepatitis C is a vital component of a comprehensive health program for persons using illicit drugs. Such care includes screening for transmission risk behavior, prevention counseling and education, testing for HCV antibody and RNA. IDUs found to have chronic HCV infection should be assessed for the presence and degree of liver disease and evaluated for treatment for HCV Hepatitis C care also requires providing access to treatment for substance use and abuse. Therapy with opioid agonists, including methadone maintenance treatment, has been shown to diminish and often eliminate opioid use and reduce transmission of infection. Approval of buprenorphine makes office-based pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction possible. When considering treatment for hepatitis C, particular attention must be paid to mental health conditions. As a group, IDUs exhibit higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders than the general population. IFN-based regimens for hepatitis C are often complicated by neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including depression, insomnia, and irritability. Strong linkages with mental health services, whether on-site or within the community, are a vital component of comprehensive health programs for IDUs and are particularly important during treatment for hepatitis C.

18030822,Health disparities in Milwaukee by socioeconomic status.,"BACKGROUND: In 2006, the city of Milwaukee ranked worse than any Wisconsin county for health outcomes and worse than all but 1 county for health determinants. METHODS: To further examine disparities in health, Milwaukee city ZIP codes were stratified into 3 groups (lower, middle, and upper) by socioeconomic status (SES). Health determinants (15 measures) and health outcomes (2 measures) were compared across these ZIP code groups, and to the rest of Wisconsin. RESULTS: The risk ratio for the lower SES group in comparison to the upper SES group was at least 2.0 for 5 of the 17 measures examined, and was at least 1.5 for 13 of the 17 measures. The upper SES group in Milwaukee, while the healthiest in the city, was worse than the state average in 6 measures. CONCLUSIONS: Large health disparities within the city of Milwaukee are associated with geographic regions of differing socioeconomic status. As the state's largest urban center, Milwaukee's relatively poor health and significant health disparities have a considerable impact on the overall health of the state. To improve population health in Wisconsin, substantial efforts and resources are needed to address these disparities, and their related upstream factors.",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,2007 Oct,United States,2007,00
17068928,Positive identity as a positive youth development construct: conceptual bases and implications for curriculum development.,"According to the theories of Erikson, Marcia, and Higgins, adolescents who can cultivate a clear and positive identity after their developmental struggles in adolescence often advance more smoothly into adulthood. Identity is organized, learned, and dynamic, and subjective evaluation of an individual's identity has emotional consequences for that individual. This paper discusses literature on the nature and importance of identity and presents strategies such as self-esteem enhancement, management of exploration and commitment, as well as reduction of self-discrepancies to help adolescents develop functional identity. Significant determinants of a person's identity development, namely gender and cultural issues, are also addressed as they are important in designing the ""Positive Identity Development"" package of Positive Adolescent Training through Holistic Social Programmes (P.A.T.H.S.), supported by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust, to help adolescents develop a positive identity.",International journal of adolescent medicine and health,2006 Jul-Sep,Germany,2006,00

11355716,Psychosomatic complaints in schoolchildren: a Nordic comparison.,"AIMS: This study investigates the association between psychosomatic complaints (PSC) and background factors from children in the five Nordic countries, their families, and their social context in a model using proximal (child), intermediate (family), and distal (society) levels. Similarities and differences between the countries were compared. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to the parents of a representative sample of 3,760 Nordic children aged seven to 12 years. The relationship between PSC and background factors was analysed using structural equation modelling. RESULTS: Headaches and stomach complaints were most common. The prevalence was higher in girls than in boys. A LISREL analysis showed that determinants of PSC varied little between countries. The most important factors associated with PSC were the mother's health and well-being, the child's mental stability and social competence, and the family's socioeconomic status. Families with low education, blue-collar work, low income, and unemployed fathers were found to be most vulnerable. High risk factors could be influenced by other intervening protective factors. The greatest country differences were found on the distal level, where macroeconomic, legislative, and social factors dominated. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of PSC was quite similar between the Nordic countries, although there were some small differences. The results also confirm that the determinants of PSC are multidimensional. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the complex reality.",Scandinavian journal of public health,2001 Mar,Sweden,2001,00
18820345,"Effects of self-efficacy, body mass, and cardiorespiratory fitness on exercise motives in Chinese college students.","BACKGROUND: Researchers have studied exercise determinants primarily from cognitive and social psychology perspectives, which typically give minimal attention to the body as a physical and biological entity. With the belief that tapping into multidimensional variables would potentially help us better understand motivation in exercise, we designed this study to examine the influences of self-efficacy, body mass, and cardiorespiratory fitness level on Chinese college students' leisure-time exercise motives. METHODS: 208 college students completed measures of self-efficacy and exercise motives during regular physical education classes. Their body mass and cardiorespiratory fitness level data were derived from the latest annual physical training test. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of self-efficacy, body mass, and cardiorespiratory fitness on exercise motives. RESULTS: Cardiorespiratory fitness level and self-efficacy in exercise significantly contributed to both psychological and interpersonal motives. Body mass was the only significant predictor for body-related motives. However, analyses of health and fitness motives did not result in any significant predictors. CONCLUSION: Physical and psychological variables have both independent and specialized functions on exercise motives. Future motivational studies in exercise should pay greater attention to ecological approaches that account for physical, psychological, and social factors.",Journal of physical activity & health,2008 Sep,United States,2008,00
12227967,Urban development and health inequalities.,"Urban development has historically been seen as both a cause and solution for social inequalities in health. However, environmental and individual gradients within urban areas occur everywhere, and are resistant to change. Environments are influenced by the degree and type of industrialization, quality of housing, accessibility to green space and - of increasing concern - transport. Individual behaviour, however, also contributes to social differences, both through migration and by the effects on individuals of cultural experiences through the life-course. Reduction on inequalities may be possible through larger social action, for example urban regeneration. There remains an important role for public health in addressing determinants of health at the population level.",Scandinavian journal of public health. Supplement,2002,England,2002,00
12556926,Functional outcome at adolescence for infants less than 801 g birth weight: perceptions of children and parents.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare functional, emotional, and academic status of adolescents who had been extremely low birth weight (ELBW) with those who were full term. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six adolescents who were born in 1983 to 1984 at less than 801 g birth weight were compared with 26 adolescents born at term. Adolescent-perceived status was assessed using the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-SR) and the Self-Perception Profile. Parents' perceptions were assessed using BASC Parent Report, Family Impact Questionnaire, and Functional Status Measure. Health status was obtained through written requests to primary care providers and parent interviews. Academic and attendance information was obtained through school records. RESULTS: Compared to the term adolescents, the ELBW group had significantly lower function related to health status, increased need for special education, and tended to score lower on academic performance measures. However, ELBW adolescents' perceptions regarding their scholastic, athletic, or social competencies did not differ from the term group or national normative data. Parents of ELBWs reported lower adaptive skills, but no other behavioral differences from the term group. CONCLUSION: ELBW survivors and their parents perceived outcome at adolescence positively in spite of evident limitations. Mechanisms that ELBW families use to cope may be important determinants for successful, long-term outcome.",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,2003 Jan,United States,2003,00
12205250,A prospective study of the role of depression in the development and persistence of adolescent obesity.,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent obesity is a strong predictor of adult obesity, and adult obesity has been associated with depression, especially in women. Studies have also suggested an association between depression in adolescence and higher body mass index (BMI) in adulthood. Whether depression leads to obesity or obesity causes depression is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine in longitudinal analyses whether depressed mood predicts the development and persistence of obesity in adolescents. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 9374 adolescents in grades 7 through 12 who completed in-home interviews for the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Assessments were made at baseline (1995) and at follow-up 1 year later. Depressed mood was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. BMI (kg/m2) was calculated from self-reported height and weight. BMI percentiles and z scores were computed using the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. Obesity was defined as BMI > or =95th percentile, overweight as BMI > or =85th percentile and <95th percentile, and normal weight as BMI <85th percentile. A parental respondent gave information on household income, parental education, and parental obesity. RESULTS: At baseline, 12.9% were overweight, 9.7% were obese, and 8.8% had depressed mood. Baseline depression was not significantly correlated with baseline obesity. Among the 9.7% who were obese at follow-up, 79.6% were obese at baseline, 18.6% were overweight at baseline, and 1.8% were normal weight at baseline. Having depressed mood at baseline independently predicted obesity at follow-up (odds ratio: 2.05; 95% confidence interval: 1.18, 3.56) after controlling for BMI z score at baseline, age, race, gender, parental obesity, number of parents in the home, and family socioeconomic status. This finding persisted after controlling further for the adolescents' report of smoking, self-esteem, delinquent behavior (conduct disorder), and physical activity. After controlling for all these same factors, depressed mood at baseline also predicted obesity at follow-up among those not obese at baseline (odds ratio: 2.05; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 4.06) and follow-up BMI z score among those obese at baseline (beta = 0.11; standard error beta = 0.05). In contrast, baseline obesity did not predict follow-up depression. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed adolescents are at increased risk for the development and persistence of obesity during adolescence. Understanding the shared biological and social determinants linking depressed mood and obesity may inform the prevention and treatment of both disorders.",Pediatrics,2002 Sep,United States,2002,00
12841426,Biological and environmental determinants of childhood obesity.,"Childhood obesity reflects the confluence of three factors that minimize attention to internal physiologic satiety signals: the release of central opioids through ingestion of sweets and fats, which induces a preference for such foods; the phylogenetic quality of extending meals in response to environmental demands, as in work schedules, or through finding patches of agreeable food that are safe to consume (this is exacerbated in impoverished children, whose activity is limited); the determination of food preference through social interactions renders feeding systems open to external influences such as mass marketing and television advertising. Alternative feeding modes are presented based on studies of childhood food preferences and how children may be influenced to choose more balanced and healthier diets.",Nutrition in clinical care : an official publication of Tufts University,2003 Jan-Apr,United States,2003,00
15345092,Factors Associated with Women's Medication Use.,"HEALTH ISSUE: Research has consistently shown that while women generally live longer than men, they report more illness and use of health care services (including medication). In the literature, the reasons for women's elevated medication use are not clear. This paper investigates the associations between over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription (Rx) medication use and selected social and demographic variables in men and women. KEY FINDINGS: While a larger proportion of women than men used medication throughout the study, the proportion of people using medication did not increase. The use of OTC and Rx medication increased by number of physician visits for women and men.Medication use increased with age, chronic disease and number of physician visits, and decreased with the perception of good to excellent health. The relationship with other factors varied for women and men depending on their education level, income and social roles. For women, the social roles of being married or previously married, being employed or being a parent did not increase their likelihood of medication use. Reported income adequacy is not associated with the chances of mediation use among highly educated women, but for women with low levels, medication use increases as income adequacy decreases. DATA GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: More complete data are needed about social roles and their relation to mediation use. Data that would allow an assessment of the appropriateness of OTC and Rx drug use or the reasons for such use need to be collected. More research is needed to better understand the distribution and determinants of specific medication use.",BMC women's health,2004 Aug 25,England,2004,00
18941263,Issues in the measurement of social determinants of health.,"This article focuses on the measurement of the social determinants of health, and specifically on issues relating to two key variables relevant to the analysis of public health information: poverty and inequality. Although the paper has been written from the perspective of economics, the discipline of the two authors, it is also of relevance to researchers in other disciplines. It is argued that there is a need to ensure that, when considering measurement in this largely neglected area of research, sufficient thought is given to the relationships that are being examined or assessed. We argue further that any attempt at measurement in this area must take into account the historical backdrop and the complex nature of the relationships between these key variables.",Health information management : journal of the Health Information Management Association of Australia,2008,Australia,2008,00
15030015,Husband involvement in the treatment of child illness in Guatemala.,"The aim of this study is to test prevailing assumptions that Guatemalan men are authoritative or aloof husbands and, in turn, are either problematic or irrelevant to child health. Based on survey data collected in 1994-95 about 959 children, this research examines whether, how and why husbands were involved in recent episodes of young children's illness and sheds light on the potential effect of husband involvement on treatment. A relatively high percentage of women reported that they asked for advice or assistance from their husbands regarding child illness, and, contrary to popular notions, the multivariate analyses suggest that husbands' involvement was not driven by their household authority. Rather, key determinants of whether husbands gave advice or assistance included characteristics of the illness and child and the availability of sources of social support, while key determinants of what kind of support husbands gave (namely whether they gave/bought medicines, recommended a provider visit, or gave other advice or assistance) largely related to characteristics of the illness and child, as well as the availability of biomedical health care providers in the community and ethnicity.",Journal of biosocial science,2004 Mar,England,2004,00
10960532,Public perception of the risk of blood transfusion.,"BACKGROUND: Health policymakers are concerned about the proportion of people who say they are unwilling to receive a blood transfusion. This article examines how social, cultural, and political factors affect the perceived risk of transfusions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected as part of a large national telephone survey of 1204 people conducted in the United States in 1997 and 1998. The survey elicited images associated with blood transfusions and contained questions about the perceived risk of the blood supply, sensitivity to stigma, world views, trust, and demographics. RESULTS: The results showed that a substantial proportion of people do not consider the US blood supply to be safe and say they would not accept blood if hospitalized. The images evoked most frequently by the stimulus phrase ""blood transfusions"" were related to AIDS or HIV. The people who tend to perceive the greatest personal and public risk from blood transfusions are female, nonwhite, and less educated, and they have not previously received a transfusion. Sensitivity to stigma, mistrust, one's perceived inability to control hazardous activities and technologies, and fatalistic and egalitarian world views tend to be associated with heightened concern about the risk of blood transfusions. CONCLUSION: Risk perceptions need to be monitored to anticipate and deal with problems of public acceptance. Risk management strategies should be tailored to the specific characteristics of individuals that are important determinants of the perceived risk of transfusions.",Transfusion,2000 Aug,United States,2000,00

However, the study of intergroup attitudes has focused primarily on the influence of direct exposure to out-group members as determinants of stereotypes and prejudice. Two experiments tested the hypothesis that learning that others share one's intergroup beliefs influences intergroup attitudes and behavior as well as stereotype representation. Experiment 1 demonstrated that learning that one's beliefs are shared or not shared with others influences attitudes, behavior, and the strength of the attitude-behavior relationship. Experiment 2 demonstrated a potential mechanism for such effects by showing that learning about whether others share one's stereotypes influences the accessibility of those stereotypes and related stereotypes.",Journal of personality and social psychology,2001 Apr,United States,2001,00
19184723,The determinants of discrimination against daughters in China: evidence from a provincial-level analysis.,"This paper reports a provincial-level analysis of the way in which various socio-economic and socio-demographic determinants influence the decision to discriminate against daughters in China. While most existing studies use the infant or child sex ratio as the only variable to be explained, this study analyses separately the two main discriminatory practices: sex-selective abortion (with sex ratio at birth as a proxy) and neglect of girls' health care (with excess infant mortality among females as a proxy). The analysis helps to illuminate the circumstances that encourage sex-selective behaviours, which appear to be dictated mainly by extreme poverty, family support to the elderly, and father's education, together with the social pressure on couples to adhere to traditional values and roles and the constraints on family size. While sex-selective abortion appears to result from long-term strategies to optimize family composition, lethal neglect is the immediate result of economic constraints.",Population studies,2009 Mar,England,2009,00
17106541,Does the anatomical localization of lower extremity venous diseases affect the quality of life?,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of venous diseases at different anatomical localizations on the qualities of life of patients with varicose veins. METHODS: The study included 354 cases, which was referred to a private vascular and interventional radiology center in Bursa, Turkey between January 2005 to January 2006. The cases were diagnosed with visual inspection and were clinically indicative of varicose veins. Color Doppler ultrasonography was used to radiologically examine the varicose veins. All cases were accepted as class II criteria according to the Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, Pathophysiologic classification. The generic Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36) was used to measure physical and mental quality of life (QOL). High scores indicated good QOL. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 13.0 program was used for the statistical evaluation. RESULTS: When the life SF-36 quality parameters of cases with different anatomical localizations of the varicose veins were examined, only the mental health scores were found to differ in different groups (p<0.01). In females and males with superficial venous disease, significant differences were found in physical function, physical role and pain among the physical health scale components, and in vitality and emotional role scores among the mental state determinants. When females and males with deep vein disease were compared, significant differences were found among both physical and mental health determinants. CONCLUSION: Anatomical localization of lower extremity varicose veins can be accepted as a predictive factor in determining the life qualities of patients with varicosities in their lower limb, and should be used to regulate their therapy and follow up protocols.",Saudi medical journal,2006 Nov,Saudi Arabia,2006,00
11159155,Excess incidence of squamous cell esophageal cancer among US Black men: role of social class and other risk factors.,"Data from a population-based case-control study were used to evaluate the relation between social class factors and squamous cell esophageal cancer and the extent to which alcohol, tobacco, diet, and low income contribute to the higher incidence among Black men than among White men in the United States. A total of 347 male cases (119 White, 228 Black) and 1,354 male controls (743 White, 611 Black) were selected from three US geographic areas (Atlanta, Georgia, Detroit, Michigan, and New Jersey). Cases were residents of the study areas aged 30-79 years who had been diagnosed with histologically confirmed esophageal cancer between 1986 and 1989. The adjusted odds ratios for subjects with annual incomes less than $10,000 versus incomes of $25,000 or more were 4.3 (95% confidence interval: 2.1, 8.7) for Whites and 8.0 (95% confidence interval: 4.3, 15.0) for Blacks. The combination of all four major risk factors-low income, moderate/heavy alcohol intake, tobacco use, and infrequent consumption of raw fruits and vegetables-accounted for almost all of the squamous cell esophageal cancers in Whites (98%) and Blacks (99%) and for 99% of the excess incidence among Black men. Thus, lifestyle modifications, especially a lowered intake of alcoholic beverages, would markedly decrease the incidence of squamous cell esophageal cancer in both racial groups and would narrow the racial disparity in risk. Further studies on the determinants of social class may help to identify a new set of exposures for this tumor that are amenable to intervention.",American journal of epidemiology,2001 Jan 15,United States,2001,00

21234160,Coping behaviour of female teachers: Demographic determinants.,"BACKGROUND: The study investigates the role of certain demographic variables in determining stress-coping behavior of female teachers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consists of 150 female teachers selected by stratified sampling method from various schools of Bhopal. Stress-coping behavior was measured with the help of a subscale of 'The Occupational Stress Indicator' (Wendy Lord, 1993) consisting of 28 items encompassing six dimensions of coping strategies i.e. Logics, Involvement, Social Support, Task Strategies, Time Management and Home and Work Relations. The scores of the subjects were compared in terms of marital status, age, and level of teaching with the help of 't' test and 'F' test was used for comparing experience. RESULTS: Marital status, age, and experience were found to be significant determinants of stress-coping, whereas the sores did not differ significantly on the basis of level of teaching. CONCLUSION: Married teachers in the age range of 40-60 years, with higher experience can cope better with the job stress than their counterparts.",Industrial psychiatry journal,2009 Jan,India,2009,00
17650032,Determinants for having sex while symptomatic among patients with sexually transmitted infections in Uganda.,"In order to identify predictors of having sex while symptomatic among patients with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), a cross-sectional study was done at Mulago STD clinic in Kampala, Uganda. Ninety eight patients with STIs who engaged in sex while symptomatic were compared with 40 patients who did not engage in sex while symptomatic on: social-demographic; STI symptoms, health seeking behavior; condom use, sexual behaviour; partner referral; and knowledge and attitudes about STIs. On univariate analysis the risk of having sex while symptomatic was increased by: being female (crude odds ratio (COR) 2.82,95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-6.47), being married (COR 4.42, CI 1.89-10.43); presenting with other symptoms apart form vaginal / urethral discharge, genital ulcer, or low abdominal pain (COR 2.76, CI1.19-6.41); having a regular partner (COR3.14, 1.49-7.83); not having sex with a casual partner (COR 3.86 CI 1.46-10.29), and finding it difficult to refer sexual partners (COR 2.66, CI 1.04-6.86). The independent predictors of having sex while symptomatic were symptoms > 14 days duration (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 8.01, CI 2.00-16.67), previous medications (AOR 5.85, CI 2.04-16.75) and finding it difficult to refer sexual partners (AOR 4.76, CI 1.45-16.67). To reduce the proportion of STI patients who engage in sex while symptomatic, there is need to strengthen health education messages that stress the importance of abstaining from sex while symptomatic and to provide effective treatment at the first level of contact with these patients.",African journal of health sciences,2000 Jul-Dec,Kenya,2000,00
19203848,Genetic determinants of ageing processes and diseases in later life.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of genetic factors in diseases of later life. METHODS: Review of literature relevant to the role of genetic factors in variation of incidence of age-related diseases of later life using Medline, Web of Science, to search publications in English since 1980 and citations found in relevant publications. RESULTS: The identity of ageing and longevity genes remains unknown despite lively interest in lipoprotein metabolism, genomic instability, oxidative stress, cellular response to damage, inflammatory processes, insulin/IGF1-signalling and Sirtuins. Genes involved in lifespan appear remarkably conserved across species but genes that convey increased susceptibility to specific age-dependent diseases are not yet identified. CONCLUSION: Individual differences in rates of ageing and incidence of the common diseases of later life require explanation. The Sirtuins and the field of epigenetics are emerging as potentially informative research priorities. Further research includes the development of biomarkers and a greater understanding of the interaction between genes and the environment. The hypothetical treatment of ageing could retard or prevent age-associated diseases resulting in widespread health, social and economic benefit.",Maturitas,2009 Mar 20,Ireland,2009,00
19380976,Mobile phones as mediators of health behavior change in cardiovascular disease in developing countries.,"The global burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is becoming a growing problem in developing countries. Successful self-management of CVD is dependent on a multitude of factors, including social support, communication with health care providers, careful monitoring, and other determinants. The growing market penetration and the communication properties of mobile phones create opportunities for innovation in promoting CVD self-management through support of lifestyle and behavior modification. Mobile phones support various modes of communication and interaction, have fewer adoption barriers, and are more prevalent than other available technologies in developing countries. However, mobile phone interventions are not without many challenges such as mobile infrastructure, electric infrastructure, access to mobile devices, and appropriate user interfaces for interaction. In this paper, we discuss current evidence as well as research opportunities to explore the role of mobile phones in supporting behavior modification in developing countries.",Studies in health technology and informatics,2009,Netherlands,2009,00
16076583,Addictions and social compassion.,"Addictions are, to a considerable extent, born of disadvantage and deprivation. That is not the whole story; there are other factors in place, some of which are in individuals as individuals. In terms of the social determinants of ill-health, addiction and poverty are highly correlated. There is also a literature that investigates whether additionally inequality is bad for our health. The hypothesis put forward in this paper is that in a caring society being poor is not good for health but it is not so bad as being poor in an uncaring society. Societies that claim to be based on social solidarity, as do the Scandinavians, tend to be highly taxed with consequent large public sectors. In Australia, taxation is very low relative to most OECD countries. The idea of tax for redistributive purposes is not seen as politically palatable to the Australian electorate. There is a need to rethink the public health response to addictions. Epidemiology and biostatistics dominate too much. Public health needs to accept the depth and width of the challenge that a concern for and acceptance of the role of social capital offer. The paper discusses this in the context of community autonomy and public compassion and the need for societies to 'own' addictions and addiction policy in public discourse. More compassion will not 'solve' problems of inequalities and addictions. The point is rather that it is a good place to start.",Drug and alcohol review,2005 Mar,Australia,2005,00

Modest to strong support was provided for components of TPB and SET; weak support was provided for components of TRA. Perceived behavioral control was related to vigorous physical activity. Self-efficacy was related to moderate and vigorous physical activity, and it accounted for the effect of intention on physical activity. The observed relationships were similar between Black and White girls. Self-efficacy and perceived behavioral control are independent influences on physical activity among Black and White adolescent girls and warrant study as potential mediators in physical activity interventions.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",2002 Sep,United States,2002,00
12645179,[Psychobiological determinants of risk behavior in adolescence].,"Human adolescence is mainly characterised by an elevated number of psychological, biological and behavioural changes. This rapid as well as challenging change in the ""inner state"" during adolescence in humans seems to share a number of similarities with the age-dependent alteration of the normal and ""linear"" development in other mammalian species. Hence, in order to further investigate the biological bases of these idiosyncratic age-related responses, it seems worth to develop and to study suitable animal models for this developmental phase. Aim of the present review is to show experimental results indicating an elevated similarity between humans and rodents (mice and rats) in a number of psychological (elevated levels of novelty seeking as well as of harmavoidance due to a reduced anxiety) behavioural (elevated exploration of novel as well as potentially dangerous environments and peculiar vulnerability to incentive properties of drugs of abuse) and neurobiological (developing state of the underlying cortical pathways implicated in the above mentioned responses) processes. These findings could prove really useful in view of a general deeper comprehension of this age period and helpful in developing earlier and more effective prevention strategies aimed at reducing the social impact of dangerous and reckless behaviours frequently shown by human adolescents (drug addiction, undesired pregnancy. AIDS and car accident).",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,2002,Italy,2002,00
17920743,The social epidemiology of tuberculosis in South Africa: a multilevel analysis.,"Increased risk of tuberculosis is widely recognized to be associated with increased poverty, yet there have been few analyses of the social determinants of tuberculosis, particularly in high-burden settings. We conducted a multilevel analysis of self-reported tuberculosis disease in a nationally representative sample of South Africans based on the 1998 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Individual and household-level demographic, behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors were taken from the DHS; data on community-level socioeconomic status (including measures of absolute wealth and income inequality) were derived from the 1996 national census. Of the 13,043 DHS respondents, 0.5% reported having been diagnosed with tuberculosis disease in the past 12 months and 2.8% reported having been diagnosed with tuberculosis disease in their lifetime. In a multivariate model adjusting for demographic and behavioral risk factors, tuberculosis diagnosis was associated with cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and low body mass index, as well as a lower level of personal education, unemployment and lower household wealth. In a model including individual- and household-level risk factors, high levels of community income inequality were independently associated with increased prevalence of tuberculosis (adjusted odds ratio for lifetime tuberculosis comparing the most unequal quintile to the middle quintile of inequality: 2.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.59-3.53). These results provide novel insights into the socioeconomic determinants of tuberculosis in developing country settings, although the mechanisms through which income inequality may affect tuberculosis disease require further investigation.",Social science & medicine (1982),2008 Jan,England,2008,00
10916199,[Determinants of health and health policy. Part 3. From intervention of quality of life].,"Effectiveness of outputs of a qualified intervention can be valued by several positive criteria corresponding to the ""quality of life"" conception, which is based on the feeling of the health and contentment. The finding that great differences in the income among different social groups in conditions of the liberal market society correlate with several health and social problems brought about to the hypothesis that the decrease of the differences in the income, accompanied by strengthening of various forms of the social cohesion, civic solidarity, legitimate equality, and ethical justice may substantially improve the health status of the population. The hypothesis has been verified in many epidemiological studies and found to be valid enough for the health policy and far-seeing economy. Analytics of the World Bank recommend to governments primary invest into the health of socially week groups in order to decrease their poverty and to keep social conciliation. World Health Organization (WHO) sets in its new program for Europe called ""21 Goals for the 21st Century"" that differences in the health status among the European states should diminish till 2020 by one third and within the countries by one quarter at least. Both goals should be achieved by a substantial improvement of the health status of the ill-adapted social groups and by significant improvement of those socioeconomical conditions which may have adverse effects namely on the differences in incomes, education and opportunities for employment.",Casopis lekaru ceskych,2000 Mar 29,Czech Republic,2000,00
17176238,"Federal, State and Territory government responses to health inequities and the social determinants of health in Australia.","ISSUE ADDRESSED: Planned actions by governments can play an important part in addressing the social determinants of health and health inequities. We assess the extent to which Australian health departments are committed to health equity as a core value, and the extent to which strategic directions and policies show evidence of action and achievement in reducing health inequities and attention to the social determinants of health. METHODS: Key documents guiding each health department since 2000 were sought from a key informant in each jurisdiction (State/Territory/federal). An analysis was made of the content in terms of stated values, strategies, objectives, intended and current initiatives, collaborations, funding, and reporting of achievements in relation to the reduction of health inequities and the attention accorded to the social determinants of health. RESULTS: All jurisdictions are explicitly or implicitly committed to reducing health inequities and to addressing the social determinants of health to at least a limited extent. The extent of commitment varies from those who make a clear statement of the importance of achieving health equity at both whole-of-government and health department level, to others who have extremely limited commitment. There is also variation in the extent to which directions are transformed into planned initiatives to improve health outcomes or access to health services for disadvantaged groups or areas, and variations in the degree of monitoring and evaluation. CONCLUSION: Although substantial health inequities exist in Australia there is explicit or implicit recognition of the underlying value of equity within all jurisdictions and some policies designed to increase health equity in all. However, in most jurisdictions health equity could be more explicitly incorporated into core government and health department strategies and initiatives, and there is room for the development of the capacity to monitor change over time in access to services, quality of care, and improved health outcomes.",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2006 Dec,Australia,2006,00

By comparing the socioeconomic provisions for specialist training in Italy and the UK, this work identified several determinants negatively influencing the environment in which junior doctors practise. Modernisation of European postgraduate medical education can be taken forward, provided some regulation and some consistency in socioeconomic provisions for specialist training can be promoted by competent authorities across all European countries.",Postgraduate medical journal,2006 Dec,England,2006,00
16186159,Health care costs in old age are related to overweight and obesity earlier in life.,"Obesity is responsible for at least 90 billion dollars in direct U.S. health care costs annually. A high proportion of people who were overweight or obese at younger ages survives past age sixty-five to experience adverse consequences. The determinants of obesity are complex and multifactorial, with genetic, biological, behavioral, social, and environmental contributors. The effects of adverse weight in older age have negative implications for healthy aging and lead to greater societal expenditures. Given the high costs and ineffectiveness of existing programs to treat obesity, perhaps the only solution to the obesity epidemic is primary prevention of weight gain beginning in youth.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2005,United States,2005,00
17525696,Women's midlife health across cultures: DAMES comparative analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The Decisions At Menopause Study (DAMES) investigates the experience of menopause in four countries. This article explores self-reported health. DESIGN: Women aged 45 to 55 years were interviewed in Lebanon (n=298), Morocco (n=299), Spain (n=300), and the United States (n=293). The survey instrument included closed- and open-ended questions. Statistical analyses were used to assess the determinants of reporting poor health, and textual analyses were used to highlight themes related to perceptions of health. RESULTS: In Lebanon and Morocco, 22% and 28%, respectively, of the women sampled indicated that their health was not good. In Spain and the United States, 15% and 11% of the women sampled reported their health as fair or poor. We explored significant predictors of poorer reported health across sites. Responses to the open-ended questions ""How is your health?"" and ""How do you compare your health to other women your own age?"" revealed common concerns of aches and pains, tiredness, work/responsibilities, and family across all four sites. Unique themes included the war in Lebanon, poverty in Morocco, and social activity in Spain. Menopausal symptoms may in many cases be overshadowed by other health concerns of middle-aged women. Nonspecific symptoms such as tiredness and aches and pains serve to link bodily health with social circumstances. Family and work responsibilities are common concerns of middle-aged women. CONCLUSIONS: Research on midlife health and menopause needs to be systematic enough to enable cross-cultural comparisons. At the same time, it must be flexible enough to identify population-specific symptoms, social context, and lifestyle concerns.","Menopause (New York, N.Y.)",2007 Jul-Aug,United States,2007,00
18562066,"Coping with the Asian tsunami: perspectives from Tamil Nadu, India on the determinants of resilience in the face of adversity.","The Asian tsunami of December 26, 2004 wreaked havoc along the southeastern coast of India and resulted in devastating losses. The high rates of long-term mental health consequences in adult survivors predicted immediately after the disaster have not been borne out by recent surveys. This qualitative study explored the psychological impact of the tsunami on survivors with a view to gaining insights into the ethno-cultural coping mechanisms of affected communities and evaluating resilience in the face of incomprehensible adversity. We conducted focus group discussions 9 months after the tsunami with two groups of fishermen, two groups of housewives, a group of village leaders and a group of young men in four affected villages of Nagapattinam district in Tamil Nadu, India. In spite of incomplete reconstruction of their lives, participants reconstructed meaning for the causes and the aftermath of the disaster in their cultural idiom. Qualitative changes in their social structure, processes and attitudes towards different aspects of life were revealed. Survivors valued their unique individual, social and spiritual coping strategies more than formal mental health services. Their stories confirm the assertion that the collective response to massive trauma need not necessarily result in social collapse but also includes positive effects. The results of this study suggest that interventions after disaster should be grounded in ethno-cultural beliefs and practices and should be aimed at strengthening prevailing community coping strategies.",Social science & medicine (1982),2008 Sep,England,2008,00
17712693,"Using the theory of planned behaviour to understand the motivation to learn about HIV/AIDS prevention among adolescents in Tigray, Ethiopia.","Various studies indicate that school- or university-based HIV prevention curricula can reduce the prevalence of sexual risk behaviour among adolescent youth in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, effective HIV/AIDS prevention education may be problematic, if the needs of youth are not served adequately. To date, little attention has been given to the motivation of youth to learn about HIV/AIDS and about their preferences for HIV/AIDS curriculum design options. The aim of this study was to get insight into the determinants of the motivation of youth to learn about HIV/AIDS prevention and to assess their curriculum design preferences. Students from a university in Tigray, Ethiopia, filled out a structured questionnaire, which assessed demographics, variables that according to the Theory of Planned Behaviour are related to the motivation to learn, and their preferences for independent, carrier and integrated HIV/AIDS curriculum designs. On average, participants were highly motivated to learn about HIV/AIDS. Motivation to learn was primarily related to social norms and was not related to self-efficacy to discuss HIV/AIDS in class. The often discussed reluctance to discuss sexuality and condom use in curricula in Sub-Saharan Africa, seems to be more related to existing negative social norms, than to lack of self-efficacy. Participants revealed a high preference for the independent, carrier and integrated curriculum design options. However, students with a higher motivation to learn about HIV/AIDS were more attracted to the independent course design.",AIDS care,2007 Aug,England,2007,00
19828251,Perceived entitlement to pain-related support and pain catastrophizing: associations with perceived and observed support.,"Studies on the determinants of pain-related support are needed to enhance couples-based treatments for pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which pain catastrophizing and perceived entitlement to pain-related support (i.e., support entitlement) were associated with perceived and observed social support. Participants were 106 chronic pain couples recruited from the community. They completed surveys as well as an observational discussion task. Greater support entitlement in persons with pain was correlated positively with pain catastrophizing, punishing spouse responses, and observed spousal invalidation but negatively correlated with perceived spousal support, solicitous spouse responses, and observed validation. Catastrophizing was correlated with perceptions of general spousal support but not the other support variables. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that among persons with lower levels of support entitlement, catastrophizing was associated with greater solicitous spouse responses. Among those with a greater entitlement to support, catastrophizing was associated with greater punishing spouse responses and observed invalidation by the spouse. These results suggest that support entitlement plays an important role in couples' supportive interactions about pain. Continued research is needed to determine how a desire for pain-related attention and support and catastrophizing translate into behaviors that affect support provision and receipt.",Pain,2009 Dec 15,United States,2009,00
18248691,Representations of relatedness with parents and friends and autonomous academic motivation during the late adolescence-early adulthood period: reciprocal or unidirectional effects?,"BACKGROUND: The literature on the determinants of academic motivation indicates that social and affective processes connected to students' interpersonal relationships are central elements in understanding students' academic motivation and other school-related outcomes. AIMS: The aim of this study was to answer the following questions: Does autonomous motivation drive representations of relatedness, do representations of relatedness drive autonomous motivation, or are these constructs reciprocally related over time? SAMPLE: The sample consists of 834 adolescents aged 18 years (SD=1.88) who participated in a 3-year longitudinal study. RESULTS: Results from the structural equation models provided good support for the effect of representations of relatedness with parents on autonomous academic motivation but no convincing support for the effect of motivation on representations of relatedness with parents. In addition, no significant effect in either direction was found between representations of relatedness with friends and autonomous academic motivation. CONCLUSION: It might be important to inform parents that they may still have an influence on their adolescent's representations of relatedness and subsequently on his/her autonomous academic motivation even during the late adolescence-early adulthood period, a period when some parents may be tempted to believe that they can do little to motivate their offspring.",The British journal of educational psychology,2008 Dec,England,2008,00
19241490,Determinants of physical activity among women treated for breast cancer in a 5-year longitudinal follow-up investigation.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the 5-year trajectory of physical activity among women with breast cancer, and to evaluate biopsychosocial variables (health status, physical symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQL), depressive symptoms, and social support), measured soon after breast cancer diagnosis, as predictors of the 5-year trajectory. METHODS: Women diagnosed with Stage II or III regional breast cancer (n=227), surgically treated and awaiting the start of adjuvant therapy completed baseline assessments of medical, psychological, and behavioral functioning. Follow-up evaluations were conducted every 4 months during the first year and every 6 months during the subsequent 4 years (12 assessments total during the 5-year study). Mixed-effects modeling was utilized to estimate the baseline level of physical activity as well as rate of change over time. Measures of physical health status, HRQL, depressive symptoms, and social support were included as predictors of the physical activity trajectory. RESULTS: A curvilinear pattern of change in physical activity was evident over the 5-year follow-up (p=0.002). Physical activity increased gradually during the first 18 months, then declined steadily over the subsequent 42 months. Poor physical health, depressive symptoms, and lower emotional HRQL were associated with less physical activity. Higher family support was associated with a slower decline in physical activity in the latter 42 months of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional HRQL following diagnosis with breast cancer appears to be important for sustaining physical activity in the first 1-2 years following diagnosis. Physical activity interventions among breast cancer survivors should address depressive symptoms early in the course of treatment.",Psycho-oncology,2009 Apr,England,2009,00
15171840,[Intimate partner violence: social and health determinants and responses].,"The present study aims to review the problem of intimate partner violence, as well as its causes and consequences. It will also specifically analyze the role of health professionals. In opposition to the classical epidemiological view of risk factors, Heise proposes an ecological framework to study violence against women. This framework analyzes the interplay among the personal, situational and sociocultural factors that combine to cause abuse. Regarding the frequency of intimate partner violence in Spain, in January 2003 there were 2.519 formal complaints and 69 women died between January and November 2003. No geographical patterns in mortality or the incidence of formal complaints of intimate partner violence or among the provinces with the highest incidence of formal complains and those with highest mortality were observed. The only national survey published in Spain was performed by the Women's Institute in 1999, which reported a prevalence of domestic violence of 9.2%. A frequency of 22.8% was found in a primary health care center in Granada. Health services can play a key role in helping victims of domestic violence, since most women contact the health services at some time in their lives. Professionals in administrative or managerial positions can contribute to raising awareness of this health problem, which is one of the main causes of poor health and disability. Evidently, beyond consciousness-raising and early detection campaigns, public health strategies should be designed to prevent this serious health problem the causes of which can be changed.",Gaceta sanitaria,2004,Spain,2004,00

Married mothers and their infants demonstrated more positive behavior and received higher HOME scores when the infant was 6 and 15 months old than did their cohabiting and single counterparts. Married families were also better off than single and cohabiting families on several demographic, parent personality, financial, and social context measures. Single and cohabiting families were similar across most measures. Selection variables (maternal age, ethnic group, and education) explained much, but not all, of the family structure differences in the mother-infant relationship and the HOME. Maternal psychological adjustment, attitudes about child rearing, income, and social support explained little of the family structure variation, suggesting that characteristics that preceded marriage and conception were important determinants of family structure differences.",Journal of family psychology : JFP : journal of the Division of Family Psychology of the American Psychological Association (Division 43),2004 Mar,United States,2004,00
19878542,Current European guidelines for management of arterial hypertension: are they adequate for use in primary care? Modelling study based on the Norwegian HUNT 2 population.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that clinical guidelines using combined risk evaluation for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) may overestimate risk. The aim of this study was to model and discuss implementation of the current (2007) hypertension guidelines in a general Norwegian population. METHODS: Implementation of the current European Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension was modelled on data from a cross-sectional, representative Norwegian population study (The Nord-Trondelag Health Study 1995-97), comprising 65,028 adults, aged 20-89, of whom 51,066 (79%) were eligible for modelling. RESULTS: Among individuals with blood pressure >or=120/80 mmHg, 93% (74% of the total, adult population) would need regular clinical attention and/or drug treatment, based on their total CVD risk profile. This translates into 296,624 follow-up visits/100,000 adults/year. In the Norwegian healthcare environment, 99 general practitioner (GP) positions would be required in the study region for this task alone. The number of GPs currently serving the adult population in the study area is 87 per 100,000 adults. CONCLUSION: The potential workload associated with the European hypertension guidelines could destabilise the healthcare system in Norway, one of the world's most long- and healthy-living nations, by international comparison. Large-scale, preventive medical enterprises can hardly be regarded as scientifically sound and ethically justifiable, unless issues of practical feasibility, sustainability and social determinants of health are considered.",BMC family practice,2009 Oct 30,England,2009,00
19005951,Continuing professional development and social accountability: a review of the literature.,"The idea that health professionals should be accountable to the society they serve is not a new concept and by the 1990 s, the continuing professional development (CPD) of health professionals was being seen as one way in which Canadians' level of health could be improved. The public was, and is still today, increasingly demanding a system that is more responsive to regional and community needs. As a result, there is a need for more health professional education at all stages of the education continuum - undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing professional development - that meets the health and social needs of the populations being served. The trend is now towards 'socially accountable' health care, meaning that the broader context of CPD must also include the personal, social, and political aspects of health care and as such, involve a widening of accountability to patients, the community, managers and policymakers. CPD planning must take into account local and national priorities as well as personal learning needs. However, the definition of social accountability and the stages at which it is addressed is sometimes vague and this added to the difficulty of identifying relevant studies in the literature. Nonetheless, there were some ""best practices"" evident via Canadian and American studies which focused on models of socially accountable CPD, as well as examples of interdisciplinary collaboration in Canada, the United States, Australia, Great Britain, and the United Arab Emirates. However, there is a definite need for increased research and publication of such ""best practice"" initiatives. There is also a need for Canadian health professional schools to facilitate this process by sharing their experiences and resources if possible. An extensive literature review was conducted between January and March 2004. Due to time constraints, it was limited to articles written in the English language. The databases/sources utilized included: Medline (now known as Pubmed), CINAHL, ERIC, PsychInfo, Canadian Business & Current Affairs (CBCA) Full-text Education (now known as CBCA Education), Research and Development Resource Base in Continuing Medical Education (RDRB/CME) at the University of Toronto, EMBASE (Excerpta Medica). This literature review was one of the first activities conducted under the auspices of ""Issues of Quality and Continuing Professional Development: Maintenance of Competence"", a national project funded by the Primary Health Care Transition Fund, Health Canada. The purposes of this review were to identify literature which focuses on aspects of continuing professional development, social accountability, and determinants of health; ""best practices"" of socially accountable CPD and inter/intra-disciplinary collaboration, and the critical success factors and challenges to implementing CPD, especially CPD that meets the needs of both health professionals and the populations they serve.",Journal of interprofessional care,2008,England,2008,00
16585483,Social interactions in adolescent television viewing.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether social interactions influence the television viewing choices of adolescents in grades 7 through 12. DESIGN: Data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey were used to examine the association between individual-level and school-level television choices. An instrumental variables approach was used to solve the simultaneity problem found in models that examine the association between individual and aggregate choices. SETTING: In-home interviews in the United States collected in 1996. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 4532 students in grades 7 through 12 in 132 US public and private schools who participated in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). MAIN EXPOSURE: The reported television viewing choices of an individual's schoolmates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The number of hours of television individuals reported viewing in a week. RESULTS: The number of hours of television that adolescents report viewing per week was associated with their peers' reported hours of television viewing. Adjusted for other covariates, a 1-hour increase in average school-level television viewing was associated with an increase in almost half an hour of television viewing at the individual level. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that social interactions within schools influence the hours of television that adolescents report viewing. This finding is important for both future attempts at modeling the determinants of adolescent television viewing and suggestions for future policy interventions. The presence of social interactions implies that interventions that affect the social norms of television viewing within schools could also change individual television viewing. In reducing the number of hours of television watched, these interventions could also positively affect adolescent obesity, emotional problems, and academic achievement.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,2006 Apr,United States,2006,00
17696267,Determinants of reduced walking speed in people with musculoskeletal pain.,"OBJECTIVE: Maintenance of good walking speed is essential to independent living. People with musculoskeletal disease often have reduced walking speed. We investigated determinants of slower walking, other than musculoskeletal disease, that might provide valuable additional targets for therapy. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Somerset and Avon Survey of Health, a community based survey of people aged over 35 years. A total of 2703 participants who reported hip or knee pain at baseline (1994/1995) were studied, and reassessed in 2002-2003; 1696 were available for followup, and walking speed was tested in 1074. Walking speed (m/s) was used as outcome measure. Baseline characteristics, including comorbidities and socioeconomic factors, were tested for their ability to predict reduced walking speed using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Age, female sex, and immobility at baseline were predictive of slower walking speed. Other independent risk factors included the presence of cataract, low socioeconomic status, intermittent claudication, and other cardiovascular conditions. Having a cataract was associated with a decrease of 0.10 m/s (95% CI 0.03, 0.16). Those in social class V had a walking speed 0.22 m/s (95% CI 0.126, 0.31) slower than those in social class I. CONCLUSION: Comorbidities, age, female sex, and lower socioeconomic position determine walking speed in people with joint pain. Issues such as poor vision and social-economic disadvantage may add to the effect of musculoskeletal disease, suggesting the need for a holistic approach to management of these patients.",The Journal of rheumatology,2007 Sep,Canada,2007,00
16936981,[Association between dietary carbohydrates and type 2 diabetes mellitus: epidemiological evidence].,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been escalating throughout the world and usual food consumption is regarded as one of the most important environmental determinants for chronic diseases. Thus, the role of type and quality of carbohydrates on the etiology of type 2 diabetes is still poorly understood. The present review discusses the available epidemiological evidence regarding the effect of the type and source of carbohydrate of the usual diet and the risk of type 2 diabetes in adults. Although epidemiological investigations support the hypothesis for a potential risk effect of high glycemic index and low fiber content diets for diabetes, the results are controversial and the benefit may be related to the magnesium content of the structure of the grains, suggesting the relevance of taking into account the food sources instead of nutrients on investigations of diet and risk of chronic diseases. The available evidence suggests that eating a diet rich in whole grain cereals and vegetables and low in refined grains, sucrose and fructose contents is beneficial in the prevention of diabetes. Thus, more clinical trials are required to support the associations and establish biologically plausible pathways.",Arquivos brasileiros de endocrinologia e metabologia,2006 Jun,Brazil,2006,00
12573079,The relative strength of weight and length at birth in contrast to social factors as determinants of height at 18 years in Brazil.,"BACKGROUND: There is scarce information on the relative importance of measurements at birth and social factors in determining adult height. AIM: To assess the relative contribution of length and weight at birth, and social factors to height at 18 years. METHODS: A total of 3470 boys born in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil, in 1978/1979 were reassessed at the time of military conscription. Anthropometric, demographic and social variables were collected concurrently and used in a multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2029 (61.3%) of the target population were assessed at 18 years. In the adjusted analysis, birth length, birth weight, social class, neighbourhood wealth of subject, maternal age and birth order were highly associated with height at 18 years. The results were similar when birth weight and length at birth were included as continuous or categorical variables. The differences in height due to length at birth were greater than those due to social factors. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated the lasting and greater effect of length and weight at birth on height in comparison to social factors, but social factors are still meaningful in their effects on height. Birth length has a marginal greater effect on final height than birth weight.",Annals of human biology,2002 Nov-Dec,England,2002,00
11061638,Multiple levels of analysis and intervention in HIV prevention science: exemplars and directions for new research.,"The need to continue the scientific development of evidence-based HIV-1 prevention strategies is clear. The epidemic continues to rage out of control, and a vaccine against HIV-1 is nowhere in sight. We think that it is important to consider the influence of multiple social units on HIV risk behavior. In this article, we use ecological theory to outline multiple levels of analysis at which preventive interventions can be conceptualized. These levels include the individual, dyadic/small group, organizational, community, and societal/cultural. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of locating HIV risk at each level, and provide exemplars of HIV prevention for each in an effort to encourage HIV prevention scientists to consider the level at which they are locating the determinants of HIV risk behavior when conducting research. We conclude by stating that scientists and research funding has favored the individual level of analysis, but that to be most successful, the field of HIV prevention science should address risk behavior at all levels of analysis.","AIDS (London, England)",2000 Sep,England,2000,00
14962415,The determinants of participation in activities of daily living in people with impaired vision.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the determinants of participation in daily activities in people with impaired vision using the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) instrument. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We recruited 319 participants with no vision rehabilitation history, distance visual acuity (VA) <6/12 (better eye), the ability to converse in English, and 18 years or older. Participants completed the 32-item IVI questionnaire and provided demographic, personal, cultural, and environmental details on vision-related functioning. Visual acuity data were either abstracted from the participants' files or assessed by qualified personnel. Participants also completed the SF-12 to evaluate physical (PCS-12) and mental health (MCS-12). RESULTS: The areas of greatest restriction of participation were associated with reading, outdoor mobility, participation in leisure activities, and shopping. In stepwise linear regression presenting VA, the PCS-12 and MCS-12 explained the variance in leisure and work (60 participants or 19%), consumer and social interaction (92 participants or 30%), household and personal care (76 participants or 24%), mobility (92 participants or 30%), emotional reaction to visual loss and (106 participants or 33%), and total IVI score (114 participants or 36%). Having age-related macular degeneration contributed marginally to the IVI domains and total score (P <.05-.01), except for the emotional domain. Belonging to a social group explained 3% and 2% of the variance in the consumer and social interaction and emotional domains, respectively (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: Distance VA and physical and mental health explained more than a third of the variance of the total score, suggesting that an intervention aimed at improving quality of life may include strategies to improve not only vision-related rehabilitation but also mental and physical health.",American journal of ophthalmology,2004 Feb,United States,2004,00
19027188,Overcoming social and health inequalities among U.S. women of reproductive age - challenges to the nation's health in the 21st century.,"OBJECTIVE: To frame the discussion of the nation's health within the context of maternal and child health. METHODS: We used national data or estimates to assess the burden of 46 determinants. RESULTS: During 2002-2004, U.S. women of reproductive age experienced significant challenges from macrosocial determinants, to health care access, and to their individual health preservation. Two-thirds of women do not consume recommended levels of fruits and vegetables. Overall, 29% experienced income poverty, 16.3% were uninsured. About one in four women of reproductive age lived with poor social capital. Compared with white women of reproductive age, non-white women reported higher levels of dissatisfaction with the health care system and race-related discrimination. Among all U.S. women, chronic diseases contributed to the top nine leading causes of disability adjusted life years. About one-third of women had no prophylactic dental visits in the past year, or consumed alcohol at harmful levels and smoked tobacco. One in three women who had a child born recently did not breast feed their babies. Demographics of women who are at increased risk for the above indicators predominate among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. CONCLUSIONS: At least three-fourths of the U.S. women of reproductive age were at risk for poor health of their own and their offspring. Social intermediation and health policy changes are needed to increase the benefits of available health and social sector interventions to women and thereby to their offspring.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2009 May,Ireland,2009,00
15277281,Social support and its relationship to morbidity and mortality after acute myocardial infarction: systematic overview.,"Among the commonly understood socioeconomic determinants of health, social change, disorganization, and poverty have been associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. One of the postulated mechanisms through which these determinants have been linked to health and illness is their relationship to social support. The health determinant, social isolation or lack of a social support network (SSN), and its effects on premature mortality after acute myocardial infarction mandate further scrutiny by the cardiovascular community for several reasons. First, as a predictor of 1-year mortality, low SSN is equivalent to many of the classic risk factors, such as elevated cholesterol level, tobacco use, and hypertension. Second, treatment of acute myocardial infarction is costly. Because low social support is associated with an increased 1-year mortality, neglecting the role of the SSN may diminish the possible gains accrued during acute-phase treatment. Therefore, lack of an SSN should be considered a risk factor for subsequent morbidity and mortality after a myocardial infarction. Finally, cardiac rehabilitation programs and other extant prevention strategies can be better used to reduce mortality after myocardial infarction. This article systematically reviews recent evidence related to SSNs to provide an update on the role of social support in cardiovascular disease-related outcomes.",Archives of internal medicine,2004 Jul 26,United States,2004,00

15798130,Father's occupational group and daily smoking during adolescence: patterns and predictors.,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship among father's occupational group, daily smoking, and smoking determinants in a cohort of New Zealand adolescents. METHODS: The longitudinal Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study provided information on adolescents' self-reported smoking behavior and potential predictors of smoking, such as social and material factors, personality characteristics, educational achievement, and individual attitudes and beliefs regarding smoking. Longitudinal logistic generalized estimating equation analyses were used. RESULTS: Adolescents whose fathers were classified in the lowest-status occupational group were twice as likely as those whose fathers occupied the highest-status occupational group to be daily smokers. This high risk of daily smoking among the adolescents from the lowest occupational group was largely predicted by their lower intelligence scores and by the higher prevalence of smoking among fathers and friends. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent socioeconomic differences in smoking, school-based interventions should seek to prevent smoking uptake among adolescents, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status.

17254605,A genetic study of the acute anxious response to carbon dioxide stimulation in man.,"People with panic disorder-agoraphobia and their relatives often react anxiously to CO(2)-enriched gas mixtures. Available data are not suited to disentangle genetic from common environmental causes of familial aggregation of CO(2) reactivity, nor provide quantitative estimations of the sources of trait variation. Three-hundred-forty-six twin pairs belonging to the general population-based Norwegian NIPH Mental Health Study underwent self-assessments of anxiety and of DSM-IV panic symptoms after inhalation of a 35%CO(2)-65%O(2) mixture. Two thresholds were employed - at sample's 75th and 90th percentiles of responses - to define provoked panic attacks and to calculate polychoric correlations. Variance components were estimated by structural equation modelling (SEM). For definitions of responses based on the sum of all 13 panic symptoms, SEM could not discriminate between shared environmental versus genetic causes of familial resemblance for provoked attacks. For definitions of responses based on global anxiety, or on the sums of those symptoms (dyspnea, dizziness, palpitations) with highest variance post-CO(2), the best-fitting models indicated additive genetic factors as the sole causes for within-family resemblance. Best-fit heritability estimates ranged from 0.42 to 0.57. Genetic and idiosyncratic environmental factors explain most of individual differences in reactivity to hypercapnia. Within-family similarities for this trait are largely explained by genetic determinants.",Journal of psychiatric research,2007 Dec,England,2007,00
16142509,Background factors as determinants of satisfaction with care among first-episode psychosis patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of demographic and psychosocial background factors and psychiatric and functional status before and at admission on the patients' satisfaction with care (PSC) among first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients. METHOD: One year after entering the Parachute Project, 134 FEP patients completed a patient satisfaction questionnaire. The association with demographic and psychosocial background factors, together with psychiatric and functional status before and after admission, was analysed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine per cent of the variance of PSC was explained by factors such as educational level, social network, duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) the year prior to onset. Negative symptoms and lack of hope at admission were also predictors of PSC. The strongest predictor was DUP. CONCLUSION: Affecting the public knowledge in psychiatric problems and psychiatric treatment, together with early intervention strategies aiming to decrease the prodromal and DUP period among FEP patients, can positively influence the patients' experience of given care. By increasing the knowledge of available psychiatric treatment, the sense of powerlessness might decrease among the affected persons, and the possibility of early help seeking might increase.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2005 Sep,Germany,2005,00
17107636,Determinants of adolescent pregnancy in an urban area in Turkey: a population-based case-control study.,"The aim of this study was to determine the degree to which socioeconomic status is a risk factor for first birth at age 19 or younger in married women in an urban area of Turkey. The research was a population-based case-control study. The study group comprised all married and pregnant women aged 15-19 (adolescent pregnancies) attending primary care centres (144 subjects). Married women between 20 and 29 years of age, experiencing their first pregnancy (adult pregnancies), were determined as the control group (144 subjects). A questionnaire was completed for each subject during face-to-face interviews. Adolescent pregnancy was more frequent in women from families with a low socioeconomic status, as determined by occupation (class) and income; both were associated with adolescent pregnancy. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified seven factors associated with adolescent pregnancy: exposure to violence within the family prior to marriage; families partially opposed or unopposed to adolescent marriage; secondary school or lower education level; lack of social security; living in houses in which the number of persons per room was over 1; unemployed women; and having sisters with a history of adolescent pregnancy.",Journal of biosocial science,2007 Mar,England,2007,00
11825636,Iron stores in low-income pregnant Mexican women at term.,"BACKGROUND: Iron stores can be depleted during pregnancy. Serum ferritin is the most useful non-invasive test to assess iron stores in women of reproductive age. Iron status of pregnant Mexican women at term from a low-income group was investigated through serum ferritin determinations. METHODS: Hemoglobin and serum ferritin were measured in 201 low-income urban women with at-term pregnancy receiving attention at a public university hospital. Hemoglobin cut-off value was 110.0 g/L. Depending on their serum ferritin concentration, women were divided into three groups: group I, iron deficiency, serum ferritin <12 microg/L; group II, borderline iron stores, serum ferritin >or=12 microg/L and <30 microg/L, and group III, normal iron stores, serum ferritin >or=30 microg/L. RESULTS: Mean SF value in the entire group was 7.0 +/- 6.4 microg/L, with a mean Hb of 110.1 +/- 15.8 g/L. One hundred seventy-two women (85.6%) had empty iron stores. Ninety-two women (46%) in the entire group had iron deficiency anemia, as did 79 (46%) of the 172 iron-deficient women. During their pregnancy, 165 women (82%) did not ingest any supplemental iron and 131 (65%) did not receive any prenatal care. CONCLUSIONS: We documented a high prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, together with practically no prenatal care utilization and no supplemental iron ingestion in this low-income group. A serum ferritin concentration >or=12 microg/L was always accompanied by a normal hemoglobin concentration. These data suggest that prenatal care and iron supplementation may be considered as major determinants of maternal iron stores to prevent iron deficiency anemia.",Archives of medical research,2002 Jan-Feb,United States,2002,00
12406806,Variability and vulnerability at the ecological level: implications for understanding the social determinants of health.,"OBJECTIVES: We examined variability in disease rates to gain understanding of the complex interactions between contextual socioeconomic factors and health. METHODS: We compared mortality rates between New York and California counties in the lowest and highest quartiles of socioeconomic status (SES), assessed rate variability between counties for various outcomes, and examined correlations between outcomes' sensitivity to SES and their variability. RESULTS: Outcomes with mortality rates that differed most by county SES were among those whose variability across counties was high (e.g., AIDS, homicide, cirrhosis). Lower-SES counties manifested greater variability among outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in health outcome variability reflect differences in SES impact on health. Health variability at the ecological level might reflect the impact of stressors on vulnerable populations.",American journal of public health,2002 Nov,United States,2002,00
14512245,Pedestrian injuries in Mexico: a multi-method approach.,"UNLABELLED: Studies of road traffic injuries should identify social determinants amenable to intervention, and should attend to the problems of individual drivers and pedestrians. This is especially true in developing nations like Mexico, where traffic fatality rates are high and interventions ineffective. OBJECTIVE: Combine qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze pedestrian injuries from motor vehicles in Mexico City, and identify their social, contextual and environmental determinants. Methods included (1). a cross-sectional analysis of mortality, producing crude and specific mortality rates and standardized mortality ratios (95% CI) by region; (2). Spatial analysis using a geographic information system to generate maps at different aggregation levels; (3). Observation with cameras to identify traffic patterns, spaces, behaviors, and patterned violations of regulations; and 4). Semi-structured in-depth interviews of pedestrians and drivers involved in an accident. RESULTS: The overall crude mortality rate was 7.14/100000, (CI 6.85-7.42), with differences by sex and region. The highest concentration of deaths was observed in 10 neighborhoods, at specific types of street environments. The high-risk environments have wide avenues with abundant vehicular traffic, where spaces supposedly reserved for pedestrians are invaded by cars and vendors. Many pedestrians have never driven a motor vehicle, few know the traffic signs, and almost all events were ""hit and run"" cases. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of quantitative and qualitative methods allows us to see the specific importance of some determinants of pedestrian injuries. Spatial, epidemiological, and social perspectives help point out the local accident characteristics which must be considered before defining preventive interventions.",Social science & medicine (1982),2003 Dec,England,2003,00
12162831,Inequalities in health in Latin America and the Caribbean: descriptive and exploratory results for self-reported health problems and health care in twelve countries.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore and describe inequalities in health and use of health care as revealed by self-report in 12 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. METHODS: A descriptive and exploratory study was performed based on the responses to questions on health and health care utilization that were included in general purpose household surveys. Inequalities are described by quintile of household expenditures (or income) per capita, sex, age group (children, adults, and older adults), and place of residence (urban vs. rural area). For those who sought health care, median polishing was performed by economic status and sex, for the three age groups. RESULTS: Although the study is exploratory and descriptive, its findings show large economic gradients in health care utilization in these countries, with generally small differences between males and females and higher percentages of women seeking health care than men, although there were some exceptions among the lower economic strata in urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in self-reported health problems among the different economic strata were small, and such problems were usually more common among women than men. The presence of small inequalities may be due to cultural and social differences in the perception of health. However, in most countries included in the study, large inequalities were found in the use of health care for the self-reported health problems. It is important to develop regional projects aimed at improving the questions on self reported health in household interview surveys so that the determinants of the inequalities in health can be studied in depth. The authors conclude that due to the different patterns of economic gradients among different age groups and among males and females, the practice of standardization used in constructing concentration curves and in computing concentration indices should be avoided. At the end is a set of recommendations on how to improve these sources of data. Despite their shortcomings, household interview surveys are very useful in understanding the dimensions of health inequalities in these countries.",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,2002 May-Jun,United States,2002,00
19031488,The relationship between generalized social phobia and avoidant personality disorder in a national mental health survey.,"OBJECTIVE: There has been ongoing clinical controversy dating back to the revised third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders concerning the boundaries and extent of overlap between Axis I generalized social phobia (GSP) and Axis II avoidant personality disorder (APD). This study sought to examine the relationship between the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders GSP and APD in a large nationally representative sample of the United States population. METHOD: We used the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (n=43,093; age 18+; response rate=81%) to study fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Axes I and II psychiatric disorders, assessed by a reliable semi-structured in-person interview. RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence was 2.8% for GSP and 2.4% for APD. The overlap between GSP and APD varied according to the number of GSP social situations feared. Although 36.4% of individuals with GSP were diagnosed with APD, the majority (57.3%) of individuals with GSP who feared all 13 social situations assessed were diagnosed with APD. Nearly 40% of individuals with APD also had GSP. Compared to individuals with GSP alone, individuals with comorbid GSP and APD showed significantly lower mental health-related quality of life on the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form, more interaction and observation fears, and an increased likelihood of having other psychiatric disorders such as major depression. CONCLUSIONS: APD and GSP show a high degree of overlap (16-57%), depending on the number of social situations feared. Overall, results suggest that APD and GSP appear to be highly related, but potentially separable constructs. Further research is needed to identify the determinants and consequences of having either or both diagnoses.",Depression and anxiety,2009,United States,2009,00
17690579,Determinants of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy among HIV-1-infected patients in Cote d'Ivoire.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess adherence to HAART and to determine factors associated with poor adherence among HIV-1-infected patients in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. METHODS: A prospective observational study of 614 consecutive patients attending an HIV/AIDS outpatient clinic. Adherence was measured twice at 3-month intervals by self-report of missing doses over 4 days. An adherence level of less than 95% was defined as poor adherence. We used generalized estimating equation models for binomial distribution with repeated measures for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 591 subjects who completed the study, 74.3% reported adherence levels of 95% or greater. Six factors were independently related to poor adherence: age less than 35 years [relative risk (RR) 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.79], absence of social support (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.24-2.24), number of daily pills 10 or more (RR 1.47; 95% CI 1.14-1.91), time of adherence assessment (first versus second time assessment RR 1.36; 95% CI 1.12-1.66), CD4 cell count of 250 cells/mul or greater (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.10-1.88), and not being less worried about HIV infection now that treatments have improved (RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.01-1.58). Drug supply interruptions in the pharmacies were reported by 10.0% of the non-adherent patients as the reason for missing pills. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial factors were found to impact adherence and should be analysed in more detail by further studies. Scaling up antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa should be preceded by reliable drug supply and distribution systems.","AIDS (London, England)",2007 Aug 20,England,2007,00
19643005,The health of Arab-Americans living in the United States: a systematic review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Despite substantial attention paid to Arab-Americans (AAs) in the media and in public discourse, there is limited research about the health of AAs in the United States (US) in the public health literature. This review aims to synthesize the extant peer-reviewed literature concerned with the health of AAs living in the US. METHODS: We summarize existing research on the prevalence, relative burden compared to other ethnic and racial groups, and determinants of diseases within each morbidity cluster among AAs living in the US. RESULTS: Available evidence suggests that the health of AAs may differ from that of other ethnic and racial groups in the US, and that exposures specific to this ethnic group, such as immigration, acculturation, and discrimination may be important in the etiology of several diseases among AAs. CONCLUSION: Given the growth of this ethnic group and its marginalization in the current sociopolitical climate, more research about the health of AAs in the US seems warranted. We summarize relevant methodological concerns and suggest avenues for future research.",BMC public health,2009 Jul 30,England,2009,00
16494089,Work and family characteristics as determinants of socioeconomic and sex inequalities in sleep: The Japanese Civil Servants Study.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether socioeconomic and sex inequalities in poor sleep quality are explained by socioeconomic and sex differences in work and family characteristics. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand five hundred fifty-six employees (2397 men and 1159 women) aged 20 to 65 years in local government in Japan. MEASUREMENTS: Respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire that asked about sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; work characteristics, as measured by the job-demand-control-support model, work hours, and shift work; and family characteristics, such as family structure and family-work conflicts. RESULTS: Lower control at work, higher work demands, lower social support, shorter and longer working hours, shift work, being single, higher family-to-work conflict, and higher work-to-family conflict were independently associated with poorer sleep quality in both men and women. In men, the age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of low-grade employees for poor sleep quality was 1.64 (95% confidence interval: 1.14-2.36) in comparison with high-grade employees. The difference in sleep was attenuated when work and family characteristics were adjusted for (OR=1.25 [0.84-1.86]). Among women, there was no significant grade difference in sleep. Women tended to have poorer sleep quality than men (the age-adjusted OR=1.75 [1.49-2.06]). The sex difference was attenuated and no longer significant when adjustments were made for work and family characteristics (OR=1.04 [0.85-1.27]). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that work and family characteristics may be important for reducing socioeconomic and sex inequalities in sleep. Sex differences in the pattern of socioeconomic inequalities in sleep deserve further research.",Sleep,2006 Feb,United States,2006,00
17595548,Chronic disease prevention and management: some uncomfortable questions.,"Morgan, Zamora and Hindmarsh make a compelling case for a national strategy on chronic disease prevention and management. The truths raised in the lead paper are not particularly inconvenient, but they do raise a number of uncomfortable questions: (1) Why are physicians not taking a more responsible and active role to prevent and manage chronic diseases on behalf of their patients? (Physicians must recognize that it is their professional responsibility and their job to provide their patients with the appropriate level of care for chronic conditions.) (2) Why are non-physician healthcare providers not playing a larger role to prevent and manage chronic diseases? (3) Why is there a greater focus on managing chronic diseases than on preventing or delaying them from happening? (4) Have we forgotten the profound impact of the social determinants of health on illness, life expectancy and death?",HealthcarePapers,2007,Canada,2007,00
21694883,The determinants of the antibiotic resistance process.,"BACKGROUND: The use of antibiotic drugs triggers a complex interaction involving many biological, sociological, and psychological determinants. Resistance to antibiotics is a serious worldwide problem which is increasing and has implications for morbidity, mortality, and health care both in hospitals and in the community. OBJECTIVES: To analyze current research on the determinants of antibiotic resistance and comprehensively review the main factors in the process of resistance in order to aid our understanding and assessment of this problem. METHODS: We conducted a MedLine search using the key words ""determinants"", ""antibiotic"", and ""antibiotic resistance"" to identify publications between 1995 and 2007 on the determinants of antibiotic resistance. Publications that did not address the determinants of antibiotic resistance were excluded. RESULTS: The process and determinants of antibiotic resistance are described, beginning with the development of antibiotics, resistance and the mechanisms of resistance, sociocultural determinants of resistance, the consequences of antibiotic resistance, and alternative measures proposed to combat antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the published literature identified the main determinants of antibiotic resistance as irrational use of antibiotics in humans and animal species, insufficient patient education when antibiotics are prescribed, lack of guidelines for treatment and control of infections, lack of scientific information for physicians on the rational use of antibiotics, and lack of official government policy on the rational use of antibiotics in public and private hospitals.",Infection and drug resistance,2009,New Zealand,2009,00
19145723,Feeding habits as determinants of early childhood caries in a population where prolonged breastfeeding is the norm.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of feeding habits and daytime sugar intake on the prevalence of early childhood caries in a population where prolonged breastfeeding is a norm. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at 18 of 102 public health centers in Tehran. During a 4-day period at each center, between 20 and 35 children aged 1-3 years were enrolled, resulting in a sample of 504 children. In structured interviews, mothers were asked to give information about their child's feeding habits, daytime sugar intake, and their family's background. Sugar intake during the night was operationalized as separately calculated burdens of nighttime breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. Clinical dental examinations followed the World Health Organization criteria. Data analysis included chi-square test, t-test, ANOVA, and logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Of the children, 56% were solely breastfed (mean duration 16.6 months; 95% CI 16.0-17.2), 42% were both breastfed and bottle-fed, and 2% were solely bottle-fed. Mean duration of breastfeeding for the solely breastfed 24- to 36-month olds was 22.8 months (95% CI 21.8-23.9). At bedtime, 69% were breastfed, 11% bottle-fed, and 20% were not fed at all. With respect to feeding during the night, 72% of children were breastfed, 12% were bottle-fed with milk, 1% received a bottle with water, while 15% were not fed. Early childhood caries (ECC) occurred in 3-26% of the children, depending on age group (P < 0.001). The burden of milk-bottle feeding at night was a clear determinant for ECC (OR = 5.5) whereas breastfeeding per se, its duration, the burden of breastfeeding at night, and daytime sugar intake were not. CONCLUSION: On account of its association with ECC, milk-bottle feeding at night should be limited, whereas prolonged breastfeeding appears to have no such negative dental consequences.",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,2008 Aug,Denmark,2008,00
11990012,Determinants of occurrence and recovery from hallucinations in daily life.,"BACKGROUND: Data related to the dynamics of hallucinatory experiences of patients suffering from schizophrenia are scarce. Detecting antecedent conditions and coping strategies may aid development of targeted psychological interventions. METHOD: We studied hallucinating and non-hallucinating patients suffering from schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n = 57), and non-schizophrenic severe mentally ill patients with depression (n = 37). Data were collected using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) over a period of 1 week. Contingent on a randomly signalling beep, subjects filled in reports of ongoing hallucinations as well as thought, mood, current activity, social circumstances and places frequented. RESULTS: More subjects suffering from schizophrenia reported hallucinations, but for all hallucinating subjects the qualities of hallucination episodes were quite similar. More subjects reported visual hallucinations at least once. In contrast, the intensity of auditory hallucinations was higher. Anxiety was the most prominent emotion during hallucinations and reports of anxiety intensity exceeded baseline levels before the first report of auditory hallucinations. Context modified hallucination intensity over the course of an episode. Social withdrawal resulted in a decrease of hallucinatory intensity (AH > VH), while social engagement slightly raised intensity levels (VH > AH). Doing nothing (VH > AH) and work activities (AH > VH) led to decreases in intensity levels over time, while passive leisure activities (watching TV) resulted in increases in intensity levels of hallucinations (AH > VH). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that hallucinating experiences are subject to a host of contextual influences. Understanding variation offers useful insights for therapy.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2002 Mar,Germany,2002,00
16004700,"Who benefits from inpatient short-term psychotherapy in the long run? Patients' evaluations, outpatient after-care and determinants of outcome.","BACKGROUND: Little work has been published on short-term inpatient treatments combining the virtues of inpatient treatments and short-term psychotherapy. The purposes of this study are to (a) determine the outcomes of short-term psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy from patients' and therapists' perspectives, (b) assess the stability of changes, and (c) identify predictors of long-term outcome. METHODS: 83 consecutive inpatients (76% of those eligible) were assessed at intake, discharge, and 1 year follow-up by standardized questionnaires regarding symptoms (SCL-90R), interpersonal problems (IIP), object relationships (IPO), and the therapeutic relationship (HAQ). Diagnoses and functioning (GAF) were assessed by the therapists. RESULTS: Psychological distress (effect size S = 1.14) and physical complaints (ES = 1.03) decreased strongly from intake to discharge, the majority of patients moving from the pathological to the normal range of the global severity index GSI (SCL-90R). At follow-up, average distress remained at a low level, and the majority of patients, and their therapists and physicians, regarded their well-being as improved. In a multivariate approach, a substantial proportion of variance of the distress at follow-up (42%) was explained by an infantile object relationship pattern (IPO), social avoidance (IIP), negative vocational changes, and a lack of a confidant at follow-up. A delayed start of subsequent ambulatory psychotherapy was another negative outcome predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Attention should be given to maladaptive interpersonal relationship patterns, to vocational reintegration, and a confiding relationship as potential predictors of long-term outcome. Also, patterns of ambulatory after-care following inpatient treatment need further scrutiny.",Psychology and psychotherapy,2005 Jun,England,2005,00
11075414,Clinical epidemiology and research on HIV infection in Switzerland: the Swiss HIV Cohort Study 1988-2000.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) was initiated in 1988 and represented the main scientific component of the comprehensive response to the AIDS epidemic in Switzerland. It brought together physicians and scientists from five university hospitals (Basel, Berne, Geneva, Lausanne and Zurich) and two Cantonal hospitals (Lugano and St. Gallen). The objective of SHCS was, and still is, to produce rapid, high quality patient-oriented medical research in the field of HIV infection. METHODS: SHCS is a prospective population-based cohort study. Any HIV-infected person aged > or = 16 years is eligible to participate. Data collection and study procedures are standardised. Data quality and protocol monitoring are conducted at the coordination and data centre in Lausanne. Detailed information on demographics, income, mode of HIV acquisition, risk behaviours, clinical events, laboratory results, treatment and treatment tolerance is collected at registration and at 6-monthly intervals. RESULTS: Since 1996, 10,600 persons have been enrolled and the SHCS study population is considered fairly representative of the HIV-infected population in Switzerland, at least in terms of gender and mode of HIV acquisition. In 1999, 4600 patients were actively followed up and more than 70% of patients were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). As a consequence, mortality and the incidence of HIV-related opportunistic infections have decreased significantly in the recent past. Between 1996 and 2000, 91 original manuscripts have been published by SHCS scientists and physicians, almost exclusively in peer-reviewed journals. A wide range of scientific questions have been addressed, including HIV primary infection, the natural history of HIV infection, the clinical and biological impact of HAART, drug resistance, risk factors for disease evolution including the timing of treatment initiation, the role of CD4 receptors, the validity of HIV surveillance reports, determinants of treatment access and tolerance, clinical trials of new drug combinations, the interruption of prophylaxis following a favourable response to HAART and issues relating to quality of life and interaction between income, social level and disease evolution. CONCLUSION: The SHCS has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on medical practice, public health and research in Switzerland and beyond. It represents a network of excellence which has brought together and fostered intensive collaboration between physicians and institutions throughout this country and beyond. This was possible thanks to the support of the Federal Office of Public Health and the commitment of primary care physicians, researchers and patients. This project may be model for focused and prioritised multicentre and transdisciplinary research programmes.",Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,2000 Oct 14,Switzerland,2000,00
11875373,Prevalence and determinants of sexually transmitted diseases: an analysis of young Jamaican males.,"BACKGROUND: Jamaican adolescents have high rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). GOALS: Since the sexual behaviors that put an individual at risk for HIV are the same as for other STDs, the prevalence and determinants of STD symptoms among a sample of young Jamaican males were examined. STUDY DESIGN: As part of the 1997 Reproductive Health Survey, male adolescents and young adults in Jamaica were surveyed about symptoms of STDs and related sex behaviors. RESULTS: Overall, 9% of the sample reported symptoms of STDs in the year before the interview. Rates of high-risk sexual behaviors were high. Logistic regression analyses indicated that being older and having multiple sex partners were associated with having symptoms of STDs. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention programs should recognize that various factors can increase the risk of contracting and transmitting STDs, including HIV. Interventions should be targeted to those with high-risk behaviors that are conducive to continued participation in high-risk sexual behaviors.",Sexually transmitted diseases,2002 Mar,United States,2002,00
11132365,Methods for identifying and assessing groups in health behavioral research.,"Methods to study groups developed in other fields have much to contribute to the study of health behavior, including alcohol and substance use. This paper surveys group methods in order to demonstrate how attention to group levels of analysis can provide new insights about the context and causes of health behavior. The first major section of this paper focuses on the influences on health behavior associated with ""naturally occurring groups"" such as peer networks, families, workplaces, neighborhoods, churches, treatment groups and residential settings. Different aspects of group influence are discussed in terms of seven different features of social groups: history, structure, function, resources, process, norms and climate. The second major part of this paper is concerned with methods to identify meaningful subgroups in heterogeneous samples. Following an overview of taxonomic methods to identify and assign cases to groups, we highlight the potential for these methods to help address a number of fundamental theoretical problems in health behavioral research, including: describing cultural diversity, distinguishing response sets in survey research, controlling error in outcomes scores related to baseline differences, tracking trajectories of change, and revealing interactions among determinants of health behavior. The third and final section of the paper highlights specific applications of taxonomic and group-influence methodologies in intervention research, including design and analysis of randomized trials, studies of existing treatment settings and group-level variables involved in translational research.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2000 Nov,England,2000,00
15580719,Individualised quality of life after pacing. Does mode matter?,"AIMS: To examine the hypothesis that atrial based pacing improves Quality of Life (QoL) after pacing by undertaking a detailed QoL evaluation that includes an individualised assessment as well as disease specific evaluation. METHODS: Prospective study of patients randomised to VVI(R) or atrial based pacing modes using the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual QoL (SEIQoL), the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey (SF36), and a modified version of the Karolinska Cardiovascular Symptomatology Questionnaire (KCSQ). RESULTS: Seventy-three patients completed the two-year follow up of the study. Pacing improved SEIQoL scores, cardiovascular symptoms and the physical role limitation, social limitation and mental health domains of SF36 from baseline to one month. Pacing mode had no effect on QoL the major determinants of which were baseline QoL and a history of coronary artery disease. CONCLUSION: Atrial based pacing does not improve QoL in the two years after pacing when compared with VVI(R) pacing.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2004 Nov,England,2004,00

The problem of health is sometimes raised in families, social circles and institutions. Due to the fact that students of special pedagogy have contacts with school children with health deficits, they have to be fully aware of the fact how significant predicator health is in their own development. The target of this study was to show the output of the research aimed at seeking an answer to the following question: What level of knowledge about health and its determinants in their own perception is presented by the students on the grounds of the educational specialty they have chosen? The research comprised 84 students of 1st, 3rd and 5th years of the faculty of special pedagogy (different specialties) aged from 18 to 24. The research material was collected by an interview questionnaire elaborated by themselves and categorized conversation (""a ladder"") concerning three of the following basic questions: 1) the amount of general knowledge about health they possessed; 2) the amount of their knowledge of factors conditioning a human's state of health; 3) the amount of the awareness of the importance of one's care for his or her own health and for that of others. The output received in the research shows a mean degree of satisfaction of special pedagogy students with the level of their knowledge concerning health. Their statements connected with their self-assessment of that level should make one reflect upon the subject in question.",Roczniki Panstwowego Zakladu Higieny,2006,Poland,2006,00

We're short of people telling us what to do"": an appraisal of public policy and mental health.","BACKGROUND: There is sustained interest in public health circles in assessing the effects of policies on health and health inequalities. We report on the theory, methods and findings of a project which involved an appraisal of current Scottish policy with respect to its potential impacts on mental health and wellbeing. METHODS: We developed a method of assessing the degree of alignment between Government policies and the 'evidence base', involving: reviewing theoretical frameworks; analysis of policy documents, and nineteen in-depth interviews with policymakers which explored influences on, and barriers to cross-cutting policymaking and the use of research evidence in decisionmaking. RESULTS: Most policy documents did not refer to mental health; however most referred indirectly to the determinants of mental health and well-being. Unsurprisingly research evidence was rarely cited; this was more common in health policy documents. The interviews highlighted the barriers to intersectoral policy making, and pointed to the relative value of qualitative and quantitative research, as well as to the imbalance of evidence between ""what is known"" and ""what is to be done"". CONCLUSION: Healthy public policy depends on effective intersectoral working between government departments, along with better use of research evidence to identify policy impacts. This study identified barriers to both these. We also demonstrated an approach to rapidly appraising the mental health effects of mainly non-health sector policies, drawing on theoretical understandings of mental health and its determinants, research evidence and policy documents. In the case of the social determinants of health, we conclude that an evidence-based approach to policymaking and to policy appraisal requires drawing strongly upon existing theoretical frameworks, as well as upon research evidence, but that there are significant practical barriers and disincentives.",BMC public health,2008 Sep 15,England,2008,00
15030013,Pathways of the determinants of unfavourable birth outcomes in Kenya.,"This paper explores the pathways of the determinants of unfavourable birth outcomes, such as premature birth, the size of the baby at birth, and Caesarean section deliveries, in Kenya using graphical log-linear chain models. The results show that a number of factors that do not have direct associations with unfavourable birth outcomes contribute to these outcomes indirectly through intermediate factors. Marital status, the desirability of a pregnancy, the use of family planning and access to health facilities have no direct associations with poor birth outcomes, such as premature births and the small size of the baby at birth, but are linked to these outcomes through antenatal care. Antenatal care is identified as a central link between various sociodemographic or reproductive factors and birth outcomes.",Journal of biosocial science,2004 Mar,England,2004,00
18781930,Determinants of perceived severity of hypertension and drug-compliance in hypertensive patients.,"BACKGROUND: Severity of illness is not an important determinant of drug-compliance. In this paper we hypothesize that the perceived severity of illness rather than the true severity of illness is a determinant of drug-compliance. If this is true, then it will be worthwhile for physicians to look for factors determining this perceived severity of illness. OBJECTIVES: (I) To test in a prospective survey whether this hypothesis can be confirmed in mildly hypertensive patients, and (II) to identify factors determining their perceived severity of illness. METHODS: 450 patients were invited to participate in a prospective survey if their systolic blood pressure had been between 140 and 170 mm Hg and their diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 100 mm Hg despite treatment, for at least three clinic visits. Based on previously published data three factors possibly contributing to the perceived severity of hypertension were identified: (1) objective medical information, (2) expected physical symptoms, and (3) a positive social identification with fellow-patients. These factors were used as independent determinants in a multiple linear regression model with perceived severity of hypertension as outcome variable. Subsequently, this outcome variable together with patient characteristics was used as an independent variable in a multiple logistic regression model with drug-compliance as outcome variable. RESULTS: 176 patients, mean age 62 years, 52% females, completed the study. In the multiple linear regression analysis all of the three identified factors were statistically significant predictors of the perceived severity of hypertension with beta-values from 0.22 to 0.26, and p-values between 0.031 and 0.004. The multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that, after adjustment for gender, age, school, and general health status, the perceived severity of hypertension was a significant determinant of drug-compliance at p = 0.040. DISCUSSION: The present study shows what information patients use to conclude on the level of their blood pressure being too high or not. This information can be used to better understand the patients' ideas about health and possibly to influence these ideas. Patients' conclusion about the level of their blood pressure predicted their drug-compliance. Our study increased insight into the psychology of the patient and the results may be helpful to physicians in order to further understand and influence patient behaviors, particularly, adherence to antihypertensive medication.",Cardiovascular & hematological disorders drug targets,2008 Sep,United Arab Emirates,2008,00
11596556,The demand for child curative care in two rural thanas of Bangladesh: effect of income and women's employment.,"This paper seeks to investigate the determinants of child health care seeking behaviours in rural Bangladesh. In particular, the effects of income, women's access to income, and the prices of obtaining child health care are examined. Data on the use of child curative care were collected in two rural areas of Bangladesh--Abhoynagar Thana of Jessore District and Mirsarai Thana of Chittagong District--in March 1997. In estimating the use of child curative care, the nested multinomial logit specification was used. The results of the analysis indicate that a woman's involvement in a credit union or income generation affected the likelihood that curative child care was used. Household wealth decreased the likelihood that the child had an illness episode and affected the likelihood that curative child care was sought. Among facility characteristics, travel time was statistically significant and was negatively associated with the use of a provider.",The International journal of health planning and management,2001 Jul-Sep,England,2001,00
19207602,"Home-care utilization within the year of death: trends, predictors and changes in access equity during a period of health policy reform in British Columbia, Canada.","Healthcare policy reforms enacted through the 1990s explicitly endorsed expanded community care and enhanced equitable access to care. We examine end-of-life home-care service utilization during this time period. We are interested in trends in and predictors of utilization influencing receipt of service or total service use. This is a population-based, retrospective study of home-care utilization by adults 50 years of age and older in British Columbia, Canada, who died in the last 6 months of each year from 1991 to 2000 (n = 98,327). Data were drawn from the British Columbia Linked Health Data resource; we examined both receipt and extent of care, using logistic and standard regression models. Independent variables included year of death, age, gender, area of residence and income quintile. Year of death was not significantly associated with receipt of home care in general. However, the odds of receiving home support services declined significantly over time, while annual home support hours increased. In contrast, receipt of home nursing increased, while annual home nursing visits did not change. Social factors frequently emerged as significant predictors of both receipt and extent of care. However, we found only limited evidence for interactions between these factors and year of death acting as determinants of receipt or extent of service. Results suggest that end-of-life home care services did not expand, but instead were reallocated and intensified over the 1990s. As well, there was little evidence to suggest enhanced equity in access to care.",Health & social care in the community,2009 May,England,2009,00

Specifically, the authors describe the development by the ESVHWP Steering Committee of a context-specific stress process model for east side Detroit residents. The authors examine data from in-depth interviews to illuminate actions taken by community members to reduce stressors or minimize their impact on health. Finally, the authors describe the use of this context-specific stress process model and data gathered regarding actions to address community stressors to inform the development of interventions by the ESVHWP to reduce stressors or strengthen the conditioning factors that reduce the impact of stress on health.

11333089,Early teacher-child relationships and the trajectory of children's school outcomes through eighth grade.,"This study followed a sample of 179 children from kindergarten through eighth grade to examine the extent to which kindergarten teachers' perceptions of their relationships with students predict a range of school outcomes. Kindergarten teachers rated children's behavior and the quality of the teacher-child relationship. Follow-up data from first through eighth grade were organized by epoch and included academic grades, standardized test scores, work-habit ratings, and discipline records. Relational Negativity in kindergarten, marked by conflict and dependency, was related to academic and behavioral outcomes through eighth grade, particularly for children with high levels of behavior problems in kindergarten and for boys generally. These associations remained significant after controlling for gender, ethnicity, cognitive ability, and behavior ratings. The results have implications for theories of the determinants of school success, the role of adult-child relationships in development, and a range of early intervention and prevention efforts.",Child development,2001 Mar-Apr,United States,2001,00
19335945,Lessons from tuberculosis control for public health.,"Tuberculosis (TB) control in many ways exemplifies evidence-based public health practice, rigorously implemented, with appropriate emphasis on the central importance of political support for success. With more than 30 million patients treated in the past decade, TB control has important implications for managing both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Simple diagnostic tests, meticulously proven standardized treatment regimens with assured drug supply, supportive case management and a superb information system that tracks the progress of every patient, all facilitate effective program implementation. TB control shows that public health programs, including those that require long-term treatment in the primary care system, can be effective in poor countries; however, TB rates are heavily influenced by the social, environmental and epidemiologic context, emphasizing that treatment is not enough and that socio-economic factors may be more important determinants of epidemiologic trends than treatment programs. TB control is effective when it combines two essential components: a practical, implementable, proven technical package, and political commitment. Political commitment is also essential to implement other interventions that can improve health, including healthier air, water and food, as well as programs to prevent or reduce tobacco smoking, cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity and other growing public health problems. By implementing evidence-based practices, ensuring operational excellence, using information systems that facilitate accountability and evaluation, and obtaining and maintaining political support, we can address the public health challenges of the twenty-first century.",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,2009 Apr,France,2009,00
19689757,A systematic review of caregiver burden following stroke.,"Abstract Caregiver burden following stroke is increasingly recognised as a significant health care concern. A growing number of studies have evaluated the patient, caregiver, and social support factors that contribute to increased caregiver burden. We conducted a systematic review of this literature to guide future research. A search of the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases (up to July 2008) and reference sections of published studies using a structured search strategy yielded 24 relevant articles. Studies were included if they evaluated predictors and/or correlates of caregiver burden in the setting of stroke. The prevalence of caregiver burden was 25-54% and remained elevated for an indefinite period following stroke. In studies that evaluated independent baseline predictors of subsequent caregiver burden, none of the factors reported were consistent across studies. In studies that assessed concurrent factors independently contributing to caregiver burden in the poststroke period, patient characteristics and social support factors were inconsistently reported. Several studies identified caregiver mental health and the amount of time and effort required of the caregiver as significant determinants of caregiver burden. Our findings highlight the need for more research to identify caregivers in need of support and guide the development and implementation of appropriate interventions to offset caregiver burden.",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,2009 Aug,United States,2009,00

This article presents WHO estimates new cases of some of curable STDs, and italian data from national reporting system (published from ISTAT and ISS). The number of new reported cases decreases in Italy, but reported cases are not all cases. People with STDs tend not to seek treatment or to self-medicate, this behaviour is common in youths. In many cases STDs are asymptomatic in both sexes, particularly in women. Women are also much more vulnerable biologically, culturally, socioeconomically. There is also a lack of notification by physicians. Important social determinants of STDs diffusion are migration and travels. Prevention and control of STDs need collaboration between medical disciplines: gynaecology, urology, dermo-venerology, microbiology, epidemiology, public health. Contributions of nurses, laboratory technician and social workers are also required. The role of public health specialists in the prevention is strictly related to health education.

12959869,The view from somewhere: locating lesbian experience in women's health.,"In some circles of nursing practice and research, ""women's health"" is seen to stand for ""women's reproductive and heterosexual health."" In this article we offer a view of women's health that makes central the contexualized reality of the material, social, and discursive experiences of women's lives. We suggest that the barriers to adopting broader conceptualizations of health are grounded in pervasive ideologies that privilege biology and a traditional model of health over nonmedical determinants of health. Lesbian disclosure is a central experience in lesbian life, and, as such, is seen as an exemplar of research questions that challenges our taken-for-granted ideologies and contextualizes women's health experiences.",Health care for women international,2003 Sep-Oct,England,2003,00
11727467,"Overweight, stature, and socioeconomic status among women--cause or effect: Israel National Women's Health Interview Survey, 1998.","OBJECTIVE: To determine if short stature and overweight/obesity are predictors of low socioeconomic status (SES), measured by educational attainment. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study on a random sample carried out through telephone interviews over a period of five months (March through August 1998). SUBJECTS: A total of 1587 Jewish and Arab Israeli women--773 women age 20-44 years, and 814 women age 45-74 years. METHODS: Two cross-sectional telephone surveys were conducted; both times, telephone numbers were drawn from the population registry. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant predictors of body mass index (BMI), while controlling for population group, parity, smoking, and physical activity. RESULTS: The level of one's education and one's stature were significantly, independently associated with BMI. Low stature and obesity were indicators of low educational attainment. LIMITATIONS: The subjects of the study reported their own weight and height. The tendency to overestimate one's height and underestimate one's weight places the accuracy of data under question. However, as there is no reason to believe that the biases in the reports would vary with educational status, the results of the study remain valid. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity/overweight is directly related to the level of education and inversely to stature. Together, one's level of education and stature may be determinants of low SES. Therefore, in subpopulations with high rates of obesity and short stature, comprehensive programs should include welfare in addition to dietary measures.",The journal of gender-specific medicine : JGSM : the official journal of the Partnership for Women's Health at Columbia,2001,United States,2001,00
18706113,"The Lausanne cohort Lc65+: a population-based prospective study of the manifestations, determinants and outcomes of frailty.","BACKGROUND: Frailty is a relatively new geriatric concept referring to an increased vulnerability to stressors. Various definitions have been proposed, as well as a range of multidimensional instruments for its measurement. More recently, a frailty phenotype that predicts a range of adverse outcomes has been described. Understanding frailty is a particular challenge both from a clinical and a public health perspective because it may be a reversible precursor of functional dependence. The Lausanne cohort Lc65+ is a longitudinal study specifically designed to investigate the manifestations of frailty from its first signs in the youngest old, identify medical and psychosocial determinants, and describe its evolution and related outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: The Lc65+ cohort was launched in 2004 with the random selection of 3054 eligible individuals aged 65 to 70 (birth year 1934-1938) in the non-institutionalized population of Lausanne (Switzerland). The baseline data collection was completed among 1422 participants in 2004-2005 through questionnaires, examination and performance tests. It comprised a wide range of medical and psychosocial dimensions, including a life course history of adverse events. Outcomes measures comprise subjective health, limitations in activities of daily living, mobility impairments, development of medical conditions or chronic health problems, falls, institutionalization, health services utilization, and death. Two additional random samples of 65-70 years old subjects will be surveyed in 2009 (birth year 1939-1943) and in 2014 (birth year 1944-1948). DISCUSSION: The Lc65+ study focuses on the sequence ""Determinants --> Components --> Consequences"" of frailty. It currently provides information on health in the youngest old and will allow comparisons to be made between the profiles of aging individuals born before, during and at the end of the Second World War.",BMC geriatrics,2008 Aug 18,England,2008,00
10719008,Optimizing economic outcomes in antibiotic therapy of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.,"The social, medical and economic effects of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis on individual patients and the resource implications of this disease for the healthcare sector are considerable. Optimizing the selection of patients who should receive antibiotics according to stringent clinical criteria is the first step in promoting good clinical practice and cost-effectiveness. Antibiotic efficacy is then the major driver of cost, especially when it reduces the need for hospitalization. Resistance to first-line antibiotics can be expected to increase the risk of treatment failure. Other drivers of cost include non-compliance, which predisposes to therapeutic failure, and the selection of resistant strains. Treatment regimens of short duration, once-daily dosing and good tolerability are determinants of good compliance and cost savings. The expenses of first-line antibiotics typically account for only a small proportion of the overall costs of healthcare and the cheapest antibiotics are not necessarily the most cost-effective. The clinical success rate of first-line therapy is the primary determinant of the overall expenditure on healthcare because of the high costs associated with treatment failure, especially if it leads to hospitalization. Factors such as poor patient compliance and high antibiotic resistance rates, which undermine the clinical efficacies of first-line therapy, will increase the overall costs of treatment.",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,2000 Mar,England,2000,00
16643346,Psychiatric nurses' ethical stance on cigarette smoking by patients: determinants and dilemmas in their role in supporting cessation.,"It has been argued that psychiatric nurses are ideally placed to provide smoking cessation interventions to patients with mental illness. This assumes that psychiatric nurses actively support smoking cessation. The current paper articulates some of the reasons why this has not occurred, in particular, some of the ethical beliefs held by nurses that may prevent such activity. Such an assumption also discounts the evidence that confirms psychiatric nurses to have among the highest smoking rates in nursing and in the health professions in general. The role and impact of the institution are also considered. In-depth interviews with seven community and inpatient psychiatric nurses were thematically analysed. Extensive individual and group discussions were also held with inpatient nurses from open and locked psychiatric settings during participant observation of the settings. The findings suggest that psychiatric nurses can be more effective in the primary care role of supporting patients' smoking cessation if they receive adequate institutional support to do so.",International journal of mental health nursing,2006 Jun,Australia,2006,00
12612097,Community participation in a multisectoral intervention to address health determinants in an inner-city community in central Havana.,"It is increasingly acknowledged that the process of community involvement is critical to the successful implementation of community-based health interventions. Between 1995 and 1999, a multisectoral intervention called Plan Cayo Hueso was launched in the inner-city community of Cayo Hueso in Havana, Cuba, to address a variety of health determinants. To provide a better understanding of the political structures and processes involved, the Cuban context is described briefly. The interventions included improvements in housing, municipal infrastructure, and social and cultural activities. A qualitative study, consisting of interviews of key informants as well as community members, was conducted to evaluate the community participatory process. Questions from an extensive household survey pre- and postintervention that had been conducted in Cayo Hueso and a comparison community to assess the effectiveness of the intervention also informed the analysis of community participation, as did three community workshops held to choose indicators for evaluating effectiveness and to discuss findings. It was found that formal leaders led the interventions, providing the institutional driving force behind the plan. However, extensive community involvement occurred as the project took advantage of the existing community-based organizations, which played an active role in mobilizing community members and enhanced linkage systems critical to the project's success. Women played fairly traditional roles in interventions outside their households, but had equivalent roles to men in interventions within their household units. Most impressive about this project was the extent of mobilization to participate and the multidimensional ecosystem approach adopted. Indeed, Plan Cayo Hueso involved a massive mobilization of international, national, and community resources to address the needs of this community. This, as well as the involvement of community residents in the evaluation process, was seen as resulting in improved social interactions and community well-being and enhanced capacity for future action. While Cuba is unique in many respects, the lessons learned about enhancing community participation in urban health intervention projects, as well as in their evaluation, are applicable worldwide.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2003 Mar,United States,2003,00

The aim of this study was to analyze the associations between some personal, social, and environmental determinants, practice of physical activity and future intention to practice in a sample of 639 university students (321 men and 318 women), mean age 21.43 years (+/- 2.78). Physical fitness self-perception, physical activity history, and coach's support to practice physical activity have a direct effect on the practice of physical activity and an indirect effect on future intention to practice, both in men and women. The practice of physical activity has also a direct effect on future intention to practice. Likewise, the participation in sport competitions predicts practice of physical activity and future intention in men, whereas being a member of a sports club predicts practice and future intention in women.",The Spanish journal of psychology,2009 May,England,2009,00
17288665,"Gender power imbalance and differential psychosocial correlates of intended condom use among male and female adolescents from Venda, South Africa.","OBJECTIVES: In South Africa, a gender power imbalance exists which may prevent women from negotiating safe sexual encounters. In this study we tested which constructs from Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) under these circumstances were most related to condom use intention. We hypothesized that in a situation of gender power imbalance self-efficacy would be a more salient correlate of intended condom use for females, while for males attitude to condoms and subjective norm would be more important. DESIGN: This study employed a cross-sectional questionnaire design. METHOD: Male participants (N=94) and female participants (N=101) from Venda, South Africa completed standard, multi-item, reliable measures of TPB constructs (condom-related attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, intention) and PMT constructs (vulnerability, severity, fear, response-efficacy, self-efficacy) and reported their past condom use behaviour. RESULTS: Regression analysis indicated that among males attitude to condoms and subjective norm were significantly related to intended condom use. Among females attitude and self-efficacy were significantly related to intended condom use. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that in a situation of gender power imbalance psychosocial correlates of intended condom use differ for males and females.

11767810,"Self-efficacy, psychosocial factors, and exercise behavior in traditional versus modified cardiac rehabilitation.","BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy and social support are established determinants of exercise adherence and have potential usefulness for tailoring independent exercise regimens for cardiac patients. Highly supervised traditional cardiac rehabilitation programs may be a barrier for independent exercise self-efficacy in low - and moderate-risk patients. PURPOSE: The authors evaluated changes in psychosocial measures including self-efficacy and social support in 80 cardiac patients with low to moderate risk randomized to a traditional cardiac rehabilitation protocol (TP) or modified protocol (MP). These measures also were assessed for their potential to predict subsequent exercise behavior. METHODS: The TP (n = 38) emphasized a supervised exercise regimen and included continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for 3 months. The lower cost MP (n = 42) emphasized independent exercise and included group education/support meetings, and gradually weaned patients from continuous ECG monitoring and direct medical supervision. RESULTS: Repeated measures analyses of variance indicated that MP patients had higher levels of self-efficacy for independent exercise without continuous ECG monitoring (P < .05). No other protocol differences were found. Multiple regression analyses using the pooled sample (excluding dropouts) indicated that self-efficacy for independent exercise was the only significant predictor of exercise over 6 months (R2=.28 [adjusted R2= .221 P < .01). In contrast to previous reports, social support for exercise was not a significant predictor of exercise behavior. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest cardiac rehabilitation programs for low- and moderate-risk patients should emphasize educational and patient monitoring methods that promote patient self-efficacy for independent exercise. Programs that emphasize highly supervised exercise including longer term use of continuous ECG monitoring may impair self-efficacy for independent exercise. Longer-term studies are needed to fully determine the value of using psychosocial measures for designing individualized exercise programs and predicting long-term exercise behavior in cardiac patients.",Journal of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation,2001 Nov-Dec,United States,2001,00
11128887,Domains and determinants of quality of life after stroke caused by brain infarction.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the domain-specific quality of life (QOL), including physical, social and role functioning, mental health, vitality, bodily pain, and general health domains, and to assess QOL's clinical and sociodemographic correlates in patients who were disabled by ischemic stroke. DESIGN: One-year prospective study of an inception cohort of patients with first-ever brain infarction. SETTING: Stroke unit of a neurologic department of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Eighty-five consecutive patients (36 women, 49 men; mean age +/- SD, 65+/-12.5 yr) with first-ever stroke of a mild to moderate nature caused by brain infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were examined at 3 and 12 months poststroke. QOL was measured using the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. The variables studied were lateralization of cerebral lesion, neurologic and functional status, depression, age, gender, marital status, and living conditions. Depression was evaluated according to the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition. Neurologic impairment was assessed by Scandinavian Stroke Scale, performance in activities of daily living by the Barthel index, and the intellectual deterioration by the Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: QOL was poorer for the patients with mild to moderate stroke impairments at 3 months poststroke. The test domains most prone to being affected were physical functioning, physical role limitations, vitality, and general health. Only the domains of physical functioning and physical role limitations improved during the follow-up at 1 year. Depression, although mostly minor, was the most important reason for impaired QOL. Depression, being married, and age emerged as significant independent contributors to the low score value of vitality. Depression and being married were related to the low score value of physical role limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke affects QOL, impairing its physical and psychosocial domains. The most important determinants of low QOL seem to be depression and being married. These findings provide new challenges for stroke rehabilitation, calling for identification of patients and spouses in need of supportive services.",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2000 Dec,United States,2000,00
15766999,Pathogenesis and management of pain in osteoarthritis.,"The term osteoarthritis describes a common, age-related, heterogeneous group of disorders characterised pathologically by focal areas of loss of articular cartilage in synovial joints, associated with varying degrees of osteophyte formation, subchondral bone change, and synovitis. Joint damage is caused by a mixture of systemic factors that predispose to the disease, and local mechanical factors that dictate its distribution and severity. Various genetic abnormalities have been described, but most sporadic osteoarthritis probably depends on minor contributions from several genetic loci. Osteoarthritic joint damage may be associated with clinical problems, but the severity of joint disease is only weakly related to that of the clinical problem. For this reason the associations and pathogenesis of pain are in as much need of investigation as joint damage. Subchondral bone and synovium may be responsible for nociceptive stimuli, and peripheral neuronal sensitisation is an important feature, and can result in normal activities (such as walking) causing pain. Central pain sensitisation can also occur, and psychosocial factors are important determinants of pain severity. We present a stepwise approach to the management of osteoarthritis.","Lancet (London, England)",2005 Mar 12-18,England,2005,00
15331814,"Conquering the intolerable burden of malaria: what's new, what's needed: a summary.","Each year, up to three million deaths due to malaria and close to five billion episodes of clinical illness possibly meriting antimalarial therapy occur throughout the world, with Africa having more than 90% of this burden. Almost 3% of disability adjusted life years are due to malaria mortality globally, 10% in Africa. New information is presented in this supplement on malaria-related perinatal mortality, occurrence of human immunodeficiency virus in pregnancy, undernutrition, and neurologic, cognitive, and developmental sequelae. The entomologic determinants of transmission and uses of modeling for program planning and disease prediction and prevention are discussed. New data are presented from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe on the increasing urban malaria problem and on epidemic malaria. Between 6% and 28% of the malaria burden may occur in cities, which comprise less than 2% of the African surface. Macroeconomic projections show that the costs are far greater than the costs of individual cases, with a substantial deleterious impact of malaria on schooling of patients, external investments into endemic countries, and tourism. Poor populations are at greatest risk; 58% of the cases occur in the poorest 20% of the world's population and these patients receive the worst care and have catastrophic economic consequences from their illness. This social vulnerability requires better understanding for improving deployment, access, quality, and use of effective interventions. Studies from Ghana and elsewhere indicate that for every patient with febrile illness assumed to be malaria seen in health facilities, 4-5 episodes occur in the community. Effective actions for malaria control mandate rational public policies; market forces, which often drive sales and use of drugs and other interventions, are unlikely to guarantee their use. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria is rapidly gaining acceptance as an effective approach for countering the spread and intensity of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, and other antimalarial drugs. Although costly, ACT ($1.20-2.50 per adult treatment) becomes more cost-effective as resistance to alternative drugs increases; early use of ACT may delay development of resistance to these drugs and prevent the medical toll associated with use of ineffective drugs. The burden of malaria in one district in Tanzania has not decreased since the primary health care approach replaced the vertical malaria control efforts of the 1960s. Despite decentralization, this situation resulted, in part, from weak district management capacity, poor coordination, inadequate monitoring, and lack of training of key staff. Experience in the Solomon Islands showed that spraying with DDT, use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), and health education were all associated with disease reduction. The use of nets permitted a reduction in DDT spraying, but could not replace it without an increased malaria incidence. Baseline data and reliable monitoring of key outcome indicators are needed to measure whether the ambitious goals for the control of malaria and other diseases has occurred. Such systems are being used for evidence-based decision making in Tanzania and several other countries. Baseline cluster sampling surveys in several countries across Africa indicate that only 53% of the children with febrile illness in malarious areas are being treated; chloroquine (CQ) is used 84% of the time, even where the drug may be ineffective. Insecticide-treated bed nets were used only 2% of the time by children less than five years of age. Progress in malaria vaccine research has been substantial over the past five years; 35 candidate malaria vaccines are in development, many of which are in clinical trials. Development of new vaccines and drugs has been the result of increased investments and formation of public-private partnerships. Before malaria vaccine becomes deployed, consideration must be given to disease burden, cost-effectiveness, financing, delivery systems, and approval by regulatory agencies. Key to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness will be collection and prompt analysis of epidemiologic information. Training of persons in every aspect of malaria research and control is essential for programs to succeed. The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) is actively promoting research capacity strengthening and has established networks of institutions and scientists throughout the African continent, most of whom are now linked by modern information-sharing networks. Evidence over the past century is that successful control malaria programs have been linked to strong research activities. To ensure effective coordination and cooperation between the growing number of research and control coalitions forming in support of malaria activities, an umbrella group is needed. With continued support for scientists and control workers globally, particularly in low-income malarious countries, the long-deferred dream of malaria elimination can become a reality.",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2004 Aug,United States,2004,00
15627401,The Latin American Social Medicine database.,"BACKGROUND: Public health practitioners and researchers for many years have been attempting to understand more clearly the links between social conditions and the health of populations. Until recently, most public health professionals in English-speaking countries were unaware that their colleagues in Latin America had developed an entire field of inquiry and practice devoted to making these links more clearly understood. The Latin American Social Medicine (LASM) database finally bridges this previous gap. DESCRIPTION: This public health informatics case study describes the key features of a unique information resource intended to improve access to LASM literature and to augment understanding about the social determinants of health. This case study includes both quantitative and qualitative evaluation data. Currently the LASM database at The University of New Mexico http://hsc.unm.edu/lasm brings important information, originally known mostly within professional networks located in Latin American countries to public health professionals worldwide via the Internet. The LASM database uses Spanish, Portuguese, and English language trilingual, structured abstracts to summarize classic and contemporary works. CONCLUSION: This database provides helpful information for public health professionals on the social determinants of health and expands access to LASM.",BMC public health,2004 Dec 31,England,2004,00
15005732,Determinants of endotoxin levels in living environments of farmers' children and their peers from rural areas.,"BACKGROUND: Lower frequencies of asthma and hayfever have been observed in children with contact to livestock. At school age, the amount of endotoxin measured in the dust of children's mattresses is inversely related to the occurrence of atopic asthma, hayfever and atopic sensitization both in children from farming and non-farming households. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate which home and lifestyle characteristics of farm and non-farm families contribute to endotoxin levels measured in different indoor home environments. METHODS: In the framework of the Allergy and Endotoxin (ALEX) Study, endotoxin was measured in dust samples from the living room floor and the child's mattress of 319 farmers' families and 493 non-farming families, and in settled dust from stables. Endotoxin content of all dust samples was determined by a kinetic Limulus assay (Limulus-Amebocyte-Lysate test). Information about the child's activities on farms, home characteristics and cleaning behaviours was obtained from parental questionnaires. RESULTS: Endotoxin levels in stables did not predict the amount of endotoxin measured in floors or mattresses. However, a dose-dependent association between the child's activity on the farm and indoor home endotoxin levels was observed, both in farm and non-farm children. In non-farm children pet keeping and the frequency of floor cleaning were additionally associated with endotoxin levels, whereas in farm children parental farm activities, study area, time since last cleaning, the mattress type as well as younger age of the children contributed to increased microbial exposure. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that regular contact to farm animals increases indoor home endotoxin concentrations, both in farm and non-farm children, and might thus explain the protective effect of contact to livestock on atopic outcomes. To assess children's individual exposure to a microbial environment, measures of mattress dust exposure are needed as stable endotoxin concentrations were not associated with indoor home levels.",Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2004 Mar,England,2004,00
19133319,Mating dominance amongst male Himalayan tahr: blonds do better.,"In ungulates, rank order is determined by differences in weight, body size, weapon size and age. In the Caprini tribe (Bovidae: Caprinae), adult male Himalayan tahr are unique to show different coat colours, but no sexual dimorphism in weapons. A highly significant correlation between hair colour and rank order was found during the rut: males with a lighter coloured ruff dominated over darker ruffed ones, in both aggressive interactions and access to oestrus females. We studied colour-based dominance in relation to weight, age and testosterone levels, which establish the social rank in most ungulates. No differences in weight and testosterone concentrations were found between adult male colour classes, but males with paler ruffs were significantly younger than darker adult males. The distribution of physical traumas from fights confirmed that younger, lighter-coloured males had a higher rank than older, darker males, a pattern which is unusual amongst ungulates. Coat colour seems to work as a signal of rank in male-male aggressive interactions and it changes according to age, whereas the relevant physiological determinants deserve further research. Intrasexual male competition has not changed weapon size or shape in the Himalayan tahr, but ruff colours are apparently used to signal rank and dominance. Colour patterns of adult males may then be homologous to ritualised weapons, apparently being a unique feature of male tahr amongst mammals.",Behavioural processes,2009 May,Netherlands,2009,00
11879721,Determinants of ambulatory care in a defined adult Swedish diabetic population.,"AIMS: To investigate factors associated with health care utilisation in ambulatory diabetes care in relation to complications attributable to diabetes mellitus in an adult diabetic population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study; standardised interview, physical examination, and an evaluation of medical records, comprising all known diabetic subjects living in six primary health care districts in southern Sweden (N = 1861, aged > 25 years; 90.1% participation). RESULTS: People managed by specialists (17.2%) had more complications related to diabetes and were more often treated with insulin. Persons managed in health care centres with a diabetes nurse specialist used insulin more often, used self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) more regularly, lived on their own, and used meals on wheels and Community Care Alarm Service more frequently than those managed in other health centres. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed high utilisation of office visits to physicians ( > 5 visits) to be mainly associated with the presence of a foot ulcer (OR (95% CI) 2.1 (1.4-3.3)), congestive heart failure (1.6 (1.1-2.3)), and cardio-cerebrovascular disease (1.4 (1.1-1.9)). High utilisation of visits to other care-givers ( > 4 visits) was related to current or previous foot ulcers (2.4 (1.5-3.7) and 2.1 (1.2-3.5)), meals on wheels (1.9 (1.2-3.0)), and treatment with insulin (1.6 (1.2-2.1)). CONCLUSIONS: High utilisation of ambulatory diabetes care was mainly associated with health status and complications related to diabetes, particularly diabetic foot ulcers. Organisational factors such as managed care with access to a diabetes nurse specialist in a health care centre was related to increased use of self-monitoring of blood glucose and insulin treatment. Visits to other care-givers were associated with access to social welfare. In diabetes care, activities to promote health and prevent complications need to be stressed.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2002 Apr,Ireland,2002,00
11265579,Promoting health: intervention strategies from social and behavioral research.,"This report, released by the Division of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention within the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences, asserts that behavioral and social interventions such as health promotion and disease prevention offer great promise to reduce disease morbidity and mortality in the United States, but as yet their potential has not been recognized or tapped by the federal government. Two overarching recommendations are the need to address generic social and behavioral determinants of health rather than the clinical causes of disease and death, and the need to intervene at multiple levels of influence including the individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and policy levels. Seven recommendations for intervention strategies, nine recommendations for research, and three recommendations for funding are offered.",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,2001 Jan-Feb,United States,2001,00
17672224,"The implications of public policy related to parks, recreation, and public health: a focus on physical activity.","A collaborative framework that influences the promotion of policy related to physical activity should include parks and recreation as well as public health practitioners and researchers. As governments at all levels become increasingly focused on the impact of public resources, park and recreation agencies are challenged to document and demonstrate the impact of leisure services. Public policy associated with parks and recreation is driven by public interest and is often debated in the absence of relevant research to demonstrate the determinants and correlates of parks and recreation to address prevailing social conditions. This paper describes current policy and funding issues faced by public parks and recreation professionals responding to increasing physically active leisure across the lifespan of Americans. We also discuss how a collaborative framework approach can be used to inform public policy designed to increase the physical activity of the American public.",Journal of physical activity & health,2007,United States,2007,00

In this paper the determinants of infant and child mortality are discussed, with particular emphasis on the role of consanguineous marriages, short birth spacing and maternal education. It is shown that short birth spacings and type of marriage are more important determinants of infant mortality than maternal education. Moreover, the relative role of consanguineous marriages appears to increase with time.",Journal of biosocial science,2000 Oct,England,2000,00
19090609,Prevalence of chronic diseases according to socioeconomic status measured by wealth index: health survey in Serbia.,"AIM: To examine socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of chronic diseases in Serbia, using the data from 2006 national health survey. METHOD: A stratified sample of 7673 households was selected and 14522 household members older than 20 years were interviewed (response rate 80.5%). Wealth index was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. Standardized morbidity prevalence ratios were computed using the poorest category as reference. Odds ratios for the prevalence of the selected chronic diseases and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated by multivariate logistic analysis adjusted for age, education, smoking status, and body mass index. RESULTS: Hypertension was the most prevalent disease in all socioeconomic categories; standardized morbidity prevalence ratios were higher in richer men (151.3 in the richest) and lower in richer women (86.1 in the richest). Rheumatism/arthritis was the second most prevalent disease in both sexes, with the highest prevalence in the poorest group; the pattern remained the same after standardization (standardized morbidity prevalence ratio in the richest: 86.4 in men and 74.0 in women). The prevalence of hyperlipidemia was associated with wealth index in both men and women and was highest in the richest group; the pattern remained the same after standardization (standardized morbidity prevalence ratio in the richest: 275.9 in men and 138.4 in women). Logistic regression models showed that higher wealth index was associated with higher prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and allergy, while lower wealth index was associated with higher prevalence of rheumatism/arthritis. CONCLUSION: There were considerable socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of chronic diseases in Serbia. These results indicate an opportunity to reduce inequalities and show a need for further investigation on the determinants of chronic diseases.",Croatian medical journal,2008 Dec,Croatia,2008,00
15133693,Unexplained antepartum fetal deaths: what are the determinants?,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess fetal, antenatal, and pregnancy determinants of unexplained antepartum fetal death. METHODS: This is a hospital-based cohort study of 34,394 births weighing 500 g or more from January 1995 to December 2002. Unexplained fetal deaths were defined as fetal deaths occurring before labor, without evidence of significant fetal, maternal or placental pathology. RESULTS: Ninety-eight unexplained antepartum fetal deaths accounted for 27.2% of 360 total fetal deaths. Two-thirds of these deaths occurred after 36 weeks' gestation. The following factors are independently associated with unexplained fetal deaths: primiparity (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.21, 2.86); parity of five or more (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.26, 3.26); low socioeconomic status (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.14, 2.86); maternal age 40 years or more (OR 3.62; 95% CI 1.22, 4.52); maternal age of 18 years or less (OR 1.79; 95% CI 0.82, 2.89); maternal prepregnancy weight greater than 70 kg (OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.85, 3.68); fewer than three antenatal visits in women whose fetuses died at 31 weeks or more (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.08, 2.48); birth weight ratio (defined as ratio of birth weight to mean birth weight for gestational age) between 0.85 and 0.94 (OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.28, 4.18) or over 1.45 (OR 2.92; 95% CI 1.75, 3.21); trimester of first antenatal visit. Previous fetal death, previous abortion, cigarette smoking, fetal sex, low maternal weight, fetal-to-placenta weight, and post date pregnancy were not significantly associated with unexplained fetal deaths. CONCLUSION: Several factors were identified that are associated with an increased risk of unexplained fetal deaths.",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,2005 Apr,Germany,2005,00
17159594,Factors correlated with disclosure of HIV infection in the French Antilles and French Guiana: results from the ANRS-EN13-VESPA-DFA Study.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate, patterns and predictors of HIV disclosure in the French Antilles and French Guiana. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among a 15% random sample (n=398) of the hospital caseload in hospitals providing HIV care. Determinants of disclosure to a steady partner and other members of the individual's social network were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: From the time of diagnosis, 84.6% of those in a couple (n=173) disclosed their HIV-positive status to their steady partner, 55.6% disclosed to others, and 30.3% did not tell their status to anyone. Disclosure within a steady partnership was less likely among non-French individuals [Haitians: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.72; other nationalities: AOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.68]; and among those diagnosed with HIV after 1997 (AOR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.86). Determinants of disclosure to others were found to be sex (women: AOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.24-3.36), age at diagnosis (>or=50 versus<30 years: AOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.90), nationality (Haitians versus French: AOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.77), transmission route (non-sexual versus sexual: AOR 3.38, 95% CI 1.12-10.23) and hospital inpatients (hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients: AOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.17-3.37). After disclosing, social and emotional support from confidants was common and discrimination was infrequent. CONCLUSION: One third of PLWHA had kept their HIV status secret. Interventions targeting the general population and social institutions, and support for PLWHA by healthcare staff are needed to improve the situation.","AIDS (London, England)",2007 Jan,England,2007,00

Many of the identified barriers to health related to government policies and actions. Cutbacks in federal transfers to provinces and provincial cutbacks in funding for agencies, reductions in social assistance, ending of new social housing, and other policy changes were seen as negatively impacting the health of the community and its members. These perceptions were remarkably consistent with emerging findings concerning the determinants of health.

19204797,Multidimensional profiles of health status: an application of the grade of membership model to the world health survey.,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) conducted the World Health Survey (WHS) between 2002 and 2004 in 70 countries to provide cross-population comparable data on health, health-related outcomes and risk factors. The aim of this study was to apply Grade of Membership (GoM) modelling as a means to condense extensive health information from the WHS into a set of easily understandable health profiles and to assign the degree to which an individual belongs to each profile. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This paper described the application of the GoM models to summarize population health status using World Health Survey data. Grade of Membership analysis is a flexible, non-parametric, multivariate method, used to calculate health profiles from WHS self-reported health state and health conditions. The WHS dataset was divided into four country economic categories based on the World Bank economic groupings (high, upper-middle, lower-middle and low income economies) for separate GoM analysis. Three main health profiles were produced for each of the four areas: I. Robust; II. Intermediate; III. Frail; moreover population health, wealth and inequalities are defined for countries in each economic area as a means to put the health results into perspective. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses have provided a robust method to better understand health profiles and the components which can help to identify healthy and non-healthy individuals. The obtained profiles have described concrete levels of health and have clearly delineated characteristics of healthy and non-healthy respondents. The GoM results provided both a useable way of summarising complex individual health information and a selection of intermediate determinants which can be targeted for interventions to improve health. As populations' age, and with limited budgets for additional costs for health care and social services, applying the GoM methods may assist with identifying higher risk profiles for decision-making and resource allocations.",PloS one,2009,United States,2009,00

11061638,Multiple levels of analysis and intervention in HIV prevention science: exemplars and directions for new research.,"The need to continue the scientific development of evidence-based HIV-1 prevention strategies is clear. The epidemic continues to rage out of control, and a vaccine against HIV-1 is nowhere in sight. We think that it is important to consider the influence of multiple social units on HIV risk behavior. In this article, we use ecological theory to outline multiple levels of analysis at which preventive interventions can be conceptualized. These levels include the individual, dyadic/small group, organizational, community, and societal/cultural. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of locating HIV risk at each level, and provide exemplars of HIV prevention for each in an effort to encourage HIV prevention scientists to consider the level at which they are locating the determinants of HIV risk behavior when conducting research. We conclude by stating that scientists and research funding has favored the individual level of analysis, but that to be most successful, the field of HIV prevention science should address risk behavior at all levels of analysis.","AIDS (London, England)",2000 Sep,England,2000,00

Subjects were 593 older peoples aged 60-74 residing in a suburb of Tokyo, Japan. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between relevant characteristics and volunteer participation. Among females, those who had lived in the community longer, residing in a single household, actively participating in hobbies or continuing education, not working and reporting better self-rated health were more likely to participate in volunteer activities. By contrast, there were no specific correlations among males. 51.0% of the non-participants reported that they would like to participate in volunteer work in the future. The most frequently given reason for non-participation was ""Don't have time to participate"". Additional concerns were related to accessibility such as ""Don't know where I should go to participate"". For promoting volunteer activities among older Japanese, diverse volunteer activities should be offered with consideration to differences in lifestyle by gender and also by available flexible time. A plan for improving the accessibility to volunteer work is also needed.",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2008 Sep-Oct,Netherlands,2008,00
14578917,Changes in body weight and onset of hypertension in perimenopausal women.,"We assessed the determinants of onset of hypertension in a large, prospective population-based study of perimenopausal women from the Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention (OSTPRE) study. The data collection started in 1989, when a baseline postal inquiry was sent to all women aged 47-56 years (n=14 220) residing in the Kuopio Province in Eastern Finland. Names, social security numbers and addresses were obtained from the Population Register Centre of Finland. A total of 11 798 women responded at baseline and at 5-year follow-up in 1994. After the exclusion of 1777 women with prevalent hypertension at baseline and women with missing height or weight information, the study population consisted of 9485 without established hypertension at baseline. New cases of established hypertension during the follow-up (n=908) were ascertained with the Registry of Specially Refunded Drugs of the Finnish Social Insurance Institution (SII). According to the National Health Insurance, the SII granted 90% reimbursement for drug costs in defined chronic illnesses necessitating continuous medication, like arterial hypertension. Weight and weight gain both raised the risk by 5% per kg (P<0.001). Weight gain of 4-6 kg increased the risk of hypertension 1.25 times and a gain of more than 7 kg 1.65 times compared with the control (zero) group. To conclude, the onset of hypertension in peri- and early postmenopausal women was related to an increase in body weight despite controlling for initial body weight, reported physical activity and use of HRT. Therefore, preventing weight gain by dietary means and exercise is of great importance at menopausal age.",Journal of human hypertension,2003 Nov,England,2003,00

16837653,Genome-wide scan for quantitative trait loci influencing spatial navigation and social recognition memory in Dahl rats.,"The genetic determinants of learning and memory have been difficult to unravel because of the complex inheritance of these forms of cognitive behavior encompassing multiple genetic and environmental factors. Indeed, genes that can account for strain and individual variations in learning and memory are largely unknown. Here we report a genome-wide scan for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting spatial learning and memory and social recognition memory in an F2 population derived from Dahl rats. We detected five QTLs on chromosomes 1, 8, 11, 17, and 20 affecting spatial acquisition performance and five QTLs on chromosomes 2, 3, 9, and 20 influencing spatial accuracy (once information about the target location had been acquired). None of these QTLs overlap, indicating the existence of independent genetic determinants for these two distinct behavioral components of spatial navigation. Moreover, five QTLs affecting social recognition memory were detected, two on chromosome 9 and three on chromosome X. The chromosomal regions linked to social recognition memory performance in the rat are syntenic to regions that have been linked to autism in humans. Thus our results could have paradigmatic value in guiding the experimental investigation of similar pathways in genetic susceptibility to this disorder, which results in profound impairments in social behavior.",Physiological genomics,2006 Jul 12,United States,2006,00

18684850,Comparison of tuberculosis surveillance systems in low-incidence industrialised countries.,"The comparative analysis of National Tuberculosis Control Programmes (NTPs) in industrialised, low-tuberculosis-incidence countries is limited. Analysis of applied methods, function and accumulated experience contributes to improving global tuberculosis control. A questionnaire addressing NTP surveillance infrastructure and characteristics was completed in 19 industrialised countries, with populations of >3 million and annual notified tuberculosis incidence rates of <16 cases per 100,000 population (2003 data). All European countries surveyed adopted World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for the Surveillance of Tuberculosis in Europe (EuroTB) definitions. Surveillance information, which usually includes names, was transferred electronically to the national level in 17 out of the 19 countries. Surveillance systems capture process and social determinants. Case notification to the central level occurred within a median period of 7 days, independent of mandatory notification requirements. The mean completeness of tuberculosis case-reporting was estimated to be 93.5% (range 65-100%). Integration between HIV and tuberculosis registries was performed in two countries, and, in seven others, both databases were cross-matched periodically. National Tuberculosis Control Programme function in industrialised low-incidence countries utilises well-established infrastructure and relies upon centralised operations. Approaches are consistent with current World Health Organization surveillance recommendations. The present study lays collaborative groundwork for additional multinational analyses for the enhancement of global tuberculosis surveillance, which may assist policy-makers in countries moving from medium to low rates of incidence.",The European respiratory journal,2008 Dec,England,2008,00
18241330,Socioeconomic status (SES) as a determinant of adherence to treatment in HIV infected patients: a systematic review of the literature.,"OBJECTIVES: It has been shown that socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with adherence to treatment of patients with several chronic diseases. However, there is a controversy regarding the impact of SES on adherence among patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Thus, we sought to perform a systematic review of the evidence regarding the association of SES with adherence to treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS. METHODS: We searched the PubMed database to identify studies concerning SES and HIV/AIDS and collected data regarding the association between various determinants of SES (income, education, occupation) and adherence. FINDINGS: We initially identified 116 potentially relevant articles and reviewed in detail 17 original studies, which contained data that were helpful in evaluating the association between SES and adherence to treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS. No original research study has specifically focused on the possible association between SES and adherence to treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS. Among the reviewed studies that examined the impact of income and education on adherence to antiretroviral treatment, only half and less than a third, respectively, found a statistically significant association between these main determinants of SES and adherence of patients infected with HIV/AIDS. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review of the available evidence does not provide conclusive support for existence of a clear association between SES and adherence among patients infected with HIV/AIDS. There seemed to be a positive trend among components of SES (income, education, occupation) and adherence to antiretroviral treatment in many of the reviewed studies, however most of the studies did not establish a statistically significant association between determinants of SES and adherence.",Retrovirology,2008 Feb 1,England,2008,00

11999484,Gender equity and socioeconomic inequality: a framework for the patterning of women's health.,"This paper explores the interrelationship of gender equity and socioeconomic inequality and how they affect women's health at the macro- (country) and micro- (household and individual) levels. An integrated framework draws theoretical perspectives from both approaches and from public health. Determinants of women's health in the geopolitical environment include country-specific history and geography, policies and services, legal rights, organizations and institutions, and structures that shape gender and economic inequality. Culture, norms and sanctions at the country and community level, and sociodemographic characteristics at the individual level, influence women's productive and reproductive roles in the household and workplace. Social capital, roles, psychosocial stresses and resources. health services, and behaviors mediate social, economic and cultural effects on health outcomes. Inequality between and within households contributes to the patterning of women's health. Within the framework, relationships may vary depending upon women's lifestage and cohort experience. Examples of other relevant theoretical frameworks are discussed.

The aim of this article is to follow the cooperative community-based process of developing and testing a workbook to be used to assess and foster rural communities' health, quality of life and ultimately their sustainability. ISSUE: In a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada funded, 3 phase project, entitled Determinants of Health of Rural Populations and Communities, researchers at Brandon University, University of Manitoba and Concordia University, Canada, partnered various stakeholder groups in an visionary effort to build a framework and indicators for the purpose of assisting rural communities to assess not only their health and wellbeing, but also their sustainability. CONCLUSION: In this on-going project, it is anticipated that the findings related to the health, wellbeing, quality of life and sustainability of rural communities will be integral to policy development by local, provincial and federal organizations and governments well into this century. Moreover it is expected that diverse community-based organizations will be able to use the findings to take action, particularly in an intersectoral manner, the outcome of which will be an improvement of the rural resident and community health.",Rural and remote health,2004 Apr-Jun,Australia,2004,00
15522793,"Molecular phylogeny of the speciose vole genus Microtus (Arvicolinae, Rodentia) inferred from mitochondrial DNA sequences.","Voles of the genus Microtus represent one of the most speciose mammalian genera in the Holarctic. We established a molecular phylogeny for Microtus to resolve contentious issues of systematic relationships and evolutionary history in this genus. A total of 81 specimens representing ten Microtus species endemic to Europe as well as eight Eurasian, six Asian and one Holarctic species were sequenced for the entire cytochrome b gene (1140 bp). A further 25 sequences were retrieved from GenBank, providing data on an additional 23, mainly Nearctic, Microtus species. Phylogenetic analysis of these 48 species generated four well-supported monophyletic lineages. The genus Chionomys, snow voles, formed a distinct and well-supported lineage separate from the genus Microtus. The subgenus Microtus formed the strongest supported lineage with two sublineages displaying a close relationship between the arvalis species group (common voles) and the socialis species group (social voles). Monophyly of the Palearctic pitymyid voles, subgenus Terricola, was supported, and this subgenus was also subdivided into two monophyletic species groups. Together, these groupings clarify long-standing taxonomic uncertainties in Microtus. In addition, the ""Asian"" and the Nearctic lineages reported previously were identified although the latter group was not supported. However, relationships among the main Microtus branches were not resolved, suggesting a rapid and potentially simultaneous radiation of a widespread ancestor early in the history of the genus. This and subsequent radiations discernible in the cytochrome b phylogeny, show the considerable potential of Microtus for analysis of historical and ecological determinants of speciation in small mammals. It is evident that speciation is an ongoing process in the genus and that the molecular data provides a vital insight into current species limits as well as cladogenic events of the past.",Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,2004 Dec,United States,2004,00
17434862,Is work in education child's play? Understanding risks to educators arising from work organization and design of work spaces.,"The educational sector exposes its primarily female work force to numerous psychosocial risk factors. At the request of the education workers', ergonomists developed a participatory research project in order to understand the determinants of the difficulties experienced by special education technicians. These technicians work with students presenting behavioral and learning difficulties as well as developmental and mental health problems. Eighteen technicians were interviewed and the work of seven technicians and two teachers was observed. Technicians prevent and manage crisis situations and help students acquire social skills. Coordination with teachers is made difficult by the fact that most technicians work part time, part year, and many technicians' work areas and classrooms are physically distant one from another. Most technicians change schools each year and must continually reconstruct work teams. Management strategies and poorly adapted working spaces can have important repercussions on coordination among educators and on technicians' capacity to help students and prevent aggressive behavior.",New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS,2007,United States,2007,00

CURRENT KNOWLEDGE: Many prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination approaches have been explored but no effective vaccine is presently available. In fact, as members of the Herpesviridae family, both HSV-1 and 2 types have genes involved in immune evasion.

20073151,"Genomic medicine and racial/ethnic health disparities: promises, perils, and the challenges for health care and public health policy.","Scientific and policy debates following new genetic discoveries have been intense and emotional when they have involved questions about the causes of, and solutions for, racial and ethnic health disparities in the United States. The difference in prevalence of diseases, allele frequency and genotype frequency among racial/ethnic groups are well known. The genomic profile for a given disease could have different genetic variants for different racial/ethnic groups. Do these results indicate that we have to consider different genetic tests and different genomic medicine for different racial/ethnic groups? If we do this, what is the impact on ethnic and class disparities in health care services in the United States? Current advances in genetic medicine are very promising; however, we must consider the possible impacts of these findings on health disparities, and how genetic medicine can be extended to everyone, not just those who can pay the often high price. If genomic medicine is to be a valid and reliable technology for all citizens regardless of wealth, race, ethnicity, or other determinants of social disadvantage, public health policymakers have to consider a number of policy issues and implications.",Ethnicity & disease,2009 Autumn,United States,2009,00
17374601,Clinical determinants of long-term quality of life after stroke.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine factors that independently predict health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 1 and 3 years after stroke. METHODS: Subjects numbering 397, from a population-based register of first-ever strokes were assessed for HRQOL using the Short Form 36 (SF36) 1 year after stroke. Physical (PHSS) and mental health (MHSS) summary scores were derived from the eight domains of HRQOL in the SF36. Multivariate stepwise regression analyses were conducted to determine independent predictors of these scores; beta coefficients with 95% CI were obtained.beta coefficient is the difference between average value of the variable (e.g. male) and average value under consideration (e.g. female). Demographic and stroke risk factors, neurological impairments and cognitive impairment (MMSE <24) were included in the models. Similar analyses were undertaken on 150 subjects 3 years post-stroke. RESULTS: A year after stroke, independent predictors of the worst PHSS were of females (beta coefficient -3.3: 95% CI -5.7 to -0.8), manual workers (-3.2: -5.9 to -0.4), diabetes (-4.2: -7.7 to -0.8), right hemispheric lesions (-4.9: -8.7 to -1.2), urinary incontinence (-7.8: -11.6 to -4.1) and cognitive impairment (-2.7: -5.5 to -0.1); the worst MHSS were associated with being Asian (-11.8: -20.6 to -3.0), ischaemic heart disease (-2.7: -5.4 to -0.03), cognitive impairment (-3.04: -5.8 to -0.3). Subjects aged 65-75 years (5.4: 2.5 to -8.4) had better MHSS than those <65 years. Three years post-stroke, independent predictors of worse PHSS were hypertension (-8.7: -13.5 to -3.9), urinary incontinence (-8.1: -15 to -1.1) and cognitive impairment (-8.3: -13.2 to -3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of HRQOL vary both over time after stroke and whether physical or psychosocial aspects of HRQOL are being considered. This study provides valuable information on factors predicting long-term HRQOL, which can be taken into consideration in audits of clinical practice or in future interventional studies aiming to improve HRQOL after stroke.",Age and ageing,2007 May,England,2007,00
16684384,"Nutritional status of Amerindian children from the Beni River (lowland Bolivia) as related to environmental, maternal and dietary factors.","OBJECTIVES: To report the nutritional status of children aged up to 15 years and their mothers living in a remote Amazonian area of Bolivia, and to study its main social, familial and maternal determinants. SETTING: Fifteen Beni River communities located at the foot of the Andes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of riverside populations. All childbearing mothers and their children in the 15 communities were examined. METHODS: Information on household production, dietary habits and demography was collected. Individual clinical, anthropometric and parasitological examinations were carried out. SUBJECTS: A total of 631 persons were examined: 171 mothers and 460 children and adolescents aged 0 to 15 years. RESULTS: There were no cases of severe wasting, but 41% of 0-5-year-olds and 36% of 5-10-year-olds were stunted. Among 346 stool specimens examined, 75% were positive for at least one helminth. Diversity of food and quality of diet were satisfactory in 54% of households, but 27% had low diversity scores. Mothers were lighter and shorter than those observed at the national level: 20% had height below 145 cm. Prevalence of anaemia (42%) was also higher. In pre-school children, multivariate analysis indicated a relationship between growth retardation and household factors such as dietary quality, ethnic group and clinical state, but not maternal anthropometry. In contrast, in school-age children and adolescents, growth retardation was related to maternal characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Growth retardation appeared mainly during the weaning period and did not seem to improve thereafter. To ameliorate this situation, an effort should be made to prevent common parasitic and infectious diseases in young children. Follow-up of pregnant mothers during pregnancy and delivery also needs to be reinforced.",Public health nutrition,2006 May,England,2006,00
17594757,Goal desires moderate intention-behaviour relations.,"Models such as the Extended Model of Goal-Directed Behaviour and the Theory of Planned Behaviour imply that the impact of one's goals on behaviour is mediated by more proximal determinants. We hypothesize that goals can have a broader and more dynamic impact on behaviour and, specifically, that goal desires can moderate the effect of intentions on behaviour. Four studies addressed this issue by examining the direct and moderated effects of goal desires on behaviour. All of the studies required participants to complete baseline measures and then a follow-up indicator of behaviour. In Study 1 (N=119) that focused on fruit intake, Study 2 (N=123) and Study 3 (N=96) concerned with drinking alcohol and Study 4 (N=109) regarding snack consumption, behavioural intentions were more reliably related to behaviour when goal desires were strong. The results of Study 3 suggested that goal desire stability increases the likelihood of this moderator effect emerging and Study 4 revealed that this effect was not suppressed by intention stability. The findings suggest that goals and behavioural intentions can operate simultaneously and jointly influence action, a view that contradicts predictions that the effects of goals are fully mediated by more proximal behavioural determinants.",The British journal of social psychology,2008 Mar,England,2008,00
19497127,A qualitative study on the acceptability and preference of three types of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets in Solomon Islands: implications for malaria elimination.,"BACKGROUND: In March 2008, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu governments raised the goal of their National Malaria Programmes from control to elimination. Vector control measures, such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal bed nets (LLINs) are key integral components of this programme. Compliance with these interventions is dependent on their acceptability and on the socio-cultural context of the local population. These factors need to be investigated locally prior to programme implementation. METHOD: Twelve focus group discussions (FGDs) were carried out in Malaita and Temotu Provinces, Solomon Islands in 2008. These discussions explored user perceptions of acceptability and preference for three brands of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) and identified a number of barriers to their proper and consistent use. RESULTS: Mosquito nuisance and perceived threat of malaria were the main determinants of bed net use. Knowledge of malaria and the means to prevent it were not sufficient to guarantee compliance with LLIN use. Factors such as climate, work and evening social activities impact on the use of bed nets, particularly in men. LLIN acceptability plays a varying role in compliance with their use in villages involved in this study. Participants in areas of reported high and year round mosquito nuisance and perceived threat of malaria reported LLIN use regardless of any reported unfavourable characteristics. Those in areas of low or seasonal mosquito nuisance were more likely to describe the unfavourable characteristics of LLINs as reasons for their intermittent or non-compliance. The main criterion for LLIN brand acceptability was effectiveness in preventing mosquito bites and malaria. Discussions highlighted considerable confusion around LLIN care and washing which may be impacting on their effectiveness and reducing their acceptability in Solomon Islands. CONCLUSION: Providing LLINs that are acceptable will be more important for improving compliance in areas of low or seasonal mosquito nuisance and malaria transmission. The implications of these findings on malaria elimination in Solomon Islands are discussed.",Malaria journal,2009 Jun 4,England,2009,00
10914507,Domestic fire injuries treated in New Zealand hospitals 1988-1995.,"AIM: To describe demographic features of people discharged from New Zealand hospitals following injury caused by fire and flame in domestic locations. METHOD: Review of hospital discharge data for the years 1988-1995. RESULTS: From 1988-1995 there were 1493 discharges from New Zealand hospitals with injury as the result of fire and flame in domestic locations. Age-standardised hospitalisation rates for fire related injury over the period have been stable, with an overall discharge rate of 5.45 hospitalisations per 100000 person years. Male discharges exceeded female in all years (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.73-2.14). Stratification by age indicated that discharge rates were highest among New Zealanders aged over 75 years and under fifteen years. Maori discharge rates exceeded non-Maori over all age groups (RR 3.3, 95% CI 2.82-3.58). CONCLUSION: Maori discharge rates for fire related injury in the home are substantially higher than non-Maori in all age groups, and highlight the importance of developing culturally appropriate injury prevention strategies. Social and material determinants of injury need to be addressed through public policy, provision of quality housing and community development initiatives.",The New Zealand medical journal,2000 Jun 23,New Zealand,2000,00
16314378,Do psychological characteristics explain socioeconomic stratification of self-rated health?,"This study evaluated whether negative emotions explain socioeconomic status (SES) stratification of self-rated health (SRH) and whether this putative relation is independent of established SRH determinants. Mood disorders, trait negative affect and health status indices were assessed in a representative cross-sectional survey of 3032 adults in the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS). Adjustment for health behaviors and health status appreciably reduced SES influence on SRH, but adjustment for negative emotions did not. However, both psychological resources (e.g. social support, extraversion) and negative emotions independently predicted SRH. Detection of SRH determinants was sensitive to binary versus ordinal SRH definitions.",Journal of health psychology,2006 Jan,England,2006,00

The purpose of this article is to review the current situation of the MDGs worldwide and to analyse the barriers which are preventing them from being attained in each of the MDG areas, as well as to assess a number of the indicators evaluated. In order to do so, a review has been made of the scientific literature published on the MDGs in the principal health sciences and social sciences databases, as well as the most significant reports on the issue drawn up by the United Nations. The scientific studies on the 8 MDGs and their 18 Targets make it possible to undertake a critical analysis of the situation in which each of these Goals are found at the present time, identifying the determinants that are preventing the attainment of the Goals and the actions considered necessary in order to achieve progress. Although there have been improvements in some of the goals on a world level, the research carried out to date reveals barriers to the attainment of the MDGs, as well as the insufficient weight of the developing countries in the economic and political decision-making processes, together with the incoherence between the economic policies and the social and health policies. Furthermore, Sub-Saharan Africa constitutes the most disadvantaged region, which means that it will not attain the majority of the MDGs. Spain and the developed countries, in addition to contributing resources, can also contribute to the MDGs by means of the identification and eradication of the barriers preventing attainment. This involves promoting international economic relations under conditions of social justice, by supporting a greater decision-making power for developing countries and denouncing actions that increase social inequalities and the impoverishment of the population.",Revista espanola de salud publica,2008 Sep-Oct,Spain,2008,00
14753105,Oral disease and psychosocial risk determinants in relation to self-assessments of general health in persons with chronic whiplash-related disorders.,"The aim of this study was to analyse how self-assessed general health was related to oral health among persons afflicted with whiplash-associated disorders (WAD), controlling for relevant background factors, confounders and other risk factors. Questionnaires included the SF-36 Health Survey, self-assessed oral health and relevant risk factors, in total 49 questions. Multivariable regression modelling was performed. Members of a nationwide Swedish association enlisting persons who have problems concerning a whiplash injury (n = 1,928) were included. A total of 979 persons participated in the study, a response rate of 50.8%. A multivariable regression model is presented, with general health as the dependent variable, and the independent variables inserted en-bloc. The model was highly significant with an explained variance of 28%. Among background factors, only older age appeared as significantly and strongly related to poorer general health. The strongest explanatory contributions came from the health related variables. Oral disease and extra-oral body pain were both strongly related to poorer general health, most obviously for the oral disease variable. Oral disease was significantly and to a clinically relevant degree associated with self-assessed general health. Several other psychosocial indicators of stress were also significantly related to the general health. These findings are consistent with the stress-behaviour-immune model for development of disease.",Swedish dental journal,2003,Sweden,2003,00
18372875,Health promotion in South Africa.,"Health promotion first entered the South African health system in 1990. Today, Health Promotion is a Directorate located within the Social Sector Cluster (SSC) within Primary Health Care (PHC), District and Development operations which falls under the Deputy Director General for Health Service Delivery in the National Department of Health (DoH). The first significant piece of new policy for health promotion in South Africa appeared in the African National Congress (ANC) health policy document, health care services including reproductive health care. At the moment, health promotion service delivery is the responsibility of the national, provincial and local governments with provincial and local governments mainly implementing and the National Health Promotion Directorate offering support. Funding for health promotion activities comes from the Department of Health budget allocation by the National Treasury. One major problem for Health Promotion development is infrastructure. There is significant community participation in South Africa including health promotion policy and strategy document development. Health Promotion research and evaluation is limited. The National Department of Health considers the settings approach to be crucial in driving the progress of health promotion. There are very few trained health promotion specialists either capable or in the position to inform politicians and opinion leaders about the relationship between health and social determinants, and the evidence of effectiveness of health promotion action. Mechanisms for demonstrating evidence of health promotion effectiveness in terms of health, social, economic and political impact are lacking and occupational standards for health promotion education and training are needed.",Promotion & education,2007,England,2007,00
18727132,What do we know about quality of life in dementia? A review of the emerging evidence on the predictive and explanatory value of disease specific measures of health related quality of life in people with dementia.,"OBJECTIVE: Given its complexity, there is growing consensus on the need to measure patient-rated broad outcomes like health-related quality of life (HRQL) as well as discrete functions like cognition and behaviour in dementia. This review brings together current data on the distribution, determinants and course of HRQL in dementia to investigate the predictive and explanatory value of measures of HRQL in people with dementia. DESIGN: A systematic review of papers in English published up to October 2007 to identify data on the use of disease-specific measures of HRQL in dementia. RESULTS: There are no clear or consistent associations between socio-demographic variables and HRQL. There is no convincing evidence that lower cognition or greater activity limitation is associated with lower HRQL. There is a strong suggestion that depression is consistently associated with decreased HRQL in dementia. However, the magnitude of the associations observed is moderate only and the proportion of variance explained is low suggesting that depression and HRQL are different constructs. We currently know almost nothing about the natural history of HRQL in dementia or what attributes or interventions promote or inhibit HRQL life for people with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: While in other illnesses there may be simple association between HRQL and an easily measurable clinical variable, in dementia this is not so. There are now instruments available with which to measure disease-specific HRQL directly in clinical trials and other studies that can yield informative data.",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2009 Jan,England,2009,00

A synthesis of the evidence from UK policy and practice (1980-2004).,"OBJECTIVES: To synthesise data on the impact on health and key socioeconomic determinants of health and health inequalities reported in evaluations of national UK regeneration programmes. DATA SOURCES: Eight electronic databases were searched from 1980 to 2004 (IBSS, COPAC, HMIC, IDOX, INSIDE, Medline, Urbadisc/Accompline, Web of Knowledge). Bibliographies of located documents and relevant web sites were searched. Experts and government departmental libraries were also contacted. REVIEW METHODS: Evaluations that reported achievements drawing on data from at least two target areas of a national urban regeneration programme in the UK were included. Process evaluations and evaluations reporting only business outcomes were excluded. All methods of evaluation were included. Impact data on direct health outcomes and direct measures of socioeconomic determinants of health were narratively synthesised. RESULTS: 19 evaluations reported impacts on health or socioeconomic determinants of health; data from 10 evaluations were synthesised. Three evaluations reported health impacts; in one evaluation three of four measures of self reported health deteriorated, typically by around 4%. Two other evaluations reported overall reductions in mortality rates. Most socioeconomic outcomes assessed showed an overall improvement after regeneration investment; however, the effect size was often similar to national trends. In addition, some evaluations reported adverse impacts. CONCLUSION: There is little evidence of the impact of national urban regeneration investment on socioeconomic or health outcomes. Where impacts have been assessed, these are often small and positive but adverse impacts have also occurred. Impact data from future evaluations are required to inform healthy public policy; in the meantime work to exploit and synthesise ""best available"" data is required.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2006 Feb,England,2006,00
16387555,"Determinants of high and low attendance to diet and exercise interventions among overweight and obese older adults. Results from the arthritis, diet, and activity promotion trial.","BACKGROUND: Determinants of adherence to lifestyle regimens are ill understood. Attendance to intervention sessions is crucial for patients to acquire knowledge and skills regarding the core elements of an intervention. Therefore, we explored demographic, health-related, and social determinants of high and low attendance to diet and exercise sessions among overweight and obese patients with knee osteoarthritis (> or = 60 years; N = 206). METHODS: The Arthritis, Diet, and Activity Promotion Trial was an 18-month randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of dietary weight loss and exercise interventions. We conducted chi-square and t-tests, and logistic regression analyses on categories of short- and long-term attendance to intervention sessions. RESULTS: Over the 18-month duration of the study, 60.7% (+/- 28.5) of diet sessions, and 53.2% (+/- 29.0) of exercise sessions were attended. Not being married, low social participation, and single intervention randomization predicted high attendance to diet sessions during months 1-4. Exercising at home, and single intervention randomization predicted high attendance to exercise sessions during months 5-18. High attendance to sessions early in the intervention was a significant determinant of high session attendance thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: Offering people a choice where to exercise, and stimulating early intervention session attendance can be effective in improving long-term attendance to both interventions. Several determinants we found may be amenable to change to enhance intervention adherence of future randomized controlled trials involving dietary weight loss and/or physical exercise.",Contemporary clinical trials,2006 Jun,United States,2006,00
12617359,Aggregate Health Status: a benchmark index for community health.,"A qualitative review of population health assessment models used throughout the United States and Canada indicate both individual and community-level domains of health. Individual-level domains of health include health habits, education, public safety, environment, social, government, culture, and mobility. Community-level domains include the same general health domains but aggregated to the community level Aggregate Health Status (AHS). In the development of the AHS portion of our model, the dependent variable was the general health question from the Medical Outcomes Study. The remainder of the survey was partitioned into mutually exclusive individual measure subsets. A linear combination of these global variables then produces a single estimate relating the multiple domains of the broader determinants of health to health status. This global variable uniquely discriminates between the five categories of general health. This model serves as a framework and benchmark indicator that (1) provides a summary indicator of the overall health status of the population, (2) is broadly representative of populations rather than individuals, (3) is a population perspective rather than a provider perspective, and (4) emphasizes outcomes versus inputs and processes.",Journal of medical systems,2003 Apr,United States,2003,00
12622310,Association between organizational inequity and incidence of psychiatric disorders in female employees.,"BACKGROUND: Prior research on work-related factors in the aetiology of psychiatric disorders has been concentrated on job control, job demands and social support. To broaden the view to managerial procedures, we examined whether the extent to which employees are treated with equity in the workplace predicts their mental health. Organizational equity refers to decision-making procedures, which are consistently applied, open, correctable and include input from affected parties (procedural justice). It also refers to respectful and considerate treatment of individuals by supervisors (relational justice). METHOD: A cohort of 1786 female hospital employees with no psychiatric disorder at baseline responded to a questionnaire on organizational equity. From the responses, both an individual score and a work unit mean score were assigned to each participant. The outcome was new reports of doctor-diagnosed psychiatric disorders during the 2-year follow-up. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were corrected for clustering of the data. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and salary, odds ratio of new psychiatric disorders for self-reported low procedural justice was 1.9 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.2). Corresponding odds ratio for low procedural justice, as assessed with work unit mean scores, was 1.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0). These associations remained statistically significant after additional adjustment for mental distress at baseline and job control, job demands and social support. Relational justice did not predict psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSION: Research on organizational equity provides new information about potential work-related determinants of mental health. Low procedural justice seems to be an independent risk factor for psychiatric disorders in female employees.",Psychological medicine,2003 Feb,England,2003,00
10717486,Determinants of the intention to adopt hormone replacement therapy among premenopausal women.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the psychosocial factors that influence the intention to adopt hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at menopause. METHODS: Random Digit Dialing was used to recruit 644 premenopausal non-hysterectomized women aged 45-54. Data were collected using a telephone questionnaire previously developed according to the theory of planned behaviour. Variables measured were: intention to adopt HRT (INT); attitude towards HRT (Aact); perceived social norm (SN); perceived behavioural control (PBC); and personal normative belief (PNB). Socio-demographic data were also obtained. RESULTS: Stepwise multiple regression of INT on the theoretical variables yielded an R(2) of 0.70. The determinants were Aact (beta=0.39, P<0.001), PNB (beta=0.25, P<0.001), PBC (beta=0.23, P<0.001) and SN (beta=0.12, P<0.001). Women with a strong intention to adopt HRT represented 25% of the sample. These women were more likely to believe that adopting HRT would have the following positive consequences: an improvement in general well-being, the prevention of health problems, an improvement in interpersonal relationships, an increase in productivity, the regulation of mood swings and a reduction of hot flashes. They were also more likely to believe in the following negative consequences: side-effects, an increased risk of cancer, the likelihood of weight gain, and interference in the natural course of menopause (all at P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Actions that target behaviourial beliefs regarding HRT and perceived barriers to its adoption are most likely to influence adoption of HRT.",Maturitas,2000 Mar 31,Ireland,2000,00
17540420,The response to the trench diseases in World War I: a triumph of public health science.,"The recent 90-year anniversary of the Battle of the Somme presents an opportunity to examine the public health response to the trench diseases, new conditions which arose in the trenches of World War I. Throughout history, there have been two views of epidemic disease: the configurationist and contagionist perspectives. Most doctors responding to the trench diseases, 'contingent-contagionists', combined these two conceptions of disease. Because of the difficulty of finding a causative organism and the absence of effective treatment, the majority view became that these conditions were a product of the trench environment. Configurationism, with its emphasis on environmental and social determinants, seemed to provide the most obvious approaches for tackling the trench diseases. The diseases were effectively controlled using the tools of public health science: sanitary discipline and a battery of measures, such as improving trench construction, improving the diet, providing protective kit, regular bathing and treating lice infestation. The response demonstrates the triumph of public health science over new medical technologies. It also illustrates the importance of considering all the many determinants of health and of close surveillance, discipline and partnership working to counter ill-health. Although technology, training, doctrine and health beliefs change over time, the interaction between disease and environment remains the core challenge to public health practitioners.",Public health,2007 Aug,Netherlands,2007,00
12088253,Analysis of the recourse to conservative surgery in the treatment of breast tumors.,"AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Conservative surgery is the treatment of choice for malignant tumors, at least up to stage II. The aim of this study was to analyze the recourse to conservative surgery for breast tumors and its determinants (ie, characteristics of hospitals and patients). METHODS: The study was conducted in Italy's Lazio region and was based on administrative data of the regional Hospital Information System, a database on hospitalizations. We selected all regional hospitalizations for therapeutic breast surgery over 1997, classifying them as either ""conservative"" or ""non-conservative"". The other variables considered were type of hospital, number of beds, volume of activity (average annual number of hospitalizations for breast cancer surgery), specific diagnosis, severity of cancer, and patient's age, place of residence, and socioeconomic level. A logistic model was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 7235 hospitalizations were analyzed, 3570 (49%) for malignant tumors and 3665 (51%) for benign disease. The logistic model showed that the factors most closely correlated with conservative surgery were age (OR = 2.2; 95% Cl: 1.8-2.6, for the age group <50 years compared to >70 years); severity of cancer (OR = 0.6; 95% Cl: 0.5-0.8, for non-localized compared to localized tumors), and volume of activity of the hospital (OR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.6, for hospitals with >70 operations/year compared to those with <20 operations/year). The study also revealed that surgery for malignant tumors was performed by both high-volume and low-volume hospitals throughout the region. CONCLUSIONS: The association between conservative surgery and younger age, even after controlling for the severity of cancer, points to the need to encourage adherence to the existing guidelines. The association between conservative surgery and high-volume hospitals and the finding that a high proportion of breast operations is performed in low-volume facilities suggest that further efforts should be made to promote admission to high-volume hospitals.",Tumori,2002 Mar-Apr,United States,2002,00
19905397,Analysis of relative influence of nodes in directed networks.,"Many complex networks are described by directed links; in such networks, a link represents, for example, the control of one node over the other node or unidirectional information flows. Some centrality measures are used to determine the relative importance of nodes specifically in directed networks. We analyze such a centrality measure called the influence. The influence represents the importance of nodes in various dynamics such as synchronization, evolutionary dynamics, random walk, and social dynamics. We analytically calculate the influence in various networks, including directed multipartite networks and a directed version of the Watts-Strogatz small-world network. The global properties of networks such as hierarchy and position of shortcuts rather than local properties of the nodes, such as the degree, are shown to be the chief determinants of the influence of nodes in many cases. The developed method is also applicable to the calculation of the PAGERANK. We also numerically show that in a coupled oscillator system, the threshold for entrainment by a pacemaker is low when the pacemaker is placed on influential nodes. For a type of random network, the analytically derived threshold is approximately equal to the inverse of the influence. We numerically show that this relationship also holds true in a random scale-free network and a neural network.","Physical review.

18930531,Tackling the challenges to health equity in China.,"In terms of economic development, China is widely acclaimed as a miracle economy. Over a period of rapid economic growth, however, China's reputation for health has been slipping. In the 1970s China was a shining example of health development, but no longer. Government and public concerns about health equity have grown. China's health-equity challenges are truly daunting because of a vicious cycle of three synergistic factors: the social determinants of health have become more inequitable; imbalances in the roles of the market and government have developed; and concerns among the public have grown about fairness in health. With economic boom and growing government revenues, China is unlike other countries challenged by health inequities and can afford the necessary reforms so that economic development goes hand-in-hand with improved health equity. Reforms to improve health equity will receive immense popular support, governmental commitment, and interest from the public-health community worldwide.","Lancet (London, England)",2008 Oct 25,England,2008,00
20168034,Social determinants of children's health in urban areas in India.,"Children of the urban poor in India suffer a much poorer health status than the urban non-poor, influenced to a large extent by social determinants. In this paper, National Family Health Survey-3 (2005-06) data were analyzed to assess the health status of urban poor children vis-a-vis the non-poor, and to identify the social determinants precipitating disparities. The analysis shows sharp disparity between child health indicators between urban poor and non-poor. Key findings include under-five mortality per thousand (urban poor 72.7 and non-poor 41.8) and children under-five underweight for age (urban poor 47% and non-poor 26.2%). Significant demographic and social correlates of child health in urban areas included poverty, gender, caste status, religion, mother's educational attainment, occupational status of parents, and women's autonomy in the household. They influenced different facets of child health, such as nutritional status and access to immunization.",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,2009,United States,2009,00
12511058,Drug users and HIV-combination therapy (HAART): factors which impede or facilitate adherence.,"The current highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), i.e., triple combination treatment including a protease inhibitor, allows for long-term suppression of HIV-replication. The intake guidelines, however, are very strict and, like many other HIV positive patients, drug users have problems in achieving good therapy compliance. As a result, the effectiveness of the medication therapy is seriously jeopardized. This qualitative study, involving in-depth interviews with 27 ""hard drug"" users in Amsterdam, seeks to provide better insights into the extent of adherence to HAART. In addition, factors that impede or facilitate adherence have been listed in order to develop and improve strategies. The study shows that almost half of the ""hard drug"" users interviewed do not adhere to the therapy. A large number of determinants for adherence were identified at the level of medication, the individual, and the environment. Many of these determinants can be influenced, which means that they can provide clues for the effective implementation of measures that may enhance effectiveness of treatment.",Substance use & misuse,2002,England,2002,00
18450680,Uncertainty and health-related quality of life 1 year after coronary angiography.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about illness-related uncertainty and decreased health-related quality of life in patients undergoing initial coronary angiography or about the long-term effects of uncertainty. OBJECTIVES: To compare patients with and without high levels of uncertainty before angiography and to examine the influence of uncertainty on health-related quality of life 1 year after angiography. METHODS: In a prospective, longitudinal study, measurements of perceived control, uncertainty, affective distress, and health-related quality of life were collected from 93 patients before angiography (baseline) and 1 year later. At baseline, patients were classified into high- and low-uncertainty groups by median split. At 1 year, analysis of variance was used to compare health-related quality of life and psychological outcomes in the 2 groups, and multiple linear regression with stepwise entry was used to identify independent determinants of health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Compared with patients with low baseline uncertainty, patients with high baseline uncertainty had higher levels of anxiety and depression and lower levels of perceived control and health-related quality of life 1 year after angiography. Baseline health-related quality of life, uncertainty, and life stress accounted for 54% of the variance in health-related quality of life, even when angiographic outcome was controlled for (P < .001). Baseline uncertainty was independently associated with health-related quality of life (beta = -0.25; 95% confidence interval, -9.40 to -0.05; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: At initial angiography, high levels of uncertainty about illness portend negative health-related quality of life outcomes up to 1 year later.","American journal of critical care : an official publication, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses",2008 May,United States,2008,00
16687458,Predictors of short-term success of antiretroviral therapy in HIV infection.,"OBJECTIVES: The success of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV infection may be influenced by numerous host factors. There is a lack of data presenting a combined assessment of a variety of these parameters for treatment efficacy in clinical routine practice. METHODS: Different indices of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) were evaluated prospectively in the context of self-reported adherence, health-related quality of life and social determinants, as measured by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 210 individuals were studied between 2002 and 2004, 77% were males, mean age was 44 years, mean CD4 count was 336 cells/mm3 and 63% had a viral load < 50 copies/mL. In univariate analysis, baseline viral load, unscheduled drug levels, a 4 h pharmacokinetic profile (PK-P) at a scheduled visit and self-reported complete adherence within the previous 2 weeks were significantly associated with virological success of HAART at 12 weeks. At 24 weeks, only baseline viral load, the 4 h PK-P and adherence were significantly associated with HAART efficacy. In multivariate analysis, baseline viral load, adherence, unscheduled drug levels, trough levels at a visit with appointment as well as the 4 h PK-P were significantly associated with virological success at 12 weeks. At 24 weeks, only adherence was significantly linked to outcome. The other parameters were not found to have an impact on treatment efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: TDM and self-reported adherence were independently predictive of short-term HAART success in this prospective study. Unscheduled drug measurements provided similar diagnostic information as a 4 h PK-P. Thus, we propose the use of unscheduled drug level monitoring and self-reported adherence to help identify patients with elevated risk of virological failure.",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,2006 Jul,England,2006,00
17878172,Is phenomenology the best approach to health research?,"Much research at the National Institutes of Health--for example, the NIH Roadmap (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/)--has focused on aspects of systems biology and the application of new technologies, which might best be considered descriptive or phenomenological. Unfortunately, etiologic research and social, behavioral, and environmental population studies are at risk of becoming second-class research. In particular, the Roadmap does not address the need for studies of unique populations, determinants of the large variations in disease among populations and over time, and the long incubation period for many diseases. Success in reducing disease in the population will depend on linking the enormous potential of phenomenological methods to excellent etiologic and social/behavioral studies. The phenomenological approach alone will improve our descriptions of disease but may not result in reducing disease burden in human populations.",American journal of epidemiology,2007 Nov 15,United States,2007,00

STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective observational study, parents of 58 children with NF1 (32 boys, 26 girls, age 12.2 +/- 2.5 years) visiting a university clinic, and their 43 children 10 years or older were assessed with the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). Potential determinants of domain scores were assessed in 3 explorative regression models. RESULTS: Parents reported a significant impact of NF1 on 9/13 CHQ scales, with moderate effect sizes on 8 (general health perceptions, physical functioning, general behavior, mental health, self esteem, family activities, role functioning emotional/behavioral, and parent emotional impact). Children report an impact on bodily pain, and an above average general behavior. Multiple CHQ scales were sensitive to demographic factors and behavioral problems, and 1 to NF1 severity. NF1 visibility and school problems did not influence HR-QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Parents, but not the children with NF1, report a profound impact of NF1 on physical, social, behavioral, and emotional aspects of HR-QOL. Multiple HR-QOL domains were most sensitive to behavioral problems, which points to an exciting potential opportunity to improve HR-QOL in children with NF1 by addressing these behavioral problems.",The Journal of pediatrics,2009 Mar,United States,2009,00

METHODS: Rapid Participatory Appraisal involves communities in identifying and challenging their own health-related needs. Information on ten health and social aspects was collated from existing documentation, neighbourhood observations, and interviews with a range of residents and key informants, providing a composite picture of the community's structure, needs and services. RESULTS: The perceived needs after 10 years encompassed a wide construct of health, principally the living environment, housing, and lack of finance. Most identified upstream determinants of health rather than specific medical conditions as primary concerns. After the initial Rapid Participatory Appraisal many interviewees took the recommendations forward, working to promote a healthier environment and advocate for local resources. Interventions requiring support from outwith the community were largely not sustained. CONCLUSION: Rapid Participatory Appraisal proved valuable in assessing long-term change. The community's continuing needs were identified, but they could not facilitate and sustain change without the strategic support of key regional and national agencies. Many repeatedly voiced concerns lay outwith local control: local needs assessment must be supported at higher levels to be effective.",BMC public health,2006 Mar 15,England,2006,00

11762890,Determinants of general practitioner use among women in Australia.,"This study investigates the use of general practitioner services by women in Australia. Although there is a universal health insurance system (Medicare) in Australia, there are variations in access to services and out of pocket costs for services. Survey data from 2350 mid-age (45-50 years) and 2102 older (70-75 years) women participating in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health were linked with Medicare data to provide a range of individual and contextual variables hypothesised to explain general practitioner use. Structural equation modelling showed that physical health was the most powerful explanatory factor of general practitioner use. However, after adjusting for self-reported health, out of pocket cost per consultation was inversely associated with use of services. The out of pocket cost was generally lower for women with low socioeconomic status but cost was also directly related to geographical remoteness. Women living in more remote areas had higher out of pocket costs and poorer access to services. Women who reported better access to care were more likely to be satisfied with their most recent general practice consultation and less likely to be sceptical of the value of medical care. These results show the need for health policies that improve the equitable use of general practitioner services in Australia.",Social science & medicine (1982),2001 Dec,England,2001,00
16162598,"Socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioural, and psychological determinants of BMI among young women: differing patterns for underweight and overweight/obesity.","OBJECTIVES: Underweight, overweight, and obese women aged 18-34 years were compared with normal weight women of the corresponding age according to socioeconomic, psychosocial, health behaviour, self reported global and psychological health, and locus of control characteristics. METHODS: The 2000 public health survey in Scania is a cross-sectional study. A total 13,715 persons aged 18-80 years, of which 1967 were females of 18-34 years of age, were included in this study. They answered a postal questionnaire, which represents 59% of the random sample. A logistic regression model adjusted for age was used to investigate the association between socioeconomic, psychosocial, health behaviour, self reported global and psychological health, locus of control, and the BMI categories. RESULTS: A 17.5% proportion of the women, aged 18-34 years, were underweight (BMI < 20.0), 18.4% were overweight, and 7.0% obese. The prevalence of underweight according to the BMI < 18.5 definition was 5.8% among women aged 18-34 years. Women who were underweight had significantly higher odds ratios for overtime work, being students, low emotional support, and poor self reported global as well as poor psychological health than normal weight women. Women who were overweight/obese were unemployed, had low education, low social participation, low emotional and instrumental support, were daily smokers, had a sedentary lifestyle, had poor self reported global health, and had lack of internal locus of control compared with normal weight women. CONCLUSIONS: Underweight women are more likely to have poorer psychological health than normal weight women. In contrast, overweight and obese women are more likely to have poor health related behaviours and lack of internal locus of control compared with normal weight women. These differing patterns suggest both different etiology and different preventive strategies to deal with the health risks of people who are underweight as opposed to those who are overweight/obese.",European journal of public health,2006 Jun,England,2006,00
17999706,Social cognitive determinants of ecstasy use to target in evidence-based interventions: a meta-analytical review.,"AIMS: The health hazards and prevalence of ecstasy use have been documented in two decades of research, but no review reporting on potentially modifiable antecedents of use is available. The aim of this study was to integrate systematically research identifying cognitive correlates of ecstasy use. Such research has the potential to identify targets for evidence-based interventions designed to discourage use. METHODS: The databases PsycINFO and MedLine were searched, inclusion criteria applied to resulting hits, and descendency and ancestry approaches applied to the selected publications. Reported associations between cognitive determinants, including intention to use and ecstasy use measures, were synthesized by calculating a weighted mean effect size, r. RESULTS: The pattern of associations lent support both to the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the expectancy approach as descriptions of potentially useful determinants. Attitudes were associated most strongly with intention and use, followed by subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of the strength of associations and the potential modifiability of identified cognitions suggests that evidence-based interventions to discourage ecstasy use should target negative expectancies, perceived behavioural control and anticipated regret, and consider tailoring perceived behavioural control elements.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2008 Jan,England,2008,00

DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinic-based prospective cohort study of HIV-1-infected women followed for up to 6 years and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The multivariate pregnancy rate ratio (RR) comparing women at clinical stage II with women at stage I was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39, 0.82), and the pregnancy RR for women at stage III or IV compared with women at stage I was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.36), controlling for independent predictors of pregnancy incidence. Pregnancy rates were lower among older women, unmarried women, women who had revealed their HIV status to someone, and women who had living children from their most recent pregnancy. The association of HIV-1 clinical progression with a decline in pregnancy incidence was not explained by weight loss, menstrual dysfunction, or nutritional status.

15623836,Pregnancy increases BMI in adolescents of a population-based birth cohort.,"Evidence from developed countries suggests that adolescents grow while pregnant and that their growth is associated with increased weight gain and fat storage, but this has never been examined in girls from developing countries. Adolescents born in 1982 in Pelotas, Brazil, are being followed in a birth cohort study. Information on social and biological determinants of nutritional status was collected in early life. Both in 1997 and in 2001, 464 girls were located through household visits, 16% of whom had had a pregnancy in this period. Changes in height, weight, and BMI between 1997 and 2001 were analyzed in relation to the occurrence of pregnancy, after adjustment for previous anthropometric status, as well as social and biological characteristics. The average gains were 2.0 +/- 2.0 cm in height, 3.1 +/- 5.9 kg in weight, and 0.7 +/- 2.2 kg/m(2) in BMI. Each pregnancy was associated with a reduction of 0.46 cm on height gain from 1997 to 2001 (P = 0.02). Girls who became pregnant gained 2.25 kg more than all others (P = 0.004). There was a clear association between pregnancy and BMI change. A single pregnancy was associated with an increase of 0.81 kg/m(2) (P = 0.01) and 2 or more pregnancies were associated with an increase of 1.58 kg/m(2) (P = 0.02). Teenage pregnancy was associated with an important increase in BMI.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the socioeconomic and cultural determinants, organisational structure, distinct categories, and spatial patterning of sex work in Tallinn, Estonia, and identify recent temporal changes in sex work patterns. METHODS: In-depth interviews with key informants; naturalistic observations of sex work and drug use venues, geo-mapping of sex work sites, review of media, public policy, and commissioned reports, and analyses of existing data. RESULTS: Sex work takes place in a hierarchy of locations in Tallinn ranging from elite brothels and ""love flats"" to truck stops. These sites vary in terms of their public health importance and social organisation. There are full time, part time, and intermittent male and female sex workers. Among others, the taxi driver, madam and the bartender are central roles in the organisation of sex work in Tallinn.

Subjects included 82 women 18 years of age or older who were currently seeking treatment at an outpatient clinic. The Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 20 (SF-20) assessment consisted of patient self-ratings on 20 items measuring six distinct health dimensions. Additional data were collected on age, ethnicity, education, employment status, length of time since HIV diagnosis, CDC stage of disease, total CD4 count, number of symptoms, Karnofsky Performance Scores, social support and discrimination. Multiple regression analyses were performed using each of the six health dimension scores as dependent variables and a combination of ten demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables as independent variables. All of the six multiple regression equations were statistically significant, with R(2) values ranging from 0.35 to 0.44. Age, Karnofsky Performance Score and social support were statistically significantly related to several scale scores (p < 0.05). These results provide baseline data on clinical, demographic and psychosocial determinants of quality of life in a female patient population.

17400353,"Distancing the mad: Jarvis's Law and the spatial distribution of admissions to the Hamilton Lunatic Asylum in Canada, 1876-1902.","The institutional confinement of the 'insane' in the nineteenth century constitutes one of the most controversial events in the social history of medicine. Within this scholarship there has emerged an important debate over the spatial determinants of institutionalization. Some studies uphold an historical postulate--Jarvis's Law--that contends there was a 'distance decay' effect in mental hospital utilization--that is, an inverse correlation between the distance from a medical institution and the likelihood of people to use its resources. Other scholars have challenged or modified this thesis, arguing that factors such as the local politics, urban living, or socio-economic status were more important determinants of institutional confinement. This article contributes to this ongoing debate by analysing over 4000 admissions to the Ontario Provincial Asylum in the city of Hamilton, Canada, between 1876 and 1902. The results confirm Jarvis' Law was applicable to the Hamilton context: there was an inverse statistical relationship between physical distance from the asylum and the likelihood of admission. However, this paper yields three additional dimensions to the literature: (1) it demonstrates that jails were much more likely to be utilized as temporary places of confinement for communities far from provincial mental hospitals; (2) the length of stay in the asylum was positively correlated with the distance travelled to the institution; and (3) an inverse relationship was found when correlating distance from the asylum and the likelihood of being readmitted to the same institution. These findings suggest an impact of 'distance' beyond the dimension of hospital utilization and imply that the broader asylum experience could be affected by the previous location of patients.",Social science & medicine (1982),2007 Jun,England,2007,00
15256518,The association of maternal growth and socio-economic measures with infant birthweight in four ethnic groups.,"BACKGROUND: Both maternal socio-economic status (SES) and growth measures are themselves interrelated and are also related to infant birthweight. The objective of this study is to compare the relative importance of such maternal measures as determinants of birthweight of female infants-the prospective mothers of the next generation. METHODS: The study base was derived from a population-based multiethnic intergenerational cohort: the Washington State Intergenerational Cohort. Infants of mothers from four ethnic groups were included: non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics. We generated simple, partial, and multiple correlation coefficients to investigate the association between birthweight and the maternal growth and SES measures. RESULTS: While there were slight differences among the ethnic groups, generally each of three maternal pre-conceptional growth measures-birthweight, stature, and pre-pregnant weight-was a stronger predictor of female infant birthweight than were each of the five maternal SES factors-age, parity, marital status, educational attainment, and prenatal care onset. After accounting for the proportion of variation in birthweight explained by the maternal growth measures and maternal smoking, the addition of the five SES variables added relatively little to the prediction of infant birthweight. The maximal multiple correlation coefficients (R2) yield values ranging from 9.5% to 12.8%. CONCLUSIONS: A mother's growth before pregnancy is a stronger predictor of infant birthweight than is her current socio-economic circumstance. Since the mother's growth must have been influenced by the socio-economic circumstances of her family of upbringing, this further highlights the intergenerational contribution on a woman's reproductive success.",International journal of epidemiology,2004 Dec,England,2004,00

These studies consist partly in retrospective analysis of pathological situations and partly in the analysis of normal development. It appears that the social and emotional surroundings of the child, provided that they were continuous and devoid of ambiguity, play a prominent role in this process. At present, numerous authors consider that gender identity is achieved at about 2 years of age when the child has a harmonious general development.

17669595,Relationship of early childhood illness with adult cortisol in the Barry Caerphilly Growth (BCG) cohort.,"BACKGROUND: The developmental origins hypothesis suggests that pre- and postnatal exposures may influence vulnerability to later disease. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one pathway by which this may occur. Analyses were conducted in the Barry Caerphilly Growth (BCG) cohort to explore whether the postnatal exposure of childhood infections was related to HPA axis activity in adulthood. METHODS: Detailed data on type and frequency of illnesses were collected in the first 5 years of life. At the recent follow-up of this cohort (N=566; mean age of participants=25 years) three salivary cortisol samples were taken: two fasting samples in the morning (within 30 min of arrival at the study site and after venesection and cognitive test procedures) and one evening sample (2200 h). These data were transformed to provide AUCi and AUCg (indices reflecting axis reactivity and total hormonal output, respectively). FINDINGS: Negative associations were evident between number of upper respiratory illnesses and adult cortisol (as captured by the second morning sample, evening sample and AUCg). These relationships remained after controlling for other potential prenatal, postnatal and adult determinants. These associations were not observed for gastrointestinal illnesses suggesting that confounding by socioeconomic factors is unlikely to be the explanation. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood respiratory illnesses were associated with reduced HPA axis activity in adulthood. Further follow-ups will determine whether this pattern of activity influences vulnerability to diseases associated with HPA regulation.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2007 Sep-Nov,England,2007,00

In many cases, this event is associated with unpleasant somatic-vegetative, urogenital or psychological symptoms. To test the health and social demographic factors (especially household income level) that influence willingness to pay (WTP) for a new hormone-free treatment in women of menopausal age. 1365 women between the ages of 45 and 73 years were surveyed about their health and WTP for the new treatment. WTP was evaluated with a closed-ended binary questionnaire (four groups with different levels of co-payment between euro15 and euro60), using the contingent valuation method. The average WTP was calculated according to the area under the demand function. Factors contributing to payment readiness were examined by means of binary logistic regression. WTP was significantly affected by women's opinion of the new medication, the level of co-payment required, net household income, whether currently in treatment for menopausal symptoms, and Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) values. Compared with other factors, the level of co-payment was predicted to have a negative impact on WTP. Income level is an important factor in WTP and correlates highly with several other health-related variables (WHO-5 index, MRS value, receipt of other menopause medicines and existing co-morbidity). The average co-payment that our group of women was willing to pay was between euro17 and euro35 per month, or euro24 to euro42 for women who were currently receiving treatment for symptoms of menopause. While interpreting the results, it should be considered that the hypothetical therapy was assumed to be a new non-reimbursable alternative to conventional therapy offered under the existing statutory framework for health insurance in Germany. Despite some methodological limitations, these results are useful for examining the factors affecting WTP and incremental utilities for future medicine dealing with menopause.",PharmacoEconomics,2009,New Zealand,2009,00

20025778,"Protocol for an experimental investigation of the roles of oxytocin and social support in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and subjective responses to stress across age and gender.","BACKGROUND: Substantial empirical evidence has demonstrated that individuals who are socially isolated or have few positive social connections seem to age at a faster rate and have more chronic diseases. Oxytocin is a neurohypophyseal hormone hypothesized to coordinate both the causes and effects of positive social interactions, and may be involved in positive physiological adaptations such as buffering the deleterious effects of stress and promoting resilience. The proposed research will examine whether and how oxytocin influences responses to stress in humans and will consider effects in relation to those of social support. METHODS/DESIGN: Experimental research will be used to determine whether exogenously administered oxytocin (intranasal) influences psychological and physiological outcomes under conditions of stress across gender and age in adulthood. Hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Oxytocin ameliorates the deleterious neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and subjective effects of stress; 2) Oxytocin and social support have similar and additive stress-buffering effects; 3) Oxytocin effects are stronger in women versus men; and 4) Oxytocin effects are similar across a range of adult ages. Hypotheses will be tested with a placebo-controlled, double-blind study using a sample of healthy men and women recruited from the community. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either oxytocin or placebo. They undergo a social stress manipulation with and without social support (randomly assigned), and outcome measures are obtained at multiple times during the procedure. DISCUSSION: Understanding the determinants of healthy aging is a major public health priority and identifying effective measures to prevent or delay the onset of chronic diseases is an important goal. Experimental research on oxytocin, social relationships, and health in adulthood will contribute to the scientific knowledge base for maximizing active life and health expectancy. At conclusion of the study we will have solid evidence concerning the effects of oxytocin on stress response and whether it has similar effects across age and gender groups. A neurobiological understanding of resilience can inform efforts for both prevention and intervention of diseases or problems common in later life.",BMC public health,2009 Dec 21,England,2009,00

Findings from the review indicate that yoga has a positive short-term effect on multiple diabetes-related outcomes; however, long-term effects of yoga therapy on diabetes management remain unclear. The context of the social environment, including interpersonal relationships, community characteristics, and discrimination, influences the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors such as physical activity, including yoga practice. Further research is necessary to determine the extent of this influence.",Family & community health,2008 Jul-Sep,United States,2008,00
16436237,[Long-term disease in Danish children reported by the parents].,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to report the prevalence and nature of long-term diseases and their consequences in children under the age of 16 in Denmark, and to identify the socio-demographic determinants of disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parents and stepparents participating in the Danish Health and Morbidity Survey, 2000, were interviewed at home about long-term diseases, including impairments and sequelae after injury and disease, in children under the age of 16 living at home. Answers were given for 7,670 children, and diseases were coded according to ICD-10 by two doctors. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the determinants and consequences of disease. RESULTS: A total of 16.2% of children had one or more long-term diseases, boys (17.5%) more frequently than girls (14.8%). The prevalence increased through the first six years of life. A social gradient was seen: children of parents with low socioeconomic status or with little education had a higher prevalence. The most frequent disease was asthma (4.9%). Also frequent were congenital disorders (1.6%), otitis media (1.4%) and hearing impairment (0.6%). Children with long-term disease suffered more frequently than others from poor health in general, recent sick leave and poor thriving. DISCUSSION: The figures for long-term disease reported by the parents participating in the study were in accordance with what was found in earlier studies, but stigmatising and less severe diseases, as well as periodically recurring diseases, were probably underreported. Attention should be paid to the high prevalence of asthma, to the poorer thriving and to the general health status of children with long-term disease, and to the social inequality in children's health.",Ugeskrift for laeger,2006 Jan 23,Denmark,2006,00
16464928,Developing a critical media research agenda for health psychology.,"This article outlines reasons why psychologists should concern themselves with media processes, noting how media are central to contemporary life and heavily implicated in the construction of shared understandings of health. We contend that the present research focus is substantially medicalized, privileging the investigation and framing of certain topics, such as the portrayal of health professionals, medical practices, specific diseases and lifestyle-orientated interventions, and restricting attention to social determinants of health as appropriate topics for investigation. We propose an extended agenda for media health research to include structural health concerns, such as crime, poverty, homelessness and housing and social capital.",Journal of health psychology,2006 Mar,England,2006,00
19402801,Research and action: toward good quality of life and equity in health.,"A brief summary of key presentations at the 15th Annual International Society for Quality of Life conference is presented. Special highlights of this conference were its location (South America) and its aim to present current and potential contributions of the health-related quality of life (QoL) field to equity in healthcare at a clinical and population level, providing crucial inputs for decision-making in a person-centered health conception. Present and future utilization of health-related QoL measures, norms and bank items were introduced by David Cella, who also called for researchers' cooperation, stating that efforts towards a commonly shared language and metric are better than a relentless pursuit of perfection. Other central topics in the search of equity were stigma and poverty. The importance of negative attributes by others in stigma severity perception and low self-reported QoL was demonstrated by Donald Patrick, who suggested interventions for reducing stigma. Poverty impact on children's QoL and the importance of social determinants were demonstrated through a unique, longitudinal Brazilian study. Complementarily, the importance of a biological basis of oncologic symptoms, particularly cytokines, and the impact of their control on health-related QoL were addressed by Charles Cleeland. The meeting stressed the combined importance of social, psychological and biological factors in determining patient-reported outcomes.",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,2009 Apr,England,2009,00
11261639,Onset and early course as determinants of the further course of schizophrenia.,"OBJECTIVE: First treatment contact is preceded by a lengthy prodromal and psychotic prephase. We analysed the occurrence of symptoms and disabilities prior to first contact and their consequences for medium-term illness course. METHOD: A population-based sample of 232 first episodes of schizophrenia was studied retrospectively using the IRAOS and compared with matched peers from the population of origin. Further illness course was studied prospectively at six cross-sections over 5 years from first admission onwards. RESULTS: Three quarters showed a prodromal phase of 5 years (mean) and a 1-year accumulation of psychotic symptoms. First to appear were depressive and negative symptoms and early signs of cognitive and social impairment. Social disability emerged 4 to 2 years before first contact. Further illness course was determined by stage of social development at psychosis onset with the consequence of a significantly poorer course for men than women because of men's earlier illness onset. Symptomatology, type of onset, age and gender influenced social course via stage of social development and, additionally, via young men's socially adverse illness behaviour. CONCLUSION: Social course is determined by individual stage of social development at illness onset and by early illness course. Therefore, early detection and intervention are needed.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica. Supplementum,2000,Denmark,2000,00
19806842,Historically black medical schools: addressing the minority health professional pipeline and the public mission of care for vulnerable populations.,"Substantial changes in not only access to care, cost, and quality of care, but also health professions education are needed to ensure effective national healthcare reform. Since the actionable determinants of health such as personal beliefs and behaviors, socioeconomic factors, and the environment disproportionately affect the poor (and often racial/ethnic minorities), many have suggested that focusing efforts on this population will both directly and indirectly improve the overall health of the nation. Key to the success of such strategies are the ongoing efforts by historically black medical schools (HBMSs) as well as other minority serving medical and health professional schools, who produce a disproportionate percentage of the high-quality and diverse health professionals that are dedicated to maintaining the health of an increasingly diverse nation. Despite their public mission, HBMSs receive limited public support threatening their ability to not only meet the increasing minority health workforce needs but to even sustain their existing contributions. Substantial changes in health education policy and funding are needed to ensure HBMSs as well as other minority-serving medical and health professional schools can continue to produce the diverse, high-quality health professional workforce necessary to maintain the health of an increasingly diverse nation. We explore several model initiatives including focused partnerships with legislative and business leaders that are urgently needed to ensure the ability of HBMSs to maintain their legacy of providing compassionate, quality care to the communities in greatest need.",Journal of the National Medical Association,2009 Sep,United States,2009,00
17708005,Pathways of disadvantage and smoking careers: evidence and policy implications.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate in older industrialised societies (a) how social disadvantage contributes to smoking risk among women (b) the role of social and economic policies in reducing disadvantage and moderating wider inequalities in life chances and living standards. METHODS: Review and analysis of (a) the effects of disadvantage in childhood and into adulthood on women's smoking status in early adulthood (b) policy impacts on the social exposures associated with high smoking risk. MAIN RESULTS: (a) Smoking status--ever smoking, current smoking, heavy smoking, and cessation--is influenced not only by current circumstances but by longer term biographies of disadvantage (b) social and economic policies shape key social predictors of women's smoking status, including childhood circumstances, educational levels and adult circumstances, and moderate inequalities in the distribution of these dimensions of life chances and living standards. Together, the two sets of findings argue for a policy toolkit that acts on the distal determinants of smoking, with interventions targeting the conditions in which future and current smokers live. CONCLUSIONS: An approach to tobacco control is advocated that combines changing smoking habits with reducing inequalities in the social trajectories in which they are embedded. Policies to level up opportunities and living standards across the lifecourse should be championed as part of an equity oriented approach to reducing the disease burden of cigarette smoking.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2006 Sep,England,2006,00
16775603,Lessons in ethnonephrology.,"Only recently has the nephrology community moved beyond a fairly singular focus on terminal kidney failure to embrace population-based studies of earlier stages of disease, its markers and risk factors, and of interventions. Observations in developing countries, and in minority, migrant, and disadvantaged groups in westernized countries, have promoted these developments. We are only beginning to interpret renal disease in the context of public health history, social and health transitions, changing population demography, and competing mortality. Its intimate relationships to other health issues are being progressively exposed. Perspectives on the multideterminant etiology of most disease and the pedestrian nature of most risk factors are maturing. We are challenged to reconcile epidemiologic patterns with morphology in diseased renal tissue, and to consider structural markers, such as nephron number and glomerular size, as determinants of disease susceptibility. New work force models are mandated for population-based studies and intervention programs. Intervention programs need to be integrated with other chronic disease initiatives and nested in a matrix of systematic primary care, and although flexible to changing needs, must be sustained over the long term. Cross-disciplinary collaboration is essential in designing those programs, and in promoting them to health-care funders. Substantial expansion and restructuring of the discipline is needed for the nephrology community to participate effectively in those processes.",Kidney international,2006 Jul,United States,2006,00
15006238,Equity of use of inpatient services by the two communities in Northern Ireland.,"OBJECTIVE: There is concern about whether public services in Northern Ireland are equitably targeted across the religious divide. This study investigates whether use of acute hospital inpatient services differs by religious denomination, after adjusting for supply and for identified demographic, morbidity and socio-economic determinants of need for such services. METHODS: Hospital utilisation at small area level was modelled against a wide range of potential health and socioeconomic factors. Spatial interactive modelling was used to estimate the effect of supply of hospital beds and other facilities on hospital utilisation. Two-stage weighted least-squares regression was used to model utilisation against need and supply. RESULTS: There was a clear positive relationship between the proportion of Roman Catholics in a ward and both need for and utilisation of inpatient services. The higher levels of relative utilisation in wards with a greater proportion of Catholics persisted after controlling for needs but not when supply variables were also entered in the regression equation. The surviving needs drivers were: uptake levels of 'income maintenance' benefits, all-ages standardised mortality ratio, low birth weight and elderly people living alone. Most of these indicators of need are positively correlated with proportion of Catholics. CONCLUSIONS: When both need and supply factors are taken into account, there appears to be no significant effect of religion on inpatient hospital use in Northern Ireland. Efforts to ensure socio-economic equity between the two communities should focus on ensuring that hospital rationalisation does not lead to disadvantage and on reducing socio-economic differentials between the Catholic and Protestant communities.",Journal of health services research & policy,2004 Jan,England,2004,00
18777450,Is the worldwide epidemic of obesity a communicable feature of globalization?,"Globalization has a major impact on both economic and social determinants in public health. The current worldwide epidemic in obesity needs to be considered in the context of globalization as a communicable rather than non-communicable process. There is increasing evidence that global trends in lifestyle, eating behavior and cultural adaptation contribute to the rapid increase in obesity around the world. Thus, obesity may be defined as a ""socially-contagious"" feature of globalization. Furthermore, infectious agents are being identified that may cause obesity by central mechanisms or by modulating adipocyte function or at least by contributing to the chronic inflammatory milieu of the metabolic syndrome. Therefore, globalization may indeed form a critical platform for these pathogens to fuel the obesity epidemic. Understanding obesity in the light of globalization as a communicable disorder will allow outlining better avenues of prevention and treatment.","Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",2008 Sep,Germany,2008,00

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. PARTICIPANTS: 532 Turkish people older than 12 years. METHODS: The data were obtained through a structured questionnaire and oral examination. The World Health Organisation methodology was followed in assessing the oral health status. RESULTS: Comparison of the study population with German studies showed a similar caries experience in younger groups, but in older groups a lower treatment level. The proportion of regular dental attendees indicated no difference according to age. A person was more likely to use dental services regularly if he had a better level of German language and preferred German services. Perceived oral condition, educational level and sex were also important for care pattern. Regular use of services was negatively associated with the mean number of decayed, missing and periodontally involved teeth, but positively related to the number of filled teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Since factors reflecting the level of adaptation to Germany were also important determinants of the dental utilisation pattern, efforts to improve the utilisation of services should be based on the socio-educational development of Turkish people in Germany.",International dental journal,2002 Jun,England,2002,00
18377906,Males of a single-brooded tropical bird species do not show increases in testosterone during social challenges.,"The challenge hypothesis poses that in socially monogamous vertebrates, males increase circulating testosterone in response to aggressive challenges to promote intense and persistent aggression. However, in bird species that raise only a single brood during short breeding seasons as well as those with essential male parental care, males lack the well-documented testosterone response to social challenges. We tested male behavioral and hormonal responses to social challenges in a neotropical bird species, the buff-breasted wren (Thryothorus leucotis), which is single-brooded with extensive male parental care, but in contrast to most species studied to date, has a long breeding season. We presented live female, male, and paired decoys with song playback for 30 min during pre-breeding and breeding periods. Males responded aggressively to all intruders, but male decoys elicited somewhat weaker responses overall. Responses to female decoys were most intense during pre-breeding, whereas pair decoys elicited stronger responses at breeding. Plasma testosterone concentrations did not differ between challenged and unchallenged males, or among males exposed to different decoys or during different seasons. Plasma corticosterone in pre-breeding males was higher in challenged than unchallenged males and varied positively with the duration of social challenge. Circulating dehydroepiandrosterone concentrations were similar in challenged and unchallenged males, but correlated positively with the proportion of time males spent in close proximity to the decoy. Both testosterone and corticosterone results support recent findings, suggesting that brood number and essential male care, but not breeding-season length, may be important determinants of male hormonal responsiveness during aggressive interactions.",Hormones and behavior,2008 Jun,United States,2008,00
18274042,Social context and the health consequences of disasters.,"Disasters have been and will continue to be relatively common events in the human experience, and they make important contributions to variations in population health. There is a need, therefore, for conceptual models that identify the social and ecological factors influencing post-disaster consequences on population health. This article presents one such conceptual model which links the health consequences of natural, technological, and human-made disasters to a set of nested socioecological factors. Specifically, we attempt to link post-disaster consequences to aspects of the global and local environment and to highlight the roles played by social and ecological factors, including the social infrastructure, cultural beliefs, demography, and underlying historical and geographical circumstances. Examples from existing population-based health and disaster research are used to illustrate and amplify connections drawn from the model. From an applied standpoint, the model suggests that the role of multiple contextual determinants in shaping population health is likely to be complex. Practitioners interested in mitigating the consequences of disasters should pursue strategies that improve the underlying determinants of health, as well as practicable population-based interventions that could be implemented rapidly.",American journal of disaster medicine,2006 Nov-Dec,United States,2006,00

Eleven published studies investigating physical activity in samples of adult employees were included in this review. Across these studies, self-efficacy, or belief in personal ability to perform this health behavior, was the best predictor of physical activity among employees. Perceived benefits of physical activity and perceived health status were also found to influence participation in physical activity. Occupational health nurses could offer self-care classes and intervention programs that assist employees in improving their perceptions of self-efficacy to perform physical activity.

From the clinical charts, the following information was extracted: date of the beginning of illness, dates of medical attendance, type and date of diagnostic tests, characteristics of the disease (symptoms, stage), and date of treatment. From personal interviews we gathered the data not present in the clinical chart: sociodemographic data, information about other underlying diseases, and variables related to lifestyle. The time periods considered were from onset of symptoms to initial consultation (S-C); from initial consultation to hospital admission (C-H); and from hospital admission to diagnosis (H-D). The information on hospital admission, diagnosis, and treatment was prospectively gathered, whereas data before hospitalization were assessed retrospectively. For statistical analysis, we used Kruskal-Wallis test and Cox regression. Pain was the only predictor associated with a shorter S-C period. Hemorrhage, number of symptoms, and hospital consultation significantly shortened the interval C-H. Both hemorrhage and pain, and an initial visit at private primary care were the independent predictors that decreased the period H-D. In conclusion, sociodemographic factors did not influence healthcare attendance.",Cancer detection and prevention,2001,England,2001,00
17692292,A longitudinal typology of symptoms of depression and anxiety over the life course.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about long-term profiles of depressive and anxious symptomatology over the life course and about the developmental determinants of different trajectories. The objective of this study was to identify a novel typology of symptoms of depression and anxiety over the life course and examine its neurodevelopmental antecedents in an epidemiological sample. METHODS: A longitudinal latent variable analysis was conducted on measures of anxious and depressive symptoms at ages 13, 15, 36, 43, and 53 years among 4627 members of the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health & Development (the British 1946 birth cohort). Early life predictors of class membership were studied with ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: We identified six distinct profiles up to age 53: absence of symptoms (44.8% of sample); repeated moderate symptoms (33.6%); adult-onset moderate symptoms (11.3%); adolescent symptoms with good adult outcome (5.8%); adult-onset severe symptoms (2.9%); and repeated severe symptoms over the life course (1.7%). Heavier babies had lower likelihood of depressive and anxious symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = .92; 95% confidence interval [CI] .85-.99), whereas delay in first standing (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.11-1.28) and walking (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.14-1.31) was associated with subsequent higher likelihood of symptoms, controlling for social circumstances and stressful life events during childhood. CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence of distinct profiles of depressive and anxious symptomatology over the life course and associations with markers of neurodevelopment. This suggests very early factors are associated with long-term experience of symptoms of depression and anxiety.",Biological psychiatry,2007 Dec 1,United States,2007,00
18063899,[The proposal of policies aimed at tackling health inequalities in Korea].,"Although the New National Health Promotion Plan 2010 target to reduce health inequalities, whether the program will be effective for reducing the health inequalities in Korea remains quite unclear. More and more developed countries have been started to concentrate on comprehensive policies for reducing health inequalities. The health policies of the UK, Netherlands, and Sweden are the most wellknown. I propose that a comprehensive blueprint for tackling health inequalities in Korea should be made and that it must contain five domains: a target, structure and process, life-course approach, area-based approach, and reorganization of health care resources. The target should be based on determinants of health and more attention should be paid to socioeconmic factors. The structure and process require changes from the national health care policy based on medical services to the national health policy that involves the establishment of a Social Deputy Prime Minister and the strengthening multidisciplinary action. A life-course approach especially focused on the early childhood years. Area-based approach such as the establishment of healthy communities, healthy schools, or healthy work-places which are focused on deprived areas or places is also required. Finally, health care resources should be a greater investment on public resources and strengthening primary care to reduce health inequalities. The policy or intervention studies for tackling health inequalities should be implemented much more in Korea. In addition, it is essential to have political will to encourage policy action.",Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,2007 Nov,Korea (South),2007,00

METHOD: A cross-sectional study of children aged 10 to 12 (n = 611) using paired matches of self-administered questionnaires for children and their mothers. Clinical examinations based on World Health Organization criteria were conduced. The participation rate was 97% (n = 591) for the children, 87% (n = 533) for the mothers, and 95% (n = 584) for the clinical examinations. Multiple linear regression, descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation coefficient and chi-square test were applied. RESULTS: Private school children's mothers were more likely to have had higher education (95% at least high school) than public school children's mothers (11%); they reported better dental health (above average) than did mothers of public school children (p = 0.001). Among all mothers, those with above average self-reported dental health reported more regular dental visits than did those with below average scores (p = 0.001). Frequency of regular dental visits and toothbrushing among children attending public schools (5%, 65%) were lower than those attending private school (43%, 79%), (p = 0.001). The mean DMFS was negatively correlated with self-reported dental health (r(s) = -0.187, p = 0.001). Toothbrushing frequency and school performance were the common factors positively associated with self-reported dental health, among all children. CONCLUSION: The results emphasize the important role of mothers and their socio-economic background in enhancement of children's dental health. Their active role in conjunction with the potential of self-assessment provides a good basis for establishing and improving self-care among children, in developing countries in particular.",Community dental health,2008 Jun,England,2008,00
11744499,Toxic threats to neurologic development of children.,"Learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental delays, and emotional and behavioral problems are among childhood disabilities of increasing concern. Interacting genetic, environmental, and social factors are important determinants of childhood brain development and function. For many reasons, however, studying neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities in children is challenging. Moreover, inadequate incidence and trend data interfere with full understanding of the magnitude of the problem. Despite these difficulties, extensive laboratory and clinical studies of several neurodevelopmental toxicants, including lead, mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, alcohol, and nicotine, demonstrate the unique vulnerability of the developing brain to environmental agents at exposure levels that have no lasting effect in adults. Historically, understanding the effects of these toxicants on the developing brain has emerged slowly while generations of children are exposed to unsafe levels. Unfortunately, with few exceptions, neurodevelopmental toxicity data are missing for most industrial chemicals in widespread use, even when populationwide exposures are documented. The personal, family, and communitywide costs of developmental disabilities are profound. In addition to the need for more research, a preventive public health response requires mitigation of exposures to potential neurodevelopmental toxicants when available evidence establishes the plausibility of harm, despite residual toxicologic uncertainties.",Environmental health perspectives,2001 Dec,United States,2001,00
12910464,Characteristics of reproductive biology and proximate factors regulating seasonal breeding in captive golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas).,"Reproduction is highly demanding in terms of energy expenditure, and the costs and benefits associated with postponing or investing in a reproductive effort are crucial determinants of an individual's fitness. Understanding the reproductive potential of a species under varying ecological conditions offers important insights into the dynamics of its social system. This study provides the first detailed analysis of the reproductive potential of wild- and captive-born golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) under captive conditions, based on studbook data compiled during 1984-2000. Litters produced by wild-born females breeding in captivity are similar in size to litters observed in the wild, but smaller than litters of captive-born females. The more stringent ecological conditions experienced by wild-born females during maturation may result in a lifelong effect on litter size. However, interbirth intervals are shorter for wild-born than captive-born females. The relatively smaller burden of infant care that results from having smaller litters may allow wild-born females to sustain the next pregnancy sooner. Reproduction in the Brazilian captive population is highly seasonal for both wild-born females and females born in captivity in Brazil. Changes in photoperiod over a year provide a proximate explanation for changes in the proportion of conceptions and births per month. Outside Brazil, breeding occurs year-round, and no clear birth peak is apparent. Information from field reports that could be used to relate this finding to ecological factors, such as resource availability, is unavailable.",American journal of primatology,2003 Aug,United States,2003,00
16704332,Untangling social function and social cognition: a review of concepts and measurement.,"Over the past few decades, there has been increasing interest in the study of social impairment in schizophrenia. However, the concept of social functioning has been poorly defined in the literature. This article highlights the global and multi-factorial nature of social functioning and reviews the theoretical determinants of social dysfunction in schizophrenia. Emphasis is placed on outlining the social cognitive deficits that may occur. The study of social cognition appears particularly promising in elucidating our understanding of the development of social impairment in schizophrenia and has the potential to improve current psychosocial interventions. However, continued advances depend upon the existence of reliable and well-validated measures of social functioning and social cognition. A selection of measures are reviewed in this article in an attempt to highlight the importance of assessing multiple aspects of social functioning in schizophrenia and to assist researchers in the selection of appropriate measures. Future efforts should be directed towards the continued validation of social functioning and social cognitive measures and their adaptation for use in at-risk and early psychosis populations.",Psychiatry,2006 Spring,United States,2006,00
11393320,Identifying determinants of nations' wetland management programs using structural equation modeling: an exploratory analysis.,"Integrated management and policy models suggest that solutions to environmental issues may be linked to the socioeconomic and political characteristics of a nation. In this study, we empirically explore these suggestions by applying them to the wetland management activities of nations. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate a model of national wetland management effort and one of national wetland protection. Using five predictor variables of social capital, economic capital, environmental and political characteristics, and land-use pressure, the multivariate models were able to explain 60% of the variation in nations' wetland protection efforts based on data from 90 nations, as defined by level of participation in the international wetland convention. Social capital had the largest direct effect on wetland protection efforts, suggesting that increased social development may eventually lead to better wetland protection. In contrast, increasing economic development had a negative linear relationship with wetland protection efforts, suggesting the need for explicit wetland protection programs as nations continue to focus on economic development. Government, environmental characteristics, and land-use pressure also had a positive direct effect on wetland protection, and mediated the effect of social capital on wetland protection. Explicit wetland protection policies, combined with a focus on social development, would lead to better wetland protection at the national level.",Environmental management,2001 Jun,United States,2001,00
12611426,Social and cultural considerations in recovery from anorexia nervosa: a critical poststructuralist analysis.,"New directives in health care research challenge researchers to move analysis beyond that of the individual and focus on social, cultural, and historical processes as interrelated determinants of health and illness. Adhering to a poststructuralist methodology, this article moves the analytic focus beyond individualistic narratives and into social and cultural discourses concerning recovery from anorexia nervosa. This study focused on social and cultural assumptions identified, seemingly as a paradox, through accounts articulated by young women who are in recovery or have recovered from anorexia nervosa. By theorizing outside of an individualized framework, it is possible to foreground the relationships between individualism, health, self-surveillance, women, the body, and the notion of recovery from anorexia.",ANS.

10832576,Heterogeneity in the determinants of health and illness: the example of socioeconomic status and smoking.,"Systematic variations in health and illness among social groups have persisted and, in some cases increased, in many countries in spite of improvements in the availability of, and access to, health care services. Health policy makers have responded by showing increasing interest in non-clinical determinants of health as a way of explaining the observed systematic variations in health and illness. Yet health care and non-health care ""factors"" are often seen as competing for society's scarce resources in the production of health. The purpose of this paper is to augment this traditional approach to understanding the determinants of health in populations by exploring heterogeneity in the smoking-health relationship between social groups. Logistic regression analyses were performed using data from the 1992-93 Sante Quebec survey, a weighted random sample of the non-institutionalized population of the province of Quebec, Canada (N = 23,564). The findings suggest that the likelihood of reporting health as poor or fair was greater for smokers than non-smokers. However, the difference between smokers and non-smokers was significantly greater among groups of the population with low incomes and without employment, but significantly less among sub-groups with lower levels of education. These findings suggest that the identification, evaluation and implementation of health care programmes need to pay greater attention to the interface between social, behavioural and clinical determinants of health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2000 Jul,England,2000,00
11796086,Socio-economic determinants of selected dietary indicators in British pre-school children.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the proportion of pre-school children meeting reference nutrient intakes (RNIs) and recommendations for daily intakes of iron, zinc, vitamins C and A, and energy from non-milk extrinsic sugars. To assess whether meeting these five dietary requirements was related to a series of socio-economic variables. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data on daily consumption of foods and drinks from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) of children aged 1.5-4.5 years based on 4-day weighed intakes. SUBJECTS: One thousand six hundred and seventy-five British pre-school children aged 1.5-4.5 years in 1993. RESULTS: Only 1% of children met all five RNIs/recommendations examined; 76% met only two or fewer. Very few children met the recommendations for intakes of zinc (aged over four years) and non-milk extrinsic sugars (all ages). The number of RNIs/recommendations met was related to measures of socio-economic class. Children from families in Scotland and the North of England, who had a manual head of household and whose mothers had fewest qualifications, met the least number of RNIs/recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Very few pre-school children have diets that meet all the RNIs and recommendations for iron, zinc, vitamins C and A, and energy from non-milk extrinsic sugars. Dietary adequacy with respect to these five parameters is related to socio-economic factors. The findings emphasise the need for a range of public health policies that focus upon the social and economic determinants of food choice within families.",Public health nutrition,2001 Dec,England,2001,00
12162837,[Inequities in access to information and inequities in health].,"This piece presents evidence that inequities in information are an important determinant of health inequities and that eliminating these inequities in access to information, especially by using new information and communication technologies (ICTs), could represent a significant advance in terms of guaranteeing the right to health for all. The piece reviews the most important international scientific research findings on the determinants of the health of populations, emphasizing the role of socioeconomic inequities and of deteriorating social capital as factors that worsen health conditions. It is noteworthy that Latin America has both socioeconomic inequities and major sectors of the population living in poverty. Among the fundamental strategies for overcoming the inequalities and the poverty are greater participation by the poor in civic life and the strengthening of social capital. The contribution that the new ICTs could make to these strategies is analyzed, and the Virtual Health Library (VHL) is discussed. Coordinated by the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME), the VHL is a contribution by the Pan American Health Organization that takes advantage of the potential of ICTs to democratize information and knowledge and consequently promote equity in health. The ""digital gap"" is discussed as something that can produce inequity itself and also increase other inequities, including ones in health. Prospects are discussed for overcoming this gap, emphasizing the role that governments and international organizations should play in order to expand access to the global public good that information for social development is.",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,2002 May-Jun,United States,2002,00
18971796,Epidemiology of STD disparities in African American communities.,"This article reviews the epidemiology of sexually transmitted disease (STD) disparities for African American communities in the United States. Data are reviewed from a variety of sources such as national case reporting and population-based studies. Data clearly show a disproportionately higher burden of STDs in African American communities compared with white communities. Although disparities exist for both viral and bacterial STDs, disparities are greatest for bacterial STDs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. Gonorrhea rates among African Americans are highest for adolescents and young adults, and disparities are greatest for adolescent men. Although disparities for men who have sex with men (MSM) are not as great as for heterosexual populations, STD rates for both white and African American MSM populations are high, so efforts to address disparities must also include African American MSM. Individual risk behavior and sociodemographic characteristics of African Americans do not seem to account fully for increased STD rates for African Americans. Population-level determinants such as sexual networks seem to play an important role in STD disparities. An understanding of the epidemiology of STD disparities is critical for identifying appropriate strategies and tailoring strategies for African American communities. Active efforts are needed to reduce not only the physical consequences of STDs, such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, newborn disease, and increased risk of HIV infection, but also the social consequences of STDs such as economic burden, shame, and stigma.",Sexually transmitted diseases,2008 Dec,United States,2008,00
25136398,Corporate social responsibility in countries with mature and emerging pharmaceutical sectors.,"UNLABELLED: In recent decades the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been adopted by many business sectors, including the pharmaceutical industry. However, in this and other sectors its application remains variable, particularly between mature and developing economies. Its stakeholders include pharmacy and medical students, their attitude to the involvement of companies in socially responsible activities will be important determinants of public response to the industry. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of senior medical and pharmacy students towards the CSR concept in the pharmaceutical sector in mature (Germany) and developing (Russia) markets. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was carried out among senior pharmacy and medical students during the summer semester 2008 in two Russian and one German university. In each country 120 questionnaires were distributed. The response rate was 95% in Russia and 93% in Germany. RESULTS: Although the relevance of CSR was widely acknowledged by the students, very few were aware of CSR practices currently performed by companies. THE REPUTATION OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WAS GENERALLY POOR: less than 15% of respondents gave credence to the information provided in advertisements and fully supported pricing strategies as well as policies towards the developing countries. When choosing an employer more than 90% of respondents consider the policies affecting an employee directly as pivotal. However, for a high proportion of students (59% in Russia and 64% in Germany) socially irresponsible behavior by companies has a significant negative impact. CONCLUSIONS: This paper identifies practices which students believe should be a part of the CSR programmes for the pharmaceutical industry, and also some that should be abandoned. It recommends that corporate communication on CSR should be expanded. Key differences are seen in perceptions of students in Germany and Russia towards the extent of irresponsible actions and the variation between them.",Pharmacy practice,2009 Oct,Spain,2009,00
18036211,"Family structure and health, how companionship acts as a buffer against ill health.","BACKGROUND: Health and well-being are the result of synergistic interactions among a variety of determinants. Family structure and composition are social determinants that may also affect health behaviours and outcomes. This study was performed to examine the associations between family structure and health and to determine the protective effects of support mechanisms to improve quality of health outcome. METHODS: Six hundred people, selected by multistage sampling to obtain a representative population of men and women aged 20-60 living in communities in Japan, were included in this study. Data regarding subjective views of one's own health, family structure, lifestyle and social support were collected through structured face-to-face interviews on home visits. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, height and weight were measured by trained examiners. The associations between family structure and health after controlling for demographics, lifestyle and social support were examined using logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Subjects living alone were significantly more likely to be in ill health, as determined using the General Health Questionnaire, in comparison to those in extended families (OR = 3.14). Subjects living alone or as couples were significantly more likely to suffer from severe hypertension in comparison to those living in extended families (OR = 8.25, OR = 4.90). These associations remained after controlling for the influence of lifestyle. Subjects living only with spouse or in nuclear family had higher probabilities of mental ill health in the absence than in the presence of people showing concern for their well-being. CONCLUSION: The results of this study infers that a support mechanism consisting of companionship and the presence of family or other people concerned for one's well being acts as a buffer against deleterious influence of living in small family that will lead to improved quality of health outcome.",Health and quality of life outcomes,2007 Nov 23,England,2007,00
12379153,Measuring total health inequality: adding individual variation to group-level differences.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have revealed large variations in average health status across social, economic, and other groups. No study exists on the distribution of the risk of ill-health across individuals, either within groups or across all people in a society, and as such a crucial piece of total health inequality has been overlooked. Some of the reason for this neglect has been that the risk of death, which forms the basis for most measures, is impossible to observe directly and difficult to estimate. METHODS: We develop a measure of total health inequality - encompassing all inequalities among people in a society, including variation between and within groups - by adapting a beta-binomial regression model. We apply it to children under age two in 50 low- and middle-income countries. Our method has been adopted by the World Health Organization and is being implemented in surveys around the world; preliminary estimates have appeared in the World Health Report (2000). RESULTS: Countries with similar average child mortality differ considerably in total health inequality. Liberia and Mozambique have the largest inequalities in child survival, while Colombia, the Philippines and Kazakhstan have the lowest levels among the countries measured. CONCLUSIONS: Total health inequality estimates should be routinely reported alongside average levels of health in populations and groups, as they reveal important policy-related information not otherwise knowable. This approach enables meaningful comparisons of inequality across countries and future analyses of the determinants of inequality.",International journal for equity in health,2002 Aug 12,England,2002,00
19395132,Malnutrition and epilepsy: a two-way relationship.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: A link between malnutrition and epilepsy has been suspected for many years. METHODS: Different aspects of the question were studied with a review of previous published data. RESULTS: Several studies performed on animal models or humans highlight the possible adverse effects of malnutrition in the onset of seizures. Protein-energy, electrolyte, vitamin or trace element deficiencies may be involved. Conversely, several determinants of epilepsy could lead to malnutrition: food taboos and social exclusion in developing countries as well as some adverse effects of antiepileptic treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Two different hypotheses exist as a vicious circle: malnutrition predisposing to epilepsy or epilepsy predisposing to malnutrition. A better understanding of these interactions is necessary. In the mean time, malnutrition has to be prevented and treated.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2009 Jun,England,2009,00
15808930,Psychological determinants of the cortisol stress response: the role of anticipatory cognitive appraisal.,"Psychosocial stress is a potent activator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. While the physiological mechanisms of HPA axis responses to stress as well as its short and long-term consequences have been extensively examined, less is known why someone elicits an acute neuroendocrine stress response, i.e. what are the psychological processes involved and how are they related to the acute neuroendocrine stress response. To examine this question, a questionnaire to assess anticipatory cognitive appraisal processes was developed and administered to 81 male healthy subjects in a standardized psychosocial stress situation (Trier social stress test). Cortisol stress responses were assessed with repeated measurement of salivary free cortisol. Hierarchical regression analyses show that anticipatory cognitive appraisal, in contrast to general personality factors and retrospective stress appraisal is an important determinant of the cortisol stress response, explaining up to 35% of the variance of the salivary cortisol response. The reported results emphasize the importance of psychological stress processing for the understanding of psychobiological stress responses. Since stress and its biological consequences have been shown to be associated with the onset and the maintenance of somatic illnesses and psychiatric disorders, psychological processes are prime targets for prevention and intervention.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2005 Jul,England,2005,00
18701897,Epidemiology and the macrosocial determinants of health.,"In the past two decades, public health researchers have taken renewed interest in investigating the role of social factors in health. This holds substantial promise in terms of identifying manipulable social factors that are amenable to policy intervention. Most existing empirical and conceptual epidemiologic work, however, has focused on the more proximal social determinants, such as interpersonal relations. These factors, although perhaps easier to study epidemiologically, are much less relevant to policy makers than more ""macrosocial"" factors such as taxation policies. Limited epidemiologic attention to macrosocial determinants of health is ironic given that macrosocial factors such as the rapid industrialization and urbanization in the 19th century contributed to the organization of public health practice and, tangentially, to academic public health research. We suggest here that greater investment in the study of macrosocial determinants has the potential to make a significant and unique contribution to the greater public health agenda and should be a prominent aspect of social epidemiologic inquiry in the coming decades.",Journal of public health policy,2008 Sep,England,2008,00
19682135,"The epidemiology of dependence in older people in Nigeria: prevalence, determinants, informal care, and health service utilization. A 10/66 dementia research group cross-sectional survey.","OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and determinants of dependence in older Nigerians and associations with informal care and health service utilization. DESIGN: A single-phase cross-sectional catchment area survey. SETTING: Dunukofia, a rural community in southeastern Nigeria. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand two hundred thirty-eight adults aged 65 and older, for whom full data were available on 914. MEASUREMENTS: The full 10/66 Dementia Research Group survey protocol was applied, including ascertainment of depression, cognitive impairment, physical impairments, and self-reported diagnoses. The interviewer rated dependence as not needing care, needing some care, or needing much care. The prevalence of dependence and the independent contribution of underlying health conditions were estimated. Sources of income, care arrangements, caregiver strain, and health service use are described according to level of dependence. RESULTS: The prevalence of dependence was 24.3% (95% confidence interval=22.1-26.5%), with a concentration in participants aged 80 and older. Only 1% of participants received a pension, and fewer than 7% had paid work. Those who were dependent were less likely than others to receive income from their family. Cognitive impairment, physical impairments, stroke, and depression were each independently associated with dependence. Depression made the largest contribution. Dependence was strongly associated with health service use (particularly private doctor and traditional healer services) and with high levels of out-of-pocket expenditure. CONCLUSION: In Nigeria, dependence is an important outcome given rapid demographic aging and increases in chronic disease prevalence in all developing regions. Enhancing the social protection of dependent older adults should be a policy priority. Cognitive and mental disorders are important contributors to disability and dependence; more attention should be given to their prevention, detection, and treatment.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2009 Sep,United States,2009,00
16953956,Factors related to perceived power usage in schools.,"Based on Raven's (1992) power interaction model, situational and personal variables were examined as determinants of power choice in educational settings. The impact of educational sector (secular, religious), class level, gender and content of conflict on perceived power usage in teacher-pupil conflicts was analysed. A total of 370 elementary and junior high school pupils and 62 teachers from the same schools responded to a series of scenarios where they were asked how often specific power bases are used by teachers in trying to gain compliance. Results indicated that harsh power bases were perceived as more prevalent in the secular educational sector rather than in the religious one, in junior high school rather than elementary school, for boys as compared with girls, and for conflicts stemming from students rather than teachers. Findings were interpreted in terms of conformity level and frequency of conflicts. The discussion also addresses the lack of correspondence between teacher and pupil responses.",The British journal of educational psychology,2006 Sep,England,2006,00
16516062,Patients with a psychiatric disorder in general practice: determinants of general practitioners' psychological diagnosis.,"BACKGROUND: Although psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent in the community, many patients with a psychiatric morbidity remain unidentified as such in primary care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze which clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of patients with psychiatric morbidity are related to general practitioners' (GPs) diagnosis of mental illness. METHODS: A 1-year naturalistic survey of primary care contacts of patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of affective disorder, anxiety disorder or alcohol abuse was carried out. RESULTS: Of the patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis, 10% did not visit their GP at all during 1 year, 40% visited their GP but were only diagnosed as having somatic diagnoses and 50% were given a psychological or social diagnosis at least once during 1 year. Affective disorders are more frequently diagnosed than anxiety disorders or alcohol abuse. The chances of psychological GP diagnosis increase with the number of GP contacts. CONCLUSIONS: GPs appear to have few indications to help them distinguish patients with a psychiatric morbidity from others, as long as the patients themselves do not express more explicit clues to their condition. Public mental health education and a better public relations policy are badly needed.",General hospital psychiatry,2006 Mar-Apr,United States,2006,00
19240981,"Conceptualizing the integration of HIV treatment and prevention: findings from a process evaluation of a community-based, national capacity-building intervention.","OBJECTIVE: This paper responds to a gap in knowledge about the conceptualization of integration in community-based AIDS organizations (CBAOs). METHODS: A community-based process evaluation was conducted of a national intervention, developed by the Canadian AIDS Treatment Information Exchange (CATIE), to enhance treatment information provision in CBAOs and encourage its integration with prevention services. Our study involved 13 interviews with intervention participants in 6 CBAOs across Canada, CATIE staff, and funders, as well as a 25-person verification exercise. RESULTS: Intervention participants conceptualized integration as linking front-line HIV treatment, health promotion and prevention services, emphasizing mediation between scientific and lay knowledge, the political context of integration and the role of social determinants in clients' health and access to services. Challenges to integration include high staff turnover and inflexible funding structures. Complex health education related to the relationship between viral load and HIV transmission is a critical area of integrated service delivery. CONCLUSION: Study findings help distinguish a community-based concept of HIV-related integration from alternative uses of the term while pointing out key tensions associated with efforts to integrate HIV prevention and treatment in a community-based context.",International journal of public health,2009,Switzerland,2009,00
12614539,Paradigms of health and disease: a framework for classifying and understanding complementary and alternative medicine.,"The number of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) being utilized by North America health care consumers is growing at an astounding rate. There is a need by both health care providers and consumers to categorize CAM in order to make meaningful comparisons and informed decisions on their use. Four paradigms of health and illness are proposed that classify medicines according to the basic assumptions of health and disease associated with each medicine. CAMs classified in the body paradigm are those that work through biologic mechanisms, or in other words, target biologic factors as the primary determinants of health. The mind-body paradigm extends the body paradigm to include factors such as stress, psychologic coping styles, and social supports as primary determinants of health and disease. The body-energy paradigm assumes health and disease are functions of the flow and balances of life energies. The body-spirit paradigm assumes that one or more transcendental aspects or personalities existing outside the limitations of the material universe can influence health and disease. It is postulated that there is a hierarchical relation among the four paradigms, such that each paradigm essentially subsumes the assumptions of the previous ones, but adds additional assumptions that qualify the previous ones. Implications of this framework for clarifying many contemporary issues in health care are discussed.","Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)",2002 Dec,United States,2002,00
18259901,Feto - maternal haemorrhage in parturients: Incidence and its determinants.,"This prospective study of parturients at a tertiary health institution in south-western Nigeria aims to identify the incidence, severity and obstetric factors predisposing to feto - maternal haemorrhage (FMH) in our population. The exclusion criteria were haemoglobinopathy and patient's refusal of consent to participate in the study. The prepared slide was processed as in the acid elution test described by Kleihauer - Betke. The FMH was calculated using Mollison formula (Mollison 1972). Baseline data included maternal biodata, blood group, RhD and haemoglobin electrophoresis, route/mode of delivery, duration of labour, obstetric interventions, fetal blood group and birth weight. Data generated were analysed with Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) version 11 software. Frequency tables, cross-tabulations and correlations were performed. Pearson's correlation was applied to continuous variables, while Spearman's correlation was utilised for discrete variables. Level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. A total of 163 parturients were studied, of which eight were multifetal gestations. There were no significant differences in maternal age, parity, estimated gestational age at delivery and birth weight, in both groups of parturients with and without FMH. A total of 17 parturients (10.43%), four of which were multifetal gestations (2.45%), had demonstrable FMH. Large FMH (>15 ml fetal cells) were noted in 10 (6.14%) parturients, of which, four were RhD-negative mothers. A total of 9.8% and 11.5% parturients in the vaginal and caesarean delivery groups, respectively, had significant FMH (p = 0.736). Incidence of large FMH was similar with each of the routes of delivery. Antepartum complications of pregnancy, delivery manoeuvres and episiotomy were not significant determinants of FMH. Multiple gestations, fetal birth weight and complications in labour were significantly associated with risk of FMH. Risk-based approach to management, in RhD negative pregnant women, might lead to under-treatment, with attendant increased incidence of isoimmunisation. At least in all RhD-negative women, the cord blood should be tested to determine the baby's blood group and if RhD-positive, Kleihauer - Betke test should be done to determine the degree of FMH and anti-D immunoglobulin dose administered appropriately. Further studies are necessary to establish the determinants/risk factors for FMH.",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,2008 Jan,England,2008,00
18637319,Individual and maternal determinants of self-reported dental health among Turkish school children aged 10-12 years.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of maternal and individual characteristics on self-reported dental health of Turkish school children aged 10-12 years with different socio-economic backgrounds. METHOD: A cross-sectional study of children aged 10 to 12 (n = 611) using paired matches of self-administered questionnaires for children and their mothers. Clinical examinations based on World Health Organization criteria were conduced. The participation rate was 97% (n = 591) for the children, 87% (n = 533) for the mothers, and 95% (n = 584) for the clinical examinations. Multiple linear regression, descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation coefficient and chi-square test were applied. RESULTS: Private school children's mothers were more likely to have had higher education (95% at least high school) than public school children's mothers (11%); they reported better dental health (above average) than did mothers of public school children (p = 0.001). Among all mothers, those with above average self-reported dental health reported more regular dental visits than did those with below average scores (p = 0.001). Frequency of regular dental visits and toothbrushing among children attending public schools (5%, 65%) were lower than those attending private school (43%, 79%), (p = 0.001). The mean DMFS was negatively correlated with self-reported dental health (r(s) = -0.187, p = 0.001). Toothbrushing frequency and school performance were the common factors positively associated with self-reported dental health, among all children. CONCLUSION: The results emphasize the important role of mothers and their socio-economic background in enhancement of children's dental health. Their active role in conjunction with the potential of self-assessment provides a good basis for establishing and improving self-care among children, in developing countries in particular.",Community dental health,2008 Jun,England,2008,00
17332208,Has blood pressure increased in children in response to the obesity epidemic?,"The associations between elevated blood pressure and overweight, on one hand, and the increasing prevalence over time of pediatric overweight, on the other hand, suggest that the prevalence of elevated blood pressure could have increased in children over the last few decades. In this article we review the epidemiologic evidence available on the prevalence of elevated blood pressure in children and trends over time. On the basis of the few large population-based surveys available, the prevalence of elevated blood pressure is fairly high in several populations, whereas there is little direct evidence that blood pressure has increased during the past few decades despite the concomitant epidemic of pediatric overweight. However, a definite conclusion cannot be drawn yet because of the paucity of epidemiologic studies that have assessed blood pressure trends in the same populations and the lack of standardized methods used for the measurement of blood pressure and the definition of elevated blood pressure in children. Additional studies should examine if favorable secular trends in other determinants of blood pressure (eg, dietary factors, birth weight, etc) may have attenuated the apparently limited impact of the epidemic of overweight on blood pressure in children.",Pediatrics,2007 Mar,United States,2007,00
14678314,Frequency and determinants of formal respite service use among caregivers of children with cerebral palsy in Ontario.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of formal respite services among caregivers of children with cerebral palsy in Ontario and discuss the factors that may contribute to respite use and non-use. METHODS: A total of 468 caregivers were interviewed about their experience with formal respite services. Interviews were part of a larger cross-sectional study on caregiver health. Caregivers were asked about their knowledge of formal respite services; their use of formal respite services in the past year; financial implications relating to formal respite use; perceived barriers to formal respite service use; and reasons for not using formal respite services (if applicable). RESULTS: Nearly half (46%) of caregivers in the sample reported using respite services in the past year. Most of the caregivers who used respite services used more than one source of respite, had services provided in their home, often for less than 1 day, and reported using them more than six times. The most commonly cited reason for using formal respite services was for a planned break. Many factors influenced caregivers' use of formal respite services. Caregivers who had a child with a lower level of function, with multiple additional conditions, or who was male, were more likely to use formal respite services. Although over 90% of caregivers indicated that respite use is beneficial for both their family and child, over 60% reported facing many barriers while attempting to access respite services. CONCLUSION: Results from this cross-sectional study indicate that caregivers who used respite services used them frequently for breaks from caregiving. Caregivers described facing many barriers while attempting to access respite services therefore to improve caregiver's experience with respite services, strategies are suggested.","Child: care, health and development",2004 Jan,England,2004,00
15901197,Consumer mobility in social health insurance markets : a five-country comparison.,"During the 1990s, the social health insurance schemes of Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and Israel were significantly reformed by the introduction of freedom of choice (open enrolment) of health insurer. This was introduced alongside a system of risk adjustment to compensate health insurers for enrolees with predictable high medical expenses. Despite the similarity in the health insurance reforms in these countries, we find that both the rationale behind these reforms and their impact on consumer choice vary widely.In this article we seek to explain the observed variation in switching rates by cross-country comparison of the potential determinants of health insurer choice. We conclude that differences in choice setting, and in the net benefits of switching, offer a plausible explanation for the large differences in consumer mobility.Finally, we discuss the policy implications of our cross-country comparison. We argue that the optimal switching rate crucially depends on the goals of the reforms and the quality of the risk-adjustment system. In view of this, we conclude that switching rates are currently too low in the Netherlands, and an active government policy to encourage consumer mobility seems warranted. In Germany and Switzerland, high switching rates call for an improvement of the rather poor risk-adjustment systems. Given low switching rates in Israel and Belgium, improving risk adjustment is less urgent, but still required in the long run.",Applied health economics and health policy,2004,New Zealand,2004,00

In fact, this model was totally devoid of recent epidemiological, diagnostic, psychobiological, therapeutic knowledge, showing the multidimensional etiopathogenesis of mental disorders. In addition, the Law 180 conditioned the formation of clinical psychiatrists with this ""dogmatic"" reductionism with more emphasis on social aspects and less attention to clinical aspects and to non psychotic disorders.

This study examined the frequency and socio-demographic and clinical correlates of BZD prescription in Hong Kong (HK) and Beijing (BJ), China. METHODS: Five hundred and five clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia were randomly selected and interviewed in HK and BJ using standardized assessment instruments. Basic socio-demographic and clinical data and psychotropic drug prescriptions were collected at the time of a diagnostic interview. RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty one (29.9%) patients were prescribed BZDs in the whole sample; 25.1% and 34.8% of the HK and BJ samples, respectively. Use of BZDs was associated with sex, employment status, history of suicide, less use of clozapine, more frequent use of typical antipsychotics (APs), higher doses of APs, severity of positive symptoms, extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and insomnia. In multiple logistic regression analysis, severity of depressive symptoms, study site, sex, employment status, less use of clozapine and history of suicide remained significantly associated with BZDs. CONCLUSION: Although the ethnic and clinical characteristics of the two samples were nearly identical, there was a wide variation in the frequency of BZD prescriptions between HK and BJ suggesting that socio-cultural and economic factors as well as traditions of psychiatric training and practice all played a role in determining the use of BZDs. Prescription of BZDs in either site was not in line with current recommendation.",Pharmacopsychiatry,2007 Nov,Germany,2007,00
16494089,Work and family characteristics as determinants of socioeconomic and sex inequalities in sleep: The Japanese Civil Servants Study.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether socioeconomic and sex inequalities in poor sleep quality are explained by socioeconomic and sex differences in work and family characteristics. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand five hundred fifty-six employees (2397 men and 1159 women) aged 20 to 65 years in local government in Japan. MEASUREMENTS: Respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire that asked about sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; work characteristics, as measured by the job-demand-control-support model, work hours, and shift work; and family characteristics, such as family structure and family-work conflicts. RESULTS: Lower control at work, higher work demands, lower social support, shorter and longer working hours, shift work, being single, higher family-to-work conflict, and higher work-to-family conflict were independently associated with poorer sleep quality in both men and women. In men, the age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of low-grade employees for poor sleep quality was 1.64 (95% confidence interval: 1.14-2.36) in comparison with high-grade employees. The difference in sleep was attenuated when work and family characteristics were adjusted for (OR=1.25 [0.84-1.86]). Among women, there was no significant grade difference in sleep. Women tended to have poorer sleep quality than men (the age-adjusted OR=1.75 [1.49-2.06]). The sex difference was attenuated and no longer significant when adjustments were made for work and family characteristics (OR=1.04 [0.85-1.27]). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that work and family characteristics may be important for reducing socioeconomic and sex inequalities in sleep. Sex differences in the pattern of socioeconomic inequalities in sleep deserve further research.",Sleep,2006 Feb,United States,2006,00
12959869,The view from somewhere: locating lesbian experience in women's health.,"In some circles of nursing practice and research, ""women's health"" is seen to stand for ""women's reproductive and heterosexual health."" In this article we offer a view of women's health that makes central the contexualized reality of the material, social, and discursive experiences of women's lives. We suggest that the barriers to adopting broader conceptualizations of health are grounded in pervasive ideologies that privilege biology and a traditional model of health over nonmedical determinants of health. Lesbian disclosure is a central experience in lesbian life, and, as such, is seen as an exemplar of research questions that challenges our taken-for-granted ideologies and contextualizes women's health experiences.",Health care for women international,2003 Sep-Oct,England,2003,00
19161545,"Maternal autonomy is inversely related to child stunting in Andhra Pradesh, India.","Child stunting, an outcome of chronic undernutrition, contributes to poor quality of life, morbidity and mortality. In South Asia, the low status of women is thought to be one of the primary determinants of undernutrition across the lifespan. Low female status can result in compromised health outcomes for women, which in turn are related to lower infant birthweight and may affect the quality of infant care and nutrition. Maternal autonomy (defined as a woman's personal power in the household and her ability to influence and change her environment) is likely an important factor influencing child care and ultimately infant and child health outcomes. To examine the relationship between maternal autonomy and child stunting in Andhra Pradesh, India, we analysed data from National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-2. We used cross-sectional demographic, health and anthropometric information for mothers and their oldest child <36 months (n = 821) from NFHS-2. The main explanatory variables of autonomy are presented by four dimensions - decision making, permission to travel, attitude towards domestic violence and financial autonomy - constructed using seven binary variables. Logistic regression models were used to test associations between indicators of female autonomy and the risk of having a stunted child. Women with higher autonomy {indicated by access to money [odds ratio (OR) = 0.731; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.546, 0.981] and freedom to choose to go to the market [OR = 0.593; 95% CI 0.376, 0.933]} were significantly less likely to have a stunted child, after controlling for household socio-economic status and mother's education. In this south Indian state, two dimensions of female autonomy have an independent effect on child growth, suggesting the need for interventions that increase women's financial and physical autonomy.",Maternal & child nutrition,2009 Jan,England,2009,00

The authors conducted two focal groups at construction sites in the city of Rio de Janeiro to analyze four educational materials, employing thematic analysis. The article presents the workers' perspective on the themes discussed in the leaflets, classified in two groups of meaning: health and social control. They go on to discuss how workers' display an expanded vision of health to the extent that it includes social determinants of the health-disease process. The study identified the workers' limited participation in work-process surveillance activities and their lack of knowledge concerning workers' health measures adopted by the Ministry of Health. The authors conclude that the analysis of educational materials by their target public represents a privileged place for negotiating meanings and grasping ways of life in specific groups. They suggest educational activities using leaflets as a means to motivate critical analysis of the health-disease process.",Cadernos de saude publica,2006 May,Brazil,2006,00
16115285,"Changing patterns of inequality in birthweight and its determinants: a population-based study, Scotland 1980-2000.","Birthweight is used as an indicator of individual and population health and is known to be strongly correlated with adult cardiovascular disease. This paper uses routinely collected maternity discharge data from Scotland between 1980 and 2000 to look at birthweight trends and the changes in the distribution of maternal risk factors for birthweight. We also examine the contributions of each of the risk factors to birthweight trends and investigate whether there has been a reduction in inequality in birthweight over time. Data from 1,282,172 singleton live births were used in the analysis. Both mean birthweight and low birthweight (LBW:<2500 g) were used as outcomes. The risk factors studied were maternal age, parity, maternal height, marital status and occupational social class of the father. The slope and relative indices of inequality were used to measure the change in inequalities over time. Mean birthweight increased from 3320 g in 1980 to 3410 g in 2000, while the percentage LBW decreased slightly from 5.7% in 1980 to 5.4% in 2000. The prevalence of many risk factors changed; there has been an increase in the proportion of older mothers, single mothers, taller mothers and mothers with undetermined social class. Although most risk factors had a significant change in effect over time, the inequalities in birthweight between groups did not appear to diminish over time. Both the slope and relative index of inequality had a quadratic relationship over time, with the inequalities in birthweight being greatest in the early 1980s and late 1990s.",Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,2005 Sep,England,2005,00

STUDY DESIGN: The study consisted of a cross-sectional analysis of county-level data stratified by MSA and non-MSA areas in 1990. Dependent variables included age and sex-standardized (per 100,000) all-cause, heart disease and cancer mortality. Independent variables included primary care resources, income inequality, education levels, unemployment, racial/ethnic composition and income levels. METHODS: One-way analysis of variance and multivariate ordinary least squares regression were employed for each health outcome. RESULTS: Among non-MSA counties, those in the highest income inequality category experienced 11% higher all-cause mortality, 9% higher heart disease mortality, and 9% higher cancer mortality than counties in the lowest income inequality quartile, while controlling for other health determinants. Non-MSA counties with higher primary care experienced 2% lower all-cause mortality, 4% lower heart disease mortality, and 3% lower cancer mortality than non-MSA counties with lower primary care. MSA counties with median levels of income inequality experienced approximately 6% higher all-cause mortality, 7% higher heart disease mortality, and 7% higher cancer mortality than counties in the lowest income inequality quartile. MSA counties with low primary care (less than 75th percentile) had significantly lower levels of all-cause, heart disease and cancer mortality than those counties with high primary care. CONCLUSIONS: In non-MSA counties, increasing primary physician supply could be one way to address the health needs of rural populations. In MSA counties, the association between primary care and health outcomes appears to be more complex and is likely to require intervention that focuses on multiple fronts.",Public health,2005 Aug,Netherlands,2005,00
10813470,Economic impact of febrile morbidity and use of permethrin-impregnated bed nets in a malarious area II. Determinants of febrile episodes and the cost of their treatment and malaria prevention.,"The objective of this study is to determine the effect of permethrin insecticide-treated bed net (PITN) use on the incidence of febrile episodes and on household malaria expenses in Benin. Over the course of one year, 208 randomly selected PITN user and non-user households were visited weekly to determine expenditures on febrile morbidity and its treatment, and to monitor spending on malaria prevention. Multivariate analyses were performed to distinguish the effects of PITN use from other important determinants of morbidity, such as malaria-related beliefs and practices, income, and other socio-economic variables. Results from the logistic regression analysis show that the use of PITNs decreases the risk of febrile episodes by 34% in children living in the rural zone. Multiple regression analysis reveals that PITN use does not reduce prevention and treatment expenses. These expenses are significantly associated with women's income. This report also discusses other factors associated with febrile morbidity and malaria-related expenditures.",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2000 Feb,United States,2000,00

DESIGN: Observational study using qualitative research methods. SETTING: The postnatal and gynaecology wards of a large government hospital in Kampala, Uganda. SAMPLE: Thirty women who had narrowly avoided maternal deaths with diagnoses of obstructed labour (7), severe pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (3), post caesarean infection (6), haemorrhage (5), ectopic pregnancy (5) and septic abortion (4). METHODS: The semi-structured interviews were conducted in the local language by a woman unconnected to the hospital, and were recorded before being translated and transcribed. Analysis was conducted in duplicate using commercial software. RESULTS: The predominant theme was powerlessness, which occurred both within and outside the hospital. It was evident in the women's attempts to get both practical and financial help from those around them as well as in their failure to gain rapid access to care. Financial barriers and problems with transport primarily governed health-seeking behaviour. Medical mistakes and delays in referral were evident in many interviews, especially in rural health centres. Women were appreciative of the care they received from the central government hospital, although there were reports of overcrowding, long delays, shortages and inhumane care. There were no reports of bribery. CONCLUSIONS: Women with near-miss maternal mortalities experience institutional and social powerlessness: these factors may be a major contributor to maternal mortality.",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,2005 Sep,England,2005,00
16981446,Psychological determinants of behaviors leading to occupational injuries and diseases in agriculture: a literature overview.,"Agriculture is one of the most hazardous occupational sectors, with a high prevalence of occupational injuries and work-related health problems. Most of these problems are caused by the interplay of human behavior and ergonomic factors and are thus preventable. Interventions to prevent occupational injuries and diseases among agricultural workers should aim to change risk behaviors and conditions by addressing specific behavioral determinants. To identify these factors, social cognitive models can be use that explain and predict health-related behavior. This study reviews the literature on the application of social cognitive models for the prevention of occupational injuries and diseases among agricultural workers. Studies are reviewed that apply the Health Belief Model, Theory of ReasonedAction, Theory of Planned Behavior, Transtheoretical Model of Change, or their subcomponents, to predict or change preventive behavior. Only a limited number of studies were found describing interventions that make use of these models, and those that do are often poorly documented with regard to the effect sizes and the explanatory or predictive value. It is concluded that the application of social cognitive models could significantly contribute to the effectiveness of preventive interventions in agriculture.",Journal of agricultural safety and health,2006 Aug,United States,2006,00

Diagnosis, psychological evaluation, and management.","Ten male pseudohermaphrodites with 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 (17 beta-HSD3) deficiency were evaluated in 1 clinic with an average follow-up of 10.1 years. The diagnoses were made by demonstrating low to normal serum testosterone levels, high androstenedione levels, and high ratios of serum androstenedione to testosterone in the basal state or after treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin. The molecular features of the underlying mutations were identified in all 7 families. Two additional males in the same families are believed to be affected on the basis of history obtained from family members. All of the 46,XY individuals in these families were registered at birth and raised as females (despite the presence of ambiguous genitalia in all or most), and all virilized after the time of expected puberty due to a rise in serum testosterone to or toward the normal male range. The age at diagnosis varied from 4 to 37 years. Ten individuals were studied by the same psychologist, and change of gender role (social sex) from female to male occurred in 3 subjects and in the 2 presumed affected subjects not studied. The individual with the highest serum testosterone level maintained female sexual identity, and in 2 families some of the affected males changed gender role and others did not. Thus, while androgen action plays a role in the process, additional undefined psychological, social, and/or biologic factors must be determinants of gender identity/role behavior. Management of the 7 individuals who chose to maintain female sex roles included castration, clitoroplasty, vaginal enlargement procedures when appropriate, treatment of hirsutism, cricoid cartilage reduction, and estrogen replacement. Three of the 7 are married (2 twice), 1 is involved in a long-term heterosexual relationship, 1 is engaged to be married, and the other 2 are not married and not believed to be sexually active. The 3 subjects who changed gender role behavior to male underwent hypospadias repair, and 1 was given supplemental testosterone therapy. One of these men is divorced, and the other 2 (aged 29 and 35 years) are unmarried. The diagnosis in 8 of these subjects was made after the time of expected puberty; it is unclear whether the functional and social outcomes would have been different if the diagnosis had been made and therapy begun earlier in life.",Medicine,2000 Sep,United States,2000,00

19252786,Health status in non-dystrophic myotonias: close relation with pain and fatigue.,"To determine self-reported health status in non-dystrophic myotonias (NDM) and its relationship to painful myotonia and fatigue. In a cross-sectional study, 32 NDM patients with chloride and 30 with sodium channelopathies, all off treatment, completed a standardised interview, the fatigue assessment scale (FAS), and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Beside formal assessment of pain, assessment of painful or painless myotonia was determined. The domain scores of the SF-36 were compared with Dutch community scores. Apart from the relationship among SF-36 scores and (1) painful myotonia and (2) fatigue, regression analyses in both NDM groups were conducted to determine the strongest determinants of the SF-36 domains general health perception, physical component (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). All physically oriented SF-36 domains in both NDM groups (P <or= 0.01) and social functioning in the patients with sodium channelopathies (P = 0.048) were substantially lower relative to the Dutch community scores. The patients with painful myotonia (41.9%) scored substantially (P < 0.05) lower on most SF-36 domains than the patients without painful myotonia (58.1%). Fatigued patients (53.2%) scored substantially lower (P <or= 0.01) on all SF-36 domains than their non-fatigued counterparts (46.8%). The regression analysis showed that fatigue was the strongest predictor for the general-health perception and painful myotonia for the physical-component summary. None of the patients showed below-norm scores on the domain mental-component summary. The impact of NDM on the physical domains of patients' health status is substantial, and particularly painful myotonia and fatigue tend to impede their physical functioning.",Journal of neurology,2009 Jun,Germany,2009,00
18433488,Addressing diarrhea prevalence in the West African Middle Belt: social and geographic dimensions in a case study for Benin.,"BACKGROUND: In West Africa, the Northern Sahelian zone and the coastal areas are densely populated but the Middle Belt in between is in general sparsely settled. Predictions of climate change foresee more frequent drought in the north and more frequent flooding in the coastal areas, while conditions in the Middle Belt will remain moderate. Consequently, the Middle Belt might become a major area for immigration but there may be constraining factors as well, particularly with respect to water availability. As a case study, the paper looks into the capacity of the Middle Belt zone of Benin, known as the Oueme River Basin (ORB), to reduce diarrhea prevalence. In Benin it links to the Millennium Development Goals on child mortality and environmental sustainability that are currently farthest from realization. However, diarrhea prevalence is only in part due to lack of availability of drinking water from a safe source. Social factors such as hygienic practices and poor sanitation are also at play. Furthermore, we consider these factors to possess the properties of a local public good that suffers from under provision and requires collective action, as individual actions to prevent illness are bound to fail as long as others free ride. METHODS: Combining data from the Demographic Health Survey with various spatial data sets for Benin, we apply mixed effect logit regression to arrive at a spatially explicit assessment of geographical and social determinants of diarrhea prevalence. Starting from an analysis of these factors separately at national level, we identify relevant proxies at household level, estimate a function with geo-referenced independent variables and apply it to evaluate the costs and impacts of improving access to good water in the basin. RESULTS: First, the study confirms the well established stylized fact on the causes of diarrhea that a household with access to clean water and with good hygienic practices will, irrespective of other conditions, not suffer diarrhea very often. Second, our endogeneity tests show that joint estimation performs better than an instrumental variable regression. Third, our model is stable with respect to its functional form, as competing specifications could not achieve better performance in overall likelihood or significance of parameters. Fourth, it finds that the richer and better educated segments of the population suffer much less from the disease and apparently can secure safe water for their households, irrespective of where they live. Fifth, regarding geographical causes, it indicates that diarrhea prevalence varies with groundwater availability and quality across Benin. Finally, our assessment of costs and benefits reveals that improving physical access to safe water is not expensive but can only marginally improve the overall health situation of the basin, unless the necessary complementary measures are taken in the social sphere. CONCLUSION: The ORB provides adequate water resources to accommodate future settlers but it lacks appropriate infrastructure to deliver safe water to households. Moreover, hygienic practices are often deficient. Therefore, a multifaceted approach is needed that acknowledges the public good aspects of health situation and consequently combines collective action with investments into water sources with improved management of public wells and further educational efforts to change hygienic practices.",International journal of health geographics,2008 Apr 23,England,2008,00

17034317,"Demographic, habitual, and socioeconomic determinants of Internet addiction disorder: an empirical study of Korean teenagers.","The objective of this study was to analyze the demographic, socioeconomic, and habitual causes of juvenile Internet addiction. All do not agree that Internet addiction disorder (IAD) is a new type of addiction, but they agree that the IAD phenomenon has widely spread over recent years. This is also true in Korea. For this study, six schools in Korea were selected to collect data: two from Seoul, two from suburban areas, and two from rural areas. Two hundred and forty copies were collected out of some 700 copies distributed. Multiple regression models were employed to explore significant predictors of IAD. This study showed that at least two out of 100 teenagers in Korea are seriously suffering from IAD and that approximately one out of two is exposed to a kind of IAD. The causes of IAD are not only associated with habitual backgrounds for use of the Internet, but also demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Therefore, it can be said that the development of IAD is an interactive process between juveniles' habits of using Internet, and their demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. As IAD progresses, a single type of intervention such as parent interventions or school interventions does not work effectively. Multimodal interventions are required to provide counseling services for individuals suffering from IAD.","Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society",2006 Oct,United States,2006,00
19090609,Prevalence of chronic diseases according to socioeconomic status measured by wealth index: health survey in Serbia.,"AIM: To examine socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of chronic diseases in Serbia, using the data from 2006 national health survey. METHOD: A stratified sample of 7673 households was selected and 14522 household members older than 20 years were interviewed (response rate 80.5%). Wealth index was used as a measure of socioeconomic status. Standardized morbidity prevalence ratios were computed using the poorest category as reference. Odds ratios for the prevalence of the selected chronic diseases and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated by multivariate logistic analysis adjusted for age, education, smoking status, and body mass index. RESULTS: Hypertension was the most prevalent disease in all socioeconomic categories; standardized morbidity prevalence ratios were higher in richer men (151.3 in the richest) and lower in richer women (86.1 in the richest). Rheumatism/arthritis was the second most prevalent disease in both sexes, with the highest prevalence in the poorest group; the pattern remained the same after standardization (standardized morbidity prevalence ratio in the richest: 86.4 in men and 74.0 in women). The prevalence of hyperlipidemia was associated with wealth index in both men and women and was highest in the richest group; the pattern remained the same after standardization (standardized morbidity prevalence ratio in the richest: 275.9 in men and 138.4 in women). Logistic regression models showed that higher wealth index was associated with higher prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and allergy, while lower wealth index was associated with higher prevalence of rheumatism/arthritis. CONCLUSION: There were considerable socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of chronic diseases in Serbia.

19152688,Global influences on milk purchasing in New Zealand--implications for health and inequalities.,"BACKGROUND: Economic changes and policy reforms, consistent with economic globalization, in New Zealand in the mid-1980s, combined with the recent global demand for dairy products, particularly from countries undergoing a 'nutrition transition', have created an environment where a proportion of the New Zealand population is now experiencing financial difficulty purchasing milk. This situation has the potential to adversely affect health. DISCUSSION: Similar to other developed nations, widening income disparities and health inequalities have resulted from economic globalization in New Zealand; with regard to nutrition, a proportion of the population now faces food poverty. Further, rates of overweight/obesity and chronic diseases have increased in recent decades, primarily affecting indigenous people and lower socio-economic groups. Economic globalization in New Zealand has changed the domestic milk supply with regard to the consumer and may shed light on the link between globalization, nutrition and health outcomes. This paper describes the economic changes in New Zealand, specifically in the dairy market and discusses how these changes have the potential to create inequalities and adverse health outcomes. The implications for the success of current policy addressing chronic health outcomes is discussed, alternative policy options such as subsidies, price controls or alteration of taxation of recommended foods relative to 'unhealthy' foods are presented and the need for further research is considered. SUMMARY: Changes in economic ideology in New Zealand have altered the focus of policy development, from social to commercial. To achieve equity in health and improve access to social determinants of health, such as healthy nutrition, policy-makers must give consideration to health outcomes when developing and implementing economic policy, both national and global.",Globalization and health,2009 Jan 19,England,2009,00
18504142,"Socioeconomic determinants of psychological well-being: the role of income, income change, and income sources during the course of 29 years.","BACKGROUND: Considerable evidence indicates that income and other measures of socioeconomic position are associated with a wide variety of health outcomes. The authors of a few studies have prospectively examined the association between socioeconomic position over the course of decades and health outcomes. The present study, covering almost three decades of the life course, examined the cumulative impact of different income measures on psychological well-being among adults. METHODS: We used data collected over the course of 29 years (1965-1994) from Alameda County Study participants to study the association between average income, income changes, profit and benefit incomes-and five scales of psychological well-being--Purpose in Life, Self-acceptance, Personal Growth, Environmental Mastery, and Autonomy. In age-adjusted models, the psychological well-being measures were each regressed on each of the income measures. Potential confounders (sex, education, race/ethnicity, social isolation, depression, and perceived health) were also examined. RESULTS: Mean income over the course of almost three decades was strongly associated with all five scales of psychological well-being. Psychological well-being increased with the number of waves in which profit income was reported and with income increases over time. For all scales except Autonomy, psychological well-being decreased with the number of waves receiving need-based benefit and with decreasing income over time.

11016136,Factors responsible for delayed immunisation among children under 5 years of age.,"Although immunisation coverage has increased substantially in recent years, still a sizable proportion of children are not being immunised at appropriate time. The present hospital based, pair matched, case control study was carried out at immunoprophylactic centre of Government Medical College and Hospital, Nagpur, to identify risk factors associated with delayed immunisation among children. This study included 139 children with a delay of more than 90 days for scheduled primary immunisation and equal number of matched control (for dose) receiving immunisation at appropriate time. The study identified significant association of family size [Odd's ratio (OR) = 7.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-35.6], number of children < 5 years (OR = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.1-9.9), sex (OR = 3, 95% CI = 1.2-7.4), paternal education (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.6-8.5), maternal education (OR = 4, 95% CI = 1.5-10.9), socio-economic status (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.1-13.2) and distance from health centre (OR = 4.7, 95% CI = 1.2-17.6) with delayed immunisation. Negligence (56%) and unawareness (22.7%) of parents were main reasons for delayed immunisation. Hence more stress on identified risk factors in the study will indirectly help in reducing the frequency of delayed immunisation.",Journal of the Indian Medical Association,2000 Jan,India,2000,00
17526318,Identifying and strengthening the structural roots of urban health in Canada: participatory policy research and the urban health agenda.,"An urban health research agenda for health promoters is presented. In Canada, urban issues are emerging as a major concern of policy makers. The voices raising these issues are from the non-health sectors, but many of these issues such as increasing income inequality and poverty, homelessness and housing insecurity, and social exclusion of youth, immigrants, and ethno-racial minorities have strong health implications as they are important social determinants of health. Emphasis on these and other social determinants of health and the policy decisions that strengthen or weaken them is timely as the quality of Canadian urban environments has become especially problematic. We argue for a participatory urban health research and action agenda with four components: (a) an emphasis on health promotion and the social determinants of health; (b) community-based participatory research; and (c) drawing on the lived experience of people to influence (d) policy analysis and policy change. Urban health researchers and promoters are urged to draw upon new developments in population health and community-based health promotion theory and research to identify and strengthen the roots of urban health through citizen action on public policy.",Promotion & education,2007,England,2007,00
14625964,A practical model for preventing type 2 diabetes in minority youth.,"PURPOSE: This article proposes a model grounded in behavioral theory and empirical evidence for use when developing a program to prevent type 2 diabetes in high-risk minority youth. METHODS: The model is based on key concepts of 4 behavioral theories: the Health Belief Model, Social Learning Theory, the Theory of Planned Behavior, and the Ecological Model. Determinants of behavior to target for change are selected based on their theoretical link to behavior change, their success in changing behavior in past programs, and through thorough formative research in the target community. RESULTS: Diabetes prevention in children requires modifying a complex set of behavior patterns. Social norms and the environment are especially important in children in whom cognitive processes have not fully developed. Family and community involvement is essential for developing a health program and providing a supportive environment in which to change behavior and ongoing reinforcement to maintain behavior changes. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral theory informs the selection of factors to target in a behavioral intervention. Special considerations apply when working with children. A program to target risk must be based in behavioral theory, supported by practical data, and tailored to the needs and beliefs of the target community.",The Diabetes educator,2002 Sep-Oct,United States,2002,00
17538057,"The political economy of marriage and HIV: the ABC approach, ""safe"" infidelity, and managing moral risk in Uganda.","Research has shown that married women's greatest risk for HIV infection is their husbands' extramarital sexual activities. Using 6 months of ethnographic research in southeastern Uganda, I examined how the social and economic contexts surrounding men's extramarital sexuality and the dynamics of marriage put men and women at risk for HIV infection. I found that Uganda's HIV prevention messages may be inadvertently contributing to increased difficulty in acknowledging HIV risk and to newer forms of sexual secrecy and that structural determinants, including persistent poverty, intersect with gender inequalities to shape marital risk. After examining a community effort to regulate men's sexuality, I suggest that HIV prevention strategies should focus more on endogenous forms of risk reduction while simultaneously addressing structural factors that facilitate opportunities for men's extramarital sex.",American journal of public health,2007 Jul,United States,2007,00
15869118,Neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and access to health care.,"Most research on access to health care focuses on individual-level determinants such as income and insurance coverage. The role of community-level factors in helping or hindering individuals in obtaining needed care, however, has not received much attention. We address this gap in the literature by examining how neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with access to health care. We find that living in disadvantaged neighborhoods reduces the likelihood of having a usual source of care and of obtaining recommended preventive services, while it increases the likelihood of having unmet medical need. These associations are not explained by the supply of health care providers. Furthermore, though controlling for individual-level characteristics reduces the association between neighborhood disadvantage and access to health care, a significant association remains. This suggests that when individuals who are disadvantaged are concentrated into specific areas, disadvantage becomes an ""emergent characteristic "" of those areas that predicts the ability of residents to obtain health care.",Journal of health and social behavior,2005 Mar,United States,2005,00
11509840,A World Health Organization perspective on alcohol and illicit drug use and health.,"Alcohol and illicit drug use has a significant impact on global health. Alcohol consumption is increasing worldwide, particularly in developing countries and countries in transition, leading to an increasing number of health and social problems, both acute and chronic. Illicit drug use is also increasing, particularly injection drug use, followed by an epidemic spread of HIV and other blood-borne infections. Alcohol and illicit drug use are related to key determinants of population health and are also an outcome of poor health. Globalized marketing and trade, and rapid social changes and development in the absence of strong policies and investments in public health have led to an increased availability, use and problems related to alcohol and other substance use. Public health policies and substantial investments in effective prevention and treatment approaches are needed in order to reduce the negative impact of alcohol and other drug use at national and global levels.",European addiction research,2001 Aug,Switzerland,2001,00
16848259,Caries experience in preschool children referred for specialist dental care in hospital.,"BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of preschool children are being referred for specialist dental management in a paediatric hospital. Most cases have severe early childhood caries and require comprehensive management under general anaesthesia. The present study investigated risk factors for disease presence at initial consultation. METHODS: A convenience sample of 125 children under four years of age from the north Brisbane region were examined and caries experience recorded using dmft and dmfs indices. A self-administered questionnaire obtained information regarding social, demographic, birth, neonatal, infant feeding and dental health behaviour variables. The data were analysed using the chi-square and one-way analysis of variance procedures. RESULTS: Ninety-four per cent of referred children had severe ECC with mean dmft of 10.5 +/- 3.8 and mean dmfs of 27.1 +/- 15.1. Prevalence of severe ECC was significantly higher in children allowed a sweetened liquid in the infant feeding bottle (99 per cent) and allowed to sip from an infant feeding bottle during the day (100 per cent). Mean dmfs was significantly higher in children allowed to sleep with a bottle (28.7) and sip from a bottle during the day (29.9), children from a non-Caucasian background (31.8), those children that commenced regular toothbrushing between 6 to 12 months of age (28.1), had no current parental supervision of daily tooth-brushing (34.2) and had not taken daily fluoride supplements (27.8), vitamin supplements (27.8) or prescription medicine previously (27.6). CONCLUSIONS: The behavioural determinants for severe early childhood caries presence in hospital-referred children were similar to those identified in the regional preschool population.",Australian dental journal,2006 Jun,Australia,2006,00
12435839,Factors influencing HIV/AIDS in women of color.,"OBJECTIVE: The author reviews selected findings on the behavioral risk factors for exposure to HIV among women of color and the social, psychological, and cultural factors that may be related to these risks and to the use of condoms. The potential value of empowerment models of AIDS intervention for women of color is examined. OBSERVATIONS: The most common routes of exposure to HIV for women of color are intravenously injected drug use and prostitution related to drug use. A woman's risk for exposure to HIV is related to her ability to protect herself by negotiating a safe sexual relationship with a partner. Women who feel powerless in their relationships are less likely to protect themselves against HIV exposure. These perceptions of powerlessness are the result of a broad array of experiences that may include secondary status, exposure to violence, restricted economic opportunities, and experiences of racism and oppression. CONCLUSIONS: Research on primary and secondary prevention of HIV infection in women of color must acknowledge and address the multiple determinants of health and risk behaviors in research paradigms and methodologies that assess women's risk in relationship to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2002,United States,2002,00
11885033,Public health and peace.,"The modern concept of public health, the New Public Health, carries a great potential for healthy and therefore less aggressive societies. Its core disciplines are health promotion, environmental health, and health care management based on advanced epidemiological methodologies. The main principles of living together in healthy societies can be summarized as four ethical concepts of the New Public Health essential to violence reduction equity, participation, subsidiarity, and sustainability. The following issues are discussed as violence determinants: the process of urbanization; type of neighborhood and accommodation, and consequent stigmatization; level of education; employment status; socialization of the family; women's status; alcohol and drug consumption; availability of the firearms; religious, ethnic, and racial prejudices; and poverty. Development of the health systems has to contribute to peace, since aggression, violence, and warfare are among the greatest risks for health and the economic welfare. This contribution can be described as follows: 1) full and indiscriminate access to all necessary services, 2) monitoring of their quality, 3) providing special support to vulnerable groups, and 4) constant scientific and public accountability of the evaluation of the epidemiological outcome. Violence can also destroy solidarity and social cohesion of groups, such as family, team, neighborhood, or any other social organization. Durkheim coined the term anomie for a state in which social disruption of the community results in health risks for individuals. Health professionals can make a threefold contribution to peace by 1) analyzing the causal interrelationships of violence phenomena, 2) curbing the determinants of violence according to the professional standards, and 3) training professionals for this increasingly important task. Because tolerance is an essential part of an amended definition of health, monitoring of the early signs of public intolerance is important. The vital interplay between the informed public and efficient administration, however, can only exist in an open society. The link between democracy and health of the people, and between public health and economic welfare is real. The Public Health Collaboration in South Eastern Europe (PH-SEE) evolved just in time to reconnect and strengthen disrupted professional networks in the region as a prerequisite of effective public health action.",Croatian medical journal,2002 Apr,Croatia,2002,00
18479518,The Amsterdam Studies of Acute Psychiatry I (ASAP-I); a prospective cohort study of determinants and outcome of coercive versus voluntary treatment interventions in a metropolitan area.,"BACKGROUND: The overall number of involuntary admissions is increasing in many European countries. Patients with severe mental illnesses more often progress to stages in which acute, coercive treatment is warranted. The number of studies that have examined this development and possible consequences in terms of optimizing health care delivery in emergency psychiatry is small and have a number of methodological shortcomings. The current study seeks to examine factors associated with compulsory admissions in the Amsterdam region, taking into account a comprehensive model with four groups of predictors: patient vulnerability, social support, responsiveness of the health care system and treatment adherence. METHODS/DESIGN: This paper describes the design of the Amsterdam Study of Acute Psychiatry-I (ASAP-I). The study is a prospective cohort study, with one and two-year follow-up, comparing patients with and without forced admission by means of a selected nested case-control design. An estimated total number of 4,600 patients, aged 18 years and over, consecutively coming into contact with the Psychiatric Emergency Service Amsterdam (PESA) are included in the study. From this cohort, a randomly selected group of 125 involuntary admitted subjects and 125 subjects receiving non-coercive treatment are selected for further evaluation and comparison.First, socio-demographic, psychopathological and network characteristics, and prior use of health services will be described for all patients who come into contact with PESA. Second, the in-depth study of compulsory versus voluntary patients will examine which patient characteristics are associated with acute compulsory admission, also taking into account social network and healthcare variables. The third focus of the study is on the associations between patient vulnerability, social support, healthcare characteristics and treatment adherence in a two-year follow-up for patients with or without involuntarily admittance at the index consultation. DISCUSSION: The current study seeks to establish a picture of the determinants of acute compulsory admissions in the Netherlands and tries to gain a better understanding of the association with the course of illness and patient's perception of services and treatment adherence. The final aim is to find specific patient and health care factors that can be influenced by adjusting treatment programs in order to reduce the number of involuntary admissions.",BMC psychiatry,2008 May 14,England,2008,00
12160474,Sterility in zambia.,"BACKGROUND: Several regions such as Zambia in sub-Saharan Africa experience very high levels of sterility. Current explanations for high levels of sterility in Zambia have focused on biological determinants and have paid little attention to the plausible effects of social determinants of sterility. AIM: This study has two objectives. The first objective is to examine the extent of sterility in Zambia during 1980 and 1990. The second objective is to assess the contribution of selected social determinants to the current levels of sterility in Zambia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sterility among women in Zambia is calculated for two periods in 1980 and 1990 using census data. The study used parity progression ratios for the calculation of sterility rates. Selected social determinants of Zambian sterility were obtained from the Demographic Health Survey (ZDHS). Net effects of selected social determinants were examined using logistic regression. RESULTS: High sterility levels were found in a few Zambian Provinces. During 1980 and 1990, the rates for North Western, Eastern and Western provinces remained considerably higher than for other Zambian provinces. It was found that social level variables remained strong and significant even after controlling for the effects of incidence of biological factors such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study support the importance of developing social policies for eradicating sterility. The argument that sterility is biological and that it is not amenable to social interventions perhaps needs revision in the light of the findings of this study.",Annals of human biology,2002 Jul-Aug,England,2002,00
16930384,Genetic and environmental influences on extreme personality dispositions in adolescent female twins.,"BACKGROUND: The objective was to determine whether the pattern of environmental and genetic influences on deviant personality scores differs from that observed for the normative range of personality, comparing results in adolescent and adult female twins. METHODS: A sample of 2,796 female adolescent twins ascertained from birth records provided Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire data. The average age of the sample was 17.0 years (S.D. 2.3). Genetic analyses of continuous and extreme personality scores were conducted. Results were compared for 3,178 adult female twins. RESULTS: Genetic analysis of continuous traits in adolescent female twins were similar to findings in adult female twins, with genetic influences accounting for between 37% and 44% of the variance in Extraversion (Ex), Neuroticism (N), and Social Non-Conformity (SNC), with significant evidence of shared environmental influences (19%) found only for SNC in the adult female twins. Analyses of extreme personality characteristics, defined categorically, in the adolescent data and replicated in the adult female data, yielded estimates for high N and high SNC that deviated substantially (p < .05) from those obtained in the continuous trait analyses, and provided suggestive evidence that shared family environment may play a more important role in determining personality deviance than has been previously found when personality is viewed continuously. However, multiple-threshold models that assumed the same genetic and environmental determinants of both normative range variation and extreme scores gave acceptable fits for each personality dimension. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis of differences in genetic or environmental factors responsible for N and SNC among female twins with scores in the extreme versus normative ranges was partially supported, but not for Ex.","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",2006 Sep,England,2006,00
15208466,Mental health and substance abuse treatment and juvenile crime.,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: There is a large body of literature examining the determinants of juvenile crime, which highlights economic, family, peer, and educational factors associated with delinquency and recidivism, and the important roles of social service and educational systems. Two factors, substance abuse and mental illness are also potentially important. The observed high correlations between crime, substance abuse and poor mental health suggests that factors which reduce substance abuse and improve mental health may also be effective in reducing criminal activities. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of mental health and substance abuse treatment in reducing crimes committed by juveniles. METHODS: This paper uses detention data in conjunction with substance abuse and mental health treatment data for youth enrolled in the Colorado state foster care program over a three year period. Duration models are used to examine the structural determinants of detention. We analyze the impact of treatment in delaying or preventing this group of at-risk youth from engaging in criminal behavior. Violent crimes are analyzed separately. We also include the price of beer in all models to gauge the effectiveness of higher beer prices in reducing crime, holding treatment constant. RESULTS: The analysis finds that individuals who receive treatment have lower probabilities of being detained for any offence. Accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity makes the magnitude of these effects larger. Also consistent with our theory, higher beer prices lower the detention hazard. CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest that expansion of health services targeted at these youth may be effective at reducing crime. For violent crime, where the literature shows that substance abuse plays a significant role, stricter alcohol-regulatory policies may also be highly effective.",The journal of mental health policy and economics,2004 Jun,Italy,2004,00
17296211,A prospective mini health impact assessment of the 'Towards 2010' programme in Sandwell and West Birmingham in the West Midlands.,"OBJECTIVES: To conduct a health impact assessment (HIA) of the four 'Towards 2010' programme options under consideration. This is an innovative and visionary programme involving a 750 million pound capital investment to deliver modern and flexible healthcare services across Sandwell and West Birmingham in the West Midlands, UK. The HIA aimed to inform the Board which of the four options would be most beneficial for the local population. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective mini HIA. METHODS: The study involved a desktop exercise using a combination of the Merseyside and West Midlands Directors of Public Health guidelines for conducting HIAs. Ten broad determinants of health including employment and economy, education, transport, housing, visual amenity (environment), access to services, crime, lifestyle, pollution, and family and social cohesion were selected. For each determinant potential positive and negative impacts were identified using readily available local information and professional knowledge. RESULTS: Overall over 600 positive and negative impacts were predicted across the four options. These were summarized into 90 positive and 84 negative impacts for each of the ten broad determinants of health. The findings suggest that two out of the four options seem to offer maximum opportunity for improving the health and wellbeing of the local population and for linking into the wider regeneration initiatives within the programme area. DISCUSSION: Besides the obvious benefits that one would expect from brand new modern healthcare facilities, a wide range of other impacts were identified. This raised a level of awareness amongst the decision makers of the range of impacts that would need to be maximized or minimized to improve the health and wellbeing of the local population.",Public health,2007 Jun,Netherlands,2007,00
19473457,Correlates of sexually related personal distress in women with low sexual desire.,"INTRODUCTION: Sexual distress is an important component of diagnostic criteria for sexual dysfunctions, but little is known about the factors associated with sexual distress in women with low sexual desire. AIM: To investigate the correlates of sexual distress in women with self-reported low sexual desire. METHODS: The Prevalence of Female Sexual Problems Associated with Distress and Determinants of Treatment Seeking study was a cross-sectional, nationally representative, mailed survey of U.S. adult women. There were 31,581 respondents (response rate 63.2%) to the 42-item questionnaire that measured sexual function, sexual distress, demographic, and health-related factors. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the correlates of distress. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Low sexual desire was defined as a response of ""never"" or ""rarely"" to the question, ""How often do you desire to engage in sexual activity?"" Sexual distress was measured with the Female Sexual Distress Scale (range 0-48), with a score of 15 or higher indicating presence of distress. RESULTS: Of 10,429 women with low desire, 2,868 (27.5%) had sexual distress (mean age 48.6 years, 81% with a current partner). Women without distress were 10 years older on average, and 44% had a current partner. Having a partner was strongly related to distress (odds ratio 4.6, 95% confidence interval 4.1-5.2). Other correlates were age, race, current depression, anxiety, lower social functioning, hormonal medication use, urinary incontinence, and concurrent sexual problems (arousal or orgasm). Dissatisfaction with sex life was more common in women with low desire and distress (65%) than in those without distress (20%). CONCLUSIONS: Age has a curvilinear relationship with distress, and the strongest correlate of sexual distress was having a current partner. Sexual distress and dissatisfaction with sex life are strongly correlated. Distress is higher in women with low sexual desire in a partner relationship; further research on this factor is needed.",The journal of sexual medicine,2009 Jun,Netherlands,2009,00
18775816,Does job strain mediate the effect of socioeconomic group on smoking behaviour? The impact of different health policies in Denmark and Sweden.,"AIMS: The aim was to compare the impact of socioeconomic groups (SEG) on the risk of being a daily smoker or quitter, and to investigate whether the potentially mediating effect of psychosocial working conditions was similar in the Danish and the Swedish populations. METHODS: The study populations consisted of 10,049 employed participants, aged 18-64 years, 51% women, randomly selected from the general populations in the Oresund region, 1999-2000. Odds ratios (OR) for daily-smokers and ""non-quitters'' were computed for two age-groups and two SEGs in gender specific models, stratified by country. The association between SEG, current smoking, quitting, and influence at work, job demand and jobstrain, respectively, was tested by means of logistic regression. RESULTS: The contextual determinants defined by country had a different effect on smoking prevalence among men and women and among age groups. Low influence and job strain seemed to have an effect on smoking among Danish women, but not among Swedish women. The OR of being a daily smoker were higher in men than women among younger Danes, but higher in women than men among Swedes. The prevalence of low influence, high demand and job strain was higher and more socially skewed among the Swedes, but did not mediate the effect of SEG on smoking behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The smoking prevalence was lower and the quit-rates higher among Swedes than Danes. Both countries had social differences in smoking that in absolute terms were rather similar, but in relative terms were higher in Sweden. The mediating effect of psychosocial working conditions was lacking. The determinants of smoking behaviours must be found somewhere else in the social and cultural context.",Scandinavian journal of public health,2008 Aug,Sweden,2008,00
19225218,Problematic interpersonal relationships at work and depression: a Swedish prospective cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES: Studies have shown that interpersonal relations at work are important for several health related outcomes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether low social support, serious conflict, exclusion by superiors or by co-workers at work may be determinants of depression. METHODS: In a representative Swedish cohort study data were obtained in two waves three years apart. 4,040 women and men who did not change their jobs between the waves were chosen for the study. Exposure and confounders were obtained at Time 1 and outcome, depression according to Bech's MDI at Time 2. Previous depression was controlled for by adjusting for depression at Time 1. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Odds-ratios adjusted for possible confounders and depression at base-line showed significant effects for all four exposures on depression (adjusted OR, low social support 1.5 CI 95% 1.1-2.0, serious conflict 1.4 CI 95% 1.1-1.9, exclusion by superiors 1.6 CI 95% 1.2-2.1 and exclusion by co-workers 1.7 CI 95% 1.2-2.3). CONCLUSIONS: The present results support the conclusion that problematic interpersonal relationships at work can be determinants of depression. These prospective findings may be of relevance for prevention and when rehabilitating depressed patients.",Journal of occupational health,2009,Australia,2009,00

In addition, chronic stress associated with lower SES may also increase morbidity and mortality. Reducing SES disparities in health will require policy initiatives addressing the components of socioeconomic status (income, education, and occupation) as well as the pathways by which these affect health.

METHODS: The association between predictor variables (sociodemographic variables, health conditions, social resources, and religiosity) and feelings of mastery was assessed by using representative community-dwelling samples of 250 African American (mean age = 71.6) and 452 White (mean age = 73.0) older adults. RESULTS: African American older adults had a lower sense of mastery than White older adults. Significant modification by race was found in the associations of age, self-rated health, and religiosity with feelings of mastery. The negative effects of old age and poor health on feelings of mastery were stronger in the White sample, whereas the positive effect of religiosity on feelings of mastery was observed only in the African American sample. DISCUSSION: Although African American older adults had a lower sense of mastery than Whites, their feelings of mastery were less likely to be diminished by old age and poor health and more likely to be enhanced by religiosity. Possible explanations for cross-racial differences are discussed, as are implications.","The journals of gerontology.

12479494,Expanding the Andersen model: the role of psychosocial factors in long-term care use.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine a prevailing conceptual model of health services use (Andersen 1995) and to suggest modifications that may enhance its explanatory power when applied to empirical studies of race/ethnicity and long-term care. STUDY SETTING: Twelve focus groups of African-American (five groups) and white (seven groups) individuals, aged 65 and older, residing in Connecticut during 2000. STUDY DESIGN: Using qualitative analysis, data were coded and analyzed in NUD-IST 4 software to facilitate the reporting of recurrent themes, supporting quotations, and links among the themes for developing the conceptual framework. Specific analysis was conducted to assess distinctions in common themes between African-American and white focus groups. DATA COLLECTION: Data were collected using a standardized discussion guide, augmented by prompts for clarification. Audio taped sessions were transcribed and independently coded by investigators and crosschecked to enhance coding validity. An audit trail was maintained to document analytic decisions during data analysis and interpretation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Psychosocial factors (e.g., attitudes and knowledge, social norms, and perceived control) are identified as determinants of service use, thereby expanding the Andersen model (1995). African-American and white focus group members differed in their reported accessibility of information about long-term care, social norms concerning caregiving expectations and burden, and concerns of privacy and self-determination. CONCLUSIONS: More comprehensive identification of psychosocial factors may enhance our understanding of the complex role of race/ethnicity in long-term care use as well as the effectiveness of policies and programs designed to address disparities in long-term care service use among minority and nonminority groups.",Health services research,2002 Oct,United States,2002,00

17760500,"Independent associations of fasting insulin, glucose, and glycated haemoglobin with stroke and coronary heart disease in older women.","BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that variations in fasting glucose and insulin amongst those without frank type 2 diabetes mellitus are important determinants of cardiovascular disease. However, the relative importance of variations in fasting insulin, glucose, and glycated haemoglobin as risk factors for cardiovascular disease in women without diabetes is unclear. Our aim was to determine the independent associations of fasting insulin, glucose, and glycated haemoglobin with coronary heart disease and stroke in older women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook a prospective cohort study of 3,246 British women aged 60-79 y, all of whom were free of baseline coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, and all of whom had fasting glucose levels below 7 mmol/l. Fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment for insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) were linearly associated with a combined outcome of coronary heart disease or stroke (n = 219 events), but there was no association of fasting glucose or glycated haemoglobin with these outcomes. Results were similar for coronary heart disease and stroke as separate outcomes. The age, life-course socioeconomic position, smoking, and physical activity adjusted hazard ratio for a combined outcome of incident coronary heart disease or stroke per one standard deviation of fasting insulin was 1.14 (95% CI 1.02-1.33). Additional adjustment for other components of metabolic syndrome, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, and glycated haemoglobin had little effect on this result. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in women in the 60-79 y age range, insulin resistance, rather than insulin secretion or chronic hyperglycaemia, is a more important risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke. Below currently used thresholds of fasting glucose for defining diabetes, neither fasting glucose nor glycated haemoglobin are associated with cardiovascular disease.",PLoS medicine,2007 Aug,United States,2007,00
11042429,Health care seeking behaviour of patients with sexually transmitted diseases: determinants of delay behaviour.,"The study aimed to determine the factors associated with a delay in seeking health care for symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among a sample of 1482 patients attending STD clinics. Of the sample 78% were male, 58% sought help from the clinic within the first 6 days of noticing symptoms, 24% waited between 7 and 10 days and 17% waited longer than 10 days before seeking health care. Patients who delayed were those who treated themselves prior to seeking health care, who were female, whose friends waited before seeking treatment, who held misconceptions regarding the cause of STDs, who perceived STDs not to be serious and who valued personal autonomy in sexual behaviours less and had less positive outcome expectations of refusing sex. The data suggest that targeted interventions should be directed specifically at women and the youth. Early health care seeking could be facilitated through improved basic knowledge regarding STDs, control over one's own sexual behaviour and social support for early health care seeking.",Patient education and counseling,2000 Oct-Nov,Ireland,2000,00
11051362,Shared and unique environmental factors determine the ecology of methanogens in humans and rats.,"OBJECTIVE: This study ascertains the relative contributions of genetics and environment in determining methane emission in humans and rats. There is considerable interest in the factors determining the microbial species that inhabit the colon. Methanogens. which are archaebacteria, are an easily detected colonic luminal bacteria because they respire methane. They are present in some but not all human colons and lower animal hindguts. Opinion varies on the nature of the factors influencing this ecology with some studies proposing the existence of host genetic influences. METHODS: Methane emission was measured in human twin pairs by gas chromatography, and structural equation modeling was used to determine the proportion of genetic and environmental determinants. The importance of the timing of environmental effects and rat strain on the trait of methane emission were ascertained by experiments with cohabiting methanogenic and nonmethanogenic rats. RESULTS: Analysis of breath samples from 274 adolescent twin pairs and their families indicated that the major influences on the trait of methane emission are the result of shared (53%, 95% confidence interval 39-61) and unique environmental (47%, 95% confidence interval 38-56) effects. No significant autosomal genetic effects were detected, but as observed in other studies, men (37%) were less likely to excrete methane in their breath than women (63%). Investigation of methane emission in rats indicated that environmental effects in this animal are most potent during the weaning period, with stable gut microbial ecology thereafter for some but not all rat strains. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with shared and unique environmental factors being the main determinants of the ecology of this colonic microbe.",The American journal of gastroenterology,2000 Oct,United States,2000,00

A total of 1,026 subjects (63% women and 53% of low socioeconomic status) 40-70 years old were included in the study. Risk factors of osteoporosis were determined using the European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study (EVOS) questionnaire, and the bone status was screened by tSOS. Socioeconomic status was found to be among the major risk factors of low tSOS in our population (odds ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.58), besides the well-known risk factors such as age and gender. Therefore, we suggest that SES is an important determinant of cortical bone status.

Among the 20 survey respondents, 62% of those who had been working prior to aphasia onset were also working at the time of follow-up. Those who were working before but not after onset had higher Home Integration scores. There was a relatively large perceived change in communication from clinic discharge to the 2-year follow-up. Eighty-five percent of the respondents indicated a positive life satisfaction rating. There was a significant positive relationship between Home Integration and life satisfaction ratings. The results are discussed in relation to other reports of employment and social outcomes for stroke and aphasia. LEARNING OUTCOMES: As a result of this activity, the participant will be able to: (1) identify factors that may contribute to the successful return to work for adults with chronic aphasia; (2) describe the vocational and social outcomes of a select group of adults with chronic aphasia after participation in an intensive treatment program; and (3) discuss future need areas in understanding vocational and social participation for adults with chronic aphasia after intervention.",Journal of communication disorders,2002 Nov-Dec,United States,2002,00
17929613,"The aging population and Natural Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs); local government, healthy aging, and healthy-NORCs.","BACKGROUND: The term Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) has been used since the 1980s. NORCs are defined as communities where people remain or move to when they retire. NORCs develop 'naturally', meaning that seniors tend to remain or move there when they retire, although the residences and physical environment were not constructed for a senior population. The term, Healthy-NORC, has been introduced and is associated with healthy aging. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: We describe how demographic trends will facilitate a dramatic growth in NORCs. Acknowledging the 'Determinants of Health' model, we suggest that some determinants impact people differently at different ages. We also suggest that more attention be focused on the impact of physical/social environments on health, and that some determinants of health are particularly relevant for seniors. We argue that NORCs exist on a spectrum, from NORC to H-NORC, and that health benefits for seniors increase as NORCs adopt additional characteristics associated with improved senior health. We also illustrate H-NORC research methods and policy options for local governments. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Compared to the provision of additional medical and social services, H-NORCs represent a low-cost approach to facilitating healthy aging. Municipal governments can promote healthy aging and should pursue policies that will stimulate H-NORC development.",Alaska medicine,2007,United States,2007,00
10925770,Infant oral health.,"According to the United Nations' Convention on ""The Rights of the Child,"" articles 2 and 24, all children should have the same rights and have right to health and medical service. Early childhood caries is a lifestyle disease with biologic, behavioral, and social determinants. An early screening of all children at around 1 year of age is an excellent opportunity for early detection of risk factors and risk indicators that may increase the possibilities for its prevention. The caries risk evaluation should form the base for appropriate recommendations of preventive measures. The preventive care must be coordinated with an eventual operative care and should be based on education of prospective and new parents as well as professional and home-based measures. The various interventions must be developed further and evaluated in prospective studies in terms of effectiveness and efficiency for this specific age group. This is an urgent task for dental professionals and all societies with the ambition of providing good dental care for all young children.",Dental clinics of North America,2000 Jul,United States,2000,00
17674180,Perceived risks and benefits of sex work among transgender women of color in San Francisco.,"Prior research has shown that male-to-female (MTF) transgender women of color in the United States have a high rate of HIV infection and often engage in sex work for economic survival. With the exception of studies on HIV prevalence and behavioral risk, little research exists to elucidate the social context and determinants of sex work and related health risks among these women. Through a qualitative analysis of seven focus groups with 48 transgender women of color, we examined why and how participants became involved in sex work, documented risks associated with sex work, and explored what motivated participants to remain in sex work. Participants reported on how social networks and cultural norms, immigration issues, and experiences of racism, sexism, and transphobia influenced their decisions to enter and the risks encountered in sex work. Findings revealed that transgender women of color who engage in sex work have unique needs and experiences that must be addressed through structural and social network-based interventions to minimize their vulnerability to social and public health harms.",Archives of sexual behavior,2007 Dec,United States,2007,00
16884450,Cognitive function and social abilities in patients with schizophrenia: relationship with atypical antipsychotics.,"Although atypical antipsychotics have been associated with improvements in cognitive function in schizophrenia, the neurochemical basis for such effects is not well understood. Candidate neurotransmitter systems primarily involve dopamine and serotonin. The current study explored this issue by examining the cognitive abilities, social function and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia who were medicated with atypical antipsychotics. Comparisons were done for matched schizophrenia patients who were on antipsychotics with (i) an affinity for multiple receptors (olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine) versus those that have preferential affinity for dopamine receptors (risperidone, amisulpride); and patients on medication with (ii) a high affinity for serotonin (5HT-2A) receptors (risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine) versus those with a low (or no) affinity for 5HT-2A receptors (quetiapine, amisulpride). No differences emerged between groups on any cognitive or social variable when the groups were compared for the dopaminergic properties of antipsychotic medication. By contrast, differences did emerge when patients were compared on the 5HT-2A affinity of their antipsychotic medications. Patients on low 5HT-2A-affinity antipsychotics exhibited a better performance on a measure of selective attention and adjustment to living. These findings accord with the notion that serotonergic mechanisms are important determinants of both the cognitive and the social effects of the atypical antipsychotics.",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2006 Aug,Australia,2006,00
17999213,Determinants of effective coping with cultural transition among expatriate children and adolescents.,"The present study examined the influence of family and parental work factors, personality, and attachment on the intercultural adjustment of expatriate children and adolescents (N=104). Children from families high in cohesion exhibited higher levels of adjustment than children from low cohesive families. Expatriate work satisfaction was significantly related to children's adjustment. Emotional Stability appeared as an independent predictor of adjustment. Attachment dominated as the strongest predictor of adjustment, whereby an ambivalent attachment style was negatively related to adjustment. Interestingly, personality and attachment moderated the influence of family- and work-related factors on adjustment, whereby the beneficial effects of a healthy family and work situation were particularly found among children high on the intercultural traits and high in secure attachment.","Anxiety, stress, and coping",2007 Mar,England,2007,00
16042163,Determinants of healthy eating among low-income Canadians.,"This paper draws on four bodies of literature to consider the determinants of healthy eating for low-income Canadians: a) the social determinants of health; b) socio-economic gradients in diet; c) food security; and d) the sociology of food. Though there is a paucity of data for Canada, it is very likely that, as in other industrialized countries, there are socio-economic gradients in diet such that those who are better off consume healthier diets than those less well-to-do. The available evidence suggests that income affects food intake both directly and indirectly through the dispositions associated with particular social class locations. Thus, there may be both economic and cultural thresholds for some food groups or particular foods in food groups. Understanding these thresholds is especially important in addressing the issues facing those who are the most vulnerable among Canadians with low incomes: the food insecure. The literature reviewed suggests that improved nutrition for low-income Canadians may be difficult to achieve a) in isolation from other changes to improve their lives; b) without improvement in the nutrition of the general population of Canadians; and c) without some combination of these two changes. Four major areas of research need were identified: a) national data on socio-economic gradients in diet; b) sociological research on the interaction of income and class with other factors affecting food practices; c) sociological research on Canadian food norms and cultures; and d) research on the costs of healthy eating.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2005 Jul-Aug,Switzerland,2005,00
15663709,"The determinants of private medical insurance prevalence in England, 1997-2000.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to identify the factors that determine the prevalence of private medical insurance (PMI) in England. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Secondary data sources are the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) 1997-2000, Laing's Healthcare Market Review 1999-2000, the United Kingdom (U.K.) Department of Health's National Health Service Waiting Times Team, and the Work Force Statistics Branch of the Department of Health. STUDY DESIGN: Logistic regression models for panel data were used to compare non-PMI subscribers with individual subscribers and those with employer-provided PMI. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: The BHPS data are collected by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex. Other data used were collected by Laing and Buisson and the U.K. Department of Health. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Individual PMI is more prevalent among the well-educated and healthy. Income, age, sex, and political preference are key determinants of PMI prevalence for both individual and employer paid PMI. Individuals are also likely to reflect on information with regard to waiting times in deciding whether or not to purchase PMI cover. The withdrawal of the tax subsidy in 1997 to PMI subscribers over 60 years of age did not impact on their rate of withdrawal from PMI coverage relative to the rate among all PMI subscribers, but may have discouraged potential new subscribers. CONCLUSIONS: Current trends in the PMI market suggest that, over time, individually purchased PMI is likely to be partially displaced by PMI purchased as part of a company-based plan. However, having PMI is linked to economic factors in both groups, suggesting a similar segment of the population valuing the responsiveness that PMI provides. Geographic factors relating to waiting times and supply-side factors are associated with both individual and company-based PMI. The withdrawal of the tax subsidy to individual subscribers older than age of 60 resulted in a significant decline in the demand for PMI. In particular, the number of new subscribers in this group declined substantially.",Health services research,2005 Feb,United States,2005,00
19377731,[The Gordian knot in gender equity].,"Gender has been considered to be one of the social determinants of health; this fact constitutes an opportunity for going deeper into an analysis which, as it is a daily matter, becomes invisible. Gender-equity in health means having equal opportunities of gaining access to the available resources, a democratic distribution of power and know-how in the health system and a health policy benefitting all without allowing privileges due to gender differences. The set of factors involved in inequities due to cultural and social construction assigned to and assumed by females and men constitutes a complex framework, a Gordian knot. Gender inequity is expressed in the different ways in which people reproduce biologically and socially. Gender is a cultural determinant which is socially assumed, expressed in hierarchical power relationships and in stereotypes, performing roles and, above all, controlling resources. This work is aimed at disclosing different links of this Gordian knot, which must be dismantled or cut for making advances towards gender-equity in health.","Revista de salud publica (Bogota, Colombia)",2008 Dec,Colombia,2008,00
18183608,"Population-based controlled study of social support, self-perceived stress, activity and work issues, and access to health care in inflammatory bowel disease.","BACKGROUND: The Manitoba IBD Cohort Study is a longitudinal, population-based study of multiple determinants of health outcomes in persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnosed within 7 years at enrollment. In this cross-sectional substudy we compared IBD participants' levels of social support, self-perceived stress, disability, and access to healthcare with those of a matched community sample. METHODS: IBD participants (n = 388) were interviewed using the Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS) 1.1 and 1.2 to assess psychosocial variables. The national CCHS data were accessed to extract a community comparison group, matched on age, sex, and geographic residence. RESULTS: Compared to the community sample, IBD participants received more tangible, affective, or emotional support in the past year and were more likely to have experienced a positive social interaction. Those with IBD were as likely to be employed as those in the community sample, although they reported greater rates of reduced activity and days missed. Work was not identified as a significant source of stress, but physical health was more likely to be identified as a main stressor by those with active IBD compared to the non-IBD sample. Individuals with IBD were twice as likely to report unmet healthcare needs than the community sample; however, there was agreement across both groups regarding common barriers, including long waits and availability. CONCLUSIONS: While the disease may contribute to greater interference with work quality and daily activities, IBD patients have similar levels of stress and appear to have enhanced social supports relative to those in the community without IBD.",Inflammatory bowel diseases,2008 Apr,England,2008,00

11264431,Effects of altitude versus economic status on birth weight and body shape at birth.,"The compelling evidence linking small size at birth with later cardiovascular disease has renewed and amplified a clinical and scientific interest in the determinants of fetal growth. Although the effects of maternal nutrition on fetal growth have been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about the effects of maternofetal hypoxia. This study tested the hypothesis that in highland regions, high altitude rather than maternal economic status is associated with reduced and altered fetal growth by investigating the effects of high altitude versus economic status on birth weight and body shape at birth in Bolivia. Bolivia is geographically and socioeconomically unique. It contains several highland (>3500 m above sea level) and lowland (<500 m) cities that are inhabited by very economically divergent populations. Birth weight, body length, and head circumference were compared between a high- (n = 100) and low- (n = 100) income region of La Paz (3649 m; largest high-altitude city) and a high- (n = 100) and low- (n = 100) income region of Santa Cruz (437 m; largest low-altitude city). In addition, the frequency distribution across the continuum of birth weights was plotted for babies born from high- and low-income families in La Paz and Santa Cruz. Mean birth weights were lower in babies from La Paz than in babies from Santa Cruz in both high- and low-income groups. The cumulative frequency curve across all compiled birth weights was shifted to the left in babies from La Paz compared with those from Santa Cruz, regardless of economic status. The frequency of low birth weight (<2500 g) was higher in babies from La Paz than from Santa Cruz in both high- and low-income groups. In addition, at high altitude but not at low altitude, high income was associated with an increase in the head circumference:birth weight ratio. These findings suggest that high altitude rather than economic status is associated with low birth weight and altered body shape at birth in babies from Bolivia.",Pediatric research,2001 Apr,United States,2001,00
19811603,Revitalizing primary health care and family medicine/primary care in India--disruptive innovation?,"CONTEXT: India has rudimentary and fragmented primary health care (PHC) and family medicine systems, yet it also has the policy expectation that PHC should meet the needs of extremely large populations with slums and difficult to reach groups, rapid social and epidemiological transition from developing to developed nation profiles. Historically, the system has lacked impetus to achieve PHC. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of PHC approaches and the current state of PHC and family medicine in India in order to assess the opportunities for their revitalization. METHODS: A narrative review of the published and grey literature on PHC, family medicine, Web2.0 and health informatics key papers and policy documents, pertinent to India. OUTCOMES: A conceptual framework and recommendations for policy makers and practitioner audiences. FINDINGS: PHC is constructed through systems of local providers who address individual, family and local community basic health needs with strong community participation. Successful PHC is a pre-eminent strategy for India to address the determinants of health and the almost chaotic of massive social transition in its institutions and health care sector. There is a lack of an articulated comprehensive framework for the publicly stated goals of improving health and implementing PHC. Also, there exists a very limited education and organization of a medical and PHC workforce who are trained and resourced to address individual, family and local community health and who have become increasingly specialized. However, emerging technology, Health2.0 and user generated health care informatics, which are largely conducted through mobile phones, are co-evolving patient-driven health systems, and potentially enhance PHC and family medicine workforce development. CONCLUSIONS: In order to improve health outcomes in an equitable manner in India, there is a pressing need for a framework for implementing PHC. The co-emergence of information technologies accessible to the mass population and user-driven health care provide a potential catalyst or innovation for this transition.",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,2009 Oct,England,2009,00
12174476,"Demographic, socio-economic and environmental determinants of utilisation of antenatal care in a rural setting of Sindh, Pakistan.","OBJECTIVE: Majority of the women in the developing countries are unable receive antenatal care for a variety of reasons. This study determines the factors affecting utilisation of antenatal care by women of a rural area in Sindh, Pakistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during August 1997, in Union Council Jhangara, Sindh, Pakistan. Married women, who had delivered at least one child, were included in the study from each household and systematically 222 eligible women were selected. The effects of demographic, socio-economic and environmental factors on the utilisation of antenatal care, by women during their most recent pregnancy were also studied. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess independent effect of individual factors. RESULTS: Among the study subjects, 29.3% (65) of the women utilised antenatal care during the last (most recent) pregnancy and out of them 72.3% (47) received it from the government health care provider. Presence of electricity in the house was strongly associated with the utilisation of antenatal care (AOR = 5.3; 95% CI 2.2-12.7). Women whose husbands were in white-collar occupation, were utilizing the antenatal care significantly more (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.2-4.6) compared to women whose husbands were in blue-collar occupations. CONCLUSION: The study shows that social status and economic condition of a woman is an important determinant of utilisation of antenatal care. Therefore, improvement of socioeconomic status is required to increase utilization of antenatal and perinatal care.",JPMA. The Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association,2002 Apr,Pakistan,2002,00
11641744,Social determinants of dietary habits in Denmark.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is an association between socioeconomic status and a healthy diet, taking the possible influence of other social variables such as age, gender, income and household composition into consideration. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nationwide study in Denmark, 1995. SUBJECTS: Random sample from the civil registration system. A total of 852 men and 870 women aged 18-80 y participated, a response rate of 58%. INTERVENTIONS: A 7 day estimated dietary record was used to obtain information about the diet. Information about social background was gained through face-to-face interview. RESULTS: The intake of fruit and vegetables and the percentage energy (E%) from fat in the diet were significantly associated with the educational level of both men and women. For men with only basic schooling, the mean intake of vegetables and fat was 84 g/10 MJ and 41 E% respectively. Men with long higher education had a mean intake of 119 g/10 MJ of vegetables and 37 E% of fat. For women, the corresponding figures for the intake of vegetables and fat were 131 g/10 MJ and 38 E% and 175 g/10 MJ and 37 E%, respectively. For women, age, income and household composition were also significantly associated with the intake of fruit and vegetables. CONCLUSIONS: Education seems to be the most important social variable to explain social differences in dietary habits. Additional variables are needed to explain dietary habits of women. Differences are seen for both foods and nutrients.

18367889,Population medicine in a curricular revision at Case Western Reserve.,"Inclusion of population medicine in a medical school curriculum has received growing attention. Recently, the Association of American Medical Colleges has highlighted this issue through support of the Regional Medicine and Public Health Education Centers initiative. The Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine joined this consortium while implementing a new curriculum in which population medicine would be an underlying theme woven with the classic science elements of disease. The organization for the first two years of the new curriculum, which was implemented in 2006, is a six-block structure during which the basic sciences are learned with key concepts of population medicine woven throughout. The focus for this article is Block One, in which population medicine is the major emphasis of the introduction to medicine. The first week, students learn social determinants, impact on communities, and social aspects of diabetes mellitus, even before addressing a patient's clinical presentation. Emphasis on student-centered learning is undertaken as part of the new curriculum, using a series of weekly, case-based, small-group sessions. This type of group learning is used throughout Block One as students encounter key components of population medicine. A thesis requirement was also introduced as a mechanism to emphasize research with opportunities for research in population medicine as well as other medical sciences. A variety of mechanisms are described to measure the outcomes of Block One.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2008 Apr,United States,2008,00
16286497,Multilevel analysis of associations between socioeconomic status and injury among Canadian adolescents.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of individual and area level measures of socioeconomic status (SES) to the occurrence of various injury types among Canadian adolescents. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross sectional Canadian data were used from two sources: (1) the 2001/02 health behaviour in school aged children survey (individual level SES measures, injury measures), and (2) the 2001 Canada census of population (area level SES measures). Injury outcomes included: medically treated injury, injury hospitalisation, sport/recreational injury, and fighting injury. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine individual and area level SES measures as potential determinants of adolescent injury. PARTICIPANTS: 7235 students in grades 6-10 from 170 schools across Canada. MAIN RESULTS: Associations between SES and injury were identified for each injury outcome examined, although a clear direction of association was not present for the overall measure of medically treated injury. In general, lower SES was associated with increased risk for hospitalised and fighting injury. Higher SES was associated with increased risks for sport/recreational injury. Independent contributions of individual and area level measures of SES were seen for hospitalised and fighting injury. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between SES and adolescent injury exist; however, the direction of these relations becomes more apparent with particular indicators of SES and when homogenous injury outcomes are evaluated.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2005 Dec,England,2005,00
11833984,Social support for spouse caregivers of persons with dementia.,"OBJECTIVES: This study analyzes the value of simultaneously taking helper and caregiver characteristics into account when examining social support received by spouse caregivers of persons with dementia. This study questions whether sources and types of received support vary by the gender and relationship of the helper and/or by the caregiver's race and gender. METHODS: Drawing on a sample of 210 spouse caregivers of persons with dementia, the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) method was used to estimate a population-average logistic regression model to address cross-level helper and caregiver interactions. RESULTS: Results indicate that helper and caregiver characteristics interact in complex ways. White male caregivers are more likely to receive emotional support from adult children and to receive practical assistance from formal sources compared with other types of support and to other race-gender caregiver groups. DISCUSSION: Description of social status characteristics of caregivers as determinants of their social network may be less fruitful in understanding the benefits of social support than a focus on which helpers assist with what kinds of task for which groups of caregivers.","The journals of gerontology.

19642956,A focus on health promotion and prevention through the development of the national men's health policy.,"ISSUES ADDRESSED: The Australian Government announced its intention to develop a national men's health policy in June 2008. A focus on prevention was identified as a foundation principle that would underpin the development of this policy. This brief report provides a descriptive account of the key discussion points relating to health promotion and prevention during a National Men's Health Roundtable held in Canberra in March 2009. METHODS: Invitations to the Roundtable were extended to peak professional organisations and national health bodies with an interest in men's health. Presentations from the National Preventative Health Taskforce, the National Primary Health Care External Reference Group and National Men's Health Ambassadors were used to provoke discussion relating to men's health. RESULTS: The most salient issues that were raised at the Roundtable and that were specific to health promotion and prevention contexts included the need to clearly define key terms that relate to health promotion and prevention (to support a joined-up and health-in-all-policies approach); acknowledge that gender intersects with other social determinants of health; recognise that men's engagement though health promotion and primary healthcare services can be improved by using settings-based approaches more widely; a greater focus on men's health literacy; a universal funding system to support men's health promotion; clarity about the roles and responsibilities that various health professionals play in improving the status of men's health; and the need to build health equity between and within specific populations of men through action on the social determinants of health. CONCLUSION: Recognising the place of health promotion and illness prevention in a national men's health policy will provide the necessary platform to build critical health literacy among men, promote equitable access to primary healthcare services and better support men's engagement within the health system.",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2009 Aug,Australia,2009,00
14563081,The politics of public health: a response to Epstein.,"Conservatives are taking aim at the field of public health, targeting its efforts to understand and control environmental and social causes of disease. Richard Epstein and others contend that these efforts in fact undermine people's health and well-being by eroding people's incentives to create economic value. Public health, they argue, should stick to its traditional task--the struggle against infectious diseases. Because markets are not up to the task of controlling the transmission of infectious disease, Epstein says, coercive government action is required. But market incentives, not state action, he asserts, represent our best hope for controlling the chronic illnesses that are the main causes of death in industrialized nations. In this article, we assess Epstein's case. We consider his claims about the market's capabilities and limits, the roles of personal choice and social influences in spreading disease, andthe relationship between health and economic inequality. We argue that Epstein's critique of public health over-reaches, oversimplifies, and veils his political and moral preferences behind seemingly objective claims about the economics of disease control and the determinants of disease spread. Public health policy requires political and moral choices, but these choices should be transparent.",Perspectives in biology and medicine,2003 Summer,United States,2003,00
12239450,Nutritional determinants of epithelial ovarian cancer risk: a case-control study in Mexico.,"BACKGROUND: Variations in the incidence of cancer can be influenced by diet and specific lifestyles. In the last years, diet has been evaluated as an important factor in the development of ovarian cancer, even though the results have not been consistent. Dietary factors related to the risk of ovarian cancer in Mexican women were evaluated. METHODS: A case-control study in Mexico City was done during 1995-1997 in a social security hospital, evaluating 84 new cases of ovarian cancer and 629 controls. A validated questionnaire with 116 items about the frequency and type of food intake was used. The analysis of nutrients was done with the residual method adjusted for total energy intake and other predictor variables through logistic regression methods. Also, partition models estimated the total caloric intake for other sources. RESULTS: The nutrients negatively associated with ovarian cancer in the highest versus the lowest tertile were retinol (OR 0.52; p for trend = 0.03) and vitamin D (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.23-0.80; p = 0.01; residual model). Additionally, carbohydrates were positively associated (partition model: OR 1.08; 95% CI 1.00-1.15), and tortilla intake did not show an association with ovarian cancer (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.78-1.17). CONCLUSIONS: The diet of the Mexican population is rich in carbohydrates; in Mexico corn intake is the main energy source. On the other hand, vitamins such as retinol and vitamin D were shown to be associated with this neoplasm in a protective way; nevertheless, further studies are necessary to allow us to corroborate our results. This is the first attempt in our country that relates the Mexican diet to ovarian cancer.",Oncology,2002,Switzerland,2002,00
11882210,The influence of liberal political ideology on nursing science.,"Previous notions of science as impartial and value-neutral have been refuted by contemporary views of science as influenced by social, political and ideological values. By locating nursing science in the dominant political ideology of liberalism, the author examines how nursing knowledge is influenced by liberal philosophical assumptions. The central tenets of liberal political philosophy - individualism, egalitarianism, freedom, tolerance, neutrality, and a free-market economy - are primarily manifested in relation to: (i) the individualistic focus of our science; (ii) our view of society as essentially egalitarian and equitable; (iii) our preference for politically neutral knowledge development, and (iv) an economy of knowledge development that supports rather than challenges the status quo. I argue that exposing, rather than ignoring, the liberal ideological values inherent in nursing science will render these assumptions open to debate, stimulate ongoing development of critically oriented knowledge, and increase our capacity to influence the social, political and economic determinants of health.",Nursing inquiry,2001 Jun,Australia,2001,00
19968409,Agreeableness and alcohol-related aggression: the mediating effect of trait aggressivity.,"This study investigated the mediating effect of trait aggressivity on the relation between agreeableness and alcohol-related aggression in a laboratory setting. Participants were 116 healthy male social drinkers between 21 and 30 years of age. Agreeableness and trait aggressivity were measured using the Big Five Inventory and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, respectively. Following the consumption of an alcohol or no-alcohol control beverage, participants completed a modified version of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm, in which electric shocks were received from and administered to a fictitious opponent during a competitive task. Aggression was operationalized as the proportion of the most extreme shocks delivered to the fictitious opponent under conditions of low and high provocation. Results indicated that lower levels of agreeableness were associated with higher levels of trait aggressivity. In turn, higher levels of trait aggressivity predicted extreme aggression in intoxicated, but not sober, participants under low, but not high, provocation. Findings highlight the importance of examining determinants of intoxicated aggression within a broader theoretical framework of personality.",Experimental and clinical psychopharmacology,2009 Dec,United States,2009,00

However, only during the past decade have investigators begun to conduct experiments exploring the various ways in which observation of the behaviour of others might influence mate selection. Here, we review both field and laboratory studies of behavioural processes that underlie non-independence in mate choice, discussing both direct and indirect social influences on mate selection. We focus on laboratory studies in which guppies and Japanese quail, species that have received greatest attention from investigators, have served as subjects. Although much is now known about how public information can affect mate selection in controlled environments, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge of whether and how such information contributes to mate selections by members of free-living populations.",Behavioural processes,2000 Oct 5,Netherlands,2000,00
19493901,A test of the social cohesion hypothesis: interactive female marmots remain at home.,"Individuals frequently leave home before reaching reproductive age, but the proximate causes of natal dispersal remain relatively unknown. The social cohesion hypothesis predicts that individuals who engage in more (affiliative) interactions are less likely to disperse. Despite the intuitive nature of this hypothesis, support is both limited and equivocal. We used formal social network analyses to quantify precisely both direct and indirect measures of social cohesion in yellow-bellied marmots. Because approximately 50 per cent of female yearlings disperse, we expected that social relationships and network measures of cohesion would predict dispersal. By contrast, because most male yearlings disperse, we expected that social relationships and cohesion would play a less important role. We found that female yearlings that interacted with more individuals, and those that were more socially embedded in their groups, were less likely to disperse. For males, social interactions were relatively unimportant determinants of dispersal. This is the first strong support for the social cohesion hypothesis and suggests that the specific nature of social relationships, not simply the number of affiliative relationships, may influence the propensity to disperse.",Proceedings.

14695371,"Barriers to addressing the societal determinants of health: public health units and poverty in Ontario, Canada.","Despite Canada's reputation as a leader in health promotion and population health concepts, actual public health practice for the most part remains wedded to downstream strategies focussed on behaviour change. In Canada's largest province this has led to the implementation of a heart health promotion approach focussed on diet, activity and tobacco use. This is so despite increasing evidence that these approaches are generally ineffective, particularly for those at greatest risk. In addition, these strategies appear to divert public and governmental attention away from addressing the broader societal determinants of health. Examples of Ontario public health units that have begun to address societal determinants of health provide a counterbalance to the dominant paradigm that frames health as an individual responsibility. These new approaches focus attention upon the health-threatening effects of governments' regressive social and economic policies in a manner consistent with the best principles of health promotion.",Health promotion international,2003 Dec,England,2003,00
15963873,Modern day influences on sexual behavior.,"To better understand temporal trends in sexual behavior and their determinants, it is important to look at the demographic and technologic context in which we live; both affect sexual behaviors. Mental disorders and CSA emerge as important correlates of high-risk sexual behaviors. The changing role and expectations of women-the result of major economic and social transformation-transform society further through changes to family and community structures. These changes occur alongside increasing inequality and upheavals in the world, all of which are more visible through increased mobility and communication in the ""global village."" Changes in sexual norms, relationships, abuse, and mental health are better understood in the context of this broad political background.",Infectious disease clinics of North America,2005 Jun,United States,2005,00
16690584,Prediction of long-term occupational performance outcomes for adults after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.,"PURPOSE: To examine predictors of long-term occupational performance outcomes for adults after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHOD: This study involved analysis of data from a retrospective cohort of adults (N = 306) with moderate to severe TBI discharged from a Pennsylvania rehabilitation treatment facility. Extensive pre-injury sociodemographic, injury-severity, post-injury personal (cognitive, physical, affective), post-injury environmental (social, institutional, physical), and post-injury occupational performance (participation in self-care, productivity, leisure activities) data were gathered from hospital records and using in-person interviews. Interviews occurred at a mean time of 14 (range, 7-24) years post-injury. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to investigate determinants of long-term occupational performance outcomes. RESULTS: Pre-injury behavioural problems, male gender, post-injury cognitive and physical deficits, and lack of access to transportation were significant independent predictors of worse occupational performance outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports the use of a comprehensive model for long-term outcomes after TBI where pre-injury characteristics and post-injury cognitive and physical characteristics account for the greatest proportion of explained variance.",Disability and rehabilitation,2006 May 15,England,2006,00
12003249,Healthy aging among inner-city men.,"OBJECTIVE: Until now, prospective studies of aging have begun with 50- to 60-year olds, not adolescents. Premature deaths, childhood variables, and alcohol abuse have been often ignored. So has positive aging. As people live longer, gerontology needs to understand the determinants of health as well as illness in the later years. METHOD: The present study follows a cohort of adolescent boys (332 inner-city youths) for 60 years or until death. Complete physical exams were obtained every 5 years and psychosocial data every 2 years. Predictor variables assessed prior to age 50 include six variables reflecting uncontrollable factors--parental social class, environmental strengths, number of family problems, major depression, ancestral longevity, and premorbid physical health at age 50--and six variables reflecting (at least some) personal control: alcohol abuse, smoking, marital stability, body mass index, coping mechanisms, and education. The four outcome variables chosen to assess healthy aging at 70 reflected both ""mind"" and ""body."" They included objectively assessed variables (death and/or disability prior to 70, and objective mental health) and two subjectively assessed variables (perceived instrumental activities of daily living and life enjoyment). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis suggested that positive aging at 70 could be predicted by variables assessed prior to age 50. More hopeful still, if the six variables under some personal control were controlled, depression was the only uncontrollable variable that affected the quality of subjective and objective aging. CONCLUSIONS: First, we may have greater personal control over our biopsychosocial health after retirement than previously recognized. Second, in this cohort, psychiatric rather than sociological predictors appeared more important.",International psychogeriatrics,2001 Dec,England,2001,00

By comparing the socioeconomic provisions for specialist training in Italy and the UK, this work identified several determinants negatively influencing the environment in which junior doctors practise. Modernisation of European postgraduate medical education can be taken forward, provided some regulation and some consistency in socioeconomic provisions for specialist training can be promoted by competent authorities across all European countries.",Postgraduate medical journal,2006 Dec,England,2006,00
10706815,"Choosing Work Group Members: Balancing Similarity, Competence, and Familiarity.","This study explores one of the contributors to group composition-the basis on which people choose others with whom they want to work. We use a combined model to explore individual attributes, relational attributes, and previous structural ties as determinants of work partner choice. Four years of data from participants in 33 small project groups were collected, some of which reflects individual participant characteristics and some of which is social network data measuring the previous relationship between two participants. Our results suggest that when selecting future group members people are biased toward others of the same race, others who have a reputation for being competent and hard working, and others with whom they have developed strong working relationships in the past. These results suggest that people strive for predictability when choosing future work group members.

15590705,Health seeking behaviour and health service utilization in Pakistan: challenging the policy makers.,"There is a growing literature on health seeking behaviours and the determinants of health services utilization especially in the context of developing countries. However, very few focused studies have been seen in Pakistan in this regard. This paper presents an extensive literature review of the situation in developing countries and relates the similar factors responsible for shaping up of a health seeking behaviour and health service utilization in Pakistan. The factors determining the health behaviours may be seen in various contexts: physical, socio-economic, cultural and political. Therefore, the utilization of a health care system, public or private, formal or non-formal, may depend on socio-demographic factors, social structures, level of education, cultural beliefs and practices, gender discrimination, status of women, economic and political systems environmental conditions, and the disease pattern and health care system itself. Policy makers need to understand the drivers of health seeking behaviour of the population in an increasingly pluralistic health care system. Also a more concerted effort is required for designing behavioural health promotion campaigns through inter-sectoral collaboration focusing more on disadvantaged segments of the population.","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2005 Mar,England,2005,00
16674820,The basic principles of migration health: population mobility and gaps in disease prevalence.,"Currently, migrants and other mobile individuals, such as migrant workers and asylum seekers, are an expanding global population of growing social, demographic and political importance. Disparities often exist between a migrant population's place of origin and its destination, particularly with relation to health determinants. The effects of those disparities can be observed at both individual and population levels. Migration across health and disease disparities influences the epidemiology of certain diseases globally and in nations receiving migrants. While specific disease-based outcomes may vary between migrant group and location, general epidemiological principles may be applied to any situation where numbers of individuals move between differences in disease prevalence. Traditionally, migration health activities have been designed for national application and lack an integrated international perspective. Present and future health challenges related to migration may be more effectively addressed through collaborative global undertakings. This paper reviews the epidemiological relationships resulting from health disparities bridged by migration and describes the growing role of migration and population mobility in global disease epidemiology. The implications for national and international health policy and program planning are presented.",Emerging themes in epidemiology,2006 May 4,England,2006,00

DESIGN: Nine focus groups were conducted with LMD residents in 9 counties in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. One focus group was held in each county on the topical area of behavioral change. SETTING: Nine counties in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. PARTICIPANTS: The study population included 91 persons, 85 females and 6 males (18-60+ years of age), of whom 71 were African Americans, 17 were Caucasians, and 3 were Hispanics, who participated in the focus group discussions. ANALYSIS: Data analyses were completed by general and specific content coding. Data were reviewed for emerging themes for each topic. The Social Cognitive Theory served as the framework for understanding the determinants of a change in healthful food consumption behavior. RESULTS: The study showed considerable variability in perceptions that are influenced by both personal and external factors. These factors include health concerns, family influence, and need for and availability of nutrition information. Participants were interested in learning about healthful eating, food preparation skills, and portion control. CONCLUSIONS: Focus groups in the LMD identified many important themes relevant to the development of nutrition interventions in these communities. These data will be used to guide the community-based participatory interventions that will be developed and implemented in the LMD. The findings could be applicable to other researchers designing interventions for similar populations.",Journal of nutrition education and behavior,2008 Mar-Apr,United States,2008,00

STUDY SETTING: Twelve focus groups of African-American (five groups) and white (seven groups) individuals, aged 65 and older, residing in Connecticut during 2000. STUDY DESIGN: Using qualitative analysis, data were coded and analyzed in NUD-IST 4 software to facilitate the reporting of recurrent themes, supporting quotations, and links among the themes for developing the conceptual framework. Specific analysis was conducted to assess distinctions in common themes between African-American and white focus groups. DATA COLLECTION: Data were collected using a standardized discussion guide, augmented by prompts for clarification. Audio taped sessions were transcribed and independently coded by investigators and crosschecked to enhance coding validity. An audit trail was maintained to document analytic decisions during data analysis and interpretation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Psychosocial factors (e.g., attitudes and knowledge, social norms, and perceived control) are identified as determinants of service use, thereby expanding the Andersen model (1995). African-American and white focus group members differed in their reported accessibility of information about long-term care, social norms concerning caregiving expectations and burden, and concerns of privacy and self-determination. CONCLUSIONS: More comprehensive identification of psychosocial factors may enhance our understanding of the complex role of race/ethnicity in long-term care use as well as the effectiveness of policies and programs designed to address disparities in long-term care service use among minority and nonminority groups.",Health services research,2002 Oct,United States,2002,00

Yet, despite this, most citizens seem to be unaware of regional health authorities, why they exist, the drivers and constraints involved, or whether these divergent structures and regional governance processes have influenced patterns of restructuring and health outcomes. And even when discussions have taken place, these debates have tended to be more prescriptive than analytical. All of this has complicated the task of conceptualizing and making sense of the determinants that have influenced regionalization forms of health service restructuring in Canada and how these have influenced the way resources have been allocated, decisions reached and accountability exercised.",HealthcarePapers,2004,Canada,2004,00

However, up until now, the extent to which violence acts as a risk factor for mental disorders has not been investigated prospectively. AIMS: We determined the risk of common mental disorders (CMD) associated with personal experience with physical violence (PV). METHODS: A cohort of 3253 public employees in Rio de Janeiro completed questionnaires that measured CMD (GHQ-12), experience with PV and stressful life events (SLE). RESULTS: After adjusting for age, income and SLE, those who experienced PV in either 1999 or 2001 and those who experienced PV in both years had, respectively, 1.2-fold (95% CI; 1.0-1.4) and 2.1-fold (1.6-2.6) increased risks of CMD. CONCLUSION: Direct exposure to violence may act cumulatively on the risk of developing CMD. The absence of association for reporting CMD both in 1999 and 2001 suggests that other determinants may be more relevant for chronic mental disorders.",The International journal of social psychiatry,2008 Mar,England,2008,00
18754978,Nurses' intentions to provide continuous labor support to women.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the determinants of nurses' intentions to practice continuous labor support. DESIGN: A descriptive survey based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. SETTING: A large, urban Canadian hospital with 2 sites and 7,000 births per year. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-seven registered nurses from 2 birthing units. RESULTS: Scores measuring nurses' attitudes, subjective norms, and intentions regarding continuous labor support for women with epidural analgesia were significantly lower than those for women without epidural analgesia (p<.0001). Multiple regression analyses revealed that previous labor support courses, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control explained 55% of the variance in nurses' intentions to provide continuous labor support to women without epidural analgesia while 88% of the variance in intentions to provide continuous labor support to women with epidural analgesia was explained by subjective norms and attitudes. Subjective norms made the most significant contribution to the variance in nurses' intentions to provide continuous labor support. Top perceived organizational barriers to continuous labor support included unit acuity and method of patient assignment. CONCLUSION: Nurses' intentions to provide continuous labor support are lower for women receiving epidural analgesia and are influenced by the perceived social pressures on their unit. Nurses view organizational barriers as important factors influencing their ability to provide continuous labor support.","Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN",2008 Jul-Aug,United States,2008,00
17582371,Do different factors explain self-rated health in men and women?,"BACKGROUND: Self-rated health has elicited special interest, in the wake of a number of studies demonstrating that it is a powerful predictor of future mortality, mare so for men than for women. The association between self-rated health and biological correlates also appears to differ between men and women, for reasons unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine gender differences in the interpretation and/or valuation of health-related information by comparing men and women's association of abroad array of perceived health determinants with their statements about health. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a randomly selected population of 8200 men and women aged >17 years in Stockholm, Sweden. Subjects received a 120-item questionnaire that included measures of health care utilization, lifestyle, demographics, psychosocial factors, and mental, functional, and physical health. RESULTS: Among the 5470 people who responded to the questionnaire, most of the 42 potential correlates (41 for men, 40 for women) were significantly correlated to self-rated health. The overall association pattern was surprisingly similar for men and women. However, some small differences appeared: educational level, physical activity, and cultural activities played a more crucial role when men judged their health, whereas satisfaction with sleep and doctor visits played a more crucial role when women judged their health. These results were also for the most part confirmed in regression analyses that included all variables. The correlates explained 50% of the variance in self-rated health for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the necessity of taking a broad perspective on potential correlates when analyzing mechanisms of self-rated health. When judging their own health, men and women appear to consider approximately the same broad array of factors. The similarities in association patterns indicate that men and women interpret and/or value health-related factors similarly when making statements about health. These results may influence the medical profession's acceptance or consideration of self-rated health. Understanding the gender-specific mechanisms involved in the assessment of self-rated health may contribute to the promotion of health-protective behavior and health intervention practices.",Gender medicine,2006 Dec,United States,2006,00
12548297,The burden of anemia among women in India.,"OBJECTIVE: This research investigates the prevalence and determinants of anemia among women in Andhra Pradesh. We examined differences in anemia related to social class, urban/rural location and nutrition status body mass index (BMI). We hypothesized that rural women would have higher prevalence of anemia compared to urban women, particularly among the lower income groups, and that women with low body mass index (BMI; <18.5 kg/m(2)) would have a higher risk compared to normal or overweight women. DESIGN: The National Family Health Survey 1998/99 (NFHS-2) provides nationally representative cross-sectional survey data on women's hemoglobin status, body weight, diet, social, demographic and other household and individual level factors. Ordered logit regression analyses were applied to identify socio-economic, regional and demographic determinants of anemia. SETTING: Andhra Pradesh, a southern Indian state. SUBJECTS: A total of 4032 ever-married women aged 15-49 from 3872 households. RESULTS: Prevalence of anemia was high among all women. In all 32.4% of women had mild (100-109.99 g/l for pregnant women, 100-119.99 for non-pregnant women), 14.19% had moderate (70-99.99 g/l), and 2.2% had severe anemia (<70 g/l). Protective factors include Muslim religion, reported consumption of alcohol or pulses, and high socioeconomic status, particularly in urban areas. Poor urban women had the highest rates and odds of being anemic. Fifty-two percent of thin, 50% of normal BMI, and 41% of overweight women were anemic. CONCLUSIONS: New program strategies are needed, particularly those that improve the overall nutrition status of women of reproductive ages. This will require tailored programs across socio-economic groups and within both rural and urban areas, but particularly among the urban and rural poor.",European journal of clinical nutrition,2003 Jan,England,2003,00
12187802,[Comprehensive geriatric assessment and treatment of elderly diabetic patients].,"Because of diversities of physical, mental, and psychological functions as well as clinical and social backgrounds, comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is of great importance in treating elderly diabetic patients. We addressed three issues as to functions important for the CGA. First, we assessed several domains of cognitive function in 213 elderly diabetic patients. Attention and visual memory in diabetic patients without vascular disease were impaired compared with non-diabetic controls after adjusting for age and sex using analysis of covariance. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, hyperglycemia, and the presence of cerebral infarction were independent determinants for the impairment of attention in the diabetic patients. The results suggest that glucose control is important for the maintenance of cognitive function in elderly diabetic patients. Secondly, we assessed positive well-being as a measure of psychological function using a PGC morale scale in 197 elderly diabetic patients without cerebrovascular disease at baseline and examined whether the low well-being affect the development of cerebrovascular disease in a 3-year longitudinal study. The results indicate that low well-being was an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular disease after adjusting conventional risk factors in elderly diabetic patients. Thirdly, as a physical function, we assessed 5-m walking speed for both usual and maximum walking in 64 diabetic patients. The walking speed decreased with age and correlated significantly with the knee extension power and functional reach. The result suggests that muscle-strength exercise and balance training as well as endurance exercises are necessary to improve age-related decreases in walking speed and for effective exercise in elderly patients. From a gerontological point of view, new strategies of elderly diabetes treatment including muscle strength exercise and psychological approaches should be established to improve physical, mental, psychological, and social functions as assessed by the CGA.",Nihon Ronen Igakkai zasshi.

15629682,The urban built environment and overdose mortality in New York City neighborhoods.,"Accidental drug overdose continues to be a substantial cause of mortality for drug users. Characteristics of the neighborhood built environment may be important determinants of the likelihood of drug overdose mortality independent of individual-level factors. Using data from the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, we conducted a multilevel case control study using data on accidental overdose deaths as cases and non-overdose accidental deaths as controls. We used archival data from the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey and the Mayor's Office of Operations to assess characteristics of neighborhood external (e.g. dilapidation of buildings) and internal (e.g. quality of utilities in houses) built environment. Multilevel analyses were used to assess the relations between the neighborhood built environment and the likelihood of overdose death. Six out of the eight characteristics of the external environment studied and three out of the six characteristics of the internal environment studied were significantly associated with the likelihood of fatal drug overdose in multilevel models after adjusting for individual-level (age, race, sex) and neighborhood-level (income, drug use) variables. Deterioration of the built environment, particularly the external environment, is associated with an increased likelihood of fatal accidental drug overdose. Disinvestment in social resources, psychosocial stressors, neighborhood differences in response to a witnessed overdose, and differences in vulnerability to the adverse consequences of drug use in different neighborhoods may explain the observed associations.",Health & place,2005 Jun,England,2005,00
17959411,Housing assets and the socio-economic determinants of health and disability in old age.,"The influence of socio-economic determinants among the elderly is a complex subject. Although they rely on pension income, the wealth that they have accumulated over their lifetime (primarily housing assets), jointly with housing-related determinants, could have a more significant effect on health production. Hence, owning a house has more potential than income for reducing health inequalities. This study makes use of a representative cross-sectional database on the Spanish population aged 55 or over. Using a continuous variable to measure health and a measure of disabilities in old age, the study explores some socio-economic determinants of health and disability and provides a breakdown of inequalities in socio-economic status and in aggregate individual health. The study's findings indicate that housing equity overrides the effect of income as a determinant of health and (absence of) disability in old age. Furthermore, housing assets account for more than 90% of socio-economic inequalities and 54% of inequalities in disability.",Health & place,2008 Sep,England,2008,00

18364362,Childhood and current determinants of heavy drinking in early adulthood.,"AIMS: To explore the association of parental education, childhood living conditions and several adversities with heavy drinking in early adulthood, and to analyze the effect of the respondent's current circumstances on these associations. METHOD: The analyses were conducted in a sample of 1234 adults aged 18-29 years participating in the Finnish Health 2000 Survey (65% of the original representative two-stage cluster sample, N = 1894). The outcome measure was heavy drinking measured by g/week for pure alcohol (for men >or=280 g/week and for women >or=140 g/week). RESULTS: 8% of young adult men and 5% of women were heavy drinkers. In both genders, parental alcohol problems and other childhood adversities, poor own education, and unemployment status increased the risk of heavy drinking. The impact of childhood on heavy drinking was partly independent and partly mediated by adult characteristics, in particular, for both genders, low level of education. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood adversities are associated with heavy drinking in early adulthood among both genders. Childhood social circumstances as well as low educational level and unemployment should be taken into account in planning preventive policies to tackle the harms caused by excessive alcohol use at the individual and population level.","Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire)",2008 Jul-Aug,England,2008,00

METHODS: A consumer survey was conducted among postmenopausal women in four European countries (Germany, Denmark, Italy and the UK), including a total of 465 respondents. RESULTS: The declared acceptability of isoflavones was highest in Germany (80%), followed by Italy (75%), the UK (59%) and Denmark (55%; p < 0.001). Among other factors, prior information about isoflavones (odds ratio (OR) 2.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-4.51, p < 0.001) and belief that foods can be used to treat medical conditions (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.17-4.05, p = 0.014) were the strongest predictors of potential acceptability. The preferred forms in which isoflavones might be taken differed markedly between countries. CONCLUSIONS: Information about the health effects of isoflavones and health-diet links should be considered the most important factors in attempts to influence the potential acceptability of isoflavone products. Foods enriched with isoflavones need to be developed with regard to specific cultural demands in order to assure consumer acceptance on the marketplace.",Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,2005 Sep,England,2005,00

17458704,Social determinants of the health of urban populations: methodologic considerations.,"A full understanding of the role of the urban environment in shaping the health of populations requires consideration of different features of the urban environment that may influence population health. The social environment is key to understanding the way in which cities affect the health of populations. Social determinants of health (SDH) are important, generally, yet can have different effects in different settings from urban to rural, between countries, between cities, and within cities. Failure to acknowledge, and more importantly, to understand the role of SDH in health and access to health and social services will hamper any effort to improve the health of the population. In this paper, we will briefly summarize a few key SDH and their measurement. We will also consider methodologic tools and some methodologic challenges. The concepts presented here are broadly applicable to a variety of settings: developed and developing countries, slum areas, inner cities, middle income neighborhoods, and even higher income neighborhoods. However, our focus will be on some of the more vulnerable urban populations who are most profoundly affected by SDH.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2007 May,United States,2007,00
16195528,Use of discretionary protective equipment in high school athletes: prevalence and determinants.,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to describe the use of discretionary protective equipment among high school athletes and to examine social and behavioral determinants contributing to equipment usage. METHODS: We analyzed data from a 3-year (1996-1999), stratified, 2-stage cluster sample of athletes engaged in 12 organized sports in 100 North Carolina high schools (n=19728 athlete-seasons) (an athlete-season represents an individual student who participates in a particular sport in a particular season). We used generalized logistic regression to model the association of social and behavioral determinants and demographic variables with discretionary protective equipment use. RESULTS: About one third of high school athletes self-reported using lower extremity discretionary protective equipment. Girls, seniors, those who played limited-contact sports, and those who played multiple sports reported higher usage. Small school size, low player/coach ratio, high proportion of team usage, and history of previous lower extremity injury were important predictors of usage. Coaches' experience, qualifications, and training, however, were not predictive of usage. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention efforts to promote use of discretionary protective equipment need to target school-level factors and should consider both team requirements and the role of peers in setting and reinforcing norms.",American journal of public health,2005 Nov,United States,2005,00
10899475,The determinants of sexual intercourse before age 16.,"PURPOSE: To identify risk and protective factors for initiation of sexual intercourse before age 16 years at the level of the individual, family, and school. METHODS: A longitudinal study based on a cohort of 1020 people born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972/73 and followed up to age 21 years. Demographic characteristics of the sample were similar to the New Zealand population of that age, except that a smaller proportion (3%) were Maori or Pacific Island Polynesian. Information on individual, family and school factors was collected by interview with parents at ages 3, 5, 7 and 9 years and then by postal questionnaire two-yearly up to 15 years. Subjects were assessed two-yearly from age 3 years and interviewed about their behaviours and ambitions at ages 11, 13, and 15 years. Questions about age at first intercourse were asked by computer at age 21 years. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model associations with age of first intercourse less than 16 years. RESULTS: Data on age at first intercourse were available for 926/1020 (91%) of surviving members of the cohort assembled at age 3 years. Overall 27.5% of males and 31.7% of females reported sexual intercourse before age 16 years. In multivariate analyses the independent predictors for early sexual initiation for males were: not having outside home interests at age 13 years, no religious activity at age 11 years, not being attached to school at age 15 years, a low reading score, and a diagnosis of conduct disorder in early adolescence. For females, independent predictors were: socioeconomic status in the middle range, mother having her first child before age 20 years, IQ in the middle range, not being attached to school, being in trouble at school, planning to leave school early, cigarette smoking and higher self-esteem score. CONCLUSIONS: Individual and school factors appear to be more important than family composition or socioeconomic status in the decision to have sexual intercourse before age 16 years. The lowering of age at first intercourse may be partly a cohort effect related to high rates of teenage childbearing in the mothers' generation, and to changes in social acceptability of early sexual behaviour.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,2000 Aug,United States,2000,00
19579152,Low back pain and determinants of sickness absence.,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is a frequent diagnosis for sickness absence. The process of sick-listing is complex, and the doctor must integrate information from several levels in the decision. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe the main determinants of sickness absence for LBP. METHODS: We conducted a non-systematic search in Medline and personal files to identify determinants of sickness absence, and structured these into four levels of the sick-listing process. These levels are characteristics of 1) the sick-listed worker, 2) the sick-listing doctor, 3) the workplace, and 4) the cultural and economic conditions of the society. RESULTS: Important characteristics of the sick-listed person seem to be poor mental health, including negative beliefs about LBP. Also, comorbidity and lack of coping abilities are found associated to sickness absence. The impact of the doctors' personal beliefs about LBP is not clear. Doctors in general seem to be frustrated by their gatekeeper role and the influence of other healthcare providers on the sick-listing decision. The workplace is an important factor in the sick-listing process, but the impact of physical working conditions is of less importance than social support, job control, and demands. On the society level, the economic awards in sickness absence and the general acceptance of being sick listed seem to be of importance for the individual's decision to claim sick leave. CONCLUSION: The sick-listing process for LBP is complex, and the determinants are mostly non-medical. It seems important to adopt a broad perspective of how a worker copes with pain and how these coping strategies interact with cultural, economic, and societal determinants of sickness certification.",The European journal of general practice,2009,England,2009,00
11039078,"Male pseudohermaphroditism due to 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency. Diagnosis, psychological evaluation, and management.","Ten male pseudohermaphrodites with 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 (17 beta-HSD3) deficiency were evaluated in 1 clinic with an average follow-up of 10.1 years. The diagnoses were made by demonstrating low to normal serum testosterone levels, high androstenedione levels, and high ratios of serum androstenedione to testosterone in the basal state or after treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin. The molecular features of the underlying mutations were identified in all 7 families. Two additional males in the same families are believed to be affected on the basis of history obtained from family members. All of the 46,XY individuals in these families were registered at birth and raised as females (despite the presence of ambiguous genitalia in all or most), and all virilized after the time of expected puberty due to a rise in serum testosterone to or toward the normal male range. The age at diagnosis varied from 4 to 37 years. Ten individuals were studied by the same psychologist, and change of gender role (social sex) from female to male occurred in 3 subjects and in the 2 presumed affected subjects not studied. The individual with the highest serum testosterone level maintained female sexual identity, and in 2 families some of the affected males changed gender role and others did not. Thus, while androgen action plays a role in the process, additional undefined psychological, social, and/or biologic factors must be determinants of gender identity/role behavior. Management of the 7 individuals who chose to maintain female sex roles included castration, clitoroplasty, vaginal enlargement procedures when appropriate, treatment of hirsutism, cricoid cartilage reduction, and estrogen replacement. Three of the 7 are married (2 twice), 1 is involved in a long-term heterosexual relationship, 1 is engaged to be married, and the other 2 are not married and not believed to be sexually active. The 3 subjects who changed gender role behavior to male underwent hypospadias repair, and 1 was given supplemental testosterone therapy. One of these men is divorced, and the other 2 (aged 29 and 35 years) are unmarried. The diagnosis in 8 of these subjects was made after the time of expected puberty; it is unclear whether the functional and social outcomes would have been different if the diagnosis had been made and therapy begun earlier in life.",Medicine,2000 Sep,United States,2000,00
19702379,"How does sexual minority stigma ""get under the skin""? A psychological mediation framework.","Sexual minorities are at increased risk for multiple mental health burdens compared with heterosexuals. The field has identified 2 distinct determinants of this risk, including group-specific minority stressors and general psychological processes that are common across sexual orientations. The goal of the present article is to develop a theoretical framework that integrates the important insights from these literatures. The framework postulates that (a) sexual minorities confront increased stress exposure resulting from stigma; (b) this stigma-related stress creates elevations in general emotion dysregulation, social/interpersonal problems, and cognitive processes conferring risk for psychopathology; and (c) these processes in turn mediate the relationship between stigma-related stress and psychopathology. It is argued that this framework can, theoretically, illuminate how stigma adversely affects mental health and, practically, inform clinical interventions. Evidence for the predictive validity of this framework is reviewed, with particular attention paid to illustrative examples from research on depression, anxiety, and alcohol-use disorders.",Psychological bulletin,2009 Sep,United States,2009,00
16097270,[Social and individual determinants of tobacco consumption in early adolescence].,"OBJECTIVES: We examined the structure of individual and social determinants of tobacco consumption in early adolescence. METHODS: Participants were drawn from a longitudinal study of a birth cohort of originally 384 children at risk for psychopathology. At the age of 15 years, adolescents completed self-report questionnaires measuring their tobacco consumption, smoking-related attitudes (self-efficacy and outcome expectancies), and the smoking behaviour of their friends and parents. RESULTS: About 60% of the 15-year olds reported ever having used tobacco, while nearly 16% reported that they smoked daily. Both smoking-related self-efficacy and peer smoking were most strongly related to early use of tobacco by males and females. Adolescents with a low level of self-efficacy and a large number of friends who smoke were at the greatest risk. While peer smoking influenced both, adolescent smoking and smoking-related attitudes, parental smoking exerted only a minor direct effect on tobacco use among 15-year olds. CONCLUSIONS: The smoking level and smoking-related attitudes during early adolescence are strongly influenced by the smoking habits of one's peers.",Zeitschrift fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie,2005 Jul,Switzerland,2005,00

20690286,"Social, economic and demographic determinants of sexual risk behaviors among men in rural Malawi: A district-level study.","Data from a survey of 715 men aged 20-44 from Mangochi district of Malawi were used to assess the sociodemographic and economic determinants of (1) having ever paid for sex, (2) total number of sex partners in the past year, and (3) having ever used condoms. Different individual characteristics were associated with each of these sexual behaviors. Polygamy and being a fisherman who has left home for over a month in the past year for work reasons were both positively associated with having ever paid for sex, whereas those with more household wealth were less likely to have paid for sex. The influence of education, age, age at sexual initiation, Muslim religion, polygamy, occupation, and having ever paid for sex on total number of sexual partners in the past year are all evident. Finally, secondary education, work-related migration, and having ever paid for sex were significantly associated with having used condoms.",African journal of reproductive health,2007 Aug,Nigeria,2007,00
18278290,Determinants of early cognitive development: hierarchical analysis of a longitudinal study.,"The study describes the relationship between anthropometric status, socioeconomic conditions, and quality of home environment and child cognitive development in 320 children from 20 to 42 months of age, randomly selected from 20,000 households that represent the range of socioeconomic and environmental conditions in Salvador, Bahia, Northeast Brazil. The inclusion criterion was to be less than 42 months of age between January and July 1999. Child cognitive development was assessed using the Bayley Scales for Infant Development, and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory (HOME) was applied to assess quality of home environment. Anthropometric status was measured using the indicators weight/age and height/age ratios (z-scores), and socioeconomic data were collected through a standard questionnaire. Statistical analysis was conducted through univariate and hierarchical linear regression. Socioeconomic factors were found to have an indirect impact on early cognitive development mediated by the child's proximal environment factors, such as appropriate play materials and games available and school attendance. No independent association was seen between nutritional status and early cognitive development.",Cadernos de saude publica,2008 Feb,Brazil,2008,00
15469413,Rationale and study design of the CardioGene Study: genomics of in-stent restenosis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: in-stent restenosis is a major limitation of stent therapy for atherosclerosis coronary artery disease. The CardioGene Study is an ongoing study of restenosis in bare mental stents (BMS) for the treatment of coronary artery disease. The overall goal is to understand the genetic determinants of the responses to vascular injury that result in the development of restenosis in some patients but not in others. Gene expression profiling at transcriptional and translational levels provides global assessment of gene activity after vascular injury and mechanistic insight. Furthermore, the delineation of genetic biomarkers would be of value in the clinical setting of risk-stratify patients prior to stent therapy. Prospective risk stratification would allow for the rational selection of specialized treatments against the development of in-stent restenosis (ISR), such as drug-eluting stents. SETTING: Patients are enrolled at two sites in the US with high-volume cardiac catheterization facilities: the William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, MI, USA, and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, USA. STUDY DESIGN: Two complementary study designs are used to understand the molecular mechanisms of restenosis and the genetic biomarkers predictive of restenosis. First, 350 patients are enrolled prospectively at the time of stent implantation. Blood is sampled prior to stent placement and afterwards at 2 weeks and 6 months. The clinical outcome of restenosis is determined 6 and 12 months after stent placement. The primary outcome is clinical restenosis at 6 months. The major secondary outcome is clinical restenosis at 12 months. Second, a corollary case-control analysis will be carried out with the enrollment of an additional 250 cases with a history of recurrent restenosis after treatment with BMS. Controls for this analysis are derived from the prospective cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting to the cardiac catheterization laboratory are screened, informed about the study and enrolled after signing the consent form. Enrollment has been completed for the prospective cohort, and enrollment of the additional group is ongoing. A standardized questionnaire is used to collect clinical data primarily through direct patient interview to assess medical history, medication use, functional status, family history, environmental factors, and social history. Further data are abstracted from the medical charts and catheterization reports. A total of 276 clinical variables are collected per individual at baseline, and 49 variables are collected at each of the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. A Clinical Events Committee adjudicates clinical outcomes. Blood samples are processed at each clinical enrollment site using standardized operating procedures. From each blood sample, several aliquots are prepared and stored of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, granulocytes, platelets, serum, and plasma. Additionally, a portion of each patient's leukocytes is cryopreserved for future cell-line creation. Samples are frozen and shipped to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Additional materials generated in the analysis of the samples at the NHLBI are frozen and stored, including isolated genomic DNA, total RNA, reverse transcribed cDNA libraries and labeled RNA hybridization mixtures used in microarray analysis. Per individual in the prospective cohort, high-quality transcript profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells at each time of blood sampling are obtained using Affymetrix U133A microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Per chip, this yields 495,930 features per individual per time of sampling. This represents expression levels for 22,283 genes per patients oer time of blood sampling, including 14,500 well-characterized human genes. Proteomics of plasma is performed with multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Protein expression is examined similarly to mRNA expression as a measure of gene expression. Genotyping is performed in two manners. First, those genes showing differential expression at the levels of mRNA and protein are investigated using a candidate gene approach. Specific variants in known gene regulatory regions, such as promoters, are sought initially, as those variants may explain differences in expression level. Second, a genome-wide scan is used to identify genetic loci that are associated with ISR. Those regions identified are further examined for genes that show differential expression in the mRNA microarray profiling or proteomics investigations. These genes are finely investigated for candidate SNPs and other gene variants. Complementary genomic and proteomic approaches are expected to be robust. Integration of data sets is accomplished using a variety of informatics tools, organization of gene expression into functional pathways, and investigation of physical maps of up- and downregulated sets of genes. CONCLUSIONS: The CardioGene Study is designed to understand ISR. Global gene and protein expression profiling define molecular phenotypes of patients. Well-defined clinical phenotypes will be paired with genomic data to define analyses aimed to achieve several goals. These include determining blood gene and protein expression in patients with ISR, investigating the genetic basis of ISR, developing predictive gene and protein biomarkers, and the identification of new targets for treatment.",Pharmacogenomics,2004 Oct,England,2004,00
17615903,Gender differences in determinants and consequences of health and illness.,"This paper uses a framework developed for gender and tropical diseases for the analysis of non-communicable diseases and conditions in developing and industrialized countries. The framework illustrates that gender interacts with the social, economic and biological determinants and consequences of tropical diseases to create different health outcomes for males and females. Whereas the framework was previously limited to developing countries where tropical infectious diseases are more prevalent, the present paper demonstrates that gender has an important effect on the determinants and consequences of health and illness in industrialized countries as well. This paper reviews a large number of studies on the interaction between gender and the determinants and consequences of chronic diseases and shows how these interactions result in different approaches to prevention, treatment, and coping with illness. Specific examples of chronic diseases are discussed in each section with respect to both developing and industrialized countries.","Journal of health, population, and nutrition",2007 Mar,Bangladesh,2007,00
18272938,Determinants of antenatal morbidity: a multivariate analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to investigate the potential risk factors for developing complications and their magnitude during the antenatal period. METHODOLOGY: The data used in this paper came from a prospective survey in rural areas of Bangladesh conducted by the Bangladesh Institute of Research for Promotion of Essential and Reproductive Health and Technologies (BIRPERHT) between November 1992 and December 1993. The differential patterns were analyzed for respondents' selected characteristics, and multivariate analysis was performed employing logistic regression and proportional hazards models for life-threatening and high-risk complications during pregnancy. RESULTS: For life-threatening complications during pregnancy, several factors emerged as potential risk factors, such as number of the pregnancy, age at marriage, duration of pregnancy, economic status and history of anemia prior to the index pregnancy. The last two covariates were associated only in the proportional hazards. Potential risk factors for high-risk complications during pregnancy were level of education, age at marriage, wanted pregnancy, duration of pregnancy and economic status. CONCLUSIONS: Health planners and policy makers in developing countries are trying to facilitate health services at the doorsteps of rural people. Our findings will help them understand the magnitude and underlying determinants of maternal morbidities and help their health planning process to reduce both life-threatening and high-risk complications during the antenatal period. Early age at marriage needs to be prevented through encouragement of girls' education as well as through increased social awareness programs. An effective quick referral mechanism should be developed to provide emergency services to high risk-groups. Finally, the importance of additional food supplements needs to be promoted during antenatal care visits as well as through mass media in order to reach people living in remote areas of rural Bangladesh.",World health & population,2007,Canada,2007,00
10705354,"Epidemiology, stage at diagnosis, and tumor biology of breast carcinoma in multiracial and multiethnic populations.","All women, regardless of their racial or ethnic origin or heritage, are at risk of developing breast cancer. Variations in breast carcinoma incidence rates among multicultural populations suggest that etiologic factors differ in their biologic expression and impact on disease outcome. Key among those factors that affect breast carcinoma development are the roles of genetics and the environment, the reproductive experience and the effects of endogenous and exogenous hormones in women, the change in immune status and host vulnerability, and the biologic determinants of breast carcinoma. Cultural dynamics, sociodemographic differences, and behavioral characteristics across population subgroups modulate how biologic disease is expressed among different races and ethnic groups. These interactions contribute to the observed variations in breast carcinoma incidence, mortality, and survival. Stage, a measure of disease status, is used to assess prognosis, plan treatment, and evaluate outcome. Numerous studies have reported a more advanced stage of breast carcinoma at diagnosis in racial/ethnic subgroups, especially among women from African American, Hispanic, American Indian, and native Hawaiian cultures. Factors associated with advanced stage at diagnosis in multicultural populations range from changes in the basic biological characteristics at the molecular and cellular level, to more complex behavioral attributes unique to a particular multicultural population, to societal issues-such as access to care and socioeconomic conditions-all of which impact on the health measure called ""stage at diagnosis."" Rapid advancements in knowledge of cancer biology and of genetic markers and tumor products are providing new mechanisms for identifying etiologic pathways that can be utilized for better screening, detection, treatment and monitoring of disease. Further studies are needed that evaluate the biologic and molecular alterations in tumor development, progression, and response to therapy. Public health attention needs to be directed toward the societal influences that impact breast carcinoma development, as well as augmenting recognition of the need for culturally appropriate, broad-based behavioral changes at the community level. In addition, continued efforts are needed to ensure the inclusion of multicultural population subgroups and minority investigators in all aspects of research-basic, clinical and applied.",Cancer,2000 Mar 1,United States,2000,00
25870883,Understanding fatalism in HIV/AIDS protection: the individual in dialogue with contextual factors.,"Many people remain at risk of becoming HIV-infected despite large-scale prevention efforts. An exploratory study was conducted to investigate the determinants of a fatalistic attitude towards protecting the self from HIV/AIDS. The study utilised the Human Sciences Research Council's national, representative EPOP-survey among South African adults age 18 and over (n = 2 494). Frequencies were calculated for all the items, and scales were compiled for perceived hopelessness, self-efficacy to effect change and future goals. Chi-square analysis was conducted between indicators of fatalism and demographic variables. A sequential logistic regression analysis was applied to the variables: feelings of hopelessness, self-efficacy, future goals and socio-demographics, as possible determinants of a fatalistic view about protecting one's self from HIV/AIDS. About 30% of the South African adult population aged 18 and over indicated such a fatalistic view. The results of logistic regression indicated that participants who reported a low level of self-efficacy to effect change, a low living standard, feelings of hopelessness, and unclear future goals were more likely to express a fatalistic attitude towards HIV/AIDS protection than others. A better balance is required between a focus on individual risk factors and an understanding of the processes through which individuals are affected by socio-economic, cultural and political contexts. On the individual level, general resources for living need to be developed, while the altering of contexts and structures in which communities function is crucial. A person-centred development framework in support of health and well-being could augur well for HIV prevention.",African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,2005 Nov,South Africa,2005,00
18023910,Association of psychosocial factors with anxiety and depressive symptoms in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate association of psychosocial factors with anxiety and depressive symptoms in Chinese type 2 diabetes patients. METHODS: Three hundred and four type 2 diabetes patients were inquired with a structured questionnaire about socio-demographic characteristics, psychological stress, coping styles, social support, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Multiple regression analysis was performed to assess the association of these psychosocial factors with anxiety and depressive symptoms after controlling for potential confounding factors of sex, age, educational level, etc. RESULTS: After adjusting for the potential confounding factors, multiple stepwise regression analysis found that anxiety symptoms were significantly positively associated with ""worrying about to be harmed by the disease"", ""social/family crisis caused by the disease"", ""worrying about declining in body/physical function"", ""declined economic condition caused by the disease"" and ""negative coping styles""; and depression symptoms were significantly positively associated with ""worrying about to be harmed by the disease"", ""worrying about declining in body/physical function"", ""social/family crisis caused by the disease"", ""declined economic condition"", ""negative coping styles"", but negatively with ""active coping styles"" and ""subjective social support"".

16507499,HIV epidemic in Estonia in the third decade of the AIDS era.,"This article describes current trends of HIV/AIDS and related conditions in Estonia, with the aim of highlighting key determinants in transmission dynamics and risk groups, problems and barriers of combating HIV/AIDS, and possible implications for prevention and control. Throughout the transition period Estonia has experienced major changes in political, economic, and social structure which all have contributed to increased violence, high-risk sexual behaviour, and substance abuse. Incidences of hepatitis B, C and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) increased in the early 1990s. HIV outbreaks were first detected among injecting drug users (IDUs) in 2000 and are still concentrated among this population group. High rates of sexual risk behaviour and inadequate knowledge regarding prevention of disease transmission in Estonia emphasizes the threat of a sex-related and STI facilitated driven HIV epidemic. To prevent further spread of HIV it is necessary to implement harm reduction interventions among IDUs. However, without effective management of socioeconomic and administrative barriers to health care and other services, an explicit policy on drugs will not reach marginalized groups and will not be able to prevent a further spread of these interrelated epidemics.",Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,2006,England,2006,00
11338739,Making a difference to the socioeconomic determinants of health: policy responses and intervention options.,"APACPH has previously highlighted the profound effect of global economic change on increasing health disparities in most countries in the Asian Pacific Region of the world, with those citizens who are most disadvantaged and vulnerable, suffering most. This presentation identifies two key issues that should underpin efforts to reduce socioeconomic health disparities: (1) the current evidence base on policies and interventions successful in reducing inequalities; and, (2) how to implement such strategies. Actions to reduce such disparities should ideally include: (1) changes in macro-level social and economic policies, (2) improving living and working conditions, (3) strengthening communities for health, (4) influencing behavioural risk factors, (5) strengthening individuals and their social networks, and (5) an improved response from the health care system and associated services. Other than a few notable exceptions, few countries have developed a coordinated and integrated approach to addressing health inequalities. However, previously successful public health interventions represent a good starting point. Health professionals have an important role to play in not only recognising that the determinants of health are rooted in the economic, social and cultural fabric of our society, but in supporting and advocating strategies and approaches that lie upstream from the health care system.",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,2000,China,2000,00
11106011,The common risk factor approach: a rational basis for promoting oral health.,"Conventional oral health education is not effective nor efficient. Many oral health programmes are developed and implemented in isolation from other health programmes. This often leads, at best to a duplication of effort, or worse, conflicting messages being delivered to the public. In addition, oral health programmes tend to concentrate on individual behaviour change and largely ignore the influence of socio-political factors as the key determinants of health. Based upon the general principles of health promotion this paper presents a rationale for an alternative approach for oral health policy. The common risk factor approach addresses risk factors common to many chronic conditions within the context of the wider socio-environmental milieu. Oral health is determined by diet, hygiene, smoking, alcohol use, stress and trauma. As these causes are common to a number of other chronic diseases, adopting a collaborative approach is more rational than one that is disease specific. The common risk factor approach can be implemented in a variety of ways. Food policy development and the Health Promoting Schools initiative are used as examples of effective ways of promoting oral health.",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,2000 Dec,Denmark,2000,00
18257061,Socioenvironmental conditions and nutritional status in urban and rural schoolchildren.,"We analyzed the nutritional status of urban and rural schoolchildren from Mendoza (Argentina), but avoided rural and urban categorization by generating subpopulations as a function of their socioenvironmental characteristics. We transformed weight and height data into z-scores using the CDC/NCHS growth charts; defined underweight, stunting, and wasting by z-scores of less than -2 SD; and calculated overweight and obesity, according to the cutoff proposed by the International Obesity Task Force. Socioenvironmental characteristics included housing, public services, parental resources, and farming practices; we processed these variables by categorical principal-component analysis. The two first axes defined four subgroups of schoolchildren: three of these were associated with urban characteristics, while the remaining subgroup was considered rural. Nutritional status differed across groups, whereas overweight was similar among the groups and obesity higher in urban middle-income children. Urban differences were manifested mainly as underweight, but rural children exhibited the greatest stunting and wasting. Thus, the negative effects of environment on nutritional status in children are not restricted to poor periurban and rural areas, though these are indeed unfavorable environments for growth: some urban families provide children with sufficient quantity and diversity of foods to expose them to obesity. By contrast, the more affluent urban families would appear to have greater possibilities for allowing their children to adopt a healthy life-style. Although the causes of differences in nutritional status between middle- and high-income urban groups are not clear, these determinants probably involve economic as well as educational influences.",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,2008 Jul-Aug,United States,2008,00
14533721,Visual disturbances in a population-based survey of 6962 subjects: the German National Health Examination Survey 1998.,"BACKGROUND: Available prevalence estimates of visual disturbances (excluding blindness) in Germany are based on data from highly selective populations. This report describes the prevalence of visual disturbances and potential determinants based on the German National Health Examination Survey from 1998. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study of the non-institutionalized population in unified Germany. People aged 18-79 years were eligible and were contacted by a multi-mode approach. The response proportion was 61%, resulting in a sample of 7124 subjects who participated in the study. Visual disturbances were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Prevalance rates are higher among women in unified as well as in East- and West Germany. The higher overall prevalence rates among women is mostly driven by higher prevalance rates at ages 18-49 years, especially for shortsightedness. The prevalence rates are higher in West Germany than East Germany. Visual disturbances are more prevalent among the middle and upper social class than the lower social class. Above the age group 40-44, the prevalence of visual disturbances considerably increases, to approximately 100% in the age group 55 years or older for both sexes and in both parts of Germany. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 100% of German adults aged 50-79 years have some degree of visual disturbance that requires refractive correction. Prevalence rates of visual disturbances are higher among people from West Germany, people of higher social status and among women. Uncorrected visual disturbances are most prevalent in the age group 18-34 years and more often among males and subjects of lower social status.",European journal of public health,2003 Sep,England,2003,00
12807093,"Do Dutch 11-12 years olds who never smoke, smoke experimentally or smoke regularly have different demographic backgrounds and perceptions of smoking?","BACKGROUND: Most adolescent smokers start smoking before the age of twelve. Little is known about the behavioural smoking determinants of Dutch primary school children. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on a sample of students from the final year of 143 Dutch primary schools. A total of 3700 students (mean age = 11.6 years) completed a questionnaire based on the ASE model, measuring the attitude, social influences and self-efficacy expectations concerning smoking. RESULTS: Students were categorized as never smokers (64.3%), experimental smokers (28.0%), and regular smokers (7.8%). Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that never smokers were younger, and were more often female, religious and from two-parent families than experimental smokers. Never smokers perceived more disadvantages, long-term physical consequences, more negative social norms and less pressure regarding smoking, higher self-efficacy expectations towards non-smoking, and had fewer parents, siblings or best friends who smoked. Looking at differences between experimental and regular smokers showed that experimental smokers received less pocket money. They also perceived more disadvantages, fewer advantages, more negative social norms and less pressure towards smoking, higher self-efficacy expectations towards non-smoking, and were less likely to be surrounded by friends, peers, family or teachers who smoked. Generally, the low scores for physical consequences and risk perception regarding addiction were striking. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking prevention aimed at primary schoolchildren should consider the different smoking categories, with their specific motives and influences. For instance, the influences on smoking initiation of parents, siblings and best friends suggest more comprehensive programmes aimed at the entire family. Youngsters' ignorance of addiction needs more attention.",European journal of public health,2003 Jun,England,2003,00
18833350,"Transdisciplinary research strategies for understanding socially patterned disease: the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress (ACCESS) project as a case study.","As we have seen a global increase in asthma in the past three decades it has also become clear that it is a socially patterned disease, based on demographic and socioeconomic indicators clustered by areas of residence. This trend is not readily explained by traditional genetic paradigms or physical environmental exposures when considered alone. This has led to consideration of the interplay among physical and psychosocial environmental hazards and the molecular and genetic determinants of risk (i.e., biomedical framing) within the broader socioenvironmental context including socioeconomic position as an upstream ""cause of the causes"" (i.e., ecological framing). Transdisciplinary research strategies or programs that embrace this complexity through a shared conceptual framework that integrates diverse discipline-specific theories, models, measures, and analytical methods into ongoing asthma research may contribute most significantly toward furthering our understanding of socially patterned disease.

This article examines race-based residential segregation as a fundamental cause of racial disparities, shaping differences in exposure to, and experiences of, diseases and risk factors. The spatial distribution of racial groups, specifically the residential segregation of African Americans in aging urban areas, contributes to disparities in health by influencing access to economic, social, and physical resources essential to health. Using the Detroit metropolitan area as a case study, this article looks at the influences of the distribution of African American and white residents on access to these resources and discusses the implications for urban policies to reduce racial disparities in health status.",The Milbank quarterly,2002,United States,2002,00
16146666,Understanding health behavior change among couples: an interdependence and communal coping approach.,"Marriage is a ubiquitous social status that consistently is linked to health. Despite this, there has been very little theory development or related research on the extent to which couple members are jointly motivated to and actively engage in health-enhancing behaviors. In this paper we propose an integrative model, based on interdependence theory and communal coping perspectives, that explicitly considers dyadic processes as determinants of couple behavior. Our integrated model applies these constructs to consider how couple dynamics might influence adoption of risk-reducing health habits. Accordingly, we suggest that the couple's interdependence can transform motivation from doing what is in the best interest of the self (person-centered), to doing even selfless actions that are best for the continuation of the relationship (relationship-centered). In turn, this transformation can lead to enhanced motivation for the couple to cope communally or act cooperatively in adopting health-enhancing behavior change. Implications for research related to couples and health behavior change are also highlighted.",Social science & medicine (1982),2006 Mar,England,2006,00
19733426,Disentangling the relative influence of built and socioeconomic environments on walking: the contribution of areas homogenous along exposures of interest.,"The geography of small areas has important implications for studying the contextual determinants of health because of potential errors when measuring ecologic exposures and estimating their effects on health. In this paper, we present an approach for designing homogeneous zones optimising the spatial distribution of an area-level exposure, active living potential (ALP), based on data collected in Montreal, Canada. The objectives are to (1) assess and compare variation in walking behaviours between these purposefully designed zones and between standard administrative units, census tracts; and (2) disentangle the relative influence of ALP and area-level socioeconomic conditions on walking using the alternative geographies. Zones were designed by statistically classifying smallest census areas (disseminations areas) into seven categories of exposure similar along three indicators of ALP: population density, land use mix, and geographic accessibility to services. Mapping of categories resulted in the delineation of zones characterised by one of seven levels of ALP. A sample of 2716 adults aged >/=45 years was geocoded and cross-classified in 270 zones and 112 census tracts. Individuals reported on minutes and motives of walking and provided socioeconomic information. Data were analysed using cross-classified multilevel models. Variation in utilitarian walking was larger across the purposefully defined zones than across census tracts. Total walking varied significantly between census tracts only. Greater ALP was associated with more utilitarian walking but with less recreational walking. Higher socioeconomic position in census tracts was positively associated with total, utilitarian, and recreational walking. The soundness of standard administrative units for measuring ecologic exposure and their associations with health should be considered prior to conducting analyses. The added value of different approaches for understanding how place relates to health remains to be established and should be the focus of further investigations.",Social science & medicine (1982),2009 Nov,England,2009,00
11327139,Perceived control in relation to socioeconomic and behavioral resources for health.,"Perceived control is a personality characteristic that contributes to well-being, but few studies have attempted to integrate the functions of perceived control with those of other determinants of health. This research tested two hypotheses about the functions of perceived control: (a) individual differences in perceived control would account for socioeconomic differences in self-rated health status; (b) performance of health-related behaviors would account for the health benefits of perceived control. Using data from adult, nonproxy respondents in the National Population Health Survey of Canada (1995; n = 11, 110), confirmatory factor analysis supported a measurement model of self-rated health status composed of two correlated factors: physical health (i.e., chronic conditions. restricted activities, self-rated general health, physical functional capacity) and mental health (i.e., distress, depression). Structural equation modeling supported the first hypothesis, but not the second, regarding perceived control as a determinant of self-rated physical and mental health. Health-related behaviors partially mediated age differences in self-rated health, but different behaviors functioned in this way for men than for women. The findings suggest that psychological process, that of perceiving control over life events, underlies social inequality in health. Health-related behaviors appear not to serve as the primary mechanism through which perceived control influences health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2001 Jun,England,2001,00
18520717,Hypertension and socioeconomic status.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The impact of socioeconomic status on hypertension is complicated and unclear. In this article, we review the findings of recently published studies pertaining to the association between socioeconomic status and hypertension. Specifically, we focus on several potentially modifiable modes of pathogenesis involved in this association, including education, occupation, and social environment. We also review several mechanisms through which the effects of socioeconomic status on hypertension may be mediated. RECENT FINDINGS: Several modifiable socioeconomic determinants, such as education and occupation, are associated with hypertension. Additional socioeconomic status markers such as urban or rural dwelling and individual, local or national economic conditions are also associated with hypertension, although these associations are complicated and at times somewhat contradictory. Possible explanations for this impact include awareness of hypertension prevention and control and better accessibility and adherence to medical treatment among higher socioeconomic status groups, as well as low birth weight and higher job strain among lower socioeconomic status groups. SUMMARY: Low socioeconomic status is associated with higher blood pressure. There is a need to develop and test culturally appropriate interventions to reduce the prevalence of hypertension among these populations to minimize the resultant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",Current opinion in cardiology,2008 Jul,United States,2008,00
18649984,Does place explain racial health disparities? Quantifying the contribution of residential context to the Black/white health gap in the United States.,"The persistence of the black health disadvantage has been a puzzling component of health in the United States in spite of general declines in rates of morbidity and mortality over the past century. Studies that have focused on well-established individual-level determinants of health such as socio-economic status and health behaviors have been unable to fully explain these disparities. Recent research has begun to focus on other factors such as racism, discrimination, and segregation. Variation in neighborhood context-socio-demographic composition, social aspects, and built environment-has been postulated as an additional explanation for racial disparities, but few attempts have been made to quantify its overall contribution to the black/white health gap. This analysis is an attempt to generate an estimate of place effects on explaining health disparities by utilizing data from the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (1989-1994), combined with a methodology for identifying residents of the same blocks both within and across NHIS survey cross-sections. Our results indicate that controlling for a single point-in-time measure of residential context results in a roughly 15-76% reduction of the black/white disparities in self-rated health that were previously unaccounted for by individual-level controls. The contribution of residential context toward explaining the black/white self-rated health gap varies by both age and gender such that contextual explanations of disparities decline with age and appear to be smaller among females.",Social science & medicine (1982),2008 Oct,England,2008,00
11983847,High physical work load and low job satisfaction increase the risk of sickness absence due to low back pain: results of a prospective cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physical and psychosocial load at work influence sickness absence due to low back pain. METHODS: The research was a part of the study on musculoskeletal disorders, absenteeism, stress, and health (SMASH), a 3 year prospective cohort study on risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders. Workers from 21 companies located throughout The Netherlands participated in the part of this study on sickness absence due to low back pain. The study population consisted of 732 workers with no sickness absences of 3 days or longer due to low back pain in the 3 months before the baseline survey and complete data on the reasons for absences during the follow up period. The mean (range) period of follow up in this group was 37 (7-44) months. Physical load at work was assessed by analyses of video recordings. Baseline information on psychosocial work characteristics was obtained by a questionnaire. Data on sickness absence were collected from company records. The main outcome measure was the rate of sickness absences of 3 days or longer due to low back pain during the follow up period. RESULTS: After adjustment of the work related physical and psychosocial factors for each other and for other potential determinants, significant rate ratios ranging from 2.0 to 3.2 were found for trunk flexion, trunk rotation, lifting, and low job satisfaction. A dose-response relation was found for trunk flexion, but not for trunk rotation or lifting. Non-significant rate ratios of about 1.4 were found for low supervisor support and low coworker support. Quantitative job demands, conflicting demands, decision authority, and skill discretion showed no relation with sickness absence due to low back pain. CONCLUSIONS: Flexion and rotation of the trunk, lifting, and low job satisfaction are risk factors for sickness absence due to low back pain. Some indications of a relation between low social support, either from supervisors or coworkers, and sickness absence due to low back pain are also present.",Occupational and environmental medicine,2002 May,England,2002,00

The study included 564 boys and 548 girls 10-15-years-old. Data on the socio-economic status and dietary habits were collected by means of a diagnostic survey. Dietary habits were determined based on a single 24-hour recall. Results obtained were compared with the RDA for Polish people. The effect of socio-economic and demographic determinants on the pattern of consumption were mogenous clusters each of which corresponded to a specific pattern of consumption. It was demonstrated that standard of living and the father's education exerted a significant effect on the pattern of consumption in adolescents examined.

11529612,Social disadvantage and variation in the incidence of end-stage renal disease in Australian capital cities.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate variation in the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within Australian capital cities. To explore the relation between the incidence of ESRD and socioeconomic disadvantage. METHODS: We obtained data from the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) regarding 5,013 patients from capital cities who started ESRD treatment between 1 April 1993 and 31 December 1998. We used the postcode at the start of treatment to calculate the average annual incidence of ESRD for each of 51 capital city regions using 1996 Census counts based on place of usual residence. We calculated standardised incidence ratios with 95% confidence intervals for each region. The standardised incidence ratios were examined in relation to the SEIFA Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD), derived from the 1996 Census. Low IRSD values indicate more disadvantaged areas. RESULTS: There is significant variation in the standardised incidence of ESRD within capital cities. There was a significant correlation (r=-0.41, p=0.003) between the standardised incidence ratio for ESRD and the SEIFA IRSD. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Capital city areas that are more disadvantaged have a higher incidence of ESRD. Socioeconomic factors may be important determinants of the risk of developing ESRD.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2001 Aug,Australia,2001,00

17374601,Clinical determinants of long-term quality of life after stroke.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine factors that independently predict health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 1 and 3 years after stroke. METHODS: Subjects numbering 397, from a population-based register of first-ever strokes were assessed for HRQOL using the Short Form 36 (SF36) 1 year after stroke. Physical (PHSS) and mental health (MHSS) summary scores were derived from the eight domains of HRQOL in the SF36. Multivariate stepwise regression analyses were conducted to determine independent predictors of these scores; beta coefficients with 95% CI were obtained.beta coefficient is the difference between average value of the variable (e.g. male) and average value under consideration (e.g. female). Demographic and stroke risk factors, neurological impairments and cognitive impairment (MMSE <24) were included in the models. Similar analyses were undertaken on 150 subjects 3 years post-stroke. RESULTS: A year after stroke, independent predictors of the worst PHSS were of females (beta coefficient -3.3: 95% CI -5.7 to -0.8), manual workers (-3.2: -5.9 to -0.4), diabetes (-4.2: -7.7 to -0.8), right hemispheric lesions (-4.9: -8.7 to -1.2), urinary incontinence (-7.8: -11.6 to -4.1) and cognitive impairment (-2.7: -5.5 to -0.1); the worst MHSS were associated with being Asian (-11.8: -20.6 to -3.0), ischaemic heart disease (-2.7: -5.4 to -0.03), cognitive impairment (-3.04: -5.8 to -0.3). Subjects aged 65-75 years (5.4: 2.5 to -8.4) had better MHSS than those <65 years. Three years post-stroke, independent predictors of worse PHSS were hypertension (-8.7: -13.5 to -3.9), urinary incontinence (-8.1: -15 to -1.1) and cognitive impairment (-8.3: -13.2 to -3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of HRQOL vary both over time after stroke and whether physical or psychosocial aspects of HRQOL are being considered. This study provides valuable information on factors predicting long-term HRQOL, which can be taken into consideration in audits of clinical practice or in future interventional studies aiming to improve HRQOL after stroke.",Age and ageing,2007 May,England,2007,00
11990880,The need for mental health promotion.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the concept and evidence for mental health promotion, within an understanding of mental health and mental illness and their determinants. METHOD: A selective review of literature and opinion in the fields of public health and mental health. RESULTS: Mental health and mental illness are often given a low priority, despite growing evidence of the burden of disease and costs to the economy. Improving mental health and reducing mental illness will improve quality of life, public health and productivity. The needs for mental health promotion are complementary to the needs for prevention and treatment of mental illness. The required activities are different. Mental health professionals have a necessary but not sufficient role in mental health promotion. CONCLUSIONS: An understanding that mental illnesses are treatable can encourage early entry to care, improve outcomes and lessen the stigma and discrimination related to mental illness. In primary health care there is some evidence that preventive interventions with groups at high risk of depression can prevent episodes of ill health. However, mental health promotion involves another dimension. Better understanding of the nature of mental health and mental illness is the key to changing the priorities, policies and practices in education, law, social services, housing and health critical in turn to the conditions conducive to mental health.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,2001 Dec,England,2001,00
15671974,Pediatric procedural pain.,"Pain is subjective. The pain response is individual and is learned through social learning and experience. Early pain experiences may play a particularly important role in shaping an individual's pain responses. Painful medical procedures such as immunizations, venipunctures and dental care, and minor emergency department procedures such as laceration repair, compose a significant portion of the average child's experience with painful events. Inadequate relief of pain and distress during childhood painful medical procedures may have long-term negative effects on future pain tolerance and pain responses. This article reviews the evidence for long-term negative effects of inadequately treated procedural pain, the determinants of an individual's pain response, tools to assess pain in children, and interventions to reduce procedural pain and distress. Future research directions and a model for conceptualizing and studying pediatric procedural pain are proposed.",Annals of emergency medicine,2005 Feb,United States,2005,00
12612097,Community participation in a multisectoral intervention to address health determinants in an inner-city community in central Havana.,"It is increasingly acknowledged that the process of community involvement is critical to the successful implementation of community-based health interventions. Between 1995 and 1999, a multisectoral intervention called Plan Cayo Hueso was launched in the inner-city community of Cayo Hueso in Havana, Cuba, to address a variety of health determinants. To provide a better understanding of the political structures and processes involved, the Cuban context is described briefly. The interventions included improvements in housing, municipal infrastructure, and social and cultural activities. A qualitative study, consisting of interviews of key informants as well as community members, was conducted to evaluate the community participatory process. Questions from an extensive household survey pre- and postintervention that had been conducted in Cayo Hueso and a comparison community to assess the effectiveness of the intervention also informed the analysis of community participation, as did three community workshops held to choose indicators for evaluating effectiveness and to discuss findings. It was found that formal leaders led the interventions, providing the institutional driving force behind the plan. However, extensive community involvement occurred as the project took advantage of the existing community-based organizations, which played an active role in mobilizing community members and enhanced linkage systems critical to the project's success. Women played fairly traditional roles in interventions outside their households, but had equivalent roles to men in interventions within their household units. Most impressive about this project was the extent of mobilization to participate and the multidimensional ecosystem approach adopted. Indeed, Plan Cayo Hueso involved a massive mobilization of international, national, and community resources to address the needs of this community. This, as well as the involvement of community residents in the evaluation process, was seen as resulting in improved social interactions and community well-being and enhanced capacity for future action. While Cuba is unique in many respects, the lessons learned about enhancing community participation in urban health intervention projects, as well as in their evaluation, are applicable worldwide.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2003 Mar,United States,2003,00
15018716,"Self-reported health in Poland and the United States: a comparative analysis of demographic, family and socioeconomic influences.","This study compares the social determinants of individual health between the United States, a capitalist society, and Poland, a 'post-communist' society. The effects of demographic factors, family characteristics and socioeconomic status on self-reported health are estimated with OLS regression using data from the 1994 American and Polish General Social Surveys. The results show lower self-reported health and more rapid declines in health for people over 60 in Poland than in the United States. Also, in Poland, women report worse health than do men while the opposite is found for the United States. The relationships between education, income and health were stronger in the United States than in Poland. Age, gender and SES may operate differently in the two countries because of a gap in social development (e.g. varying living standards and styles, health care systems and cultural attitudes) between the West and the former Eastern Europe.","Health (London, England : 1997)",2004 Jan,England,2004,00

Individual behavior and health promotion was critically examined within the context of (HIV) Human Immunodeficiency Virus and AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome) among young African-American men who have sex with men. Examples from the literature provided empirical illustrations of how these concepts have been defined conceptually and measured with respect to HIV/AIDS; particularly among this population from a public health perspective. Additionally, a conceptual model depicting the interplay of these concepts was reviewed and is provided and discussed to shed further light on the conceptual link between these concepts and healthy behaviors among sexually active African-American young men who have sex with men. The concepts are discussed in an integrative format throughout the paper within the backdrop of the proposed model for understanding the wave of HIV/AIDS within this subculture from a public health nursing perspective.",Journal of National Black Nurses' Association : JNBNA,2003 Dec,United States,2003,00
12508329,Determinants of posttraumatic adjustment in adolescents from Sarajevo who experienced war.,"The purpose of this study was to examine risk and protective factors of postwar adjustment among adolescents from Sarajevo who have been exposed to war traumas during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. More specifically, we wanted to examine differential linkages between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms and depression (as outcomes) and (a) war traumas, (b) individual and socioenvironmental factors, and (c) cognitive appraisals and coping mechanisms. Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicate that dimensions of war traumas, individual characteristics, and cognitive appraisals and coping mechanisms play a significant role in determining who will have more serious PTSD symptoms. Although individual and socioenvironmental factors are the strongest predictors of depression, dimensions of war traumas also are significantly correlated with depressive symptoms. Common risk factors for more serious depression and PTSD symptoms in postwar adjustment were female gender and low optimism. While the strongest predictor of posttraumatic stress reactions (PTSR) was trauma experience in the category of loss, the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms was female gender.",Journal of clinical psychology,2003 Jan,United States,2003,00
15687086,Social and behavioral determinants of self-reported STD among adolescents.,"CONTEXT: Adolescents have among the highest sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates. Rich data are now available to characterize the social and behavioral factors that affect adolescent STD risk. METHODS: Data from Wave 1 (1995) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) are used to estimate school, neighborhood, family and individual level effects on acquiring an STD. Data from Waves 1 and 2 (1996) of Add Health are also used to estimate the effects of prior STD acquisition and other factors on STD occurrence between waves. Random intercept logistic regression and random intercept piecewise exponential hazard regression are used to account for possible clustering in the Add Health data. RESULTS: Seven percent of sexually experienced teenagers reported ever having had an STD as of Wave 1, and almost 7% reported having had an STD between Waves 1 and 2. Respondents' age, gender, race or ethnicity, and their family background, neighborhood and school characteristics affect STD acquisition at Wave 1. Among teenagers who were sexually experienced at Wave 1, younger age at first intercourse elevates STD risk. Other factors contribute, but to a lesser degree. For acquisition of an STD between Waves 1 and 2, females, blacks, teenagers with lower levels of mother's education and those who have had a prior STD are at higher risk. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple social and behavioral factors influence lifetime history of STD. Age at first intercourse and STD history affect subsequent STD acquisition. Self-reports of STD acquisition in probability samples of the general population are useful.",Perspectives on sexual and reproductive health,2004 Nov-Dec,United States,2004,00

Further, it was aimed to examine whether ethnic identity is linked to better mental health. METHOD: Consecutive psychiatric primary care patients with Turkish background were screened with the 5-item Acculturation Questionnaire, adopted from the Latin American Validated Acculturation Scale. The interviewed patients were also assessed for psychiatric disorders according to ICD-10. RESULTS: By using the acculturation questionnaire among 220 patients included to this study, 154 (70%) patients, (88 male- 57,14%, mean age:22,1 sd. +/- 3,26 and 66 female- 42,85%, mean age: 21,73 sd. +/- 1,19) were found to be relatively good adjusted (group 1), and of 66 (30%) patients (44 male- 66,6%, mean age:26,3 sd. +/-3,39 and 22 female- 33,3%, mean age:25,88 sd. +/- 3,41) were found to be relatively poor adjusted (group 2) to the host community. The psychiatric co-morbidity showed in these two groups two distinct patterns (p< 0.001). Endogenous depression and the depression caused by the conflicts in the family-milieu are significantly more common in the group I. Unlike, the depression triggered by the psycho-social maladjustment is clearly more prevalent in the group II. The predictors of good adaptation were shown to be: bilingualism, bicultural identity and Germany as country of birth, whereas poor adaptation was related to: dominance of ethnic culture and language, and being born outside of Germany. CONCLUSION: The research presented provides firm evidence for a bicultural identity through assessments of several domains of acculturation: language spoken most of the time, language thought, ethnic identity, birthplace and the degree of adjustment to the host community. Cultural identity is one of the key determinants of mental health in evaluating adaptation to the host culture among immigrants.

15817621,Attitudes towards orthodontic treatment: a comparison of treated and untreated subjects.,"The aims of the present study were to evaluate treated and untreated subjects' attitudes towards orthodontic treatment and to examine possible determinants of these attitudes. It was hypothesized that orthodontically treated individuals would differ from untreated respondents in their attitude towards orthodontists and orthodontic treatment, and that female subjects would have a more positive attitude towards orthodontics than male subjects. Untreated individuals (n = 220) were used as a comparison group in the evaluation of orthodontic health care by previously treated subjects (n = 246). Two questionnaires were completed. The first, based on the Dental Attitude Questionnaire, contained 32 items about general attitude towards orthodontic treatment and was completed by both groups. The second questionnaire contained 46 negatively and positively based statements concerning different aspects of orthodontic treatment, and was completed by previously treated subjects. The reliability of both questionnaires was satisfactory. Previously treated subjects were found to have a significantly more positive attitude towards orthodontics than untreated subjects. The subject's attitude towards the relationship with the orthodontist, satisfaction with the treatment result and experiences with follow-up appointments predicted the general attitude towards orthodontics. Age, but not gender, was found to be a significant predictor for a subject's general attitude towards orthodontics.",European journal of orthodontics,2005 Apr,England,2005,00
16810371,[Consequences of sociodemographic inequalities on birth weight].,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze sociodemographic inequalities in prenatal and childbirth care and their consequences on birth weight. METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 10,072 postpartum women treated at public (those outsourced by the National Health System) and private maternity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1999 to 2001. To test the association between birth weight and maternal sociodemographic and biological characteristics and prenatal care (modified Kotelchuck index), postpartum women were stratified by level of schooling and two multiple linear regressions were performed. The bootstrap technique was used in addition to accurate confidence intervals for the estimated effects. RESULTS: For nearly all of the variables analyzed in the bivariate analysis, birth weight was lower among children of mothers with low schooling. In the multivariate analysis, among women with low schooling, there was a direct association between birth weight and the modified Kotelchuck index and gestational age. The variables black skin color, smoking, and history of premature birth were negatively associated with birth weight, while maternal age and parity showed distinct behaviors from the central range of data at the extremes. In the group with high schooling, only parity, gestational age, and modified Kotelchuck index were significant and directly associated with birth weight. The protective effect of prenatal care was observed, as well as the negative effect of smoking, regardless of the mother's level of schooling. CONCLUSIONS: The variables associated with neonates' birth weight of mothers with high schooling in Rio de Janeiro were biological, in contrast to the social determinants in the group with low schooling.",Revista de saude publica,2006 Jun,Brazil,2006,00
18833350,"Transdisciplinary research strategies for understanding socially patterned disease: the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress (ACCESS) project as a case study.","As we have seen a global increase in asthma in the past three decades it has also become clear that it is a socially patterned disease, based on demographic and socioeconomic indicators clustered by areas of residence. This trend is not readily explained by traditional genetic paradigms or physical environmental exposures when considered alone. This has led to consideration of the interplay among physical and psychosocial environmental hazards and the molecular and genetic determinants of risk (i.e., biomedical framing) within the broader socioenvironmental context including socioeconomic position as an upstream ""cause of the causes"" (i.e., ecological framing). Transdisciplinary research strategies or programs that embrace this complexity through a shared conceptual framework that integrates diverse discipline-specific theories, models, measures, and analytical methods into ongoing asthma research may contribute most significantly toward furthering our understanding of socially patterned disease.

The present study was carried out to estimate the prevalence of domestic violence, to identify socio-demographic and behavioral risk factors and to investigate the relationship between the women's psychological health status and violence exposure. This is a comparative cross-sectional study using a multistage random sampling technique. The sample comprised 500 women aged 18-50y. Data was collected via a structured interview questionnaire including the socio-demographic characteristics of the women and their husbands, some of the husbands' habits, attitude and history of chronic illnesses. Also, the questionnaire assesses different forms of domestic violence, women's reaction to it and its consequences on psychological well-being of women. A depression anxiety scale was used to assess the women's psychological status. The study revealed that the overall prevalence of domestic violence among the studied group was (62.2%); the commonest form (74.0%) was psychological abuse, followed by social (26.8%) one, then the physical (22.4%) and lastly sexual abuse (19.6%). On studying the socio-demographic variables, a significantly higher percentage of younger ( pound 30 years) non-educated, low income and those having any property ownership were more exposed to violence. Also exposure to abuse was more prevalent among women whose husbands were young, non-educated, skilled workers, drug abuser, with positive history of family troubles and chronic illness. The majority of women reported that they react to violence by crying loudly or screaming, while a minority may seek medical care or call the police. Regarding the psychological effect of violence exposure, the most common effects were anxiety (69.2%) and depression (52.2%), with a highly statistically significant difference with exposure in every form of domestic violence. Conclusion & Recommendations: The overall prevalence of domestic violence was relatively high and was predominantly of the psychological form. Women abuse had serious health effects on the women's health mainly her psychological well being. The study recommends practicing compulsory pre-marital counseling and offering health educational sessions in schools, universities and health units to all expected couples about marital and family life and provision of routine screening for domestic violence in primary care.",The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association,2008,England,2008,00
14674182,The expanded Chronic Care Model: an integration of concepts and strategies from population health promotion and the Chronic Care Model.,"Given the increasing incidence of chronic diseases across the world, the search for more effective strategies to prevent and manage them is essential. The use of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) has assisted healthcare teams to demonstrate effective, relevant solutions to this growing challenge. However, the current CCM is geared to clinically oriented systems, and is difficult to use for prevention and health promotion practitioners. To better integrate aspects of prevention and health promotion into the CCM, an enhanced version called the Expanded Chronic Care Model is introduced. This new model includes elements of the population health promotion field so that broadly based prevention efforts, recognition of the social determinants of health, and enhanced community participation can also be part of the work of health system teams as they work with chronic disease issues.",Hospital quarterly,2003,Canada,2003,00
14686137,Early origins of the gradient: the relationship between socioeconomic status and infant mortality in the United States.,"Although relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient.",Demography,2003 Nov,United States,2003,00
17118038,Women's perceptions of partner support and conflict in the development of postpartum depressive symptoms.,"AIM: This paper reports a study examining the influence of maternal perceptions of conflict and relationship- and postpartum-specific support from the partner on the development of depressive symptoms in the first 8-weeks postpartum. BACKGROUND: Although the quality of a woman's relationship with her partner has been associated with risk for postpartum depression, few studies have examined which elements of partner-specific support and conflict are determinants of maternal mental health. METHODS: Self-administered measures of partner support (Social Provisions Checklist, Postpartum Partner Support Scale), partner conflict (Quality of Relationships Inventory), and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) were mailed postnatally to a population-based sample of 396 mothers between April 2001 to January 2002. Differences in partner support and conflict at 1 and 4-weeks postpartum were examined between those women who met criteria for probable depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale > 9) and those who did not meet criteria for probable depression at 8-weeks postpartum. FINDINGS: Women with depressive symptoms at 8-weeks postpartum had significantly lower perceptions of relationship-specific and postpartum-specific partner support and significantly higher levels of relationship conflict than women with no depressive symptoms. Multiple regression analyses revealed that three variables, perceived social integration, partner encouragement to obtain help when needed, and partner agreed with infant care, significantly explained the variance in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal perceptions of social integration and partner provision of problem-focused informational support and positive feedback are important in determining maternal mental health. Therefore, in the antenatal period healthcare professionals should teach couples appropriate ways to provide feedback and communicate expectations, especially those relating to infant care strategies. The importance of appraisal and emotional support should be highlighted in order to foster maternal feelings of acceptance and being cared for. Partners should also be encouraged to participate actively in household tasks and infant care activities to protect the mother from becoming overwhelmed.",Journal of advanced nursing,2006 Dec,England,2006,00
15917067,Do patients' preferences predict smoking cessation?,"BACKGROUND: Social cognitive theories (e.g., ASE-model) propose that smoking cessation can be accomplished by changing underlying cognitive determinants such as attitudes, social influence, and self-efficacy. Others have argued that people's preferences for a health state can also predict behavior. In this study, preferences constitute the degree to which one is willing to give up a valuable good, that is survival, to obtain a desirable behavior (e.g., to quit smoking). The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of cognitive determinants and patients' preferences on the prediction of smoking cessation. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a randomized clinical trial. Smoking outpatients (N = 217) with cardiovascular disease were included. At baseline (T0), socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were measured. Social cognitions (pros of quitting, pros of smoking, social influence, and self-efficacy) and preferences (using a paper time trade-off measure (TTO)) were assessed at T1 (1 week). Smoking cessation was assessed at T2 (8 weeks). RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that socio-demographic (P = .92) and clinical (P = .26) factors did not predict smoking cessation, whereas social cognitions (P = .02) and preferences did (P = .00). On average, quitters are willing to give up an appreciable amount of survival years in order to quit smoking. CONCLUSION: Preference for quitting was the strongest single predictor of smoking cessation.",Preventive medicine,2005 Aug,United States,2005,00
17572457,Determinants of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in elderly people: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES: Despite strong national and international recommendations on immunization practices, rates for influenza (IV) and pneumococcal vaccinations (PV) are low. We aimed to review international immunization rates and to analyze attitudes and beliefs regarding IV and PV. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHOD: The MEDLINE database search comprised articles from 1966 to October 2005. Fourteen surveys evaluating a total number of 49292 participants in nine different countries were included into the analysis. RESULTS: Vaccination rates among risk groups do vary significantly between different countries, reaching highest rates in the USA (IV, 82%; PV, 71%) and lowest in former West-Germany for IV (37%) and in Israel for PV (20%). Recommendations by doctors play a central role in promoting IV and PV. The main reason for not being vaccinated was lack of information. CONCLUSION: Specific strategies targeted at groups are needed to increase the knowledge of IV and PV, and thereby decrease incidences of acute lung diseases.",Public health,2007 Oct,Netherlands,2007,00
12435837,"Social determinants and the health of drug users: socioeconomic status, homelessness, and incarceration.","OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the evidence on the adverse health consequences of low socioeconomic status, homelessness, and incarceration among drug users. OBSERVATIONS: Social and economic factors shape risk behavior and the health of drug users. They affect health indirectly by shaping individual drug-use behavior; they affect health directly by affecting the availability of resources, access to social welfare systems, marginalization, and compliance with medication. Minority groups experience a disproportionately high level of the social factors that adversely affect health, factors that contribute to disparities in health among drug users. CONCLUSION: Public health interventions aimed at improving the health of drug users must address the social factors that accompany and exacerbate the health consequences of illicit drug use.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2002,United States,2002,00
14626465,Risk behavior and social-cognitive determinants of condom use among ethnic minority communities in Amsterdam.,"This study assessed sexual risk behavior and determinants of condom use among migrants in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We tested the predictive utility of constructs derived from the health belief model and the theory of planned behavior. Data were collected by means of a cross-sectional study in a community sample of 537 Surinamese, Antillean, and sub-Saharan African heterosexual men and women randomly recruited from participants in an epidemiological study. Participants donated saliva for HIV testing and were interviewed using two structured questionnaires. Inconsistent condom use occurred in 82% of the primary partnerships and in 25% of the casual partnerships. Multivariate analyses, controlling for sociodemographic and behavioral factors, showed that perceived behavioral control and subjective norm regarding condom use were main social-cognitive determinants of consistent condom use. However, contrary to predictions, the relation between consistent condom use and sociodemographic and behavioral factors was not entirely mediated by these social-cognitive factors.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,2003 Oct,United States,2003,00

It is of great concern that, in practice, mental health promotion is frequently overlooked in health promotion programmes although the WHO definitions of health and the Ottawa Charter describe mental health as an integral part of health. It is suggested that more attention be given to addressing the determinants of mental health in terms of protective and risk factors for both physical and mental conditions, particularly in developing countries. Examples of evidence-based mental health programmes operating in widely diverse settings are presented to demonstrate that well designed interventions can contribute to the well-being of populations.

19717366,Fostering health equity: clinical and research training strategies from nursing education.,"Racism, ethnocentrism, segregation, stereotyping, and classism are tightly linked to health equity and social determinants of health. They lead to lack of power, money, resources, and education which may result in poor health care access and outcomes. Health profession faculties must address the complex relationships that exist between individual, interpersonal, institutional, social and political factors that influence health outcomes in both clinical and research training. Thus, the purposes of this paper are to provide examples of training strategies from nursing education that foster cultural sensitivity. First, assumptions about health equity, culture, ethnicity and race are explored. Second, clinical training within an undergraduate and graduate context are explored, including an undergraduate cancer case study and in a graduate pediatric nursing program are described to demonstrate how cultural models can be used to integrate the biomedical and psychosocial content in a course. Third, research training for summer scholars and doctoral and post doctoral fellows (short and long term) is described to demonstrate how to increase the number and quality of scholars prepared to conduct research with vulnerable populations. Research training strategies include a summer research institute, policy fellowship, and a scholars ""pipeline"" program.

18777671,The reservation wages of Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries.,"There exists a lot of research on the reservation wages of the unemployed as a determinant of unemployment duration. Little is known about the reservation wages of those who are not in the labor force but might be potential labor force returnees, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries. The main objective of this article is to assess what can be learned from the subjective reservation wages of DI beneficiaries. Using the New Beneficiary Data System (NBDS), the article assesses the magnitudes of reservation wages compared to the last wage earned and the benefit amount, as well as the determinants of reservation wages in a regression framework. The NBDS is unique in that it provides the reservation wages and the work history of DI beneficiaries before and after joining the DI rolls. The article has several noteworthy results and policy implications: *Data show that a significant portion of beneficiaries report being likely to accept a job if offered one. Based on the NBDS, 13 percent of DI beneficiaries who did not work since joining the rolls in 1981-1982 reported in 1991 that they would be willing to work if offered a job and provided their reservation wages. *DI beneficiaries do not appear to price themselves out of the labor market. Half of them would want a wage that is 80 percent or less of the last wage earned before receiving DI. It is estimated that approximately 7 percent of long-term DI beneficiaries may potentially return-to-work if they search for jobs and have a wage offer distribution with a mean at 80 percent of their last wage. *The nonlabor income in addition to the benefit is positively and significantly associated with the reservation wage, while the benefit amount per se is not. However, this result needs to be treated with caution given that nonlabor income is endogenous to the model. *Heterogeneity exists between persons still under the DI program and those that have moved to the Old-Age program. The subsamples of persons who have shifted to the Old-Age program and those who are still under the DI program have median reservation wage to the last wage ratios of 0.69 and 0.93, respectively. A significantly lower reservation wage for persons who have moved to the Old-Age program was also found in a regression framework. This heterogeneity between the two groups may result in part from the different program characteristics both groups face, for instance, in terms of benefit termination and Medicare eligibility rules. *Subjective reservation wage data can be useful to study populations that are out of the labor force. This article is innovative in that it focuses on a group of persons who are typically considered as being out of the labor force, and therefore are not asked reservation wages in general household surveys such as the Current Population Survey. It would be of great interest to collect more reservation wage data for DI beneficiaries in a longitudinal data set to expand this analysis, for instance, to assess conclusively the effects of changing program characteristics on reservation wages and return-to-work outcomes as beneficiaries transition to the Old-Age program or as new return-to-work programs are put in place.",Social security bulletin,2007,United States,2007,00
10907657,"Vigilance, active coping, and cardiovascular reactivity during social interaction in young men.","This study of 72 undergraduate men examined the effects of two determinants of cardiovascular response-active coping and vigilance-on blood pressure and heart rate responses to social stressors. Observation of a future debate partner (i.e., vigilance) evoked larger increases in blood pressure than did observation of a less relevant person, apparently through the combination of increases in cardiac output and vascular resistance. Preparation and enactment of efforts to exert social influence (i.e., active coping) evoked heightened blood pressure and heart rate responses through increased cardiac contractility and output. Thus, both vigilance and active coping in social contexts increased cardiovascular reactivity, but apparently through different psychophysiological processes.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",2000 Jul,United States,2000,00
15328302,Determinants of forward stage transitions: a Delphi study.,"Insight into stage transition determinants is necessary to develop and evaluate stage-tailored health-promoting interventions. A three-round Delphi study among stages of change researchers was conducted to make an inventory of opinions and examine agreement on determinants of forward transitions between Transtheoretical stages of change. In the first round, 10 experts completed an electronic questionnaire with open-ended questions about potential determinants for each stage transition. In the second round, a structured electronic questionnaire based on the first round results was sent to authors of scientific papers on stages of change, published between 1995 and May 2002. In the third round, participants were presented feedback about the second round and were asked to re-rate their answers based on the information provided. Results showed that participants agreed on various transition determinants, but that determinants were not always stage-specific, e.g. control-related issues and social support were identified as determinants of all transitions from contemplation to maintenance. The results further showed lower consensus about determinants of earlier stage transitions than about determinants of later stage transitions. The Delphi study identified hypotheses worthy of further examination in longitudinal observational and experimental studies.",Health education research,2005 Apr,England,2005,00

Although there is relatively little experience of measuring social capital, particularly in developing countries, there are now a number of studies that allow the identification of some key issues that need to be considered when measuring social capital. After summarizing definitions and the rise of interest in the link between social capital and health, measures used in key studies of social capital and health are presented. Some important issues are then considered: obtaining a sufficiently comprehensive measure which empirically captures the latest theoretical developments in the field (particularly the concepts of cognitive, structural, bonding and bridging social capital); moving from the individual to the ecological level; consideration of confounding factors, and validity and reliability.",Health policy and planning,2002 Mar,England,2002,00
19232149,"Social, economic, health and environmental determinants of child nutritional status in three Central Asian Republics.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the comparative effect of social, economic, health and environmental characteristics on the nutritional status of children aged <3 years in Central Asia. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis using data from Demographic and Health Surveys. SETTING: Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. SUBJECTS: Information on demographic health was gathered by Macro International Inc., Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan governments from a random sample of 14 067 households in the three countries. Anthropometric measurements were performed using standardized procedures on all children <3 years of age (n 2358). Only children with plausible Z-scores (n 1989) were selected for subsequent analyses. RESULTS: The main results indicated that country of residence, number of people in household, household wealth, birth weight, age of child, knowledge of oral rehydration therapy, maternal education, number of children <5 years of age and source of drinking water were strong predictors of child nutritional status in these countries. Furthermore, chronic malnutrition was most prevalent in all three countries but at varied levels. An unexpected finding was that fully vaccinated children were more likely to be malnourished than children who were partially vaccinated. A further unexpected finding was that breast-feeding especially in children >6 months old had a strong negative association with stunting and underweight. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the results from both the descriptive and binary logistic regression analysis are similar in terms of the explanatory variables and the statistical significance in the models.",Public health nutrition,2009 Oct,England,2009,00
20191102,DANWEI AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY IN CONTEMPORARY URBAN CHINA.,"Prior research showed that danwei, the work unit, was very important in determining workers' social, economic, and political lives in pre-reform urban China. In this paper, we argue that danwei continues to be an agent of social stratification in contemporary urban China. Using data from a 1999 survey we conducted in three large Chinese cities, Wuhan, Shanghai, and Xi'an, we assess the extent to which workers' socioeconomic well-being depends on the financial conditions of their danwei. Results show that the financial situation of danwei remains one of the most important determinants of earnings and benefits. However, the explanatory power of danwei's financial situation is much greater for earnings than for benefits.",Research in the sociology of work,2009 Jan 1,England,2009,00
19368906,Determinants of regional differences in the incidence of impetigo.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Impetigo is a common contagious skin infection, mostly seen in children and caused by Staphylococcus aureus and/or group A B-hemolytic Streptococcus. Two surveys performed in general practice showed a strong geographical gradient in the incidence rates among children in the Netherlands. The incidence in the south was approximately twice as high as in the rest of the Netherlands. We hypothesized that this difference could be explained by differences in the presence of animal farms and differences in temperature. This study examined whether there is a relationship with the numbers of bovines, pigs, sheep, and poultry per km2, and temperature, which could explain the observed regional gradient in the incidence of impetigo. DESIGN AND SETTING: In this ecological study, data on the incidence of impetigo in children 0-17 years of age from the second Dutch national survey were linked to data on the density of farm animals from Statistics Netherlands and temperature data from the Dutch Metereological Service. Using logistic regression allowing for overdispersion, we tested the significance of the effect of bovines, pigs, sheep, and poultry per km2, and temperature on the incidence of impetigo, correcting for known risk factors. RESULTS: Only the number of sheep at the (COROP) regional level was significant; however, this effect could not explain the regional differences. CONCLUSION: The regional differences in the incidence of impetigo in children cannot be explained by the variation in the presence of farm animals or differences in temperature.",Environmental research,2009 Jul,Netherlands,2009,00
10951689,"Attrition in the new beneficiary survey and followup, and its correlates.","Panel surveys interview the same individuals more than once over a period of time. Attrition from the survey occurs when those individuals die, refuse to be interviewed again, or, for some other reason, cannot be contacted. If the original sample was representative of a specific population, then survey analysis may provide misleading conclusions about changes in population characteristics over time if these individuals leave the sample in a nonrandom way. Therefore, it is important to identify the characteristics of individuals who leave the survey for various reasons. This article explores the extent of and reasons for attrition in the New Beneficiary Survey (NBS) between the first interview in 1982 and the followup interview in 1991. Presented is a comparison of the characteristics of survivors (the reinterviewed sample) with attriters (those in the sample not reinterviewed) from the retired-worker and disabled-worker samples. The article explores a variety of potential determinants of attrition to the probability of attrition. These determinants are examined alone and in a multivariate framework. The NBS sample population is drawn from and linked to Social Security Administrative records, which have exact matched data on mortality as a cause of attrition. These data do not depend on survey-reported reasons for attrition; hence, it allows the examination of the differences in the patterns and predictors of attrition due to death and due to other reasons, primarily, the refusal to be interviewed. Attrition due to death must be identified precisely because misidentification of death as refusal to be interviewed may lead researchers to infer more selective attrition than might be the case. Different patterns of attrition are evident in the comparison of attrition levels and the determinants of attrition for the retired and disabled samples, both composed of persons with relatively high mortality risk. In particular, individuals' health, health insurance coverage, and level of education have different impacts on their likelihood of attrition. In general, it appears that refusal to be interviewed is more evenly spread across populations and characteristics than is death. The analysis shows that attrition due to death and attrition due to refusal are quite different processes, even though health conditions play a role in both processes. The results suggest that because attrition patterns (including death) may be quite different across population samples, sample-specific attrition patterns must be analyzed over the lifetime of any panel study. Long-term studies of panel attrition are necessary to provide researchers analyzing the data with information on potential biases due to nonrandom attrition.",Social security bulletin,2000,United States,2000,00
12733243,[The participation of women with breast cancer in choosing their treatment: a right as yet to be gained].,"The purpose of this study was to identify how women with breast cancer perceive themselves as subjects in the process of making decisions on their own treatment. Two objectives were pursued: (a) to identify social and political determinants that, by affecting the socialization process of these women, might have influenced them in adopting a style of participation, and (b) to understand the meaning of such participation, as it was perceived by these women at the time they decided on their treatment options. The theoretical-methodological support adopted was that of Symbolic interactionism. The population sample included nine women with breast cancer. Semi-structured interviews allowed data to be gathered, and led to collecting further field notes and data from medical records. The hermeneutic dialectic method was employed as a compass for data interpretation, which made it possible to identify two broad theme units: 'construction of the female identity' and 'style of participation when choosing one's own treatment'. By means of these units it was possible to grasp what it meant for these women to deal with the issue of limits and, therefore, of ethics. In their view, they did not participate in the decision-making process, being regarded as unqualified to decide on the fate of their own bodies and lives. They were thus seen as obedient subjects in relation to medical decisions that are based on the principle of beneficence, where health care delivery is dependent on hierarchical social relationships and power structures are present between classes, genders, and levels of knowledge.",Revista latino-americana de enfermagem,2003 Jan-Feb,Brazil,2003,00
15969760,Bone mineral density measurement and osteoporosis treatment after a fragility fracture in older adults: regional variation and determinants of use in Quebec.,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength and predisposition to increased risk of fracture, with consequent increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It is therefore an important public health problem. International and Canadian associations have issued clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of OP. In this study, we identified potential predictors of bone mineral density (BMD) testing and OP treatment, which include place of residence. METHODS: Our study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Quebec Health Insurance Board. The studied population consisted of all individuals 65 years and older for whom a physician claimed a consultation for a low velocity vertebral, hip, wrist, or humerus fracture in 1999 and 2000. Individuals were considered to have undergone BMD testing if there was a claim for such a procedure within two years following a fracture. They were considered to have received an OP treatment if there was at least one claim to Quebec's health insurance plan (RAMQ) for OP treatment within one year following a fracture. We performed descriptive analyses and logistic regressions by gender. Predictors included age, site of fracture, social status, comorbidity index, prior BMD testing, prior OP treatment, long-term glucocorticoid use, and physical distance to BMD device. RESULTS: The cohort, 77% of which was female, consisted of 25,852 individuals with fragility fractures. BMD testing and OP treatment rates were low and gender dependent (BMD: men 4.6%; women 13.1%; OP treatment: men 9.9%; women 29.7%). There was an obvious regional variation, particularly in BMD testing, ranging from 0 to 16%. Logistic regressions demonstrate that individuals living in long term care facilities received less BMD testing. Patients who had suffered from vertebral fractures, or who had received prior OP treatment or BMD testing, regardless of gender, subsequently received more BMD testing and OP treatments. Furthermore, increasing the distance between a patient's residence and BMD facility precluded likelihood of BMD testing. CONCLUSION: BMD testing rate was extremely low but not completely explained by reduced physical access; gender, age, social status, prior BMD testing and OP treatment were all important predictors for future BMD testing and OP treatment.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,2005 Jun 21,England,2005,00

Previous studies demonstrated that reputation formation plays a pivotal role in prosocial behavior. This study aimed to examine the relationships between a social evaluation-induced salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) response and generosity in the dictator game. The relationship is potentially important in neuroeconomics of altruism and game theory. METHODS: We assessed sAA and allocated money in the dictator game in male students with and without social evaluation. RESULTS Social evaluation-responders allocated significantly more money than controls; while there was no significant correlation between social evaluation-induced sAA elevation and the allocated money. CONCLUSIONS: Social evaluation significantly increases generosity in the dictator game, and individual differences in trait characteristics such as altruism and reward sensitivity may be important determinants of generosity in the dictator game task.",Neuro endocrinology letters,2007 Oct,Sweden,2007,00
17543712,"Neighborhood socioeconomic status, personal network attributes, and use of heroin and cocaine.","BACKGROUND: Drug abuse is a significant public health problem because of its association with numerous negative health and social consequences. Examining the social context of drug use represents a burgeoning avenue of research in drug abuse. This study investigates the effects of neighborhood disadvantage and network factors on current heroin and cocaine use among a predominantly African-American adult sample residing in Baltimore City. METHODS: This study employs a cross-sectional, multilevel design using data from two sources: the SHIELD Study, a network-oriented HIV intervention in Baltimore City and the 1990 U.S. Decennial Census. The sample consisted of 1305 adults from 249 neighborhoods (census block groups) across Baltimore City. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed to examine personal network and neighborhood effects on current heroin and cocaine use. RESULTS: Neighborhood poverty was significantly associated with current heroin and cocaine use (odds ratio [OR]=1.51, confidence interval [CI]=1.06-2.15). Social support (OR=0.80, CI=0.69-0.92) and having ties to employed people (OR=0.47, CI=0.24-0.92) were protective of current drug use, but did not buffer negative effects of neighborhood poverty in the face of negative drug influences in the network (OR=8.62, CI=5.81-12.79). CONCLUSIONS: The contexts of neighborhoods and networks represent key determinants in understanding the social epidemiology of drug abuse. Network attributes have strong influences on drug use, and neighborhood poverty may increase odds of use. Further research is warranted to determine other aspects of neighborhood environments that may put individuals at risk for drug use and abuse.",American journal of preventive medicine,2007 Jun,Netherlands,2007,00
15345092,Factors Associated with Women's Medication Use.,"HEALTH ISSUE: Research has consistently shown that while women generally live longer than men, they report more illness and use of health care services (including medication). In the literature, the reasons for women's elevated medication use are not clear. This paper investigates the associations between over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription (Rx) medication use and selected social and demographic variables in men and women. KEY FINDINGS: While a larger proportion of women than men used medication throughout the study, the proportion of people using medication did not increase. The use of OTC and Rx medication increased by number of physician visits for women and men.Medication use increased with age, chronic disease and number of physician visits, and decreased with the perception of good to excellent health. The relationship with other factors varied for women and men depending on their education level, income and social roles. For women, the social roles of being married or previously married, being employed or being a parent did not increase their likelihood of medication use. Reported income adequacy is not associated with the chances of mediation use among highly educated women, but for women with low levels, medication use increases as income adequacy decreases. DATA GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: More complete data are needed about social roles and their relation to mediation use. Data that would allow an assessment of the appropriateness of OTC and Rx drug use or the reasons for such use need to be collected. More research is needed to better understand the distribution and determinants of specific medication use.",BMC women's health,2004 Aug 25,England,2004,00
19197424,[Resilience: a new perspective in health promotion?].,"This descriptive study deals with some concepts of resilience seeking to understand the concept from the viewpoint of health promotion, one of the basic principles of the Brazilian Family Health Program (FHP). Resilience appeared as a new subject in human sciences and in the health area. In human sciences, resilience means the positive capacity of an individual to construct itself coping with adversities, a dimension more attentive to social conditions. Although there is no consensus with regard to this subject, there seem to be some aspects related with Health Promotion. We emphasize the modern understanding of Health Promotion in order to illustrate some aspects associated with resilience such as the greater capacity of Man to decide about the determinants of his health condition. Given that Health Promotion is one of the attributions of the Family Health Program, we contextualized the program emphasizing the action of the health professionals in this area in relation to the subject, seeking to promote health working with resilience. The multi-professional teams of the Family Health Program represent at the same time a network of support and protection for the families, identifying possible risk factors. The emphasis given to the promotion of resilience however should not substitute the public policies for fighting the social inequality and precarious life conditions of part of the population.",Ciencia & saude coletiva,2009 Mar-Apr,Brazil,2009,00

At 6 months postintervention, significant group by time interactions were observed on the dietary behavioral strategies scales. The promotora condition resulted in significant behavior change initially; however, receipt of tailored and control materials was instrumental in continued behavior change after intervention activities had ceased. Group main effects suggested that the promotora condition was superior at reducing barriers and improving family interactions supporting healthy behaviors.

Survey data from 901 community health center patients, who were potential and actual participants in these programs, indicated that while images of the Medicaid program and its recipients were generally positive, stigma associated with welfare stereotypes reduced both TANF and Medicaid enrollment. Expectations of poor treatment when applying for Medicaid, enrollment barriers, and misinformation about program rules were also associated with reduced Medicaid enrollment. States that enacted strict welfare reform policies were potentially decreasing TANF participation, while states with more simplified and generous programs were potentially increasing Medicaid participation. The results suggest that the image of the adult Medicaid program remains tied to perceptions about welfare and provides guidance to policymakers about how to improve participation rates.",Journal of policy analysis and management : [the journal of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management],2004 Summer,United States,2004,00
18050152,Extending social health insurance to the informal sector in Kenya. An assessment of factors affecting demand.,"This paper contributes to analysing and understanding the demand for (social) health insurance of informal sector workers in Kenya by assessing their perceptions and knowledge of and concerns regarding health insurance and the Kenyan National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). It serves to explore how informal sector workers could be integrated into the NHIF. To collect data, focus group discussions were held with organized groups of informal sector workers of different types across the country, backed up by a self-administered questionnaire completed by heads of NHIF area branch offices. It was found that the most critical barrier to NHIF enrollment is the lack of knowledge of informal sector workers about the NHIF, its enrollment option and procedures for informal sector workers. Inability to pay is a critical factor for some, but people were, in principle, interested in health insurance, and thus willing to pay for it. In sum, the mix of demand-side determinants for enrolling in the NHIF is not as complex as expected. This is good news, as these demand-side determinants can be addressed with a well-designed strategy, focusing on awareness raising and information, improvement of insurance design features and setting differentiated and affordable contribution rates.",The International journal of health planning and management,2008 Jan-Mar,England,2008,00
17044935,"The effects of a controlled worksite environmental intervention on determinants of dietary behavior and self-reported fruit, vegetable and fat intake.","BACKGROUND: Eating patterns in Western industrialized countries are characterized by a high energy intake and an overconsumption of (saturated) fat, cholesterol, sugar and salt. Many chronic diseases are associated with unhealthy eating patterns. On the other hand, a healthy diet (low saturated fat intake and high fruit and vegetable intake) has been found important in the prevention of health problems, such as cancer and cardio-vascular disease (CVD). The worksite seems an ideal intervention setting to influence dietary behavior. The purpose of this study is to present the effects of a worksite environmental intervention on fruit, vegetable and fat intake and determinants of behavior. METHODS: A controlled trial that included two different governmental companies (n = 515): one intervention and one control company. Outcome measurements (short-fat list and fruit and vegetable questionnaire) took place at baseline and 3 and 12 months after baseline. The relatively modest environmental intervention consisted of product information to facilitate healthier food choices (i.e., the caloric (kcal) value of foods in groups of products was translated into the number of minutes to perform a certain (occupational) activity to burn these calories). RESULTS: Significant changes in psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior were found; subjects at the intervention worksite perceived more social support from their colleagues in eating less fat. But also counter intuitive effects were found: at 12 months the attitude and self-efficacy towards eating less fat became less positive in the intervention group. No effects were found on self-reported fat, fruit and vegetable intake. CONCLUSION: This environmental intervention was modestly effective in changing behavioral determinant towards eating less fat (social support, self-efficacy and attitude), but ineffective in positively changing actual fat, fruit and vegetable intake of office workers.",BMC public health,2006 Oct 17,England,2006,00
16161852,[Developing local actions: allowing individual talents be expressed and utilised within a strategic framework].,"The Regional Health Programme of Children and Adolescents in Province Alpes Cote d'Azur (PRSJ), developed between March 1998 and May 1999, is characterised by its scope and complexity. It is more a strategic framework for action than an operational programme. To carry out this action, it was adapted to the level of intervention, on the one hand, using instruments at the regional level adapted for professional interventions, and, on the other hand, through the development of territory-based approaches founded on the creation of networks. Evaluations have shown that the actors found the framework proposed by PRSJ positive and adopted it. They expressed their creativity with more spontaneity in the networks with therapeutic objectives, than those responding to health determinants, which needed initial local support. Local communities appeared as the ideal setting for dissemination and sustainability of PRSJ's objectives. PRSJ's strategic framework allowed local actors to express their talent. This mode of action, which accommodates not only programmatic focus within the context of practitioners on the ground, but also, epidemiology and socio-geographic interventions, are pertinent. To go beyond the explicit milestones set by the strategic orientations of the programme, different elements strengthening the framework are highlighted.",Promotion & education,2005,England,2005,00
15029072,[Psychological and social factors predictive of loneliness: a cognitive and behavioral approach].,"The objective of the present study was to explore the psychological and social mechanisms leading to loneliness. Based on cognitive and behavioral approaches developed in health psychology, we tested several models that might allow one to predict certain determinants of the feeling of loneliness. Included in the study were 45 individuals suffering from loneliness who had come to one of several Centres Therapeutiques de Lutte contre l'Isolement ""Recherche et Rencontres"". The subjects were asked to respond to four scales: the UCLA loneliness scale, Cattell's 16 PF 5 personality scale, Sherbourne and Stewart's social support scale, and Lazarus and Folkman's Ways of Coping Checklist. The present results confirm the previously reported deficit of social support perceived by subjects in this population. Concerning their personality, this population sample falls outside national norms in 7 dimensions: compared to the general population, the socially isolated individual appears essentially to be introverted and anxious, emotionally unstable, avoiding conflicts, timid and ill at ease in the company of -others, imaginative and distracted. To face up to their feeling of loneliness, they have a tendency to use coping styles such as ""keep it to yourself"" and ""wishful thinking"". On the other hand, they resort very little to social support. Among the pertinent variables, 5 predictive factors were recognized, and they could explain 51% of the variance in the feeling of loneliness: they include the global score of perceived social support, coping strategies focussed around wishful thinking, coping strategies that avoid resort to social support, personality traits of imaginativeness and absent-mindedness, and an introverted personality. Three predictors contributed independently to the model: absence of resort to social support, the use of wishful thinking, and the imaginative-distracted personality trait. We likewise found evidence for a mediator role of the absence of resort to social support in the relation between the levels of perceived social support and the feeling of loneliness. Thus it is not so much the deficit in the subject's social relations that determines his feeling of loneliness as it is his difficulty of appealing to others when in distress. These results suggest that it would be judicious to develop specific therapeutic interventions for this type of person that would permit them to adjust more actively and to behave more realistically.",L'Encephale,2004 Jan-Feb,France,2004,00

It begins with a definition of mental health and an outline of the data that have led to the current concern with promoting positive mental health. We then consider aspects of rural life and place that contribute to positive mental health or increase the likelihood of mental health problems. Issues identified include environment, place, gender identity, violence and dispossession and the influence of the effects of structural changes in rural communities. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the determinants of resilience in rural places, including social connectedness, valuing diversity and economic participation.",The Australian journal of rural health,2000 Jun,Australia,2000,00

To assess whether meeting these five dietary requirements was related to a series of socio-economic variables. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data on daily consumption of foods and drinks from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) of children aged 1.5-4.5 years based on 4-day weighed intakes. SUBJECTS: One thousand six hundred and seventy-five British pre-school children aged 1.5-4.5 years in 1993. RESULTS: Only 1% of children met all five RNIs/recommendations examined; 76% met only two or fewer. Very few children met the recommendations for intakes of zinc (aged over four years) and non-milk extrinsic sugars (all ages). The number of RNIs/recommendations met was related to measures of socio-economic class. Children from families in Scotland and the North of England, who had a manual head of household and whose mothers had fewest qualifications, met the least number of RNIs/recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Very few pre-school children have diets that meet all the RNIs and recommendations for iron, zinc, vitamins C and A, and energy from non-milk extrinsic sugars. Dietary adequacy with respect to these five parameters is related to socio-economic factors. The findings emphasise the need for a range of public health policies that focus upon the social and economic determinants of food choice within families.",Public health nutrition,2001 Dec,England,2001,00
11597086,Stress in the relation between trait and state anxiety.,"The relations of stress, trait anxiety, and state anxiety with cognitive performance are the central focus. Stress is conceived of as an external manipulation, trait anxiety as a relatively stable personality characteristic, and state anxiety as transient manifest feelings of insecurity. The influence of these factors on cognitive performance is considered. It was argued that the apparent interaction of stress and trait anxiety with cognitive performance can be traced to the interaction among stress, trait anxiety, and state anxiety. It was hypothesized that state anxiety increases more rapidly as a function of trait anxiety under stressful circumstances than neutral or rel atively reassuring circumstances. The negative relation between state anxiety and cog nitive performance is assumed to be constant irrespective of stress. Experimental evi dence supporting the latter supposition is presented. However, doubts are cast on classical intervention methods for invoking stress. Rather than assuming that these methods invoke stress, it is proposed that feelings of insecurity, associated with ambiguity, are determinants of experienced stress.",Psychological reports,2001 Jun,United States,2001,00
12383469,Utilization of maternal health care services in Southern India.,"This paper examines the patterns and determinants of maternal health care utilization across different social settings in South India: in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) carried out during 1992-93 across most states in India are used. Results show that utilization of maternal health care services is highest in Kerala followed by Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Utilization of maternal health care services is not only associated with a range of reproductive, socio-economic, cultural and program factors but also with state and type of health service. The interstate differences in utilization could be partly due to variations in the implementation of maternal health care program as well as differences in availability and accessibility between the states. In the case of antenatal care, there was no significant rural-urban gap, thanks to the role played by the multipurpose health workers posted in the rural areas to provide maternal health care services. The findings of this study provide insights for planning and implementing appropriate maternal health service delivery programs in order to improve the health and well-being of both mother and child.",Social science & medicine (1982),2002 Nov,England,2002,00
18487961,Social determinants of the increasing caesarean section rate in Italy.,"AIM: Consistent modifications of socio-economic factors may represent crucial non-clinical determinants for the rising rate of caesarean section among primiparae. This increasing trend has been reported in many countries and its relationship with social modifications is widely accepted, though poorly supported by published data. METHODS: Population-based social and economic data were analyzed between two study periods 30 years apart (1971 vs 2001). RESULTS: The number of births dropped dramatically within the study period (about -40%). Italian women tend to delay childbearing (25.1 vs 28.8 years of age at first delivery) to pursue a career and a later marriage and motherhood lead to a contraction of the number of members of the family. Older mothers are at higher risk of caesarean (treble over 40 years of age), especially those with high career position. Health expenditures increased significantly between 1971 and 2001. A progressive contraction of the number of women in reproductive age is expected in the next 50 years in Italy. CONCLUSION: Many determinants are involved in the choice of a caesarean section and most of these are not strictly medical. The rapidly mounting number of legal claims may indeed lead to defensive practices. Given these data, a reduction of caesarean section rate seems unlikely to be achieved at present.",Minerva ginecologica,2008 Apr,Italy,2008,00
11439296,Physical activity and determinants of physical activity in obese and non-obese children.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the physical activity (PA) patterns and the hypothesized psychosocial and environmental determinants of PA in an ethnically diverse sample of obese and non-obese middle school children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: One-hundred and thirty-three non-obese and 54 obese sixth grade children (mean age of 11.4+/-0.6). Obesity status determined using the age-, race- and gender-specific 95th percentile for BMI from NHANES-1. MEASUREMENTS: Objective measurements were collected of PA over a 7-day period using the CSA 7164 accelerometer: total daily counts; daily moderate (3-5.9 METs) physical activity (MPA); daily vigorous physical activity (> or =6 METs; VPA); and weekly number of 5, 10 and 20 min bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (> or =3 METs, MVPA). Self-report measures were collected of PA self-efficacy; social influences regarding PA, beliefs about PA outcomes; perceived PA levels of parents and peers, access to sporting and/or fitness equipment at home, involvement in community-based PA organizations; participation in community sports teams; and hours spent watching television or playing video games. RESULTS: Compared to their non-obese counterparts, obese children exhibited significantly lower daily accumulations of total counts, MPA and VPA as well as significantly fewer 5, 10 and 20 min bouts of MVPA. Obese children reported significantly lower levels of PA self-efficacy, were involved in significantly fewer community organizations promoting PA and were significantly less likely to report their father or male guardian as physically active. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that physical inactivity is an important contributing factor in the maintenance of childhood obesity. Interventions to promote PA in obese children should endeavor to boost self-efficacy perceptions regarding exercise, increase awareness of, and access to, community PA outlets, and increase parental modeling of PA.",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,2001 Jun,England,2001,00
17826170,"Depression, chronic diseases, and decrements in health: results from the World Health Surveys.","BACKGROUND: Depression is an important public-health problem, and one of the leading causes of disease burden worldwide. Depression is often comorbid with other chronic diseases and can worsen their associated health outcomes. Few studies have explored the effect of depression, alone or as a comorbidity, on overall health status. METHODS: The WHO World Health Survey (WHS) studied adults aged 18 years and older to obtain data for health, health-related outcomes, and their determinants. Prevalence of depression in respondents based on ICD-10 criteria was estimated. Prevalence values for four chronic physical diseases--angina, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes--were also estimated using algorithms derived via a Diagnostic Item Probability Study. Mean health scores were constructed using factor analysis and compared across different disease states and demographic variables. The relation of these disease states to mean health scores was determined through regression modelling. FINDINGS: Observations were available for 245 404 participants from 60 countries in all regions of the world. Overall, 1-year prevalence for ICD-10 depressive episode alone was 3.2% (95% CI 3.0-3.5); for angina 4.5% (4.3-4.8); for arthritis 4.1% (3.8-4.3); for asthma 3.3% (2.9-3.6); and for diabetes 2.0% (1.8-2.2). An average of between 9.3% and 23.0% of participants with one or more chronic physical disease had comorbid depression. This result was significantly higher than the likelihood of having depression in the absence of a chronic physical disease (p<0.0001). After adjustment for socioeconomic factors and health conditions, depression had the largest effect on worsening mean health scores compared with the other chronic conditions. Consistently across countries and different demographic characteristics, respondents with depression comorbid with one or more chronic diseases had the worst health scores of all the disease states. INTERPRETATION: Depression produces the greatest decrement in health compared with the chronic diseases angina, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes. The comorbid state of depression incrementally worsens health compared with depression alone, with any of the chronic diseases alone, and with any combination of chronic diseases without depression. These results indicate the urgency of addressing depression as a public-health priority to reduce disease burden and disability, and to improve the overall health of populations.","Lancet (London, England)",2007 Sep 8,England,2007,00
14666306,[The potential of central obesity anthropometric indicators as diagnostic tools].,"OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that the indicators of centralized obesity, namely by waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR) and waistline measure (WM), express different metabolic disorders. Thus, a study was conducted in order to verify the diagnostic potential of the relationship between these two measures and social, behavioral, and biological determinants of centralized obesity. METHODS: Two hierarchical multiple regression models were applied to a 1,042 subject sample from the city of Sao Paulo, southeastern Brazil, in order to evaluate relationships between indicators and determinants for centralized obesity. Clinical, biochemical/laboratory, and behavioral surveys were carried out using standardized questionnaires. Evaluation included blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, and waistline and hip measures. RESULTS: WHR was significantly associated with low stature and strongly related to socioeconomic level; this was not the case with WM. Both WHR and WM were strongly associated with age, sex, and sedentary lifestyle. Women were at greater risk of centralized obesity then men: OR=5.04 and 7.27 for WHR and WM, respectively. WHR was significantly associated with alterations indicative of metabolic syndrome: hypertension and low levels of HDL-cholesterol. WM was significantly associated with hypertension alone. Both indicators were strongly associated with the concomitant presence of two or more alterations related to metabolic syndrome. Unlike WHR, WC was associated with hypercholesterolemia. CONCLUSIONS: WHR was more closely associated with socioeconomic factors, former risk of malnutrition, and alterations indicative of metabolic syndrome than WM, which was more closely associated with risk factors for cardiovascular and arteriosclerotic diseases.",Revista de saude publica,2003 Dec,Brazil,2003,00
17284892,Associations of depressive symptoms with regular leisure activity and family social support among Japanese workers.,"This study was performed to determine the associations of depressive symptoms with regular leisure activity and family social support among Japanese workers. The study participants consisted of 1,605 men and 348 women. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for potentially associated variables. Depressive symptoms were associated with lack of regular leisure activity for men [odds ratio (OR) = 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.55-2.71] and for women (OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.30-4.95). Depressive symptoms were also associated with lack of family social support for men (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.43-2.43). Although a cross-sectional study does not determine which factors are determinants or consequences, these findings suggest regular leisure activity for men and women and family social support for men are independently associated with depressive symptoms.",Industrial health,2007 Jan,Japan,2007,00
16101612,"Personal accounts of 'near-miss' maternal mortalities in Kampala, Uganda.","OBJECTIVE: To explore the socio-economic determinants of maternal mortality in Uganda through interviews with women who had 'near-misses'. DESIGN: Observational study using qualitative research methods. SETTING: The postnatal and gynaecology wards of a large government hospital in Kampala, Uganda. SAMPLE: Thirty women who had narrowly avoided maternal deaths with diagnoses of obstructed labour (7), severe pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (3), post caesarean infection (6), haemorrhage (5), ectopic pregnancy (5) and septic abortion (4). METHODS: The semi-structured interviews were conducted in the local language by a woman unconnected to the hospital, and were recorded before being translated and transcribed. Analysis was conducted in duplicate using commercial software. RESULTS: The predominant theme was powerlessness, which occurred both within and outside the hospital. It was evident in the women's attempts to get both practical and financial help from those around them as well as in their failure to gain rapid access to care. Financial barriers and problems with transport primarily governed health-seeking behaviour. Medical mistakes and delays in referral were evident in many interviews, especially in rural health centres. Women were appreciative of the care they received from the central government hospital, although there were reports of overcrowding, long delays, shortages and inhumane care. There were no reports of bribery. CONCLUSIONS: Women with near-miss maternal mortalities experience institutional and social powerlessness: these factors may be a major contributor to maternal mortality.",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,2005 Sep,England,2005,00
16322486,Susceptibility to deterioration of mobility long-term after stroke: a prospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to identify clinical determinants able to predict which individuals are susceptible to deterioration of mobility from 1 to 3 years after stroke. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of stroke patients consecutively admitted for inpatient rehabilitation. A total of 205 relatively young, first-ever stroke patients were assessed at 1 and 3 years after stroke. Mobility status was determined by the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI), and decline was defined as a deterioration of > or =2 points on the RMI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for mobility decline. The discriminating ability of the model was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: A decline in mobility status was found in 21% of the patients. Inactivity and the presence of cognitive problems, fatigue, and depression at 1 year after stroke were significant predictors of mobility decline. The multivariate model showed a good fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow test P>0.05), and discriminating ability was good (area under the curve 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Mobility decline is an essential concern in chronic stroke patients, especially because it might lead to activities of daily living dependence and affects social reintegration. Early recognition of prognostic factors in patients at risk may guide clinicians to apply interventions aimed to prevent deterioration of mobility status in chronic stroke.",Stroke,2006 Jan,United States,2006,00
14992849,Creating safer workplaces: assessing the determinants and role of safety climate.,"PROBLEM: Although there has been considerable interest in safety climate, relatively little attention has been given to the factors that determine safety climate or to testing the hypothesized mediating role of safety climate with respect to safety-related outcomes. METHOD: Questionnaire responses were obtained from 2,208 employees of a large national retail chain in 21 different locations. RESULTS: After controlling for demographic variables, three factors: environmental conditions, safety-related policies and programs, and general organizational climate, accounted for 55% of the variance in perceived safety climate. Interestingly, organizational climate made a significant contribution to safety climate, even after controlling for the other more safety-relevant variables. Partial correlations showed that safety policies and programs had the largest observed correlation with safety climate, followed by two of the dimensions of organizational climate (communication and organizational support). Using Baron and Kenny's (J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 51 (1986) 1173) procedures, the principal effects of the various work situation factors on perceived safety at work were found to be direct rather than mediated by safety climate. Safety climate influenced perceived safety at work, but its role as a mediator was limited. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: These results are discussed in terms of other recent findings on safety climate and the growing interest in understanding management and organizational factors in the context of workplace safety.",Journal of safety research,2004,United States,2004,00
17170020,"Socioeconomic risk, parenting during the preschool years and child health age 6 years.","BACKGROUND: Parent child relationships and parenting processes are emerging as potential life course determinants of health. Parenting is socially patterned and could be one of the factors responsible for the negative effects of social inequalities on health, both in childhood and adulthood. This study tests the hypothesis that some of the effect of socioeconomic risk on health in mid childhood is transmitted via early parenting. METHODS: Prospective cohort study in 10 USA communities involving 1041 mother/child pairs, selected at birth at random with conditional sampling. EXPOSURES: income, maternal education, maternal age, lone parenthood, ethnic status and objective assessments of mother child interaction in the first 4 years of life covering warmth, negativity and positive control. OUTCOMES: mother's report of child's health in general at 6 years. Modelling: multiple regression analyses with statistical testing of mediational processes. RESULTS: All five indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) were correlated with all three measures of parenting, such that low SES was associated with poor parenting. Among the measures of parenting maternal warmth was independently predictive of future health, and among the socioeconomic variables maternal education, partner presence and 'other ethnic group' proved predictive. Measures of parenting significantly mediated the impact of measures of SES on child health. CONCLUSIONS: Parenting mediates some, but not all of the detectable effects of socioeconomic risk on health in childhood. As part of a package of measures that address other determinants, interventions to support parenting are likely to make a useful contribution to reducing childhood inequalities in health.",European journal of public health,2007 Oct,England,2007,00
11255938,Short- and long-term effects of fraternity and sorority membership on heavy drinking: a social norms perspective.,"This study sought to determine whether the well-established relation between fraternity/sorority (Greek) membership and heavy alcohol use persists beyond the college years and whether some common third variables might account for the relation between Greek status and heavy drinking. During each of 4 years of college and 1 additional year, young adults (N = 319) completed measures of alcohol use, personality, alcohol expectancies, and environmental influences on drinking. Throughout the college years, Greeks consistently drank more heavily than non-Greeks. Statistically controlling for previous alcohol use did not eliminate this effect. However, Greek status did not predict postcollege heavy drinking levels. Also, perceived peer norms for heavy drinking mediated the relation between Greek affiliation and heavy alcohol use. Results are discussed in terms of situational determinants of heavy alcohol involvement in young adults.",Psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors,2001 Mar,United States,2001,00

Thirty-six enumeration areas (EAs) were randomly chosen from a representative survey of 90 EAs in rural, semi-urban and urban residence strata. In each EA, 24 households were randomly chosen for water quality sampling and socio-demographic interview. Escherichia coli per 100 ml H2O was quantified using the IDEXX Colilert system and multi-stage regression models estimated cross-sectional associations between water sources, sanitation and socio-demographic factors. Almost three quarters, 74%, of the households have > 2 E. coli /100 ml H2O. Tap water has significantly lower E. coli levels compared with surface or rainwater and well water had the highest levels. Households with a water closet toilet have significantly lower E. coli compared with those using pit latrines or no toilets. Household size is positively associated, and a possessions index is negatively associated, with E. coli. Variations in community and household socio-demographic and behavioural factors are key determinants of drinking water quality. These factors should be included in planning health education associated with investments in water systems.",Journal of water and health,2008 Sep,England,2008,00

Indeed, current incidence rates in African American MSM are similar to those usually only seen in developing countries. A review of the existing literature suggests that the prevention research agenda for Black MSM could benefit from reframing conceptualization of risk as a function of individual properties to a broad consideration of social and interpersonal determinants. Studies that investigate dyadic and social-level influences on African American MSM's relationships are needed. This includes research explicating the diversity existing within the categorizations of Black MSM with respect to perceived identity (gay, bisexual, ""men on the down low,"" ""homo thugz""), constructions of masculinity, sexual scripts, sources of social support, and perceived norms and expectations. Recommendations are proposed for a research agenda focusing on linkages between interpersonal and social-structural determinants of HIV risk.",The Journal of black psychology,2004,United States,2004,00

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six adolescents who were born in 1983 to 1984 at less than 801 g birth weight were compared with 26 adolescents born at term. Adolescent-perceived status was assessed using the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-SR) and the Self-Perception Profile. Parents' perceptions were assessed using BASC Parent Report, Family Impact Questionnaire, and Functional Status Measure. Health status was obtained through written requests to primary care providers and parent interviews. Academic and attendance information was obtained through school records. RESULTS: Compared to the term adolescents, the ELBW group had significantly lower function related to health status, increased need for special education, and tended to score lower on academic performance measures. However, ELBW adolescents' perceptions regarding their scholastic, athletic, or social competencies did not differ from the term group or national normative data. Parents of ELBWs reported lower adaptive skills, but no other behavioral differences from the term group. CONCLUSION: ELBW survivors and their parents perceived outcome at adolescence positively in spite of evident limitations. Mechanisms that ELBW families use to cope may be important determinants for successful, long-term outcome.",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,2003 Jan,United States,2003,00
17665843,The Portuguese contribution to the brain drain from Portuguese speaking African countries.,"In the first part of this paper, a secondary analysis of multiple data sources was done to identify how many nurses, physicians, dentists, pharmacists and other health workers have migrated from the Portuguese speaking African countries (PSAC) to Portugal between 1998 and 2002. In the second part, the results of a 2003 questionnaire based survey of 45 nurses, from Guinea-Bissau, residing in Portugal are reported. Health professionals are increasing as a proportion of total immigrants into Portugal. Relatively to the countries' of origin population, the PSAC contribute the most with foreign health professionals to the Portuguese healthcare system. Our study of Guinea-Bissau nurses in Portugal replicates the results of other studies and suggests that the decision to emigrate is multiply determined. The implication for policy makers is that the causal complexity among factors spurring emigration makes that the marginal effect of policy reforms addressing one or more of the multiple determinants of emigration may be sufficient to retain some proportion of health professionals, even when other determinants of emigration are present.

In order to examine the causes of the difference in health level, the health indices and their determinants of two Koreas were analyzed in time order. As of the year 2000, the average life expectancy at birth is 71.0 years for men and 78.6 years for women in South Korea, which is longer than that of North Korea by 8.1 for men and 11.2 for women. Infant mortality rate in 1998 was 9.0 per 1,000 live births in South Korea and 54.0 in North Korea. Since being liberated from Japanese ruling in 1945, South Korea has achieved remarkable economic growth under democracy and a market economy system. On the other hand, North Korea has maintained a socialistic system. North Korea has suffered from economic crisis since the 1990s. From this point it could be said that economic status is the major factor for the differences in health level between the two Koreas. Economic status not only directly influences health level but also indirectly affects it through influences on nutrition, hygiene, health resources, and other intervening factors. The South Korean government has concentrated its limited resources on public health activities such as tuberculosis control, family planning (FP), and maternal and child health (MCH) programmes whereas the private sector has taken charge of constructing the health delivery system including health facilities and human resources. In order to solve the problem, which might occur in the private-oriented medical care system, the South Korean government has introduced the national health insurance programme and enforced regulation policies. Many developing countries which are suffering from poverty and disease, can learn from the experience of Korea that had suffered from similar problems up to the early 1970s.",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,2001,China,2001,00
16929906,"[Social determinants, feeding practices and nutritional consequences of intestinal parasitism in young children].","INTRODUCTION: Studies on intestinal intestinal parasitism in children under 2 years of age have rarely been performed. The nutritional consequences and feasibility of parasite prevention justify the current study. OBJECTIVES: The study was undertaken with 3 goals: (1) to identify the prevalence of pathogenic intestinal parasites (PIP), (2) to determine the social factors, sanitary conditions and nutritional practices that predict PIP, and (3) to evaluate PIP effects on infant nutritional status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All mothers with children under 18 months of age and living in an urban community of coastal Colombia were invited to participate in the PIP study. A fecal sample was obtained from each of 136 children; they represented 62% of the total 7-18 month-old population in the community. Presence of intestinal parasites was identified by direct microscopy and confirmed by a concentration test (Ritchie-Frick procedure). Logistic regressions were used to predict presence of PIP. The Z scores of length-for-age (< -2 SD-chronic malnutrition) and weight-for-length (< -2 SD-acute malnutrition) and covariance analysis were done to detect associations between intestinal parasitism and nutritional status. RESULTS: Of the 136 children, 30.6% were infected; 26.2% had helminth infections (A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, S. stercoralis), 14.9% had protozoan infections (G. lamblia) and 11.8% had mixed infections. Wasting and stunting were present in 2.9% and 12.5%, respectively. Lack of sanitary toilet facilities and low maternal education were related to mixed infections and presence of helminths (p < 0.05). Weaned children were at greater risk of mixed infections (Odds Ratio (OR) 6.5; 90% CI: 1.9-21.5) and of G. lamblia infections (OR: 2.89; 90% CI: 1.0-8.34). Children infected with T. trichiura and with mixed infections were more likely to show wasting (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The high infections in young children indicate that they be included in periodic antiparasitic chemotherapy. Burden of disease associated to intestinal parasitism may be reduced if breastfeeding is continued beyond 6 months of age.",Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,2006 Mar,Colombia,2006,00
16970785,Determinants of birthweight inequalities: population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to study the whole spectrum of birthweight in a population-based birth cohort in order to document the role played by social factors, which complement physiological and behavioural factors, in the development of birthweight inequalities at the population level. METHODS: The analyses were performed with data from the 'Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development 1998-2002 (QLSCD)'. The study follows a representative sample (n = 2103) of the children born in 1998 in the Canadian province of Quebec. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses adjusted for gestational age and mother's age indicate that mean birthweight was higher for boys than girls; improved with birth rank, mother's body mass index (BMI), and family socioeconomic status; and was lower for children of smoking mothers. Compared with children born to non-smoking mothers of higher socioeconomic status, the odds of having a low birthweight were between 6 and 12 times higher for children born to smoking mothers of lower or middle socioeconomic status. When maternal smoking status and mother's BMI are combined, socioeconomic status could still be seen to have a positive effect on mean birthweight except for overweight or obese smoking mothers, among whom the relationship between socioeconomic status and mean birthweight was reversed. In families of lower socioeconomic status, maternal smoking was the most important factor in birthweight inequalities, and in families of higher socioeconomic status, mother's BMI was the most important factor in birthweight inequalities. CONCLUSION: This research is not only important for children in developed nations, but also for those in developing countries, where high birthweight and obesity are becoming more prevalent.",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,2006 Oct,Australia,2006,00
25125929,"SUPPORT FOR THE CONTINUATION OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN JIMMA ZONE, SOUTHWEST ETHIOPIA.","BACKGROUND: Female genital mutilation/cutting is a harmful practice which has effect on female's wellbeing. However, the practice has continued to prevail in many cultures. Research on the social determinants of the practice and its continuation are scarce. The objective of this study was to assess whether attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation is predicted by gender role perception among adolescents in Jimma zone. METHODS: This study used data collected in the first round of Jimma Longitudinal Family Survey of Youth. A total of 2084 adolescents were identified from 3700 households and one adolescent were interviewed from each household using structured questionnaire. Data on the socio-demographic characteristics, religiosity, access to electronic media, perception of gender role, attitude towards continuation of Female circumcision was collected. Descriptive and multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze the data using SPSS for windows version 16.0. Statically tests were performed at the level of significance of 5%. RESULTS: Of the 2084 adolescents, 1146 (55.0%) were aged 12-14 years, 1025 (49.2%) females and 749 (35.9%) from rural areas. The majority, 1289 (61.9%) were Muslims and 1351 (64.8%) Oromo. Five hundred seventy three (28.1%) of the male youth did not agree to the importance of marrying a circumcised girl. However, 149 (13.8%) and 258 (12.7%) agreed that it is very important and important, to marry a circumcised girl, respectively. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, perception of gender role, sex, place of residence, highest education in the household and religion remained to be important predictors of attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation after adjustment for age and ethnicity. Adolescents who had low gender role perception were 1.4 times more likely to have a positive attitude towards the continuation of the female genital mutilation (OR: 95%CI, 1.41: 1.02-1.94). Female adolescents were 36% less likely to support (P<0.01) the continuation of FGM compared to their male counter parts (OR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.49, 0.83). Compared to urban youth, those who live in semi urban and rural areas were 1.46 and 1.52 times more likely to have a positive attitude towards the continuation of the FGM practice, respectively (P<0.05). Similarly the Probability of having positive attitude towards the continuation of the FGM practice decreased steadily as the highest educational level in the household increased. CONCLUSION: One-fifth of the youth support the continuation of the practice. Low gender roles perception, being from the rural areas, household's lower level of education and being Muslim were strong predictors of the attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation. Improving perception of adolescents towards gender roles through effective behavior change communication, and involving religious leaders in the campaign against the practice of female genital mutilation is recommended as a useful strategy to ban the practice.",Ethiopian journal of health sciences,2009,Ethiopia,2009,00
11055454,The SF-12 as a population health measure: an exploratory examination of potential for application.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationships among functional health status measures (SF-12 physical and mental components summary scores), traditional measures of community health status, and social determinants of health among respondents to community health status surveys conducted in nine different communities. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Data collected as part of comprehensive community health status assessments conducted in each of nine communities (in seven states) between 1992 and 1997. The purpose of each assessment was to gather data to plan and evaluate population health improvement initiatives. STUDY DESIGN AND DATA COLLECTION: This is an opportunistic study drawing on the universe of community health survey data collected by the authors to support local health improvement initiatives. Both community-level as well as an aggregate of individual-level measures are used in the analysis. Within each locality, survey respondents were randomly selected using a telephone-facilitated, mailed survey methodology. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The key variables reported here are functional health status measures (SF-12) and social determinants of health variables. SF-12 physical and mental component scales correlated with two of four traditional measures of community health status. At the aggregate level of analysis, significant relationships were found for seven of nine social determinants of health measures when compared with SF-12 component summary scores. Relationships between social determinants measures and PCS-12 and MCS-12 scores suggest both application possibilities and the need for additional analysis in order to understand the nature of those relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Physical and mental health functioning summary scores as measured by the SF-12 are useful in describing overall community health status when compared with traditional measures such as total deaths, age-adjusted mortality, or physician to population ratio. The SF-12 can also be used to measure the relationship between physical and mental health functioning (as proxies for community health status) and the social determinants of health. This analysis can help to refine our understanding of how social determinants and health status interact in a community or population as a precursor to the development of models of community or population health.",Health services research,2000 Oct,United States,2000,00
18568706,Perspectives of survivors of traumatic brain injury and their caregivers on long-term social integration.,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has damaging impacts on victims and family members' lives and their long-term social integration constitutes a major challenge. PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to document the repercussions of TBI on victims' long-term social integration (10 years post-trauma) and the contribution made by the services received from the point of view of TBI victims and family caregivers. This article examines the determinants of long-term social integration as well as the impact of TBI on family caregivers. METHODS: A qualitative design was used (semi-directed interviews). The sample consisted of 22 individuals who had sustained a moderate or severe TBI and 21 family caregivers. RESULTS: The results show that TBI is an experience that continues to present difficulties, even 10 years after the accident, and that different barriers contribute to this difficulty: not going back to work, depressive episodes, problems in relationships and sequellae. Family caregivers must help TBI victims confront the barriers in their path. IMPLICATIONS: This study adopts a longitudinal perspective to help professionals determine how to intervene with TBI victims and their families. It validates the importance of having clients and family caregivers describe their reality.",Brain injury,2008 Jul,England,2008,00
16857048,Interest in healthy living outweighs presumed cultural norms for obesity for Ghanaian women.,"BACKGROUND: Cultural norms indicate that obesity reflects increased wealth and prosperity. Yet obesity is linked to serious medical illnesses. The purpose of this study was to determine if Ghanaian women would change their body image if it meant a healthier life. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to 305 Ghanaian women waiting for clinic appointments at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra Ghana. This survey included questions on current health, selection of figural stimuli, decision making on health and social determinants and 5 questions on self-perception of health from SF-36. Anthropometric measures were taken and body mass index calculated. Women were also provided with health related information at the conclusion of the interview. RESULTS: The majority of all women surveyed would reduce their current body image if it meant that they would have an overall healthier life and reduce the risks of obesity-linked illnesses and complications. Currently obese women were significantly more likely than non-obese women to reduce their body image to reduce the risk of hypertension (OR 2.03 [1.64 - 2.51],<0.001); cardiovascular accident (OR 1.96 [1.61 - 2.38],<0.001); diabetes (OR 2.00 [1.63 - 2.44],<0.001); myocardial infarction (OR 2.27 [1.80 - 2.86],<0.001); if requested by a spouse(OR 2.64 [1.98 - 3.52],<0.001); and to improve overall health (OR 1.95 [1.60 - 2.37], <0.001). There was no association with current body image and responses to SF-36. The decision to select a new body image was not influenced by education, income, marital status or parity. Age 50 years old and less was significantly associated with the body image size reduction to reduce the risk of hypertension, diabetes, and a cardiovascular accident. CONCLUSION: The Ghanaian women interviewed in this study are interested in living a healthy life and are willing to reduce their body size to reduce the risk of obesity-linked illnesses. The target group for any interventional studies and measures to reduce obesity appears to be women age 50 and younger.",Health and quality of life outcomes,2006 Jul 20,England,2006,00
11043876,Service needs of parents with motor or multiply disabled children in Dutch therapeutic toddler classes.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine parents' service needs at the start of therapeutic toddler class treatment, to analyse determinants and to investigate received help after a period of 10 months. SUBJECTS: Parents with motor or multiply disabled children in therapeutic toddler classes. SETTING: Sixteen out of 17 Dutch rehabilitation centres. DESIGN: A sample of 84 parents, stratified according to toddler class size. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A questionnaire of 33 items, divided into five categories, was designed to assess parents' needs and to evaluate the amount of received help. Several measures were used to assess child, parent and family characteristics. RESULTS: Based on factor analysis, five need subscales were distinguished which only partially corresponded to the initial categories. The initial category concerning needs for help in family functioning did not come out as a factor. Needs expressed most frequently belonged to the three subscales of needs for information concerning the child. The average level of needs generally did not differ for mothers and fathers across the subscales. However, we found large variation in needs for both mothers and fathers on each subscale. The most important, positively correlated determinant of parents' needs was social isolation of the family. After 10 months a considerable level of unmet needs was found. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic and periodic assessment of individual needs of parents as well as the services offered is recommended. Professionals of the therapeutic toddler classes should especially focus on providing parents with information on their child's disability and therapy, community services and parenting.",Clinical rehabilitation,2000 Oct,England,2000,00
15704819,Changing ecological determinants of conduct problems from early adolescence to early adulthood.,"Changes in conduct problems from middle school through early adulthood were examined in a sample of 1191 African American and White males and females. Predictors were selected from a number of ecological contexts to examine the relative contribution of family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors to conduct problems during the 7th, 8th, and 11th grade and across transitions in middle school, into high school, and into young adulthood. Almost all contexts made a unique contribution to conduct problems except for the neighborhood setting. The variables that had the most regular influences during each of these periods were Family Consistent Control, Family Discipline Harshness, and Negative Peers. Positive family and positive peer variables had less consistent relations to outcomes. School variables were more influential in middle school than later. Few gender or race differences were found in the patterning of predictors across time. Studies using only one or two settings as predictors of conduct problems, may provide a misleading picture of their impact by excluding other contextual influences.",Development and psychopathology,2004 Fall,United States,2004,00
11075414,Clinical epidemiology and research on HIV infection in Switzerland: the Swiss HIV Cohort Study 1988-2000.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) was initiated in 1988 and represented the main scientific component of the comprehensive response to the AIDS epidemic in Switzerland. It brought together physicians and scientists from five university hospitals (Basel, Berne, Geneva, Lausanne and Zurich) and two Cantonal hospitals (Lugano and St. Gallen). The objective of SHCS was, and still is, to produce rapid, high quality patient-oriented medical research in the field of HIV infection. METHODS: SHCS is a prospective population-based cohort study. Any HIV-infected person aged > or = 16 years is eligible to participate. Data collection and study procedures are standardised. Data quality and protocol monitoring are conducted at the coordination and data centre in Lausanne. Detailed information on demographics, income, mode of HIV acquisition, risk behaviours, clinical events, laboratory results, treatment and treatment tolerance is collected at registration and at 6-monthly intervals. RESULTS: Since 1996, 10,600 persons have been enrolled and the SHCS study population is considered fairly representative of the HIV-infected population in Switzerland, at least in terms of gender and mode of HIV acquisition. In 1999, 4600 patients were actively followed up and more than 70% of patients were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). As a consequence, mortality and the incidence of HIV-related opportunistic infections have decreased significantly in the recent past. Between 1996 and 2000, 91 original manuscripts have been published by SHCS scientists and physicians, almost exclusively in peer-reviewed journals. A wide range of scientific questions have been addressed, including HIV primary infection, the natural history of HIV infection, the clinical and biological impact of HAART, drug resistance, risk factors for disease evolution including the timing of treatment initiation, the role of CD4 receptors, the validity of HIV surveillance reports, determinants of treatment access and tolerance, clinical trials of new drug combinations, the interruption of prophylaxis following a favourable response to HAART and issues relating to quality of life and interaction between income, social level and disease evolution. CONCLUSION: The SHCS has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on medical practice, public health and research in Switzerland and beyond. It represents a network of excellence which has brought together and fostered intensive collaboration between physicians and institutions throughout this country and beyond. This was possible thanks to the support of the Federal Office of Public Health and the commitment of primary care physicians, researchers and patients. This project may be model for focused and prioritised multicentre and transdisciplinary research programmes.",Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,2000 Oct 14,Switzerland,2000,00
15774446,Facets and determinants of quality of life in patients with recurrent high grade glioma.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess patients with recurrent high grade brain glioma with the aim of evaluating facets of quality of life (QOL) and their association with mood, cognition, and physical performance. METHODS: Ninety four glioma patients (four groups with different duration of glioma recurrence) were compared with 24 patients with other chronic neurological diseases and 48 healthy subjects. The Functional Living Index-Cancer (FLIC) provided QOL self evaluations, and standardised scales and neuropsychological tests assessed physical performance, mood, and cognition. RESULTS: In glioma patients, factor analysis of the FLIC items documented five domains: Psychological well being, Role/sociability, Inner experience of disease, Isolation/sharing, and Nausea. Higher FLIC total scores were related to better cognition, physical performances, and mood, and lower grading; poorer Psychological well being and worse Inner experience of disease to depressed mood; minor Role/sociability to worse cognitive and physical performances and higher grading; worse Nausea to longer disease duration. Compared with healthy subjects, all glioma groups were cognitively impaired and more anxious, and two groups with short duration of recurrence were also more depressed. Patients with chronic neurological diseases showed worse mood and cognitive abilities compared with healthy subjects, but performed attention tests better than glioma patients. Glioma and chronic disease patients showed similar FLIC scores and autonomy. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that QOL of recurrent high grade glioma patients is multifaceted and determined by multiple factors. Disease severity does not necessarily eliminate the possibility of expressing personal feelings and opinions which could provide criteria for clinical decision making and psychological support.","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2005 Apr,England,2005,00
11109180,"Primary care, income inequality, and self-rated health in the United States: a mixed-level analysis.","Using the 1996 Community Tracking Study household survey, the authors examined whether income inequality and primary care, measured at the state level, predict individual morbidity as measured by self-rated health status, while adjusting for potentially confounding individual variables. Their results indicate that distributions of income and primary care within states are significantly associated with individuals' self-rated health; that there is a gradient effect of income inequality on self-rated health; and that individuals living in states with a higher ratio of primary care physician to population are more likely to report good health than those living in states with a lower such ratio. From a policy perspective, improvement in individuals' health is likely to require a multi-pronged approach that addresses individual socioeconomic determinants of health, social and economic policies that affect income distribution, and a strengthening of the primary care aspects of health services.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2000,United States,2000,00
21119817,"The state of child development in Canada: Are we moving toward, or away from, equity from the start?","Young children have a remarkable capacity for developmental plasticity in response to the environments where they grow up, live and learn. In recognition of this capacity, the World Health Organization International Commission on the Social Determinants of Health recommended in 2008 that ""governments build universal coverage of a comprehensive package of quality early child development programs and services for children, mothers, and other caregivers, regardless of ability to pay"". Yet, in its recent report card on early learning and care, the United Nations Children's Fund revealed that Canada met only one out of 10 benchmarks, tying for last place with Ireland out of 26 wealthy countries. Not surprisingly, in Canada, large socioeconomic disparities emerge early in life in children's physical, social/emotional and language/cognitive development, which are largely attributable to systematic differences in the nature of their early environments. Moreover, there is evidence of decline in the state of early child development in Canada in recent years, concurrent with increasing economic and time pressures on families. To date, Canada has had the weakest public policy response (among the wealthy countries) to the emerging understanding of the importance of the early years. If recent activities and initiatives in Ontario, Quebec, the Canadian Senate and several other provinces are fully realized, Canada will begin to close the gap between what we know and what we do in the early childhood years.",Paediatrics & child health,2009 Dec,England,2009,00
18328149,Factors influencing calcaneus quantitative ultrasound measurements in an urban population.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of demographic, social, behavioural and anthropometric factors on quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters in an urban population. METHODS: Cross-sectional evaluation of consecutive subjects selected as part of the EPIPorto study, Portugal. Information was obtained on demographic, social, clinical and behavioural characteristics using a standard protocol. Calcaneus QUS parameters (Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation-BUA, and Speed of Sound-SOS) were obtained for men and women, stratified by age group. Comparisons according to exposure levels were made using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the multivariate effect on QUS parameters was estimated by linear regression. RESULTS: 1482 consecutive subjects (1010 females and 472 males), aged from 18 to 92 years. Higher levels of QUS parameters were found in the younger groups and progressive decrease with age were reported. Men showed higher values as compared to women in all parameters and differences between them increased with age. Differences were significant for BUA after the age of 39 and for SOS after the age of 59. In women, the multivariate model showed that age, body mass index (BMI) and smoking status were independent predictors of BUA and SOS. In men, age, BMI and calcium intake were significantly associated with BUA and SOS. CONCLUSION: The reference values in our Portuguese population are similar to others obtained in Southern European countries. In the Portuguese population, QUS parameters have age, sex and BMI as its major determinants. In addition, BUA and SOS may reflect specific bone characteristics influenced by a different set of independent determinants.",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,2008 Jan-Feb,Italy,2008,00

They will have to watch over, guide and help the demented proxy. The families' invaluable contribution and the numerous difficulties they encounter while they care for their demented proxy are insufficiently recognized.

DESIGN: Six focus groups and one-on-one interviews. SETTING: Large, public Midwestern university. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty full-time freshman and sophomore students. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Factors influencing weight and weight-related behaviors among undergraduates. ANALYSIS: Qualitative analysis using a specific thematic approach, identifying themes appearing consistently across transcripts from recorded sessions. RESULTS: Major themes that emerged in describing important influences on weight, dietary intake, and physical activity included: unhealthful food availability on campus, snacking, late-night eating, alcohol-related eating, eating because of stress/boredom, and food in student dorm rooms. Other factors related to physical activity included: negative experiences using campus recreation facilities; poor weather; and lack of time/time management, motivation, and social support for exercise. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A wide range of factors may underlie weight gain and unhealthful diet and physical activity patterns during the college years. Young adulthood is an important and overlooked area for obesity prevention efforts. Universities need to take an active role in designing and evaluating weight-related health promotion intervention strategies focusing on a variety of targets, including individual-, social-, and environmental-level influences.",Journal of nutrition education and behavior,2009 Jul-Aug,United States,2009,00

15478162,Identification of modifiable work-related factors that influence the risk of work disability in rheumatoid arthritis.,"OBJECTIVE: To define work-related factors associated with increased risk of work disability (WD) in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Questionnaires were mailed to all RA patients who used a province-wide arthritis treatment program between 1991 and 1998 (n = 1,824). The association between risk factors and WD (defined as no paid work due to RA for at least 6 months) was assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis, controlling for significant sociodemographic and disease-related variables. RESULTS: Of the original 1,824 patients, 581 were eligible and responded to the questionnaire. Work survival analysis revealed a steady rate of WD starting early, with 7.5%, 18%, and 27% work disabled at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Significant determinants in multiple logistic regression were physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire), pain (visual analog scale), and 6 work-related factors: self employment, workstation modification, work importance, family support toward employment, commuting difficulty, and comfort telling coworkers about RA. CONCLUSION: Work disability occurs early in RA.

Cluster size may depend on patient or strain characteristics. In a 7-year population-based study of tuberculosis in Karonga District, Malawi, clusters were defined by using IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism, excluding patterns with <5 bands. Spoligotyping was used to compare strains with an international database. Among 682 clustered patients, cluster size ranged from 2 to 37. Male patients, young adults, and town residents were over-represented in large clusters. Cluster size was not associated with HIV status or death from tuberculosis. Spoligotypes from 9 (90%) of 10 large cluster strains were identical or very similar (1 spacer different) to common spoligotypes found elsewhere, compared with 37 (66%) of 56 of those from nonclustered patients (p = 0.3).

17617010,Mapping as a visual health communication tool: promises and dilemmas.,"In the era of evidence-based public health promotion and planning, the use of maps as a form of evidence to communicate about the multiple determinants of cancer is on the rise. Geographic information systems and mapping technologies make future proliferation of this strategy likely. Yet disease maps as a communication form remain largely unexamined. This content analysis considers the presence of multivariate information, credibility cues, and the communication function of publicly accessible maps for cancer control activities. Thirty-six state comprehensive cancer control plans were publicly available in July 2005 and were reviewed for the presence of maps. Fourteen of the 36 state cancer plans (39%) contained map images (N = 59 static maps). A continuum of map inter activity was observed, with 10 states having interactive mapping tools available to query and map cancer information. Four states had both cancer plans with map images and interactive mapping tools available to the public on their Web sites. Of the 14 state cancer plans that depicted map images, two displayed multivariate data in a single map. Nine of the 10 states with interactive mapping capability offered the option to display multivariate health risk messages. The most frequent content category mapped was cancer incidence and mortality, with stage at diagnosis infrequently available. The most frequent communication function served by the maps reviewed was redundancy, as maps repeated information contained in textual forms. The social and ethical implications for communicating about cancer through the use of visual geographic representations are discussed.",Health communication,2007,England,2007,00
18709140,Integrating human health into environmental impact assessment: an unrealized opportunity for environmental health and justice.,"OBJECTIVES: The National Environmental Policy Act and related state laws require many public agencies to analyze and disclose potentially significant environmental effects of agency actions, including effects on human health. In this paper we review the purpose and procedures of environmental impact assessment (EIA), existing regulatory requirements for health effects analysis, and potential barriers to and opportunities for improving integration of human health concerns within the EIA process. DATA SOURCES: We use statutes, regulations, guidelines, court opinions, and empirical research on EIA along with recent case examples of integrated health impact assessment (HIA)/EIA at both the state and federal level. DATA SYNTHESIS: We extract lessons and recommendations for integrated HIA/EIA practice from both existing practices as well as case studies. CONCLUSIONS: The case studies demonstrate the adequacy, scope, and power of existing statutory requirements for health analysis within EIA. The following support the success of integrated HIA/EIA: a proponent recognizing EIA as an available regulatory strategy for public health; the openness of the agency conducting the EIA; involvement of public health institutions; and complementary objectives among community stakeholders and health practitioners. We recommend greater collaboration among institutions responsible for EIA, public health institutions, and affected stakeholders along with guidance, resources, and training for integrated HIA/EIA practice.",Environmental health perspectives,2008 Aug,United States,2008,00
18990731,Social determinants of Black-White disparities in breast cancer mortality: a review.,"Despite the recent decline in breast cancer mortality, African American women continue to die from breast cancer at higher rates than do White women. Beyond the fact that breast cancer tends to be a more biologically aggressive disease in African American than in White women, this disparity in breast cancer mortality also reflects social barriers that disproportionately affect African American women. These barriers hinder cancer prevention and control efforts and modify the biological expression of disease. The present review focuses on delineating social, economic, and cultural factors that are potentially responsible for Black-White disparities in breast cancer mortality. This review was guided by the social determinants of health disparities model, a model that identifies barriers associated with poverty, culture, and social injustice as major causes of health disparities. These barriers, in concert with genetic, biological, and environmental factors, can promote differential outcomes for African American and White women along the entire breast cancer continuum, from screening and early detection to treatment and survival. Barriers related to poverty include lack of a primary care physician, inadequate health insurance, and poor access to health care. Barriers related to culture include perceived invulnerability, folk beliefs, and a general mistrust of the health care system. Barriers related to social injustice include racial profiling and discrimination. Many of these barriers are potentially modifiable. Thus, in addition to biomedical advancements, future efforts to reduce disparities in breast cancer mortality should address social barriers that perpetuate disparities among African American and White women in the United States.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2008 Nov,United States,2008,00
19035829,Health psychology: developing biologically plausible models linking the social world and physical health.,"Research over the past several decades has documented psychosocial influences on the development and progression of several major medical illnesses. The field is now increasingly focused on identifying the biological and behavioral mechanisms underlying these effects. This review takes stock of the knowledge accumulated in the biological arena to date and highlights conceptual and methodological approaches that have proven especially productive. It emphasizes the value of a disease-centered approach that ""reverse engineers"" adverse health outcomes into their specific biological determinants and then identifies psychologically modulated neuroendocrine and immunologic dynamics that modulate those pathological processes at the cellular and molecular levels.",Annual review of psychology,2009,United States,2009,00
15341136,"Dental caries status and need for dental treatment of Pennsylvania public school children in grades 1, 3, 9, and 11.","OBJECTIVES: This cross-sectional study was designed to determine the caries status and provide a general evaluation of the level of dental treatment need of Pennsylvania public school children in grades 1, 3, 9, and 11 on a statewide and regional basis. METHODS: Between September 1998 and May 2000, caries status and treatment need were assessed using a school-based dental examination, performed on a representative sample (n=6,040) of public school children in grades 1, 3, 9, and 11 (age range=6 to 21 years). Children's caries status in the primary and permanent dentition was assessed. Need for treatment was scored on a three-level categorical scale--no treatment need identified, routine treatment need, and urgent treatment need--and was based on the presence and severity of caries and other oral conditions. Population estimates of the prevalence of untreated dental caries, DMFT and dft scores, and treatment need were calculated by grade and geographically, using the six Pennsylvania health districts and the cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The inequality of caries distribution in the population was assessed for both permanent and primary caries using Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients. RESULTS: Dental caries has remained highly prevalent among Pennsylvania's public school children. Caries levels varied considerably by health districts and city. Urgent treatment needs were significant and also varied by health district and city. CONCLUSIONS: Dental caries remains the most prevalent disease affecting Pennsylvania's schoolchildren. Caries status varies significantly by region of the state, suggesting that environmental, social, and demographic contextual factors may be important determinants of disease prevalence.",Journal of public health dentistry,2004 Summer,United States,2004,00
19276102,Sociodemographic differences in return to work after stroke: the South London Stroke Register (SLSR).,"BACKGROUND: Loss of employment contributes significantly to the burden of stroke on individuals and society. There is limited information on factors influencing return to work after stroke. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency and determinants of return to paid work after stroke in a multi-ethnic urban population. METHODS: Patterns of return to work were examined among people with first ever stroke registered in the population based South London Stroke Register. Employment status and functional outcome (Barthel Index (BI), Frenchay Activity Index (FAI)) were assessed 1 year after stroke. Associations between baseline characteristics and return to paid work were analysed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among 2874 patients with first ever strokes in 1995-2004, 400 (15%) were working before the stroke. At 1 year, 94 (35%) of 266 survivors had returned to paid work. Black ethnicity (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.88), female sex (0.43; 0.21 to 0.91), older age (p<0.001), diabetes (0.25; 0.08 to 0.79) and dependence (BI < or = 19) in the acute phase (0.24; 0.11 to 0.49) were independently associated with lower odds of return to work in multivariable analysis. Better functional outcome at 1 year was associated with return to paid work (p<0.001) but 53% of 161 independent (BI > 19) and 39% of 96 very active (FAI > 30/45) individuals had not resumed work. CONCLUSIONS: There were important sociodemographic differences in return to work after stroke that were independent of clinical and service use variables included in the analysis. A large proportion of patients did not resume work despite excellent functional outcome.","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2009 Aug,England,2009,00
17605588,Implicit negotiation beliefs and performance: experimental and longitudinal evidence.,"The authors argue that implicit negotiation beliefs, which speak to the expected malleability of negotiating ability, affect performance in dyadic negotiations. They expected negotiators who believe negotiating attributes are malleable (incremental theorists) to outperform negotiators who believe negotiating attributes are fixed (entity theorists). In Study 1, they gathered evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the implicit negotiation belief construct. In Study 2, they examined the impact of implicit beliefs on the achievement goals that negotiators pursue. In Study 3, they explored the causal role of implicit beliefs on negotiation performance by manipulating negotiators' implicit beliefs within dyads. They also identified perceived ability as a moderator of the link between implicit negotiation beliefs and performance. In Study 4, they measured negotiators' beliefs in a classroom setting and examined how these beliefs affected negotiation performance and overall performance in the course 15 weeks later. Across all performance measures, incremental theorists outperformed entity theorists. Consistent with the authors' hypotheses, incremental theorists captured more of the bargaining surplus and were more integrative than their entity theorist counterparts, suggesting implicit theories are important determinants of how negotiators perform. Implications and future directions are discussed.",Journal of personality and social psychology,2007 Jul,United States,2007,00
16753093,[Field epidemiology and social epidemiology].,"Comparing field epidemiology and social epidemiology, we pretend to think about the no explicit images and meanings operating in both necessary convergent fields, about the obstacles present in epidemiological practice to fulfil its social function and about the necessity of changing epistemological, methodological and practice grounds, beginning with field epidemiologists teaching programmes. Field epidemiology would tend to act in an absent theoretical frame. On the other hand, social epidemiology would tend to prioritize theoretical developments (thinking and research about social determinants) without correspondent action, because of the limits to change public policies. Other differences are found at intervention level (micro-macrospace), its aim (outbreak control vs. inequalities control) and the way to communicate with society. They are similar in the methodological concern, the predominance of orientation based on positivism and framed through statistic methods, but in process of epistemological opening, the stress experienced between the alternative relationship to a virtual world of data bases or to the real society, their peripherical situation in relation of the political, social, institutional and professional system and the tendency to professional frustration. Finally, we ask ten questions to the field epidemiologists related with their present practice, in order to consider if they are developing social epidemiology, and propose some changes in epidemiologist teaching and practice.",Gaceta sanitaria,2006 Mar-Apr,Spain,2006,00
14572920,"Beyond the income inequality hypothesis: class, neo-liberalism, and health inequalities.","This paper describes and critiques the income inequality approach to health inequalities. It then presents an alternative class-based model through a focus on the causes and not only the consequences of income inequalities. In this model, the relationship between income inequality and health appears as a special case within a broader causal chain. It is argued that global and national socio-political-economic trends have increased the power of business classes and lowered that of working classes. The neo-liberal policies accompanying these trends led to increased income inequality but also poverty and unequal access to many other health-relevant resources. But international pressures towards neo-liberal doctrines and policies are differentially resisted by various nations because of historically embedded variation in class and institutional structures. Data presented indicates that neo-liberalism is associated with greater poverty and income inequalities, and greater health inequalities within nations. Furthermore, countries with Social Democratic forms of welfare regimes (i.e., those that are less neo-liberal) have better health than do those that are more neo-liberal. The paper concludes with discussion of what further steps are needed to ""go beyond"" the income inequality hypothesis towards consideration of a broader set of the social determinants of health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2004 Jan,England,2004,00
17985502,Determinants of hypertension care and control among peri-urban Black South Africans: the HiHi study.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine determinants of hypertension (HTN) care and control among peri-urban hypertensive Black South Africans. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive. SETTING: Public and private primary care sites in three townships near Cape Town, South Africa. PARTICIPANTS: 403 hypertensive Black patients (183 men, 220 women), ages 35-65 years. METHODS: The Precede-Proceed Model guided the study. Self-report sociodemographics, medical history, health behaviors, health service utilization, quality of life, social support, and exposure to life threats and illness were assessed. Blood pressure (BP) was measured and height and weight recorded. RESULTS: Mean BP (mm Hg) was 151/99 for men, 142/88 for women with BP controlled (<140/90 mm Hg) among 33% of men, 44% of women. Patient-related barriers to HTN care included limited HTN-related knowledge, poor quality of life and stressors such as family death. An unhealthy lifestyle involving smoking cigarettes, physical inactivity and using alcohol excessively was common. In regression models of select socioeconomic, lifestyle risk and HTN care variables, significant predictors of lower SBP and DBP or BP control included: fewer antihypertensive medications, better compliance to HTN recommendations, younger age, female, higher education level, not using alcohol excessively, and private sector healthcare. CONCLUSION: This study identified a high level of barriers to HTN control and the need for comprehensive multilevel interventions to improve HTN care and control in this high-risk population. Furthermore, the data illustrate that the Hill-Bone compliance scale can be a practical tool in primary healthcare settings to identify patient-related factors and guide counseling to improve adherence in HTN care.",Ethnicity & disease,2007 Summer,United States,2007,00
