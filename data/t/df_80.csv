2963022,Parental attitudes toward children with handicaps: new perspectives with a new measure.,"Research on attitudes toward the disabled generally has focused on adult perceptions of disabled adults, or children's attitudes toward peers. In view of changing social practices, such as mainstreaming in education and community integration of children with special needs, measures of adults' attitudes toward disabled children are needed. This paper reports on the development and validation of a 30-item self-report questionnaire assessing parental attitudes toward children with handicaps, and presents information concerning several determinants of parental attitudes. The measure is easy to use, reliable, and shows good evidence of construct validity. It detects differences among parents by gender, by parental education and occupational status, by cultural background of parents, by parental familiarity with a handicapped person, and by stimulus (physically disabled vs. mentally retarded child referent). Results are discussed in relation to determinants of parental attitudes toward handicaps. Potential applications of this measure for evaluation of teacher attitudes are suggested.",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,1987 Dec,United States,1987,80
7424839,Behavioral determinants of mental illness concerns: a comparison of community subcultures.,"A stratified sample (race, sex, and social class) of 469 laymen from two North Carolina communities responded to a 190-item MMPI-based questionnaire with the degree of mental illness concern evoked by each item. The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance. Although laymen had roughly similar rank orderings for the 13 homogeneous clusters of items, blacks indicated greater concern over breakdowns in social orientation than whites, while the opposite pattern held for traditionally defined psychopathy (internal distresses). Upper-class concerns were, comparatively, with cognitive dysfunction, middle-class with moral and social responsibility, and lower-class with social inadequacies.",American journal of community psychology,1980 Oct,England,1980,80
2858150,A scale for detection of negative attitudes towards medication among relatives of schizophrenic patients.,"The validity of a questionnaire developed to assess negative attitudes towards drug therapy by relatives of schizophrenic patients is examined. The questionnaire items are tested against the statement: ""Patients should not take drugs, they can only be helped by good advice"". The prejudice of relatives of schizophrenics against drug therapy may have an effect on the patients' compliance to maintenance therapy and, subsequently, on their relapse rate. A number of factors, social and psychological, were examined as possible determinants of the negative attitudes of relatives. These factors include age, sex, profession, education, positive family history, and use of drugs among the relatives; mental state, residence, duration of illness, relapse rate and clinical features in the patients. Poor education of relatives correlated to negative attitudes towards drug therapy.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,1985 Feb,United States,1985,80
6848900,Parent-offspring and sibling body mass index associations during and after sharing of common household environments: the Princeton School District Family Study.,"Using the Princeton School Family Study cohort, our specific aim was to determine whether, and to what degree, parent-offspring and sibling associations for measures of body habitus outlast the period of shared common household environment in a single well characterized community. Familial associations of measures in body habitus were assessed in two and three generation kindreds, in parents and their pediatric offspring (less than 20-yr-old), parents and their adult offspring (less than or equal to 20-yr-old), and in pediatric and adult siblings. The cohort included 177 randomly recalled probands and 202 probands from a hyperlipidemic recall group (top decile plasma cholesterol and/or triglyceride). In randomly recalled whites, significant associations of body mass indices in parents and pediatric offspring and in pediatric siblings, and the absence of significant correlations in parents and adult offspring and in adult siblings, emphasize the potency of common household environmental effects relative to within-family similarities for shared body habitus. In whites from the hyperlipidemic recall group, only the mother-pediatric and adult offspring correlations for body mass indices were significant. We speculate that mothers and their offspring from kindreds selected by hyperlipidemic probands are more likely than fathers and their offspring to share eating habits and relative ponderosity, with these communal behaviors outlasting the period of common household environment. Alternatively, and speculatively, in the hyperlipidemic recall group, determinants for ponderosity may be shared more by mothers and their offspring than by fathers and their offspring. Particularly in the random recall group, within-family associations of body mass indices primarily reflect shared common household environments, and probably secondarily, the outcome of genes held in common.",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,1983 Jan,United States,1983,80

28466762,Determinants of mortality transition in developing countries before and after the Second World War: Some evidence from Cuba.,"Few studies provide an insight into what factors contributed to declines in the mortality rates of developing countries before the Second World War. In this paper, statistics on causes of death from Cuba, particularly Havana, are used to investigate what may have been some of the principal determinants of mortality decline in the developing world before the arrival of modern drugs and insecticides. Trends in cause-specific mortality are examined in the light of Cuba's social, economic, medical and public health history. The Cuban experience strongly suggests that in this country public health and sanitary reforms and nutritional improvements were largely responsible for initial declines in mortality throughout the first half of the twentieth century. One important finding is that the impact of these reforms and improved nutrition was greatly influenced by prevailing economic conditions. Periods of economic prosperity facilitated declines in mortality; but in times of adversity, the reverse occurred. It appears that during prosperous periods the maintenance and expansion of public health and sanitary facilities were made possible by increased public and private revenues, and that individuals had access to a more abundant diet. The severe economic crisis of the Great Depression had the opposite effect. With the appearance of sulphonamides in the late 1930s, antibiotics, and residual insecticides and other specific measures at the end of the Second World War, the relevance of economic conditions as a determinant of mortality decline diminished. Although this analysis points to the aforementioned trends, the Cuban experience also suggests that other factors enter into the process of declining mortality and that this phenomenon can only be explained as the result of the complex interplay of many forces.",Population studies,1981 Nov 1,England,1981,80
20841128,Psychosocial environment: a health promotion model.,"This article presents a multidimensional model of psychosocial determinants of health behavior for health promotion research and policy analysis. Frequently, health promotion focuses almost exclusively on intrapsychic determinants and on individual level behavior. Based upon Field Theory and attitude theories, this proposed model holds that in populations with comparable sociodemographic and biological status (exogenous variables) a health behavior is a function of direct and interaction effects of five key intrapsychic and external variables. These are: behavioral intentions, social support, accessibility of means for action, personal autonomy, and action situation. Empirical tests with cross-cultural studies in Venezuela, Kenya, and the Philippines provide substantial support for the model. The findings suggest that while health promotion strategies should deal with intrapsychic determinants of behavior, key extrapsychic factors (such as social support, quality and accessibility of health care measures, and situational factors) all have direct and independent effects on health behavior as well. Health promotion research and interventions which aim exclusively at intrapsychic determinants would thus have rather limited overall value. The article discusses key research and policy implications of the model presented.",International quarterly of community health education,1983 Jan 1,United States,1983,80
6738684,[The formation of eating behavior].,"Food behaviour involves the totality of the actions of man which aim at satisfying his nutritional need. It is based on psychical reflection, decision and assessment processes. Food behaviour has social and historical determinants and forms accordingly to the dialectic relation of biological, social and economic conditions. Hunger, thirst and appetite are perceived as nutritional need which results from the requirements of energy, nutrients and liquid, and is satisfied by the food behaviour in conformity with the actual material potential, situational influences, subjective ideas, interests, attitudes and knowledge as well as other psychical properties. Consequently, food behaviour is rich in variations with dynamic and conservative features. Motives as well as will components are essential constituent conditions of food behaviour. For this reason, empirical studies arteo provide psychological cognition concerning the subjective reflection of the nutritional requirements, the requirement-standard integration, the sensation of stimulation and the decision-making in food behaviour, the ultimate goal being to deduce measures for food behaviour guidance.",Die Nahrung,1984,Germany,1984,80
6139036,[Determinants of depressive reactions in the aged].,"A community sample of older adults was investigated to test some of the current hypothesis about the etiology of depression in the elderly. Multiple regression analysis showed that cognitive disturbances (memory, concentration), previous depressive episodes, and somatic health problems accounted for most of the etiological variance. Other variables, like stressful life events, financial problems, social isolation, alcohol use, age, sex, and previous somatic illnesses are significant but their numerical values are very small. Etiological insignificant were the variables: physical activities, competency in daily living, and support by ones own children.",Aktuelle Gerontologie,1983 Sep,Germany,1983,80

3071406,Psychosomatics of beauty and ugliness: theoretical implications of the systems approach.,"In this presentation, physical appearance has been considered an inseparable part of daily human existence. Relevant aspects of research in social psychology on interpersonal attraction and personality theory stressing narcissistic vulnerability were reviewed. General systems theory was proposed as a theoretical framework from which to view the multifactorial aspects of the psychosomatics of beauty and ugliness. In support of this proposition, the contemporary use of systems thinking in medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, family therapy, and the understanding of emotions was stressed. Emotional reactions to the evaluations of physical appearance by self and others were shown to be inevitable, involving appraisal and feedback processes affecting different systems in the person's life. The person's self-image and self-esteem were stressed as underlying determinants of outcome in health and in illness. Finally, we hope to have communicated our belief that in the present, as a way of integrating and summarizing the knowledge obtained in the specialized fields, systems thinking allows for more creative and successful treatment outcomes.",Clinics in dermatology,1988 Jul-Sep,United States,1988,80
3219420,[Psychological implications of cancer. I. Psychological consequences of the disease].,"The psychological consequences of cancer are most frequently reactive and do not constitute a major psychiatric illness. Anxiety and depression are the two main psychological disorders which occur frequently but with variable intensity according to the type of disease, its course, as well as the individual and social background of the patient. Physical factors such as digestive disorders, pain, mutilation and sterility can undermine the psychological adaptation. Cognitive impairment is generally due to neurological localizations of the disease or to metabolic abnormalities. The interrelationship between somatic and psychological factors must be carefully analyzed in order to recognize the determinants of suffering and abnormal coping or behavior.",Bulletin du cancer,1988,France,1988,80
3060449,Determinants of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays: a pilot study.,"Estimates of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays have always been varied, and given Medicare's new Prospective Payment System (PPS) based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), they are likely to have changed again. Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement.",Health services research,1988 Dec,United States,1988,80

2911699,Determinants of well-being in primary caregivers of spinal cord injured persons.,"A study of well-being in middle-aged and elderly spinal cord injured persons (Decker & Schulz, 1985) found that long-term coping was facilitated by the presence of a primary support person or caregiver. The purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of life satisfaction and depression in 67 primary caregivers of middle-aged and elderly spinal cord injured persons. The study revealed that the availability of social support and feelings of control over one's life were important determinants of caregivers' well-being. In addition, those caregivers spending more time each day assisting the disabled person and feeling burdened by these responsibilities experienced more depression and less life satisfaction. In working with spinal cord injured persons, rehabilitation nurses must consider the well-being of the spinal cord injured person/primary caregiver dyad as an important focus of nursing assessment and intervention.",Rehabilitation nursing : the official journal of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses,1989 Jan-Feb,United States,1989,80
3788206,A prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in preschool children belonging to a prepaid group practice: background and methods.,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,1986 Nov-Dec,United States,1986,80
6706793,Ecological factors predicting adolescent contraceptive use: implications for intervention.,"Questionnaires addressing areas expected to relate to contraceptive use were completed by 230 female adolescents. Contraceptive use among the 130 sexually active subjects were predicted by a model composed of 12 scales assessing social permissiveness, costs and benefits of contraception, parent communication, boyfriend support, sex education and knowledge, attitudes about pregnancy and contraception, and access to contraception services. Scales from the predictive model which raise ideas for potential intervention strategies assessed parent communication, boyfriend support, and perceived costs and benefits related to contraception. Since there has been public concern that intervention programs for enhancing adolescent contraceptive use might also stimulate sexual activity, correlations were computed between the predictive scales and the measure of sexual experience among all 230 subjects. These data indicated that positive parent communication about sexuality and a perception of high benefits and low costs associated with contraceptive use were not positively correlated with sexual experience. Implications for the prevention of adolescent pregnancy are discussed with an emphasis on designing innovative sex education, improving parent-child communication, resolving conflicts in contraceptive decisionmaking, and supporting the role of boyfriends in contraceptive use.",Journal of adolescent health care : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1984 Apr,United States,1984,80
3049068,The precaution adoption process.,"This article presents a critique of current models of preventive behavior. It discusses a variety of factors that are usually overlooked-including the appearance of costs and benefits over time, the role of cues to action, the problem of competing life demands, and the ways that actual decision behavior differs from the rational ideal implicit in expectancy-value and utility theories. Such considerations suggest that the adoption of new precautions should be viewed as a dynamic process with many determinants. The framework of a model that is able to accommodate these additional factors is described. This alternative model portrays the precaution adoption process as an orderly sequence of qualitatively different cognitive stages. Data illustrating a few of the suggestions made in the article are presented, and implications for prevention programs are discussed.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1988,United States,1988,80
3701583,Counselor and client personality as determinants of counselor expectancy effects.,"Seventy-eight students enrolled in summer-session college courses were randomly assigned to serve either as counselors or as clients for a 20-min, role-played peer counseling session. All of the subjects completed a battery of standardized personality measures. Each counselor interacted with two clients. Prior to the sessions, the counselor was led to believe that one of the clients was especially introverted and that the other client was especially extraverted. Dependent measures were based on clients' change scores on a mood adjective rating scale administered before and after the peer counseling sessions. Analyses showed that counselors who were more successful at biasing their clients in the direction of their expectancies (a) scored higher on measures of Dogmatism, Nurturance, and Social Recognition, (b) scored lower on Impulsivity, and (c) were more likely to be women. Clients who were more susceptible to counselor bias scored higher on the Self-Monitoring Scale, the Self-Monitoring Other-Directedness subscale, and Social Recognition. These results are discussed in light of previous research and their implications for research on interpersonal expectancy effects.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1986 Feb,United States,1986,80

7390022,The first foray: maternal influences in nest egression in the weanling rat.,"A series of experiments was performed to examine the determinants of the rat pups' 1st excursions from the maternal nest into the novel environment outside the burrow. A standardized, nidic environment consisting of a maternal nest and adjoining open field was studied under a variety of structured test conditions. When the mother was outside the nest, pups readily ventured into the field. The early excursions were not stimulated by the mother's absence from the nest because when the mother was removed from the nest but not placed in the field the pups remained nestbound. Anesthetized dams elicited few excursions, suggesting that olfactory cues are less potent in this situation than behaviorally transmitted signals. Nonlactating adults were not attractive to pups but after induction of ""maternal responsiveness"" concaveated males facilitated egression. The data from a final experiment suggest that when in the nest, the dam stimulates egression by providing additional ""permissive"" stimuli that render the weanling more responsive to approach cues outside the nest.",Developmental psychobiology,1980 Jul,United States,1980,80
7439106,[Tendency of specialization in medicine].,"The evolution of medicine from an applied science to the extension of specialized medical care delivery, has had a bearing on the student's early decision, influenced by a specialist teacher, to chose specialization in a given field. The author gives current explanations of the specialization process in order to conclude that, in Brazil, one of its leading determinants is a policy of the social welfare system that favors the specialist. Other factors cited are the (not always justified) preference of patients--at least of those who can afford it--for physicians who work with sophisticated equipment, the vested interests of the industry that produces or owns that equipment, and the desire of the young physician to escape the stiff competition he would encounter in general practice, while at the same time separating himself from the somewhat negative image of the general clinician who does not keep abreast of developments in medicine. The author examines the question in light of sociological theories of social and technical division of labor, and asserts that the process has led to the atomization of responsibilities among physicians who have become incapable, because of overspecialization, of viewing the patient as a biological, psychological, social and cultural whole.",Educacion medica y salud,1980,United States,1980,80

7143281,Adjustment to life after stroke with special reference to sexual intercourse and leisure.,"Changes in frequency of sexual intercourse and of leisure activities were related to degree of physical impairment and levels of dependence in primary and secondary ADL in 110 subjects with one stroke. About 75% of the subjects reduced their frequency or ceased having intercourse and active leisure. While changes in frequency of intercourse were temporally independent, changes in leisure activities were less pronounced for subjects examined later than 12 months after the stroke than for those investigated earlier. For intercourse, primarily ADL-dependence and impaired cutaneous sensibility were major negative determinants. Moreover, subjects with previously known arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus had changed relatively less than those without these ailments, probably due to pre-stroke reductions. It is suggested that the marked changes in sexual and leisure activities are accomplished by unsuccessful coping with the vascular catastrophe and its sequelae. Aspects of coping problems, primarily the disease-related, but also those of intra- and inter-personal nature are discussed.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1982,England,1982,80

The causes of this decline have thus far not been established. Six major strategies for investigating determinants of ischemic heart disease mortality trends are discussed in this review: (1) analyses of mortality data; (2) morbidity surveillance; (3) surveillance of change in medical care; (4) surveillance of cardiovascular risk factors; (5) social and ecological surveillance; (6) experimental and quasi-experimental community approaches.

12282631,Population structure.,"This paper reviews recent new trends in population structure in the world and its major regions in order to access the determinants of those trends and explore issues regarding the recent and projected changes in the age structure of population and the relationships of those changes to social and economic development. In particular, the paper compares the change in age structure projected by the Population Division of the UN Secretariat in its most recent 3 series--namely, those completed in 1984, 1986, and 1988. By and large, the most recent UN assessment projects that a larger proportion of the world population will be aged 60 and over in 2000 and 2025 than was previously estimated. Those changes in projections can be observed for the world and for the more developed countries as a whole, and for the regions of Africa, Latin America, Northern America, East Asia, Europe, and Oceania. While the recommendations of the International Conference on Population called attention to the importance of changes in population structure, this paper recommends urgent government action in planning social programs for the aged because of the greater eminence of population aging in many settings. The case of Japan is used to illustrate the growing importance of increases in life expectancy as a determinant of age structure changes (in relation to fertility decline), a point that is reinforced through a cruder decomposition of UN estimates and projections for several European countries.",Population bulletin of the United Nations,1989,United States,1989,80
7057173,Sociocultural determinants of the help-seeking behavior of patients with mental illness.,"This descriptive study employed semistructured interviewing and questionnaire administration to delineate the sociocultural determinants of the help-seeking process in 48 psychiatric patients. The help-seeking process is considered in two stages. The first stage starts from the recognition of initial symptoms and ends in the first contact with a mental health professional. The second stage is defined as that time between the first contact and actual participation in a planned treatment program. In both stages, patients typically go through phases of lay consultation, nonpsychiatric professional consultation, and referral. The multiple steps which are usually involved in help seeking often result in significant delay of both mental health contact and treatment. The help-seeking process was found to correlate strongly with ethnicity. Both Asians and Blacks showed more extended family involvement, and the involvement of key family members tended to be persistent and intensive in Asians. Ethnicity was also associated with the length of delay, with Asians showing the longest delay and Caucasians the least. These ethnic differences were also reflected in help-seeking pathway assignment using Lin's criteria. Although modernity and parochialism, as measured by the level of modernization and the cohesiveness of the social network system of the subjects, were also found to be correlated with delay, they appeared to exert an influence independent from that of ethnicity.",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,1982 Feb,United States,1982,80

3529422,Marital context and post-infarction quality of life: is it social support or something more?,"The development of a theory of quality of life following serious illness is currently an important field of endeavour in rehabilitation research. The interpersonal relationships of people and elements of the self-concept appear to be salient factors in causal models of subjective well-being. One such model developed to explain characteristic levels of well-being was used in a longitudinal study of adaptation to a first myocardial infarction. Data were collected from a national sample of male cardiac patients and their spouses on the illness and marital situation as predictors of long-term well-being or ill-being. Analyses of data from the first three waves of the study, which is to extend over 5 years after the onset of illness, are to be discussed in the paper. Marital status, the emotional quality of the spouse relationship and long-standing marital stressors were found to have direct and indirect effects on the two dimensions of the Bradburn Affect Balance Scale. The same is true of continuing problems associated with the heart attack relative to perceptions of having coped effectively with the after effects of illness. Differences in self-esteem and personal competence were suggested as mediators of socio-environmental and illness-related influences. The two-factor conception of well-being developed was found to be a useful framework for investigating positive and negative aspects of psychosocial rehabilitation. The same factors that explain differences between happy and unhappy people in social indicators research also appeared to be determinants of different trajectories of adaptation in the wake of a life-threatening illness. Previous research using theoretical models from stress research has overemphasized psychosocial morbidity and stress management and neglected positive processes of adaptation. The identification of love resources related to positive feeling states and life satisfaction has, therefore, not received the attention it deserves. This is especially the case regarding an overemphasis of the concept of social support as a buffer of stress. Instruments were developed to measure high and low marital intimacy, as well as chronic marital role strains, and these measures appeared to explain different trajectories of adjustment to cardiac disease. The two-factor model appears to be useful for future work on quality of life with chronic illness. The same is true of four marital contexts of rehabilitation that were identified in the study.",Social science & medicine (1982),1986,England,1986,80

The present study was a random sample (N = 295) of households in Los Angeles with Japanese surnames. Japanese Americans born in the United States tended to drink less than those born in Japan. The study also observed significant gender differences in Japanese American drinking behavior which were attributed to ascribed social roles. Other demographic and social determinants of drinking were examined through two logistic regression models. The first model predicted drinking (as opposed to abstaining), while the other distinguished heavy drinkers from those who drank alcohol in more moderate amounts. Potential reference groups (e.g., parents, friends, church groups, etc.) were often significant in predicting whether and how much a Japanese American drank.",The International journal of the addictions,1988 Apr,United States,1988,80

The quality and availability of these records vary from place to place, but generally speaking, in the case of the Netherlands, they are of high quality since population registration at the municipal level was required by law.

By-and-large the pattern of results is not dissimilar from other studies done on older children. The results are discussed in terms of the literature on economic socialization.",Journal of adolescence,1987 Dec,England,1987,80
12179093,The determinants and consequences of female migration in Thailand.,"Female migration in Thailand, especially from rural areas to the Bangkok Metropolis, is an important migratory phenomenon which leads to an unfavorable population distribution. Generally the migration level in Thailand is low but many women from the rural areas, especially from the Northeast Region, move to Bangkok Metropolis to seek work. Findings reveal that the majority of migrants are young, single women. Women migrants find it relatively easy to participate in the Bangkok labor market. Service work is the main source of employment. For the temporary migrants, it was found that those from the Northeast Region tend to return to their hometown in higher proportion than those from other regions. This was particularly so among young women migrants.",Population geography : a journal of the Association of Population Geographers of India,1983 Jun-Dec,India,1983,80

Patients who reported eating for consolation showed significantly greater difficulties in maintaining the achieved weight loss than the others. This finding constitutes further evidence of a relationship between obesity and depression. Low capacity to experience feelings of aggressiveness also seems to be linked to poor treatment results.,Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,1986 Feb,United States,1986,80
3629664,Proximate determinants of fertility and policy implications in Beijing.,"Data from a 1982 sample survey of 3,830 married women below age 50 in a district of Beijing City are applied to the Bongaarts model of the proximate determinants of fertility. A total fertility rate (TFR) of 0.75 births per woman is estimated from the model, compared with a TFR of 1.24 actually observed from the survey. The estimated TFR (0.75) results from the assumed total fecundity (TF) of 15.30 births per woman being inhibited by the indexes of the proximate determinants of fertility, most notably non-marriage (.280), contraception (.315), and induced abortion (.586). The effects of two other proximate determinants, lactational infecundability and spousal separation, were negligible. Comparative data from other countries confirm that the study area has very low levels of fertility and marriage, a very high prevalence of induced abortion, and a small effect of lactational infecundability. The extremely low level of fertility was, thus, achieved through a high level of induced abortion. Future research needs and policy implications associated with the study are discussed.",Studies in family planning,1987 Jul-Aug,United States,1987,80
6520656,Smoking and pregnancy.,"Smoking during pregnancy is associated with many adverse outcomes, including fetal and neonatal death. These consequences are tragic in many ways, but perhaps the greatest tragedy is that they are preventable if the smoker ceases to smoke during pregnancy. Although in some instances the so-called constitutional hypothesis is difficult to disprove, the available evidence seems more than convincing that it is smoking itself, and not the smoker's unique constitution, that is responsible. Cessation from smoking is clearly advisable at any time, but more so during pregnancy when every cigarette affects both the smoker and her unborn child.",Journal of psychoactive drugs,1984 Oct-Dec,United States,1984,80
4061712,A cross-cultural comparison of health status values.,"The extent to which the values attached to health states are similar in different cultures or social groups is important for understanding health and illness behaviors and for developing standardized health status measures. A cross-cultural study was conducted to compare the health status values obtained in a United States population (Seattle, Washington) with those from another English-speaking culture (London, England) on the Sickness Impact Profile, a standardized measure composed of 136 items. London judges rated the severity of dysfunction described in each item on an equal interval scale using the same methods of scaling and analysis employed in the Seattle study. A regression of English mean item values on US mean values yielded a slope of 1.00 and an intercept of -0.07, indicating that judges gave strikingly similar ratings to most items. Agreement was higher at the more severe end of the dysfunction continuum than at the least severe end, a finding consistent with the notion that what constitutes health is more difficult to define than what constitutes illness. While a universal conception of dysfunction may exist in English-speaking societies, the social and cultural determinants of health status values deserve more systematic study.",American journal of public health,1985 Dec,United States,1985,80
6667732,Second pregnancies among teenage mothers.,"An analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) finds that 82 percent of sexually active teenage mothers were using contraceptives in the year following the birth of their first child; the majority of those who practiced contraception used the pill. The proportion of black teenagers using no method of birth control was higher than that for white teenagers, and it increased over the course of the year. Rates of nonuse were particularly high among black women younger than 18, only 68 percent of whom practiced contraception (compared with 85 percent of whites the same age). Examination of the data by marital status shows that women who married while they were pregnant were the most likely to practice contraception in the year following their first birth, while those who were single at the time of first birth were the least likely to do so (89 versus 74 percent). Blacks constituted the majority of women who were not married at the time of first birth, and of all marital subgroups, single blacks had the highest rate of nonuse (29 percent). The probability of a pregnancy during the year following a first birth for all teenage mothers was 17 percent. Pregnancy rates among women with incomes less than 150 percent of poverty level were nearly twice as high as rates among women who had incomes above that level--21 percent vs. 11 percent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Family planning perspectives,1983 Nov-Dec,United States,1983,80
3434387,School counselors as gatekeepers: guidance in poor versus affluent neighborhoods.,"Previous studies reveal that career guidance is usually based on a mixture of meritocratic criteria (academic ability and achievement) and nonmeritocratic considerations (students' SES and their social labeling by counselors). The present study argues that school counselors in affluent neighborhoods emphasize the meritocratic criteria, while those in poorer neighborhoods tend to focus on the more nonmeritocratic. This hypothesis is examined in a random sample of 210 male, primary school graduates from the 10 state schools of an Israeli town, 125 of whom are from schools in affluent neighborhoods, and 85 from schools in poorer neighborhoods. A path analysis of determinants of guidance to specific high school tracks shows that students' ethnicity and labeling as problematic directly affect guidance by counselors only in the poor neighborhoods. The effect of students' ""problems"" is due to their being labeled as problematic with respect to psychological or physical attributes rather than to behavioral problems at school. The findings are subsequently interpreted as reflecting a patronizing attitude toward lower status students by counselors. Additional studies which may further elaborate the determinants of guidance in poor versus affluent neighborhoods are proposed.",Adolescence,1987 Fall,United States,1987,80

The author notes the prospects for a rapid increase in the rural labor force and considers its implications for the agricultural production structure and the need for institutional change. Consideration is also given to the continuing demand for high fertility at the family level and the role of infant and child mortality in the poverty cycle.

6723941,Repeat abortion: is it a problem?,"As the number of Canadian women who have had induced abortions increases with each succeeding year, the number at risk--and the actual incidence--of repeat abortion also increases. Some researchers have argued that women who have more than one induced abortion are less well adjusted, others that they are less willing to use contraceptives, perhaps because of anxiety about sexuality. Still others have suggested that repeat abortion is unrelated to the psychology or attitudes of individual women, but rather is an inevitable result of imperfect contraceptives, imperfect contraceptive practice and the availability of legal abortion for the termination of unwanted pregnancies. A group of 580 women seeking abortions were interviewed at the Montreal General Hospital and given a number of psychological tests. About one in five of these women were having repeat abortions. The women having repeat abortions were older, less likely to be married and more tolerant of legal abortion than were women having their first abortions. They also had intercourse more frequently than the first-abortion patients. Women obtaining a repeat abortion were slightly more likely to have been using contraceptives at the time they became pregnant, but they did not differ from first-abortion patients in the types of methods that they used. On no other social or demographic characteristics, measures of psychological adjustment or attitudes about sexuality were there any important differences between the groups. A more complex statistical analysis reveals that the two most important factors differentiating first-abortion and repeat-abortion patients are age and coital frequency--both of which are variables that reflect added exposure to the risk of unintended pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Family planning perspectives,1984 Mar-Apr,United States,1984,80
3068425,Determinants of Filipino children's responses to the death of a sibling.,"Well school-age children (N = 73) who had experienced the death of a sibling within one year of data collection were interviewed. Their reactions were related to the deceased sibling's age, nature of death, time interval since death, sex of child, and socioeconomic status. Subjects were located through registries of five hospitals and five municipalities of Rizal Province, Philippines. In addition to the interview, children produced stories about nine projective test pictures. Results showed that school grades dropped significantly after the sibling's death. Children's responses reflected three stages: (1) shock, disbelief, denial (10%); (2) guilt, protest, sadness (50%); and (3) acceptance and recovery (40%). Chi-square tests showed that Stage 1 was significantly associated with a younger age of the deceased sibling, more recent death (less than or equal to 6 months), and lower social class. With regard to the projective story themes, children whose siblings died suddenly (compared to those whose deaths were anticipated) had significantly higher loneliness themes. Children whose deceased siblings were of school age also gave significantly more death themes than children whose deceased siblings were younger.",Maternal-child nursing journal,1988 Summer,United States,1988,80
6518143,Lay theories of the causes of alcoholism.,"This paper investigates the range, structure and determinants of lay people's implicit theories of alcoholism. The different explicit medical and psychological theories are reviewed as are studies on lay beliefs about alcoholism and heavy drinking. After a number of interviews in which people were asked to list what they believed to be the major causes of alcoholism, 265 people completed a questionnaire in which they rated 30 explanations for their importance in explaining the causes of alcoholism. Females more than males believed alcoholics to be socially inadequate and anxious and that there was too much social pressure and not enough prohibitions against drinking. Middle-aged rather than younger or older people tended to explain alcoholism in terms of poor education, social and cultural pressures and biological or genetic mechanisms. However, there were few differences in the ratings of heavy, moderate, light and non-drinkers. Factor analysis revealed six factors labelled psychological stress, personal and social problems, psychoanalytic theories, sociocultural explanations, biological or genetic explanations and social desirability or pressure. The results are discussed in terms of the research on lay understandings of psychological and medical phenomena, and the relationship between explicit and implicit theories.",The British journal of medical psychology,1984 Dec,England,1984,80

2772105,Situational determinants of cardiovascular and emotional reactivity in high and low hostile men.,"Various epidemiologic studies have found that high scores on the Cook and Medley Hostility (Ho) scale are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), severity of atherosclerosis, and all-cause mortality. One plausible biological mechanism suspected of contributing to increased risk of CHD is sympathetic nervous system-mediated hyperresponsivity to environmental stressors. The present study evaluated cardiovascular reactivity among young men with high versus low Ho scores during performance of an anagram task with or without harassment. Compared to performing the task alone, harassment led to increased cardiovascular arousal that was more pronounced for the high Ho subjects than the low Ho subjects. Moreover, harassment produced increases in self-rated anger, irritation, and tension, but it was only among those subjects with high Ho scores that increased anger and irritation were associated with enhanced cardiovascular arousal. While suggesting a role for anger- and irritation-induced cardiovascular arousal in pathogenesis of CHD, these findings indicate that situation characteristics mediate the relationship between Ho scores and cardiovascular reactivity, and that there may be a differential biological link between anger/irritation and cardiovascular responses in men with high and low Ho scores.",Psychosomatic medicine,1989 Jul-Aug,United States,1989,80

The effect of breastfeeding is enhanced when the incidence of breastfeeding is high and the duration extended. These factors are more likely to occur when suckling at the breast is frequent. Sociological and behavioral factors can also influence a woman's decision to initiate and terminate breastfeeding. The effects of urbanization, maternal education, and socioeconomic status act through the intervening variables of sociocultural factors, health services, employment status of women, and availability of breastmilk substitutes. Strategies to alter these intervening variables include educational campaigns and support groups for lactating women, changes in health services, availability of child care facilities near employment centers, and enforcement of the international code of marketing of breastmilk substitutes.",Studies in family planning,1984 Jul-Aug,United States,1984,80

Height and weight data were obtained on all subjects. In addition, a questionnaire that is useful in assessing the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), was administered. Results of these tests were compared with those of normal female university students (N = 59), patients with anorexia nervosa (N = 68), and music students (N = 35). Anorexia nervosa and excessive dieting concerns were overrepresented in the dance and modelling students. Twelve cases (6.5%) of primary anorexia nervosa were detected in the dance group. All but one case developed the disorder while studying dance. Within the dance group those from the most competitive environments had the greatest frequency of anorexia nervosa. These data suggest that both pressures to be slim and achievement expectations are risk factors in the development of anorexia nervosa.

It is thought that medical students are overwhelmingly disease-oriented and not sufficiently sensitive to the role of the psychological, emotional, sociological and economic factors in the etiology and management of illness. In the present study the ATSIM (Attitudes Towards Social Issues in Medicine) was presented to third year medical students and compared with their responses obtained 2 years previously when they were first year students. The data suggest that third year medical students have positive attitudes towards certain psychosocial issues (the importance of social factors as determinants of health or illness, the role of preventive medicine in maintaining health, the role of physician-patient interactions in patient care). These attitudes were positive during the students' first year and have been maintained during the course of medical school.

Despite the fact that we used a relatively wide gamut of potential determinants (such as parental age, geographic origin, occupation, current residence, or family size) of trait variability, the results of multiple regression analysis (N = 300 families) indicate an almost complete absence of significant factors and studied variables of development. Sibling resemblance component of variance and covariance for five mentioned traits of development and some morphological characters (weight, length and head circumference at day of birth and at 16 months) were studied in 66 families. The transmissibility (""heritability"") values for the development traits were small, ranging from 0 (""Turn"") to 0.42 (""Walked"").

3701582,Objective determinants of perceived social support.,"Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1986 Feb,United States,1986,80

The study group comprised 5151 persons (86.7% of the original sample) who were interviewed in order to determine living conditions. Questions on dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status were included. 61% of the adult Danish population in the age group 20-69 had regular dental visits. Dental visit habits varied according to urbanization, age, sex and social group. Among well off persons 85% had regular dental visits as opposed to only 40% in the disadvantaged social group. Well off persons and persons with regular dental visits more often claimed good dental health than persons in the disadvantaged social group and among the non-regular visitors. In the higher social group 13% reported to have removable dentures in contrast to 51% in the disadvantaged social group. To isolate determinants of dental visits a multiple dummy-regression analysis was performed. Nearly 50% of the variation in dental visit habits was explained by the variables: urbanization, sex, age, perceived dental health status, education, work in exhausting jobs, income, social background and perceived psychological problems. Efforts to bring a greater part of the adult population in Denmark in contract with the dental health service system should consider these findings.",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,1983 Jun,Denmark,1983,80

3538185,Social and biocultural determinants of food selection.,"Health professionals concerned with improving the nutritional status of populations are facing numerous problems ranging from emaciation to overnutrition. This review article addresses the complexity, the relative significance and the interaction of factors leading to the nutritional profile of specific groups and individuals. When availability of food is threatened, the programs designed to reduce the incidence of malnutrition must balance the food supply with energy resources and population needs as well as encourage economic improvement of food distribution systems. For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection. Excessive austerity in food use negates the pleasure of eating, a useful mechanism in food choice ensuring food diversity.",Progress in food & nutrition science,1986,England,1986,80

The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments.

Analysis of the data showed strong relationships between most of the predictor variables and BSE. Regression analysis showed that variables measuring a woman's recent experience in the health care system were stronger predictors of BSE practice than intrapersonal ""health belief"" variables. However, the independent variables included in the regression accounted for almost 35 percent of the total variance in BSE practice.",American journal of preventive medicine,1986 May-Jun,Netherlands,1986,80

2963022,Parental attitudes toward children with handicaps: new perspectives with a new measure.,"Research on attitudes toward the disabled generally has focused on adult perceptions of disabled adults, or children's attitudes toward peers. In view of changing social practices, such as mainstreaming in education and community integration of children with special needs, measures of adults' attitudes toward disabled children are needed. This paper reports on the development and validation of a 30-item self-report questionnaire assessing parental attitudes toward children with handicaps, and presents information concerning several determinants of parental attitudes. The measure is easy to use, reliable, and shows good evidence of construct validity.

3169388,Perinatal risk factors and minor neurological dysfunction: significance for behaviour and school achievement at nine years.,"A prospective study was carried out on 133 neurologically deviant infants, 205 with mild abnormalities and 230 normal newborns to compare behavioural and cognitive development with neonatal and nine-year-old neurological condition. Overtly handicapped children were excluded. Major determinants of school failure were the severity of minor neurological dysfunction (MND) and social class. Main risk factors for distractable and clumsy behaviour were MND classification and male sex; for troublesome behaviour male sex and interval complications after two years of age; and for timid behaviour, family adversity. Definite neonatal neurological deviancy contributed both directly and by its association with MND to problems in behaviour and scholastic abilities. Mild neonatal neurological abnormalities and adverse obstetrical events contributed only indirectly to behavioural and learning problems. Preterm birth (less than 34 weeks) was the sole obstetric variable directly related to some of the outcome variables. The difference between home and school perception of the children's behaviour is emphasized.",Developmental medicine and child neurology,1988 Aug,England,1988,80

This paper uses shift share analysis to assess the extent to which job losses amongst the Irish in Britain over the years 1971-1977 may have induced return migration to Ireland.

2784523,Functional versus structural social support and health care utilization in a family medicine outpatient practice.,"Three hundred forty-three family-practice patients were surveyed by questionnaire and medical record audit to evaluate the relationships between social support and medical care utilization. Social support was not associated with laboratory test ordering. The mean number of office visits per year was higher for patients with low versus high confidant support (4.71 vs. 3.81, P less than 0.10) and affective support (5.21 vs. 3.60, P less than 0.05). Mean total charges in 1 year were higher for patients with low versus high confidant support ($232 vs. $148, P less than 0.05) and affective support ($244 vs. $154, P less than 0.05). Poor confidant and affective support were both associated with longer visits. Structural measures of social support were not related significantly to any utilization indicator. These findings were maintained in multiple-regression models controlling for physical health and seven demographic characteristics. Second-order regression models revealed interaction by race, employment status, and sex. Blacks showed no effect of confidant support on office visits. Poor confidant support resulted in $201 more in total charges for the unemployed (P = 0.003) versus $49 more for the employed (P = 0.15). Women with low affective support had $119 more in charges (P = 0.001) versus $16 less for men (P = 0.82). The results suggest that low functional social supports are important determinants of increased medical service utilization and that they may have differential effects by race, sex, and employment status, all of which should be considered independently in future studies.",Medical care,1989 Mar,United States,1989,80
10287174,Health policy and mental health.,"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Health promotion (Oxford, England)",1987,England,1987,80

6701728,Health care coverage of survivor families with children: determinants and consequences.,"This article, which is based on data from the Social Security Administration's 1978 Survey of Survivor Families With Children, examines the continuity of health care coverage held by families headed by widows from the time of the husband's death to the interview. The data are presented by duration of widowhood and kind of coverage the family had before the husband died. Over this period, it was found that new kinds of coverage, such as the widow's job-related health insurance or directly purchased protection, often replaced the former coverage. At the time of the interview, about three-fourths of the families had coverage, including government assistance such as Medicaid. Whether or not the young survivor families had coverage was affected by the widow's current employment status and by family income. Premiums varied by type of policy: those with individual policies paid more (and received less extensive coverage) than did those with group policies. Compared with the general population, the widows and their children were in poorer health, generally used physician services less, and had somewhat higher expenditures for health care.",Social security bulletin,1984 Feb,United States,1984,80
24302171,Spiritual and emotional determinants of health.,"Within our present health care system, there is a growing movement that argues that our perceptions of health and illness are in need of change. This change includes redefining what we mean by health in terms of the whole person-the emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of our being, as well as the physical. An increasing number of health professionals and social scientists believe our concepts of health and illness must consider all these aspects of life. It is believed that the quality of life may be enhanced by such perceptions of health, which include social and spiritual factors. Using data from the 1985 Akron Area Survey-The Subjective Quality of Life in the Akron Area-this study explores the effects of spiritual well-being and emotional well-being on health satisfaction. Results indicate that emotional and spiritual factors do significantly contribute to the subjective evaluation of health, especially for individuals who are physically limited.",Journal of religion and health,1988 Mar,United States,1988,80
7326949,When rational men fall sick: an inquiry into some assumptions made by medical anthropologists.,"Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points.","Culture, medicine and psychiatry",1981 Dec,Netherlands,1981,80

The prevalence of caries is high in the sample: 1. 31.5% of the children aged 5 to 6 are free of caries (according to the WHO objectives, 50% of the children aged 5 to 6 should have no caries), 2. the mean number of decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMF/T index) in children aged 11 to 12 is 6.6 (The DMF/T should be less than or equal to 3). The frequency of toothbrushing is distributed as follows: 23% of the children brush their teeth once a week or less, 46% brush their teeth once a day, and 31% brush their teeth twice a day or more. The purpose and the frequency of the consultations at the dentist's office have been examined: 15% of the children never consult the dentist, 44% consult the dentist in case of toothache, and 41% go to the dentist's office for screening or control. Only 3.2% of the children use regularly and appropriately fluoride tablets. Since the variance of the results is large, it is difficult to distinguish explaining variables or determinants. However, the data indicate that social groups show differences in DMF indices as well as in the behaviors associated with dental hygiene and prevention.",Archives belges = Belgisch archief,1989,Belgium,1989,80
3563565,Patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter: social psychological determinants.,"Patient-practitioner transactions in the ambulatory setting have become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years. In particular, there is growing interest in providing empirical support for our anecdotal, 'common-sense' notions that clinical encounter experiences are a major determinant of outcomes such as the patient's satisfaction with the encounter. The present study was designed to look at this issue and addressed the following two research questions: Is there a relationship between fulfillment of patient requests for services and patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter? and What degree of satisfaction is explained by the qualities of the encounter as compared to the characteristics of the patient, physician, and system of health care? Four newly-developed instruments were administered to a convenience sample of 144 adult patients and their physicians prior to and following actual visits to a University Family Practice Center. Meeting patients' requests increased their satisfaction with the encounter. At least 19% of the variance in patient satisfaction could be attributed to request fulfillment. The implications of these findings for future research into the doctor-patient relationship are discussed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1987,England,1987,80
6656327,The determinants of dropping out of care among hypertensive patients receiving a behavioral intervention.,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension.",Medical care,1983 Oct,United States,1983,80
6738684,[The formation of eating behavior].,"Food behaviour involves the totality of the actions of man which aim at satisfying his nutritional need. It is based on psychical reflection, decision and assessment processes. Food behaviour has social and historical determinants and forms accordingly to the dialectic relation of biological, social and economic conditions. Hunger, thirst and appetite are perceived as nutritional need which results from the requirements of energy, nutrients and liquid, and is satisfied by the food behaviour in conformity with the actual material potential, situational influences, subjective ideas, interests, attitudes and knowledge as well as other psychical properties. Consequently, food behaviour is rich in variations with dynamic and conservative features. Motives as well as will components are essential constituent conditions of food behaviour. For this reason, empirical studies arteo provide psychological cognition concerning the subjective reflection of the nutritional requirements, the requirement-standard integration, the sensation of stimulation and the decision-making in food behaviour, the ultimate goal being to deduce measures for food behaviour guidance.",Die Nahrung,1984,Germany,1984,80

Yet very little research information or published material is available on the extent of utilization behaviour of Siddha medicine in urban settings. This study examines the current patterns of utilization and consumer behavioural characteristics of SM through a field-based questionnaire survey of a sample of 300 patients attending 15 Siddha clinics in Salem, Tamil Nadu. Four areas were investigated: Socio-economic characteristics of the users; utilization behaviour pattern of patients; reasons for choice of Siddha therapy; opinions, attitudes, perception and satisfaction of users regarding Siddha therapy. The survey points out there is an inverse relationship between the number of patients using SM and income, education and distance travelled. Various factors were cited in choosing SM-such as, effectiveness of treatment, social influences of a relative or friend. Survey indicates that both modern medicine and SM seem to act as supporting rather than as competitive systems in a setting like Salem.

This study uses a national sample of women of childbearing age gathered by the Sri Lanka World Fertility Survey in 1975 to assess four possible reasons for differential contraceptive use: (1) differences in socioeconomic position; (2) cultural differences; (3) minority status; and (4) differential access to family planning services. The first three explanations focus on differences in the demand for contraception while the fourth explanation focuses on differences in the availability of contraceptives. The socioeconomic, cultural, and minority status hypotheses fail to explain the higher contraceptive use among the Sinhalese. The evidence is consistent with the idea that ethnic differences in contraceptive use were largely caused by differential access to family planning services.",Studies in family planning,1984 Sep-Oct,United States,1984,80
3494378,Determinants of microangiopathy in growth-onset diabetes. With special reference to retinopathy and glycaemic control.,"In a quasi-experiment all diabetic children in a defined area were exposed either to an intense clinical treatment or served as a constructed control. The cohort of 146 diabetics was observed prospectively for at least 15 years as to diabetic control, mainly glycosuria, and cross-sectionally examined for microangiopathy on four occasions. Data on family background, social situation, smoking, blood pressure, biochemical status, anthropometry, HLA factors and mortality were also gathered. Throughout the analysis duration was considered and treated as a concomitant variable. Two different strategies have been followed in the analysis, one trying to predict microangiopathy at a fixed and predetermined duration, the other to study determinants of the pattern of microangiopathy occurrence over time. Multiple logistic regression and Cox analysis have been used to fit these strategies. The prevalence of microaneurysms or more advanced stages of retinopathy at 10 years duration was 30 per cent and within 20 years 81 per cent. About 52 per cent had haemorrhages after 20 years. Mild and severe nephropathy after 20 years have been contracted by 50 and 15 per cent respectively. No clear sex differences were seen. Variables significantly explaining retinopathy within 10 years were post-pubertal duration, blood pressure, place of medical supervision and the HLA/DR4 marker. The mean glycosuria was high during puberty irrespective of age at onset. The overall pattern of retinopathy occurrence seemed to be influenced by place of medical supervision, age at onset, blood pressure, family history of ischaemic heart disease and glycemic control. For the progression of retinopathy the role of factors reflecting medical supervision and control of diabetes seemed even greater. Even after accounting for degree of diabetic control the experimental group had a more favourable outcome, suggesting additional quality of care components. Mild nephropathy was less predictable from the above risk factors while previous findings of the important role of elevated blood pressure for severe nephropathy was confirmed. We estimate that half of retinopathy cases were preventable by the ""experimental"" care and conclude the near-normalization of glycaemia under routine conditions favourably influences the development of diabetic retinopathy.",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica.

2746717,Psychological and environmental determinants of relapse in crack cocaine smokers.,"The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations.",Journal of substance abuse treatment,1989,United States,1989,80

Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery.",American journal of public health,1989 Mar,United States,1989,80

We used the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) to generate DSM-III and RDC diagnoses to estimate lifetime depressive disorders, and established (via corroborative reports) the likely accuracy of those data. Despite lifetime depression being a relatively common experience, no significant sex differences in depressive episodes were demonstrated, suggesting the possible irrelevance of biological factors in determining any sex difference. As there was not major social role divergence over the five year study, we interpret the lack of a sex difference as a consequence, and suggest that findings support the view that social factors are of key relevance in determining any female preponderance in depression described in general population studies.",Psychological medicine,1989 May,England,1989,80

This study examines the salience of attributional judgements among adolescents with cancer. Patients and their parents were categorized according to their attributions of responsibility for the cause of and solution to the adolescent's health problems into one of four attributional models. Of the four possible models, only two were represented: the medical and compensatory. Only 37.5% of parent/child pairs were concordant for model choice. Patients whose attributions conformed to those of the compensatory model sought more information (F = 5.1, (P = .03), were satisfied with the information supplied (F = 3.5, P = .07), and expressed the belief that a greater percentage of prescribed medications needed to be taken if a cure was to result (F = 4.1, P = .05). Side effects were more often experienced by patients whose responsibility attributions exemplified the medical model (F = 5.09, P = .03). Model concordance did not relate to parent/child agreement on health-related beliefs, patient age, sex, or compliance measures (P greater than .05). No relationship was found between parent-child model concordance and patient's self-reported medication compliance. The present data do not support the notion that attributions of responsibility for cause and solution of cancer should be important targets of interventions designed to increase medication compliance among cancer patients.",Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,1989,England,1989,80

28466762,Determinants of mortality transition in developing countries before and after the Second World War: Some evidence from Cuba.,"Few studies provide an insight into what factors contributed to declines in the mortality rates of developing countries before the Second World War. In this paper, statistics on causes of death from Cuba, particularly Havana, are used to investigate what may have been some of the principal determinants of mortality decline in the developing world before the arrival of modern drugs and insecticides. Trends in cause-specific mortality are examined in the light of Cuba's social, economic, medical and public health history. The Cuban experience strongly suggests that in this country public health and sanitary reforms and nutritional improvements were largely responsible for initial declines in mortality throughout the first half of the twentieth century. One important finding is that the impact of these reforms and improved nutrition was greatly influenced by prevailing economic conditions. Periods of economic prosperity facilitated declines in mortality; but in times of adversity, the reverse occurred. It appears that during prosperous periods the maintenance and expansion of public health and sanitary facilities were made possible by increased public and private revenues, and that individuals had access to a more abundant diet. The severe economic crisis of the Great Depression had the opposite effect. With the appearance of sulphonamides in the late 1930s, antibiotics, and residual insecticides and other specific measures at the end of the Second World War, the relevance of economic conditions as a determinant of mortality decline diminished. Although this analysis points to the aforementioned trends, the Cuban experience also suggests that other factors enter into the process of declining mortality and that this phenomenon can only be explained as the result of the complex interplay of many forces.",Population studies,1981 Nov 1,England,1981,80

2675244,Blood pressure and intracellular ion transport in childhood.,"The available data on the association between the cellular handling of sodium and high BP indicate that alteration of these parameters could be linked to the level of high BP. Limited data are available with regard to the association between BP and these aspects of the intracellular ion metabolism in childhood. The study of intracellular ion metabolism in children could help clarify the pathogenesis and etiology of essential hypertension by providing an opportunity to study this relationship before the effects of possible determinants of adult BP (ie, age, body weight, diet, physical activity) affect ion transport and modify its effect on BP. Specifically, familial predisposition to hypertension, growth and maturation, and the various components of body size need to be studied further to determine their role in the relationship between Na-Li CT and RBC Na and BP. Better understanding of this complex association could help elucidate the pathophysiology of essential hypertension.",Seminars in nephrology,1989 Sep,United States,1989,80
6505746,Primary health care in practice: a study in Mozambique.,"This study investigates the delivery of all aspects of Primary Health Care (PHC) in a case study of one urban health centre in Maputo, Mozambique. Within the context of overall social and economic change, Mozambique has given priority to primary health care as the driving force in its newly developed National Health Service. The urban and rural health centres are intended to be the principal vehicles for PHC delivery, and in this study one of Maputo's recently opened health centres was investigated by observing all clinic sessions, interviewing all health centre workers and collecting data from health centre records. It was found that a dichotomy exists between the tasks ascribed to the health centre in the PHC framework, and the feasibility of their execution given existing personnel and material resources. This derives in part from lack of involvement of PHC practitioners in the organisation and planning of PHC, plus resource allocation which remains in favour of secondary and tertiary rather than primary care. Prevention is accorded priority in PHC theory, yet investigation showed that the major demand on the health centre is for curative care. The quality of both curative and preventive care was evaluated and the need for training in specialist diagnostic skills, and a more socially-based understanding of the determinants of health status and risk emerged, respectively for the groups of workers in the two sectors. The level of contact between the curative and preventive sectors was investigated as was the integration of the health centre into the health service as a whole. The problems arising in these areas must be viewed in the context of the very recent development of a National Health Service in a country where, previously, curative care was available only in urban areas and virtually no preventive programmes existed. This study shows that significant steps are being taken to develop a comprehensive PHC programme in Maputo. More important still will be the extension of this level of care provision to the country as a whole.",Social science & medicine (1982),1984,England,1984,80
3585703,Personal and contextual determinants of coping strategies.,"This study examined personal and contextual predictors of active and avoidance coping strategies in a community sample of over 400 adults and in a sample of over 400 persons entering psychiatric treatment for unipolar depression. Sociodemographic factors of education and income (except for active-cognitive coping), personality dispositions of self-confidence and an easy-going manner, and contextual factors of negative life events and family support each made a significant incremental contribution to predicting active and avoidance coping. Among both healthy adults and patients, active and avoidance coping were positively associated with negative life events. Individuals who had more personal and environmental resources were more likely to rely on active coping and less likely to use avoidance coping. Moreover, for both groups, most of the predictors continued to show significant relations with active and avoidance coping strategies even after the stable component in coping was controlled in a longitudinal design. A comprehensive framework to understand the determinants of coping can be of practical value in suggesting points for therapeutic interventions aimed at fostering more adaptive coping efforts.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1987 May,United States,1987,80
3662409,Social determinants of disease.,"The primary purpose for identifying psychosocial risk factors is to prevent disease and disease complications. For 30 years, we have been doing research in this field and have been successful in identifying such risk factors as Type A behavior, social isolation, stressful life events, and various psychological patterns. However, our success in using this information to help prevent disease has been much more limited. One reason for this limited success is that we have focused virtually all of our attention on the study of individuals and almost no attention on the social environment within which people live. There are two major limitations of such a one-to-one approach: it is difficult for people to change their behavior and their life situation and even if some people do change, others enter the ""at risk"" population because no action has been taken to change those forces in society that stimulated the problem in the first place. In discussing the social determinants of disease, it is important that we develop a new approach that permits us to study not only individuals but also the social environment. An example of this approach is provided by researchers who were successful in preventing infectious diseases. The work of these researchers focused not on clinical entities or on individuals but on the environment. This resulted in a disease classification system that included concepts such as air-borne, food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne diseases. We have no such system for the study of non-infectious diseases. Considerable data already are available to help us to think about such a new classification system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Annals of clinical research,1987,Finland,1987,80

24301041,Differentiating specialists and generalists within college students' social support networks.,"In order to examine the relationships among social network structure, types of social support, and determinants of support satisfaction, an alternative method was used to score the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ). Factor analysis procedures suggested that college students' (N=198) social networks consisted of four groups: nuclear family, other family, friends, and others. Satisfaction with support was positively related to the proportion of the network occupied by nuclear family and negatively related to the proportion of friends in the network. Evidence was found for the presence of both support specialists and support generalists in the networks of the college students. These results are discussed from a developmental perspective with attention to the implications for interventions.",Journal of youth and adolescence,1985 Feb,United States,1985,80
7145506,Moral reasoning and decisions in dilemmas of neonatal care.,"The relationship between levels of moral reasoning and decisions in dilemmas of neonatal care was investigated in a sample of 452 pediatricians. Subjects included residents, faculty members, and practitioners recruited from a variety of university-affiliated and community hospitals. It was hypothesized that physicians whose moral reasoning was more fully developed would less actively treat particular cases. Such cases might include those where a patient's family requested such a limit (designated ""negative family attitude"") or the quality of life likely to be led after therapy was so low as to preclude even a minimal degree of human activity or social interaction (designated ""unsalvageable prognosis""). The hypothesis was tested through the use of two questionnaires. The first questionnaire, devised by Crane, assessed the physician's reported degree of activism in treating six cases of infants born with severe defects. The structure of moral reasoning was measured by a second questionnaire, Rest's Defining Issue Test. Subjects were scored by the degree to which they use universal, ethical principles in resolving a series of moral dilemmas. Results of the absolute level of activism (Table 1) showed that among both residents and postresidents, the degree to which cases are actively treated depends, for salvageable patients, on the type of damage and on the possibility for research. Results involving moral reasoning showed a different pattern among residents and postresidents. Among residents, a significant correlation exists between principled reasoning and the absence of active treatment (r = - 0.41, Form A; r = - 0.23, Form B). As predicted, such correlations were strongest for cases of negative family attitude or of unsalvageable prognosis. The pattern of correlations among postresidents showed either no relationship to moral reasoning or the reverse of the residency pattern (r = -0.08, Form A; r = 0.30, Form B). The influence of the type of institution a resident operates within was assessed by analysis of variance. Inasmuch as moral reasoning and institutional type both had significant main effects (Form A), their magnitude differed. Institutional type accounted for 43% of the variation in mean activism scores whereas moral reasoning accounted for only 4%; however, because one could, a priori, expect institutional norms and customs to be powerful determinants of behavior, any additional, identifiable influence deserves attention. The structure of individuals' moral reasoning seems to be such an influence.",Pediatric research,1982 Oct,United States,1982,80

In six studies involving 11,000 adults resident in the USA, France and Denmark forced expiratory volume in 1 second was related to social class and/or one of a number of other factors including education, area of residence and housing status. Trends in three other studies involving approximately 15,000 children resident in the UK and the USA were similar.

Two sets of factors are examined: social characteristics of the adopters are used to test Rogers's and Shoemaker's contention that discontinuers have more traditional values than continuers; and the adoption decision process is analyzed to identify the relationship of communication factors to discontinuance. Although number of children and experience of method problems were the major determinants of discontinuance, unfavorable information from friends and other birth control users was a significant factor.

7239734,Control of the work process: the workers' viewpoint.,"Recent studies of job satisfaction, working conditions, and changes in the content of work indicate that problems of low productivity and dissatisfaction may be related to changes in the organization of work which have reduced the amount of autonomy and control which workers have over the labor process. At the same time, elements in the labor movement, which has traditionally focused almost exclusively on obtaining higher wages and greater benefits for union members, now seem to be directing their attention to issues of workplace democracy and worker control over the production process and company policies. The research reported here investigates the determinants of worker autonomy and of workers' desire for increased worker control over the workplace. This article describes what are viewed as the main hypotheses suggested by earlier research and reports the findings and new hypotheses derived from a preliminary analysis of data from the ISR National 1977 Quality of Employment Survey and pilot in-depth interviews with sixteen Baltimore workers.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1981,United States,1981,80
3399999,Temporal and social aspects of gonorrhea transmission: the force of infectivity.,"Theoretical consideration of the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) suggests that the key determinants of transmission dynamics are the duration of infectiousness and the extent to which subgroups in the population interact sexually. We used two empirical correlates to represent these concepts: (1) the force of infectivity, calculated by summing all the days of potential infectivity (the time between last sexual exposure and treatment of the contact) generated by a given case, and then summing the days for all cases within a given subgroup; (2) self-selection, representing the observed probability that members of a given subgroup select sexual partners from within their own group. Using data gathered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, we estimated that a single group i.e., black, male, heterosexual, military personnel residing in the core areas, generated 27% of the force of infectivity. Subgroups that select greater than 50% of their sexual partners from outside their sociodemographic boundaries generated a rate for the force of infectivity that was 4.5 times higher than the rate for self-selectors. These findings confirm the core group theory and suggest strategies for control of STD.",Sexually transmitted diseases,1988 Apr-Jun,United States,1988,80

This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact.",Studies in family planning,1989 Mar-Apr,United States,1989,80

3811607,Social factors and professional attitudes as determinants of the frequency of small surgical procedures among children in Greece.,"Data concerning histories of Adenoidectomy (Ad), Tonsillectomy (T) and Appendectomy (Ap) were collected from the escorts (mainly mothers) of 2296 children 3-12 years-old. The children were admitted as outpatients at the First Department of Paediatrics of the University of Athens or the Polyclinic of the Children's Welfare Center of PIKPA in Pireaus, during the last six months of 1983. Among children with median age of about six years, 12 percent had already had at least one operation (Ad, T or Ap); this proportion increased to about 25 percent among children with median age of about 10 years. The cumulative incidence of Ad and/or T was higher among boys, whereas the cumulative incidence of Ap was higher among girls. The age adjusted cumulative incidence of Ap was significantly higher in the lower social class, whereas there was no social gradient with respect to Ad or T. There were strong intra-individual correlations among the three studied operations; in particular the age adjusted cumulative incidence of Ap was 2.9 times higher among children with Ad and/or T than among children without any of these operations. Since there are no apparent biomedical reasons to account for the observed intra-individual associations, it appears likely, that these associations reflect parental or physician's attitudes leading to unjustifiable operations in some of the children.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1986,Switzerland,1986,80
3723341,Observer judgments of acute pain: facial action determinants.,"We provided a microanalytic description of facial reactions to a series of painful and nonpainful electric shocks and examined the impact of these as discrete facial cues for observer judgments of acute pain. Thirty female volunteers were videotaped and reported their discomfort in response to electric shocks after earlier exposure to one of three social influence conditions: a tolerant model, an intolerant model, or neutral peer presence. We coded the videotapes for facial activity using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978b), and peer judges rated them for painful discomfort. Subjects exposed to a tolerant model reported no more discomfort than did subjects exposed to an intolerant model, despite receiving more intense levels of shock, but were judged by observers to be in more pain. Analyses of facial activity yielded consistent findings: Tolerant-model subjects, though reporting discomfort equivalent to that reported in other groups, displayed more pain-related facial activity (brow lowering, narrowing of the eye aperture from below, raising the upper lip, and blinking). There was a substantial direct relation between observer judgments of distress and discrete, pain-related facial actions (mean multiple R = .74 for the various shock levels rated). These data indicate that nonverbal expression yields information about the response to noxious stimulation that is non-redundant with self-report.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1986 Jun,United States,1986,80

2576262,The worldwide use of steroidal contraception.,"Historically, concerns about rapidly growing populations and resources that could not support them persuaded governments of developing countries to initiate family planning programs. Between the early 1960s and the early 1980s, the number of governments supporting these programs increased from 7 to approximately 120. Today, 52 governments in developing countries provide support to family planning programs because of the demographic rationale, and 65 governments do so because of human rights and health considerations: The effective use of family planning significantly diminishes infant, child, and maternal mortality and morbidity. Forty-five percent of married women of reproductive age worldwide are practicing contraception today; however, 69% do so in East Asia and only 11% in Africa. Female sterilization and use of intrauterine devices are the most popular methods in developing countries, and oral contraceptives and condoms, in developed countries. Of the 400 million women of reproductive age, 140 million (35%) are relying on family planning methods requiring male cooperation and less than 60 million (15%) are using oral contraceptives. More than half of these oral contraceptive users live in four countries: the United States, Brazil, France, and the Federal Republic of Germany. On the other hand, the percentage of currently married women, aged 15 to 19 years, who have never used any form of contraception is as high as 85% to 90% in Bangladesh, Sudan, and Pakistan. In many developing countries, there is a statistically significant correlation between women's use of contraception and years of education. Other important factors influencing contraceptive prevalence include the established or perceived side effects of currently available methods, the status of women, the political climate, and a number of behavioral and social determinants.",International journal of fertility,1989,United States,1989,80
6736597,"The determinants of health policy, a case study: regulating safety and health at the workplace in Sweden.","This article analyzes and criticizes the "" technocratic "" view of occupational health and safety policies, which sees the values of the personnel in ""post-industrial"" regulatory agencies as the most important determinant of those policies. It takes an alternate position, which explains occupational health and safety policies as primarily resulting from the different degrees of political power of the two major classes (capital and labor), and from the set of influences exerted on the regulatory agencies by the instruments (e.g., parties, unions, trade organizations) of those classes. It shows how an analysis of the historical evolution of those classes in Sweden and their conflict in both civil and political societies explains Swedish occupational health and safety policies better than a mere analysis of the regulators' views. And it concludes that the occupational health and safety policies in Sweden are not identical to those in the U.S.--as the "" technocratic "" theorists assume--but rather offer more protection to the workers than U.S. policies do. This situation is a result of labor having more power in Sweden than it has in the U.S. The different class formations and class behavior in the two societies are compared, and the implications of this comparison for occupational health and safety policies are discussed.","Journal of health politics, policy and law",1984 Spring,United States,1984,80

7241029,Determinants of short stature in normal children at the age of two years: a case-control study in a community in Jerusalem.,"Differences were analysed between growth patterns and determinants of physical growth in two groups of normal infants at 24 months. Longitudinal data routinely collected in a mother and child clinic were analysed. At 24 months, 26% of cohort infants were at or below the 10th percentile for length (= 'small' infants); 98 of these were compared with 83 'medium' infants (between the 50th and the 75th percentile, for example). Excessive downward deviation of length percentiles was seen in 80% of 'small' infants. In 20% their birthweight was on the 10th percentile or below; 50% had a mother less than 155 cm tall; maternal stature was closely linked with socioeconomic factors. Of mothers with less than nine years of schooling, 70% had 'small' infants. In 95% of both groups growth attainment at two years could be predicted from data at 12 months. The known factors influencing deviant physical growth overlap with those of mental and social development. Growth deviation by itself may identify infants open to multiple risks, especially if their mothers have a low educational level. Further narrowing of the target group for specialised intervention strategies should be attempted.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1980 Dec,England,1980,80

This change includes redefining what we mean by health in terms of the whole person-the emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of our being, as well as the physical. An increasing number of health professionals and social scientists believe our concepts of health and illness must consider all these aspects of life. It is believed that the quality of life may be enhanced by such perceptions of health, which include social and spiritual factors. Using data from the 1985 Akron Area Survey-The Subjective Quality of Life in the Akron Area-this study explores the effects of spiritual well-being and emotional well-being on health satisfaction. Results indicate that emotional and spiritual factors do significantly contribute to the subjective evaluation of health, especially for individuals who are physically limited.",Journal of religion and health,1988 Mar,United States,1988,80

A cross-sectional descriptive study of several populations reveals a strong and consistent dose-response pattern: Social drinkers have mean HDL cholesterol levels that are higher than those of teetotalers by as much as 33%. Cross-sectional analyses in another epidemiological study reveal the association to be independent of potential confounding factors such as smoking and body weight, and longitudinal analyses suggest that it is also not a result of certain unmeasured sources of confounding. A small experiment reveals a 15% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels among social drinkers who abstain from alcohol from a 2-week period. The evidence supports the conclusion that alcohol habits are probably one of the determinants of plasma HDL cholesterol level. A clarification of the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical medicine awaits future clinical efforts.",Circulation,1981 Sep,United States,1981,80

Questionnaires and a brief interview covered the psychological and social data while the somatic variables were recorded in a standardized medical examination. Emotional distress, self-reported symptoms, avoidance behaviour, overprotection, pessimism and a diminished sexual activity were frequent, indicating a poor adaptation. These disturbances were apparent two months after the MI and remained stable. Psychological factors were stronger determinants of maladjustment than smoking, angina pectoris and recorded somatic illness. Neither severity of the infarction nor social and demographic factors determined maladjustment.

6106945,Economic aspects of village health.,"Given the poor quantity and quality of medical care in most villages in the developing countries, the economic determinants of village health are the supply of labour, the cash flow associated with that labour and the availability of land. The paper examines these in the three classical 'time periods', arguing that inability to meet labour peaks is of great significance in explaining seasonal shortage of food and chronic shortage of cash. It also explains community indifference to upkeep of social overhead capital. Substitution of capital goods for labour is socially differentiated, not least by labour availability, and leads inevitably to a regressive distribution of land and the creation or enlargement of a class of landless labourers. Under certain limited conditions this class may enjoy a rising real income with associated health-promotive expenditures.

3120234,Reliability of self-reported sexual behavior risk factors for HIV infection in homosexual men.,"This study was undertaken to determine the reliability of self-reported sexual behavior using the test and retest technique when used with self-reported sexual behavior. The subjects were 116 asymptomatic homosexual men who participated in another study (an examination of behavioral and demographic determinants of HIV antibody status). The subjects were asked to complete two questionnaires. The first contained demographic and sexual behavior questions. The second, administered an average of 6 weeks later, used a subset of the questions in the first questionnaire. The reliability of the test-retest procedure was measured by the Kappa statistic, which assesses the proportion of agreement between two data items, accounting for the amount of agreement expected by chance. The highest degree of reliability as measured by Kappa was found with demographic information, smoking history, and sexual orientation. Self-reported sexual behaviors for the previous 6 months generally had the next highest degree of reliability as measured by Kappa. Questions examining change over the previous 5 years had the lowest reliability. Behavior changes during the time between questionnaires, subjectivity of the answer categories, and social desirability of the answers are three factors that may result in a lack of reliability in this self-reported sexual behavior questionnaire. This raises methodological concerns about the measurement of behavioral risk factors for AIDS and the ability to assess meaningfully subjective reports of behavioral change.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",1987 Nov-Dec,United States,1987,80
3354493,"Energy intake, energy expenditure, and smoking in relation to body fatness: the Zutphen Study.","In 1965 within the Zutphen Study information on several possible determinants of body fatness (eg, energy intake, energy expenditure, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and smoking) was collected. Univariate analyses showed that for 525 men aged 45-64 y and free from cardiovascular diseases, indicators of body fatness were inversely related to the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, smoking, and coffee consumption. Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects. In lean people this association may be explained by a thermogenic effect of smoking.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1988 Apr,United States,1988,80
3585703,Personal and contextual determinants of coping strategies.,"This study examined personal and contextual predictors of active and avoidance coping strategies in a community sample of over 400 adults and in a sample of over 400 persons entering psychiatric treatment for unipolar depression. Sociodemographic factors of education and income (except for active-cognitive coping), personality dispositions of self-confidence and an easy-going manner, and contextual factors of negative life events and family support each made a significant incremental contribution to predicting active and avoidance coping. Among both healthy adults and patients, active and avoidance coping were positively associated with negative life events. Individuals who had more personal and environmental resources were more likely to rely on active coping and less likely to use avoidance coping. Moreover, for both groups, most of the predictors continued to show significant relations with active and avoidance coping strategies even after the stable component in coping was controlled in a longitudinal design. A comprehensive framework to understand the determinants of coping can be of practical value in suggesting points for therapeutic interventions aimed at fostering more adaptive coping efforts.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1987 May,United States,1987,80

3563565,Patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter: social psychological determinants.,"Patient-practitioner transactions in the ambulatory setting have become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years. In particular, there is growing interest in providing empirical support for our anecdotal, 'common-sense' notions that clinical encounter experiences are a major determinant of outcomes such as the patient's satisfaction with the encounter. The present study was designed to look at this issue and addressed the following two research questions: Is there a relationship between fulfillment of patient requests for services and patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter? and What degree of satisfaction is explained by the qualities of the encounter as compared to the characteristics of the patient, physician, and system of health care? Four newly-developed instruments were administered to a convenience sample of 144 adult patients and their physicians prior to and following actual visits to a University Family Practice Center. Meeting patients' requests increased their satisfaction with the encounter. At least 19% of the variance in patient satisfaction could be attributed to request fulfillment. The implications of these findings for future research into the doctor-patient relationship are discussed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1987,England,1987,80
6814269,A prospective study of long-term care institutionalization among the aged.,"A statewide probability sample of 1,625 elders living in Massachusetts are studied prospectively to identify key determinants of long-term care (LTC) institutionalization. One-hundred forty-seven elders, 9 per cent of the original cohort, entered a LTC institution during the six-year investigation. Using logistic multiple regression, we examine the predictive power of 19 independent variables grouped into six categories: demographic characteristics, attitude, social context, long-term care needs, physical disability, and mental/emotional disability. Five variables are significantly related to institutionalization: advancing age, using ambulatory aids, mental disorientation, living alone, and using assistance to perform ""instrumental"" ADL (activities of daily living). These results may be helpful to those trying to target non-institutional services to elders for use as substitutes for institutional long-term care. They may also help explain why recent experimental tests of substituting non-institutional care for institutional services have been less than successful.",American journal of public health,1982 Dec,United States,1982,80
3791024,Long-term hospitalization of failure-to-thrive infants: developmental outcome at three years.,"The present study documented later developmental outcome in a group of 29 failure-to-thrive (FTT) infants who received extended hospitalization in infancy as an intervention for their growth failure. All infants were seen at approximately 3 years of age and were given standardized assessments of intellectual and physical development. A standard interview documented demographic variables, health problems, placements subsequent to hospitalization and additional psychological and medical treatment. Infants were divided into three groups dependent on medical and treatment factors. Means and percentages of occurrence of outcome variables were compared through either one-way ANOVAS or single sample chi-square tests with post hoc analyses. Correlational analyses were used to understand the relationships between outcome and relevant demographic, medical, and treatment variables. In general, the infants manifest persistent intellectual delays at follow-up despite maintenance of weight gains achieved during early hospitalization. More than half the group suffered from chronic health problems. A large percentage of infants had been removed from parental custody at the time of follow-up. Several demographic, medical, and treatment factors bore moderate relationships to developmental outcome. Infants who achieved more optimal growth tended to be full-term at birth, later born and without a question of physical abuse in their social histories. Intellectual functioning was related only to parental and caretaker socioeconomic status. Infants placed in foster care were unlikely to return to their families of origin. The findings suggest the need for further investigation into the determinants and outcome of extended hospitalization as a treatment for FTT.",Child abuse & neglect,1986,England,1986,80

22077172,"Social, cultural, and economic determinants of age at birth of first child in Peninsular Malaysia.","Summary In order to unravel the complex set of the determinants of fertility, we suggest that the child-bearing process be separated into a sequence of events and intervals. As the first step in the child-bearing process, age at first birth is a critical variable. Using data from the 1966-67 West Malaysia Family Survey, we formulate and test a model of the cultural, social and economic determinants of the timing of first birth among a sample of mothers, aged 30-44. Social origins, measured by the woman's father's occupation and the woman's birthplace are not important determinants, but education, early work experience, and ethnicity exercise very strong effects on the age at first birth. Age at first marriage mediates much of the effect of background variables, which suggest that there is little use of contraception to plan the first birth interval. The strong effect of ethnicity is consistent with a cultural interpretation, but important qualifications are noted.",Population studies,1980 Nov,England,1980,80
3168446,Sexual and reproductive life events in relation to duration of oral contraceptive use.,"In order to disclose differences between users and non-users of oral contraceptives (OC), 620 women aged 15-54 were invited to participate in an in depth interview about sexual, contraceptive, and reproductive life events. Of the 585 women who participated, 459 were consecutive gynecological in- or outpatients, and 126 were selected from visitors in general practice. Data was analysed by multivariate test statistics. After correction for present age and social class, the duration of use of OC (DOC) among women 15-34 years of age correlated negatively to age at menarche and coital debut and positively to number of sexual partners, oral-genital sexual practice, and number of pelvic inflammatory diseases. Among women over 35, DOC was positively associated only to cigarette smoking. No correlation was found to coital frequency (whether earlier, present or during pregnancy or menstruation), number of births and abortions, or to social classification. In epidemiological research on benefits and risks of oral contraceptives, confounding influence of one or more variables is of crucial importance. The present findings point at sexual and life-style habits as potential confounders in the study of OC and associated diseases.",Contraception,1988 Jul,United States,1988,80

Fifty adult hypertensive patients at a health maintenance organization completed questionnaires and participated in home interviews over a 10-week period. Knowledge of medical regimens, information communication between the patient and the medical professionals, satisfaction with health-care providers, health locus of control, social support, and treatment disruption to life-style were assessed. Adherence was assessed through self-report and behavioral (i.e., pill-count ratio, percentage of kept medical appointments) indices. Finally, repeated blood-pressure measurements were obtained. Structural modeling procedures revealed that greater expectancy for internal control over health and hypertension, greater knowledge of the treatment regimen, and stronger social support were significant determinants of adherence; in turn, higher levels of adherence facilitated blood-pressure reduction.",Journal of behavioral medicine,1987 Aug,United States,1987,80

Some trends are predictable, while others (such as the epidemic of AIDS) may be unexpected. Analysis of past improvements in health suggests that medical research would be more productive if greater attention were paid to the external influences and personal behaviour which are the chief determinants of health. Apart from such general implications, analysis of the changing patterns of disease is vital as a stimulus and guide for medical research of all kinds. More effective monitoring of disease trends in New Zealand will require improvement in the quality and timeliness of routine health statistics, and training of adequate numbers of epidemiologists to analyse and interpret the data.

3619566,[Therapeutic and social determinants of the number of blood glucose tests performed at home by the diabetic child].,"The aim of this study was to assess the determinants of the use of blood glucose tests by young diabetic children participating in a summer educational program. 425 children and adolescents with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) were studied. The main source of the data was a questionnaire filled by the children and their parents about the use of urine and blood glucose tests during the 8 weeks before the camp and a questionnaire filled in by the Aide aux Jeunes Diabetiques (AJD) doctors about the practical knowledge of the management of the disease. The children were divided into 2 groups according to the level of their practical knowledge, ""good"" (n = 153) and ""less good"" (n = 272). In the whole group, the mean number of urine tests per day was 2.8, 75% of the children performing 3 tests per day and 4.3% not doing any urine tests. The number of blood tests is more variable; from 0 to 28 per week, with a mean of 5.6. In the group having ""good"" practical knowledge, the blood glucose tests were done 6 times per week, in connection with the number of hypoglycemia at home (p less than 0.01), the number of daily insulin injections (p less than 0.01) and the number of insulin supplements (p less than 0.05); there was a partial substitution between blood and urine tests. In the group having ""less good"" practical knowledge, the number of blood tests was 4 per week; it was not statistically different, but it was performed in the absence of detectable reasons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Archives francaises de pediatrie,1987 May,France,1987,80

Reporting on empirically based evidence of the situation of elderly men. ad 1. The following contextual aspects of the male aging process were under consideration: generalized and personalized images of elderly men, subjective reports on ""male aging"", changing images of the male sex role and the aging role, male sex role typing across the life span, middle and late adulthood as relevant lifespan segments preceding old age, and sociodemographic and health statistics concerning the situation in which elderly men live. ad 2. The report on empirically based data on the psychosocial situation of old aged men included the following aspects: Social roles of men in old age, comparisons between elderly men and elderly women and between elderly and younger men, interindividual variability (classifications) among the group of old-aged men and early antecedents as ""predictors"" of life satisfaction in old age. Analyzing these different kinds of material, the importance of a differential approach to the multidimensionally determined situation of men in old age was stressed; on the other hand, it seemed to be possible to identify certain ""typical"" characteristics at least for the present cohorts of old-aged men (e.g. importance of the quality of marital life, significance of being free of stress, tendency of experiential integration etc.).",Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie,1986 Jul-Aug,Germany,1986,80
28466762,Determinants of mortality transition in developing countries before and after the Second World War: Some evidence from Cuba.,"Few studies provide an insight into what factors contributed to declines in the mortality rates of developing countries before the Second World War. In this paper, statistics on causes of death from Cuba, particularly Havana, are used to investigate what may have been some of the principal determinants of mortality decline in the developing world before the arrival of modern drugs and insecticides. Trends in cause-specific mortality are examined in the light of Cuba's social, economic, medical and public health history. The Cuban experience strongly suggests that in this country public health and sanitary reforms and nutritional improvements were largely responsible for initial declines in mortality throughout the first half of the twentieth century. One important finding is that the impact of these reforms and improved nutrition was greatly influenced by prevailing economic conditions. Periods of economic prosperity facilitated declines in mortality; but in times of adversity, the reverse occurred. It appears that during prosperous periods the maintenance and expansion of public health and sanitary facilities were made possible by increased public and private revenues, and that individuals had access to a more abundant diet. The severe economic crisis of the Great Depression had the opposite effect. With the appearance of sulphonamides in the late 1930s, antibiotics, and residual insecticides and other specific measures at the end of the Second World War, the relevance of economic conditions as a determinant of mortality decline diminished. Although this analysis points to the aforementioned trends, the Cuban experience also suggests that other factors enter into the process of declining mortality and that this phenomenon can only be explained as the result of the complex interplay of many forces.",Population studies,1981 Nov 1,England,1981,80

The patients' social and psychological responses during the course of his rehabilitation were elicited using a semistructured interview schedule. Determinants of outcome were assessed using multiple regression analysis. Return to work, exercise, leisure and sexual activity were all strongly influenced by somatic symptoms of chest pain, breathlessness, and tiredness. Lack of depression, not smoking, and support from the family doctor were important contributors to successful rehabilitation. Cardiac damage sustained at the time of admission did not appear to have any consistent influence on outcome. Half of the smokers had not resumed their habit at six months. Fewer men were working at six months than on admission. Somatic symptoms, anxiety and depression were considerable.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1987,England,1987,80

Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods.",Journal of biosocial science. Supplement,1989,England,1989,80

3720261,Impact of chronic arthritis in the elderly.,"These case histories illustrate how medical, psychosocial, cultural and economic factors affect the elderly with chronic arthritis. Physicians need to be aware of their patient's attitudes, concerns, support systems and goals resulting from a lifetime of experience, to provide the most appropriate and effective care. 'Images of future are usually only caricatures of the present' (Starr, 1982), but based on current demography, one can predict trends for the future. It is likely that the elderly of the future will be better off financially, better educated, healthier, more politically connected and strident, but their social support systems will be less effective. The last stems from trends such as declining birth rate, an increasingly mobile society, diminished importance of the nuclear family, and the diminishing attractiveness of professions involved with providing maintenance care. This suggests that the physician and nurse, being the primary gatekeepers for the care of and services for the elderly, must be even more attentive to the non-biological determinants of arthritis disability.",Clinics in rheumatic diseases,1986 Apr,England,1986,80

One hundred and twenty male subjects were randomly given success or failure feedback on an intellectual task. They then participated in a separate ""wine-tasting"" experiment in which they were allowed to regulate alcohol consumption. As predicted, high self-conscious subjects who had received failure feedback drank significantly more wine than did high self-conscious subjects who received success feedback. Consumption by low self-conscious subjects fell between these extremes and did not vary as a function of success and failure. Additional data indicated that these results were mediated by differential sensitivity to the positive or negative implications of success/failure by high and low self-conscious subjects. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for theoretical accounts of the psychological antecedents of alcohol consumption.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1983 Jun,United States,1983,80

Events were varied to create positively and negatively skewed distributions. The events in each distribution were ascribed to either a single person or a group of people; Ss rated how happy they would feel if they experienced specific events within the distribution. Ratings for both intrapersonal and social comparisons were fit well by Parducci's (1984) range-frequency theory. Individual events received higher ratings when presented within the positively skewed context. Overall happiness, as measured by both the mean of the happiness ratings as well as direct ratings, was highest for the negatively skewed distributions. The effects of skewing were more pronounced for intrapersonal comparisons, but ratings were more closely defined by the range of experimental stimuli for social comparisons.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1989 Mar,United States,1989,80

They were then tested twice a week individually and twice a week socially from 2 to 6 1/2 months of age in a playroom, utilizing multiple categories of behavior. The mother-only-reared juveniles were hyperactive in both object play (when tested individually) and social play. The brooder-only-reared kittens displayed enhanced socially directed behavior and were generally hypergregarious, whereas the brooder-littermate-reared kittens displayed retarded social behavior. Observations indicated that littermate-deprived kittens did not learn social communication skills and that some prolonged separation effects existed for littermate-reared kittens.

The incidence of CPTH has been 44%. Age of the patients ranged between 4 and 69 years. Clinical pictures included closed head injuries of different degree of severity: mild, moderate and severe. Time of onset, headache frequency, character, intensity, duration and associated symptoms showed a great degree of variability. However, chronic muscle contraction headache was the commonest clinical syndrome followed by migraine. Moderate correlations have been found between the severity of CPTH disturbance of consciousness, following the head trauma, and positive findings at CT scan. Moreover the comparison of personality profiles (MMPI) of CPTH (n=26) with a post-traumatic control group, without headache (n=17) showed higher scores on hypocondriasis, depression, hysteria and schizophrenia scales only in the severe CPTH group. Age of the patients, duration of unconsciousness, neurological deficits, course length and pending litigation or compensations were unrelated to the occurrence and outcome of CPTH.

When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas.

A sample of 4500 persons aged more than 59 years were interviewed in 1978. The theoretical approach was to identify the elements of successful aging under the conditions of swiss society, which are: the quality and degrees of independence and self determination of personality, continuity of the manner of living and adequate handling of the changing conditions of life in the third age including physical, mental, communicational and economic mutations. To reach this goal the survey measured the socio-economic conditions of the investigated population, their psycho-physical ability, how old people compensate deficits: the conditions essential for life, integration in leisure, private contacts, public opinions and political participation. The results show that a great majority is satisfied with the conditions of dwelling, occupation and economic conditions. But in all dimensions of life we also found minorities oppressed, threatened or deprived. Psycho-physical fitness proved to be in good state for a great majority and only a few percent were in a physical or mental condition which did not grant them independence and self-determination.

It was hypothesized that Person-Environment (P-E) congruence, as assessed by the Environmental Perception, Preference and Importance Scale (EPPIS), would be related to (1) sex integration/segregation makeup of the health related facility (HRF) living units, and (2) quantity of social interaction between staff and residents. Analysis of sex by unit sex-type interaction for 60 residents' Person-Environment (P-E) congruence scores revealed that elderly females on sex-integrated units reported a higher level of P-E congruence than those residing on female-only units; males on sex-integrated units, in contrast, reported a poorer level of P-E congruence than males on sex -segregated units. Furthermore, behavioral observations of staff-resident verbal interactions confirmed the hypothesis that residents living on units with high staff-resident interaction perceived the environments more congruent with their preferences than residents on units low in verbal interaction. The observed relationships between the P-E congruence measure, resident-staff interaction, and unit sex-type were taken as further support for the relevance and value of the EPPIS measure as a tool for assessing and improving the institutional milieu.",Experimental aging research,1981 Winter,United States,1981,80
3384599,Determinants of emergency room visits for psychological problems in a general hospital.,"Determinants of emergency room visits for psychological reasons were studied prospectively for a four month period in an Indian General Hospital. Psychiatric emergencies constituted only 2% of all emergency visits. Most of the patients were new except for 7.4% who were already registered with the outpatient services of the psychiatry department. Males outnumbered females in a ratio of 2:1. Self-referrals constituted 77% of the samples; 21% of patients were brought by police. Two-thirds of the patients were brought owing to the severity of their clinical condition and the rest, one-third, for medico-legal and social reasons. Approximately 80% of the patients sought consultation within one month of the onset of illness episode. First episode of mental illness was within last one year of the emergency room visit in 60% patients. Past history of hospitalization for mental illness was obtained only in 10% of cases. The pattern suggested that there was no misuse of emergency services by psychiatric patients although 20% of the patients presented with social problems only which required social rather than psychiatric intervention.",The International journal of social psychiatry,1988 Spring,England,1988,80
6971053,Correlates and changes over time in drug and alcohol use within a barrio population.,"Extent and determinants of use of alcohol, marijuana, inhalants, and PCP were explored in a group of 339 Mexican American youths from the East Los Angeles Housing projects. Results from this study were compared to those from a similar survey carried out in the same area 2 years ago. Use of inhalants has declined markedly compared with prevalence reported in the previous report. However, use of alcohol and marijuana have increased across all age and sex cohorts. Prevalence of PCP use, explored for the first time in this report, was shown to be extremely high. Use of all drugs was generally predicted by age, sex, and number of peers reporting use. Self-concept factors, especially one's self-evaluation with respect to others, were also significant predictors to use of marijuana, inhalants, and PCP. However, alcohol use was not related to any self-concept factors. Language (Spanish-English) used both in the home and with peers was related to use of all substances studied. Limitations in the generalization of this study as a result of sampling problems are discussed.",American journal of community psychology,1980 Dec,England,1980,80
2784327,"Obstetric deaths in Menoufia Governorate, Egypt.","A survey of all registered deaths which occurred during 1981-1983 in women of reproductive age was carried out in Menoufia Governorate, Egypt. Surviving family members were interviewed by trained social workers, and information was collected on symptoms of the disease that led to death. The completed questionnaires were reviewed by a panel of local physicians and a cause of death was assigned by the panel. Maternal mortality was a leading cause of death, second only to heart disease. There were 190 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths and 45 maternal deaths per 100,000 married women aged between 15 and 49 years. Most of the maternal deaths (63%) were due to direct obstetric causes of which haemorrhage was the main cause. Another 27% of the maternal deaths were due to indirect obstetric causes of which rheumatic heart disease was the main cause.",British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,1989 Jan,England,1989,80
3780230,Determinants of oral contraceptive use in northern Italy.,"Socio-demographic characteristics, general lifestyle habits, reproductive and medical histories were compared of 328 women who had ever used oral contraceptives and 2306 never users from a case-control surveillance conducted in Northern Italy. Oral contraceptive use was positively and strongly related with the level of education and indicators of social class. The rate ratio of ever use (adjusted for age and diagnostic category) was 3.3 for women with 12 years of education or more compared with less than 7 years, and 3.0 for women of highest compared with lowest social class. The frequency of pill use was lower among never married women, and significantly elevated among smokers (rate ratio = 2.4 for heavy smokers). In contrast, no relation was evident between alcohol or coffee consumption and pill use. Likewise, ever users of oral contraceptives were not significantly different from women who had never used the pill with regard to major reproductive factors (parity and age at first pregnancy) or several medical variables of potential interest (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), with the only possible exclusion of obesity which was less frequent among pill users. Thus, this study indicates that the major determinants of the persistently low frequency of oral contraceptive use in this Northern Italian population are social rather than reproductive or medical factors. These findings have important implications for epidemiological research on oral contraceptive and disease in this population, and underline the importance of selection and screening of oral contraceptive users on the basis of knowledge of medical factors and lifestyle habits.",Contraception,1986 Aug,United States,1986,80
3182366,"Smoking among kibbutz youth. Patterns, perceptions, and determinants.","A population of 54 high-school-aged kibbutz youth in Israel were studied to assess their smoking habits. Twenty (37%) were smokers. Among the smokers, 15 (75%) smoked daily, with four smoking as many as 10-20 cigarettes per day. Nearly half of the group believed smoking affected their health and were interested in stopping their use of cigarettes. Smokers when compared to nonsmokers had more positive peer relations (chi 2 = 9.308; p less than 0.01), less positive relations with parents (chi 2 = 8.293; p less than 0.01), more boredom with kibbutz life (chi 2 = 3.468; p less than 0.10), and less involvement with a hobby, sport, or reading (chi 2 = 3.133, p less than 0.10). Parents' smoking habits, marital status of the parents, students' self-evaluation of their academic performance, and youths' age and sex did not differentiate smokers from nonsmokers.",Journal of adolescent health care : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1988 Nov,United States,1988,80
3751657,Social determinants of aggression in a sample of Chinese primary school children.,"The aim of the present study was to relate children's aggression levels to social determinants of interest (i.e., child-rearing measures, day-care attendance, peer group influence, and TV-watching) in a sample of Chinese children in the People's Republic of China. A sample of 290 primary school students (155 boys and 135 girls, mean age 10.3) in grade four in Beijing were investigated using the Multi-Faceted Aggression Inventory. The children's parents were asked about child-rearing measures and day-care experience for the child. Teachers rated the children's aggression, school achievement level, and membership in the Young Pioneers. Despite acknowledged limitations, the findings in this study gave evidence that according to a person-environment interaction perspective, the Chinese children's individual differences in aggression were influenced by the restricted environment. As aggressive behaviour is undesired and suppressed in the Chinese culture in and outside the home, the Chinese children seemed to show lower levels and less variation of aggression behaviour than children in permissive environments (e.g., Sweden). However, when analysing sex differences in aggression environmental influences alone might not explain the differences.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,1986 May,United States,1986,80
3384511,Predicting Japanese American drinking behavior.,"Empirical data on Japanese American drinking behavior are scarce. The present study was a random sample (N = 295) of households in Los Angeles with Japanese surnames. Japanese Americans born in the United States tended to drink less than those born in Japan. The study also observed significant gender differences in Japanese American drinking behavior which were attributed to ascribed social roles. Other demographic and social determinants of drinking were examined through two logistic regression models. The first model predicted drinking (as opposed to abstaining), while the other distinguished heavy drinkers from those who drank alcohol in more moderate amounts. Potential reference groups (e.g., parents, friends, church groups, etc.) were often significant in predicting whether and how much a Japanese American drank.",The International journal of the addictions,1988 Apr,United States,1988,80
3232579,"The relationship of self-esteem, maternal employment, and work-family plans to sex role orientations of late adolescents.","Self-esteem, maternal employment, and work-family plans are examined in relation to sex role orientations of late adolescents. Data are analyzed from questionnaires administered to 387 males and females. It was found that future work-family plans were closely tied to sex role orientations of adolescents of both sexes. However, self-esteem, evaluation of the relative difficulty of male-female sex roles, and projected childlessness were salient to sex role attitudes of females but not of males. Positive evaluations of self were related to non-traditional sex role orientations among females. Maternal employment differentially affected male and female children. Sons of women in high-status occupations were reluctant to get involved in a two-career family with children. Mothers' occupational status had little influence on the plans or sex role attitudes of daughters. The results indicate that future research should investigate whether maternal employment in high-status occupations, while providing a wider range of acceptable models for girls, may serve as a negative model for boys.",Adolescence,1988 Winter,United States,1988,80

This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact.",Studies in family planning,1989 Mar-Apr,United States,1989,80
28564267,THE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF PHYLOGENETIC CONSTRAINTS IN COMPARATIVE ANALYSES: SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN BODY WEIGHT AMONG PRIMATES.,"We have presented a formal model for the quantitative analysis of phylogenetic and specific effects on the distribution of trait values among species. Total trait values are divided into phylogenetic values, inherited from an ancestral species, and specific values, the result of independent evolution. This allows a quantitative assessment of the strength of the phylogenetic inertia, or burden, displayed by a character in a lineage, so that questions concerning the relative importance of phylogenetic constraints in evolution can be answered. The separation of phylogenetic from specific effects proposed here also allows phylogenetic factors to be explicitly included in cross-species comparative analyses of adaptation. This solves a long-standing problem in evolutionary comparative studies. Only species' specific values can provide information concerning the independent evolution of characters in a set of related species. Therefore, only correlations among specific values for traits may be used as evidence for adaptation in cross-species comparative analyses. The phylogenetic autocorrelation model was applied to a comparative analysis of the determinants of sexual dimorphism in weight among 44 primate species. In addition to sexual dimorphism in weight, mating system, habitat, diet, and size (weight itself) were included in the analysis. All of the traits, except diet, were substantially influenced by phylogenetic inertia. The comparative analysis of the determinants of sexual dimorphism in weight indicates that 50% of the variation among primate species is due to phylogeny. Size, or scaling, could account for a total of 36% of the variance, making it almost as important as phylogeny in determining the level of dimorphism displayed by a species. Habitat, mating system, and diet follow, accounting for minor amounts of variation. Thus, in attempting to explain why a particular modern primate species is very dimorphic compared to other primates, we would say first because its ancestor was more dimorphic than average, second because it is a relatively large species, and third because it is terrestrial, polygynous, and folivorous.",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,1985 Nov,United States,1985,80
3563565,Patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter: social psychological determinants.,"Patient-practitioner transactions in the ambulatory setting have become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years. In particular, there is growing interest in providing empirical support for our anecdotal, 'common-sense' notions that clinical encounter experiences are a major determinant of outcomes such as the patient's satisfaction with the encounter. The present study was designed to look at this issue and addressed the following two research questions: Is there a relationship between fulfillment of patient requests for services and patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter? and What degree of satisfaction is explained by the qualities of the encounter as compared to the characteristics of the patient, physician, and system of health care? Four newly-developed instruments were administered to a convenience sample of 144 adult patients and their physicians prior to and following actual visits to a University Family Practice Center. Meeting patients' requests increased their satisfaction with the encounter. At least 19% of the variance in patient satisfaction could be attributed to request fulfillment. The implications of these findings for future research into the doctor-patient relationship are discussed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1987,England,1987,80

Use of social drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and the oral contraceptive varied considerably within the sample, being appreciably greater in White subjects. 3. Paracetamol clearance was 21% slower in Asians than in Whites and half-life 18% longer. The total range of clearance was 1.86--6.78 ml min-1 kg-1. 4. Clearance was slower in women than in men, increased with increasing alcohol intake and cigarett consumption, and was more rapid in those women using the oral contraceptive. The effects of alcohol and the oral contraceptive were also found in White subjects alone. 5 The variables found to correlate independently with paracetamol clearance accounted for only 27% of the total sample variance, however, and are unlikely to be the major determinants of paracetamol elimination in man.",British journal of clinical pharmacology,1980 Jul,England,1980,80

The series constituted all patients with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver (primary only), gallbladder, and pancreas recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1971-1975 (8,802 cases). Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes. These associations are most likely to be mediated by dietary habits. No clear-cut association was found for other cancers.",Preventive medicine,1986 Mar,United States,1986,80

Hourly changes in emotional state were recorded together with associated circumstances. Lowering of mood was associated mainly with ""hassle"" at work, pressure of time, and domestic dissatisfaction. Improvement in mood was associated with domestic happiness and satisfaction at working efficiently and to time. Mood was significantly lower when the doctor was on call. Women doctors were more prone to mood changes associated with domestic matters. Responses to a questionnaire suggested that the doctors preferred traditional clinical medicine to problems of a social or psychological origin.

Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,1986 Nov-Dec,United States,1986,80

7326949,When rational men fall sick: an inquiry into some assumptions made by medical anthropologists.,"Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points.","Culture, medicine and psychiatry",1981 Dec,Netherlands,1981,80
2525495,An epidemiological study of children's attitudes toward disability.,"In this epidemiological study the authors recorded the attitudes of children in Hamilton, Ontario, to physically disabled and mentally handicapped children. Univariate analyses confirmed the importance of female gender, friendship and contact with handicapped persons as determinants of more accepting attitudes. Type of disability and the presence or absence of disabled children in respondents' schools were not found to influence attitudes in a systematic manner. Correlations between attitudes and children's self-esteem or sociometric ratings were not significant, nor were parent-child attitude correlations. Maternal language of origin was found to influence children's attitudes, in favour of children of English-speaking mothers. These results are discussed with reference to their practical applications by community and educational systems seeking to foster integration of disabled children.",Developmental medicine and child neurology,1989 Apr,England,1989,80

The empirical estimates of the nutritional status production function provided no convincing support for the hypothesis."" The second goal was ""to investigate the joint determinants of child nutrition and of women's fertility and work choices....[It is suggested] that increases in women's education and formal sector wages will induce declines in fertility and improvements in child nutrition.

6737214,Social and emotional loneliness: an examination of Weiss's typology of loneliness.,"This study examined Weiss' conceptualization of social and emotional loneliness. Using data from an extensive survey of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Iowa, we measured social and emotional loneliness, students' affective and behavioral reactions to loneliness, students' social relationships, and their judgments of the degree to which their relationships supply the six social provisions described by Weiss. As expected, we found differences in the subjective experiences of social and emotional loneliness, although both forms of loneliness were also characterized by a common core of experiences. The results generally supported Weiss's ideas concerning the determinants of social and emotional loneliness. Predictions concerning the affective and behavioral consequences associated with each type of loneliness, however, were only partly supported, although the two forms of loneliness were associated with different affective reactions and coping behaviors. The implications of these findings for Weiss's typology of loneliness are discussed.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1984 Jun,United States,1984,80

Each subject's smoking series revealed a characteristic inter-cigarette interval frequency distribution but there was little evidence of sequential dependencies in the series with respect to either successive intervals or successive events in time. Several subjects exhibited possible characteristic peaks or troughs during successive 2-hour periods, a finding which was in agreement with previous studies, but even in these subjects temporal patterning accounted for only a small proportion of the total variance.

The selected sample was broadly representative of the ethnic groups that make up the Perth population and of the different social ranks within that population. The age, sex, weight, height, country of birth of the child and the parents, and occupation of the father were recorded for each subject. Weight, height and body mass index (BMI) increased with age. Age and sex were the most important determinants of body size. However, children of lower social rank and those with a southern European background were over-represented among the overweight children (greater than the 90th centile for BMI), particularly in adolescence. Children with an Asian background who were 11 years of age and younger were over-represented among the underweight children (less than or equal to the 10th centile for BMI). Results from this study indicate a continuing, though small (1.5 cm to 1.6 cm), secular increase in height over the past 13 to 14 years.",The Medical journal of Australia,1986 Oct 20,Australia,1986,80

Information from social records, a structured psychological interview, and projective tests did not support the notion that men with sex chromosome anomalies are particularly violent or aggressive. Hormonally, XYY men had significantly higher concentrations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than matched control groups. In contrast, XXY men had higher levels of LH, FSH, and prolactin, but low concentrations of testosterone. There was a significantly positive relation among all subjects as well as XY controls alone between plasma testosterone level and evidence of criminal convictions. A proportionate increase in testosterone levels was noted when subjects were divided into nondelinquents, delinquents without violent convictions, and delinquents with violent convictions. The relation between testosterone level and criminal behavior was not reflected in measures of aggression derived from the psychological interview and projective tests. There was no specific evidence that testosterone is a mediating factor in the criminal behavior of XYY men.",Archives of general psychiatry,1984 Jan,United States,1984,80

Three domains of determinants are identified (personal psychological resources of parents, characteristics of the child, and contextual sources of stress and support), and a process model of competent parental functioning is offered on the basis of the analysis. The model presumes that parental functioning is multiply determined, that sources of contextual stress and support can directly affect parenting or indirectly affect parenting by first influencing individual psychological well-being, that personality influences contextual support/stress, which feeds back to shape parenting, and that, in order of importance, the personal psychological resources of the parent are more effective in buffering the parent-child relation from stress than are contextual sources of support, which are themselves more effective than characteristics of the child.",Child development,1984 Feb,United States,1984,80
3168446,Sexual and reproductive life events in relation to duration of oral contraceptive use.,"In order to disclose differences between users and non-users of oral contraceptives (OC), 620 women aged 15-54 were invited to participate in an in depth interview about sexual, contraceptive, and reproductive life events. Of the 585 women who participated, 459 were consecutive gynecological in- or outpatients, and 126 were selected from visitors in general practice. Data was analysed by multivariate test statistics. After correction for present age and social class, the duration of use of OC (DOC) among women 15-34 years of age correlated negatively to age at menarche and coital debut and positively to number of sexual partners, oral-genital sexual practice, and number of pelvic inflammatory diseases. Among women over 35, DOC was positively associated only to cigarette smoking. No correlation was found to coital frequency (whether earlier, present or during pregnancy or menstruation), number of births and abortions, or to social classification. In epidemiological research on benefits and risks of oral contraceptives, confounding influence of one or more variables is of crucial importance. The present findings point at sexual and life-style habits as potential confounders in the study of OC and associated diseases.",Contraception,1988 Jul,United States,1988,80
6634993,Experience-based vocalization of male mice to female chemosignals.,"Previous experimentation led to a suggestion that pituitary-mediated metabolites present in female urine are important determinants of stimulus potency in eliciting 70 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations from adult male mice (Mus musculus). In the present experiment this hypothesis was reexamined, taking into account the prior experience of the male test subjects. Male mice were given social experience with either hypophysectomized females or intact, normal females and were then monitored for ultrasonic vocalizations to chemosensory stimuli from both. Results indicated that males (1) will emit ultrasonic vocalizations to urine from hypophysectomized females and (2) tend to preferentially emit ultrasound to stimuli from the type of female previously encountered during the social experience regimen. It is proposed that the previously reported lack of ultrasound emission by males to chemosignals from hypophysectomized females can be accounted for via straightforward associative learning mechanisms.",Physiology & behavior,1983 Sep,United States,1983,80
3529452,Socio-environmental factors and lung function.,"The literature was reviewed to assess whether the evidence implicating socio-environmental (SE) factors as determinants of adult lung function was sufficient to require that they be taken into account in epidemiological studies, together with other factors, such as age and smoking. In six studies involving 11,000 adults resident in the USA, France and Denmark forced expiratory volume in 1 second was related to social class and/or one of a number of other factors including education, area of residence and housing status. Trends in three other studies involving approximately 15,000 children resident in the UK and the USA were similar. The consistency of the findings makes it difficult to escape the conclusion that SE factors should be taken into account in comparisons of lung function between populations when the purpose is to assess the role of other environmental factors such as occupational exposure.",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,1986 Aug 30,South Africa,1986,80
2785722,Reproductive tract infections in a family planning population in rural Bangladesh.,"In contrast to social, religious, and economic determinants of acceptance and sustained use of family planning in developing countries, perceived side effects resulting from reproductive tract infections can usually be ameliorated easily and expeditiously. This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact.",Studies in family planning,1989 Mar-Apr,United States,1989,80
3222582,Predictors of non-adoption of cigarette smoking following experimentation.,"The Childhood Antecedents of Smoking Study (CASS) investigated patterns of cigarette smoking among junior and senior high school students in an upper midwest school district. Four biannual school-based surveys were conducted over two years. A cohort of 72 smokers was identified and followed to determine who continued smoking and who quit. Discriminant analysis was used to study social, psychological, and environmental factors predictive of quitting smoking. Compared to continuing smokers, quitters reported having fewer friends and siblings who smoked, they were less likely to view the cigarette smoker's image as positive, and lived in families where parental involvement with teenagers was high (based on the reports of parents). These results are consistent with the view that social influences are strong determinants of patterns of adolescent smoking behaviour.",Scandinavian journal of primary health care,1988 Sep,United States,1988,80
3609410,Desired family size and its determinants among urban Nigerian women: a two-stage analysis.,"This paper proposes and carries out a two-stage analysis of the determinants of desired family size, using data gathered from a sample of women in the city of Ilorin, Nigeria. The analysis first focuses on differences between women who report numerical family size desires and those who report nonnumerical desires. Findings suggest that there are important differences between these two groups, but there is little variation in the actual number reported by those expressing numerical desires. Implications of these findings for survey design are discussed. In particular, the practice of forcing numerical responses by instructing interviewers to probe when women report nonnumerical desires is questioned.",Demography,1987 May,United States,1987,80
31968907,"Demography, ranging patterns, and activity budgets of black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus chamek) in the Manu National Park, Peru.","Results of a long-term field study on the ecology and social organization of two groups of black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus chamek) in Peru are reported. Demography, ranging patterns, and activity budgets provide insight into some of the proximate determinants of fission-fusion social organization in this species and illustrate the different strategies used by males and females to gain access to critical resources. Longitudinal data on known individuals provide evidence for male natal philopatry and female emigration at sexual maturity in this population. Interbirth intervals are long (mean = 34.5 months) in comparison with most other primate species, and 5 of 15 infants seen within a few days of birth died or disappeared before they were a year old. Home ranges are large (150-250 ha) and fairly discrete; overlap with neighboring groups is on the order of 10-15%. Males and females differed substantially in their ranging patterns; females, particularly those with infants, restricted much of their ranging to a ""core area"" 20-33% the size of the total group range, whereas males ranged more evenly over the entire area occupied by the group. Daily path length varied over almost an order of magnitude from 465 m to 4,070 m, with a mean of 1977 m. Males spent more time traveling and less time feeding than most females. These results are compared with those obtained in previous studies of Ateles and with similar data from other primate species to assess their implications for the evolution of fission-fusion sociality in spider monkeys. The ecological factors responsible for the evolution of very similar social organizations in spider monkeys and chimpanzees are discussed.",American journal of primatology,1988,United States,1988,80
3407490,Parents' behavioral norms as predictors of adolescent sexual activity and contraceptive use.,"The influence of parental factors on adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive use has been examined previously, and findings have been contradictory. Previous studies, which found little relationship between parental norms and adolescent sexual activity, have been limited by their failure to recognize developmental differences in the relative weight of parent and peer influences between younger and older teens and by use of selected samples, resulting in a restriction of range. The current study differs in that it utilizes a clustered sample household survey of 329 males and females, aged 14 to 17, and 470 of their parents. Using multiple regression analysis, it was found that parents' reported behavioral norms account for 5% of the variance in whether adolescents have had intercourse, and for 33% of the variance in use of contraception at last intercourse. The study suggests that while parents' normative beliefs have limited effect in the decision to become sexually active, they have considerable impact on later contraceptive use.",Adolescence,1988 Summer,United States,1988,80

3933036,Some determinants of the motivational properties of ethanol in the rat: concurrent administration of food or social stimuli.,"The hypothesis was examined that the interaction of ethanol with the conditions under which it is administered may determine whether either preference or aversion for the drug develops. In Experiment 1, eight groups of food-deprived rats received injections of ethanol (175-1,400 mg/kg) in one environment and were later offered a choice between that environment and a different one previously associated with saline injections. Another eight groups were treated identically, except that food was available in both the saline and ethanol-paired environments. The groups given the drug without food showed no preference or aversion at low doses (175-700 mg/kg), but showed aversion at higher doses (1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg). When food was available, there was an increased preference for the environment paired with the 500 mg/kg dose and reduced aversion at the 1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg doses. In Experiment 2, placing two rats together increased each rat's preference for the environment associated with the other animal. However, rats pretreated with 500 mg/kg ethanol before being placed together showed a reduced preference for the environment associated with the drug and the other animal. Controls never paired with another rat showed no preference or aversion at the same ethanol dose. Thus, ethanol may interact with conditions such as the presence of food or another animal to determine final effects that are unique to those conditions.",Psychopharmacology,1985,Germany,1985,80
3780230,Determinants of oral contraceptive use in northern Italy.,"Socio-demographic characteristics, general lifestyle habits, reproductive and medical histories were compared of 328 women who had ever used oral contraceptives and 2306 never users from a case-control surveillance conducted in Northern Italy. Oral contraceptive use was positively and strongly related with the level of education and indicators of social class. The rate ratio of ever use (adjusted for age and diagnostic category) was 3.3 for women with 12 years of education or more compared with less than 7 years, and 3.0 for women of highest compared with lowest social class. The frequency of pill use was lower among never married women, and significantly elevated among smokers (rate ratio = 2.4 for heavy smokers). In contrast, no relation was evident between alcohol or coffee consumption and pill use. Likewise, ever users of oral contraceptives were not significantly different from women who had never used the pill with regard to major reproductive factors (parity and age at first pregnancy) or several medical variables of potential interest (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), with the only possible exclusion of obesity which was less frequent among pill users. Thus, this study indicates that the major determinants of the persistently low frequency of oral contraceptive use in this Northern Italian population are social rather than reproductive or medical factors. These findings have important implications for epidemiological research on oral contraceptive and disease in this population, and underline the importance of selection and screening of oral contraceptive users on the basis of knowledge of medical factors and lifestyle habits.",Contraception,1986 Aug,United States,1986,80
6882340,Odor cue determinants of urine marking in male rats (Rattus norvegicus).,"This study examined the spatial distribution of urine marking by sexually inexperienced male rats under six odor conditions: minimum odor (baseline), conspecific male urine, conspecific female urine, an animal's own urine, male gerbil urine, and amyl acetate. The gerbil urine and amyl acetate conditions were included to test the theory that marking, rather than being elicited by and directed as a display to appropriate conspecifics, occurred to the introduction of any novel or disruptive odor. The subject's own urine was used to test the theory that the animal marked to maintain an optimum level of its own odor in the environment. The results showed that marking was directed predominantly at objects in the environment over which the animal could readily pass. All odor conditions except ""own odor"" sharply increased marking over baseline levels. Marking decreased with repeated exposure to particular stimuli. The results strongly supported the theory that urine marking, at least in sexually inexperienced male rats, is produced by novel odor stimuli introduced into a familiar environment.",Behavioral and neural biology,1983 Jan,United States,1983,80
6723941,Repeat abortion: is it a problem?,"As the number of Canadian women who have had induced abortions increases with each succeeding year, the number at risk--and the actual incidence--of repeat abortion also increases. Some researchers have argued that women who have more than one induced abortion are less well adjusted, others that they are less willing to use contraceptives, perhaps because of anxiety about sexuality. Still others have suggested that repeat abortion is unrelated to the psychology or attitudes of individual women, but rather is an inevitable result of imperfect contraceptives, imperfect contraceptive practice and the availability of legal abortion for the termination of unwanted pregnancies. A group of 580 women seeking abortions were interviewed at the Montreal General Hospital and given a number of psychological tests. About one in five of these women were having repeat abortions. The women having repeat abortions were older, less likely to be married and more tolerant of legal abortion than were women having their first abortions. They also had intercourse more frequently than the first-abortion patients. Women obtaining a repeat abortion were slightly more likely to have been using contraceptives at the time they became pregnant, but they did not differ from first-abortion patients in the types of methods that they used. On no other social or demographic characteristics, measures of psychological adjustment or attitudes about sexuality were there any important differences between the groups. A more complex statistical analysis reveals that the two most important factors differentiating first-abortion and repeat-abortion patients are age and coital frequency--both of which are variables that reflect added exposure to the risk of unintended pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Family planning perspectives,1984 Mar-Apr,United States,1984,80
3762472,Body size of young Australians aged five to 16 years.,"In 1983-1984, 4578 Perth primary and secondary schoolchildren were studied. The selected sample was broadly representative of the ethnic groups that make up the Perth population and of the different social ranks within that population. The age, sex, weight, height, country of birth of the child and the parents, and occupation of the father were recorded for each subject. Weight, height and body mass index (BMI) increased with age. Age and sex were the most important determinants of body size. However, children of lower social rank and those with a southern European background were over-represented among the overweight children (greater than the 90th centile for BMI), particularly in adolescence. Children with an Asian background who were 11 years of age and younger were over-represented among the underweight children (less than or equal to the 10th centile for BMI). Results from this study indicate a continuing, though small (1.5 cm to 1.6 cm), secular increase in height over the past 13 to 14 years.",The Medical journal of Australia,1986 Oct 20,Australia,1986,80
2576262,The worldwide use of steroidal contraception.,"Historically, concerns about rapidly growing populations and resources that could not support them persuaded governments of developing countries to initiate family planning programs. Between the early 1960s and the early 1980s, the number of governments supporting these programs increased from 7 to approximately 120. Today, 52 governments in developing countries provide support to family planning programs because of the demographic rationale, and 65 governments do so because of human rights and health considerations: The effective use of family planning significantly diminishes infant, child, and maternal mortality and morbidity. Forty-five percent of married women of reproductive age worldwide are practicing contraception today; however, 69% do so in East Asia and only 11% in Africa. Female sterilization and use of intrauterine devices are the most popular methods in developing countries, and oral contraceptives and condoms, in developed countries. Of the 400 million women of reproductive age, 140 million (35%) are relying on family planning methods requiring male cooperation and less than 60 million (15%) are using oral contraceptives. More than half of these oral contraceptive users live in four countries: the United States, Brazil, France, and the Federal Republic of Germany. On the other hand, the percentage of currently married women, aged 15 to 19 years, who have never used any form of contraception is as high as 85% to 90% in Bangladesh, Sudan, and Pakistan. In many developing countries, there is a statistically significant correlation between women's use of contraception and years of education. Other important factors influencing contraceptive prevalence include the established or perceived side effects of currently available methods, the status of women, the political climate, and a number of behavioral and social determinants.",International journal of fertility,1989,United States,1989,80

Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described. It was found that smoking, work experience, and age were the most important determinants of self assessed respiratory conditions. When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas. Respiratory conditions were affected by the age of housing, and flats were found to be worse than houses. High rise flats were worse than low or medium rise flats.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1985 Mar,England,1985,80
3120234,Reliability of self-reported sexual behavior risk factors for HIV infection in homosexual men.,"This study was undertaken to determine the reliability of self-reported sexual behavior using the test and retest technique when used with self-reported sexual behavior. The subjects were 116 asymptomatic homosexual men who participated in another study (an examination of behavioral and demographic determinants of HIV antibody status). The subjects were asked to complete two questionnaires. The first contained demographic and sexual behavior questions. The second, administered an average of 6 weeks later, used a subset of the questions in the first questionnaire. The reliability of the test-retest procedure was measured by the Kappa statistic, which assesses the proportion of agreement between two data items, accounting for the amount of agreement expected by chance. The highest degree of reliability as measured by Kappa was found with demographic information, smoking history, and sexual orientation. Self-reported sexual behaviors for the previous 6 months generally had the next highest degree of reliability as measured by Kappa. Questions examining change over the previous 5 years had the lowest reliability. Behavior changes during the time between questionnaires, subjectivity of the answer categories, and social desirability of the answers are three factors that may result in a lack of reliability in this self-reported sexual behavior questionnaire. This raises methodological concerns about the measurement of behavioral risk factors for AIDS and the ability to assess meaningfully subjective reports of behavioral change.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",1987 Nov-Dec,United States,1987,80

The incidence of CPTH has been 44%. Age of the patients ranged between 4 and 69 years. Clinical pictures included closed head injuries of different degree of severity: mild, moderate and severe. Time of onset, headache frequency, character, intensity, duration and associated symptoms showed a great degree of variability. However, chronic muscle contraction headache was the commonest clinical syndrome followed by migraine. Moderate correlations have been found between the severity of CPTH disturbance of consciousness, following the head trauma, and positive findings at CT scan. Moreover the comparison of personality profiles (MMPI) of CPTH (n=26) with a post-traumatic control group, without headache (n=17) showed higher scores on hypocondriasis, depression, hysteria and schizophrenia scales only in the severe CPTH group. Age of the patients, duration of unconsciousness, neurological deficits, course length and pending litigation or compensations were unrelated to the occurrence and outcome of CPTH. These findings suggest the importance of both physical and psychological determinants (social or emotional maladjustment) in the pathogenesis of CPTH.",Journal of neurosurgical sciences,1983 Jul-Sep,Italy,1983,80

To explore these stereotypes, alcohol consumption patterns were compared in a survey of 298 Chinese, 295 Japanese and 280 Koreans in Los Angeles. Heavy drinking was found in each of the Asian groups. Gender specific logistic regression models were used to illustrate the differences in the drinking patterns of the Asian-American groups and to clarify the determinants of drinking. The greatest proportion of heavy drinking was found among the Japanese and the lowest among the Chinese. Having friends who drank was the only social factor consistently related to Asian drinking behavior.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1989 Jan,United States,1989,80
28564235,"BODY SIZE, SPERM COMPETITION, AND DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN MALE SAVANNA BABOONS.","One component of sexual selection is sperm competition. It has been reasoned that the intensity of sperm competition may be reflected in the relative testicular sizes of animals. Among males residing in multimale breeding systems, testicular size is relatively larger than among males residing in unimale mating systems. Information on whether differences in testicular size within a species can account for differences in male reproductive success is unavailable for natural populations of primates. A population of six troops of savanna baboons in Kenya was surveyed for morphometric analysis, and one of these troops was the subject of extensive behavioral observations afterwards. Testicular weights could not be obtained, but measurements of linear dimensions were transformed into volumetric estimates. Male weight accounted for 30% of the variance in testicular volume. Neither body size nor testicular volume was associated with differences in male reproductive activity. The outcome of fights over access to females could not be related to male body size, and ejaculatory patterns of males were independent of testicle size. Both sperm competition and aggressive competition intensified during the four-day optimum conception period, but fights over access to consort females were infrequent. Among savanna baboons, the probability of an ejaculation resulting in a conception is fairly low, which may account for the infrequency of injurious fights. Although testicle size influences sperm production, it does not influence either the timing of mating or the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa, and both of these factors probably account for a substantial fraction of the variance in male baboon paternity. Sperm competition is an adjunct to agonistic competition as a mechanism affecting male baboon reproductive success. It is concluded that male reproductive success in baboons is affected more by social factors than by morphological traits associated with size.",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,1989 Nov,United States,1989,80
3867226,Atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents. XII. Smoking behaviour and its determinants in 12-18-year-old subjects.,"The cross-sectional study of 1980 for atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents aimed at a wide coverage of the relevant relationships of the smoking behaviour to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. The initiation and establishment of the smoking habits were primarily viewed as a function of the youngsters' main socializing agents: the peer group and the family. A subpopulation comprising 1,790 children and adolescents aged 12, 15 and 18 years of the total sample was included in the study on smoking behaviour. The information on smoking habits was collected in connection with the medical examination in a solitary room where the youngsters could respond undisturbed. Data on the children's families were obtained by means of a general questionnaire filled out by the parents. The prevalence of daily smoking was 1% in the 12-year-old, 10% in the 15-year-old, and 30% in the 18-year-old subjects. The best friend's behaviour was the best predictor of an adolescent's smoking behaviour, although the family had retained its role as an important model as regards the learning of smoking behaviour. Quitting school turned out to be a major event leading to an increased risk of becoming a habitual smoker. No clear associations between socioeconomic status of the family and daily smoking were found, except that farmers' children had generally lower rates of daily smoking than children from other socioeconomic groups. First contacts with tobacco formed part of a normal behaviour pattern at a certain age, and this experimentation was unrelated to a later regular habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica.

Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed.

Height and weight data were obtained on all subjects. In addition, a questionnaire that is useful in assessing the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), was administered. Results of these tests were compared with those of normal female university students (N = 59), patients with anorexia nervosa (N = 68), and music students (N = 35). Anorexia nervosa and excessive dieting concerns were overrepresented in the dance and modelling students. Twelve cases (6.5%) of primary anorexia nervosa were detected in the dance group. All but one case developed the disorder while studying dance. Within the dance group those from the most competitive environments had the greatest frequency of anorexia nervosa. These data suggest that both pressures to be slim and achievement expectations are risk factors in the development of anorexia nervosa. The influence of socio-cultural determinants are discussed within the context of anorexia nervosa as a multidetermined disorder.",Psychological medicine,1980 Nov,England,1980,80
2773911,Wartime determinants of arteriographically confirmed coronary artery disease in Beirut.,"This study investigates the association of wartime stress variables and coronary artery disease as determined by coronary angiography in Lebanon in 1986, a country with an ongoing civil war for over a decade. A total of 127 patients who underwent coronary angiography at the American University of Beirut Medical Center were individually matched on age and sex with visitor controls free from any evidence of clinical coronary artery disease. Arteriographic cases (greater than or equal to 70% maximal stenosis) were compared with two control groups: arteriographic controls (entirely normal coronaries) and visitor controls. Findings suggest that there is a relation between exposure to both acute and chronic war events and coronary artery disease in this patient population. The reporting of exposure to acute war events was significantly higher in cases compared with both visitor controls (odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.17-4.90) and arteriographic controls (OR = 2.8, 95% Cl 0.93-8.47). Crossing the ""green-lines"" that separate two belligerent sides, considered as an attribute of war-related chronic stress, was more frequent in cases compared with visitor controls (OR = 3.25, 95% Cl 1.54-6.89) and arteriographic controls (OR = 5.38, 95% Cl 1.65-17.6). The relation observed between wartime stress and coronary artery disease could not be explained by possible overreporting of stressful events in patients with suspected coronary artery disease or by an increase in clinical awareness for the disease for those under continuous stress. Adjusting for the effect of the well-established coronary artery disease risk factors did not alter the above findings.",American journal of epidemiology,1989 Oct,United States,1989,80

Allocation to those groups appeared to be more likely to reflect constitutional levels of anxiety, rather than recent or current social stressors. Highly anxious mothers were distinguished on a number of presumed correlates of anxiety measured by clinical questions (e.g. terminating of anxious situations), hospital notes (e.g. mood problems noted by nursing staff) and blind rater assessments (e.g. unassertiveness). While highly anxious mothers were more likely to report more recent life events, less social support, and negative interpretations of the pregnancy, the hospital experience and the hospital staff, such variables were less discriminating when neuroticism levels were effectively controlled. This suggests an intrinsic perceptual bias, rather than that the factors were determinants. Highly anxious mothers had more delivery complications, while their babies were more likely to be dysmature and slow to suckle, features we interpret as consequences of the anxiety levels. In the postpartum period these mothers were more depressed, had more concerns about their baby, themselves and their marriage, and were less confident about coping and their parenting capacities. Such variables may be correlates or consequences of anxiety.",Psychological medicine,1986 Feb,England,1986,80
3527708,Structure and dynamics of human communication at the beginning of life.,"Although the beginning of postpartum social integration and communication has been long viewed as relevant to psychiatric theories, early parent-infant communication has become a matter of scientific investigation only recently. The present survey explains the significance of an approach based upon the general systems theory and explores to what extent the early parent-infant interaction can function as a didactic system to support the development of thought and speech. Evidence of this function has been found in those forms of parental behavior that escape the parent's conscious awareness and control, as exemplified in the vocal communication with presyllabic infants. Parents unknowingly adjust the structure and dynamics of speech to the constraints of infant capacities, detach prosodic musicality from lexical structure, and use it in particularly expressive forms for the delivery of the first prototypical messages. In this and other similar ways, parents offer an abundance of learning situations in which infants can try out various integrative operations. A biological rather than cultural provenience of the support of communicative development indicates a potential relevance for the interpretation of speech evolution.

2807934,Toward a model for improved targeting of aged at risk of institutionalization.,"A national sample of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized aged was created by merging the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey and its counterpart, the National Health Interview Survey for the same year. A weighted logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might be useful in calculating home- and community-based long-term care clients' risk of institutionalization. A model containing patient characteristics, nursing home bed supply, and a climate variable correctly classified 98.2 percent of cases residing in nursing homes or the community. Physical dependency, mental disorder and degenerative disease, lack of spouse, being white, poverty, old age, unoccupied nursing home beds, and climate all appear to be determinants of institutional residency among the aged.",Health services research,1989 Oct,United States,1989,80

Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,1986 Nov-Dec,United States,1986,80

6382590,Intelligence in schizophrenia: meta-analysis of the research.,"This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females.",Schizophrenia bulletin,1984,United States,1984,80

Information was obtained on the problems encountered by their dependant, the extent of their involvement, the amount of formal and informal support received, the subjective strain and burden reported, and their expectations of their ability to continue in the caring role. An attempt has been made to use this information to describe the extent of strain and some of the determinants of strain involved in caring. The results suggest that the sex of the dependant and the age of the supporter together with the number of problems faced all influence the reported level of strain. The amount of existing community support, whether formal or informal, does not seem to mitigate significantly the strain placed on the principal carers.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1984 Dec,England,1984,80
3966042,Determinants of mother-infant interaction in adolescent mothers.,"Mother-infant interactions of adolescent and nonadolescent mothers are compared, and the impact of maternal age, ego development, education, and child care support on these interactions is examined. Thirty primiparous, white, lower- to middle-class mothers (half less than or equal to 17 years) and their healthy full-term infants (8 months) were studied. Interactions were videotaped during face-to-face interactions and teaching sessions. Child care support and ego development were assessed. During face-to-face interactions, only one difference was found between adolescent and nonadolescent mothers: nonadolescent mothers showed more positive affect toward infants. During teaching, nonadolescent mothers talked more, showed more positive affect toward infants, and demonstrated tasks more often. Individual differences during face-to-face interactions were more related to mothers' ego development and support whereas teaching interactions were mostly associated with maternal age. Thus, maternal age was a stronger predictor of interactive style during teaching. This may partially explain noted cognitive deficits in infants of teenage mothers. However, individual differences among all mothers in ego development, education, and support were significantly related to interactions. Thus, teenage mothers with less education and support and lower ego development may represent a higher risk subgroup of adolescent mothers providing less optimal care-giving environments for their infants.",Pediatrics,1985 Jan,United States,1985,80

The analysis show that the treatment was seldom successful for persons with an accentuated addiction-like smoking behavior. There were no findings proving a correlation between personality pattern and/or sociodemographic data and treatment success.

2746717,Psychological and environmental determinants of relapse in crack cocaine smokers.,"The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations.",Journal of substance abuse treatment,1989,United States,1989,80

The number of categories important in determining retirement was greater for white men than for black men and increased with increase in economic level. Retirement was found to have few consequences, being important mainly with respect to health and economic matters. Blacks and poverty level men were minimally affected by retirement, the impact of retirement probably being somewhat ameliorated by age-determined income maintenance programs and subsidies. Men at the marginal economic level were affected most adversely.",Journal of gerontology,1985 Jan,United States,1985,80

The present review suggests using a social epidemiological approach in a third way; to promote efforts directed toward family-oriented primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is presented which shows an association between three family social factors (marital status, family socioeconomic status, family size) and risk for cardiovascular disease. The real determinants of risk, however, may be the underlying health-related behaviors indicated by each of these factors. Evidence is also presented which shows the importance of a fourth family social factor (family age) in promoting effective health education efforts to modify risk. Thus, a social epidemiological approach is more valuable than a single discipline-based approach in identifying, understanding, and modifying family social influences on cardiovascular risk.",Social science & medicine (1982),1989,England,1989,80

An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology.",American journal of psychoanalysis,1981 Spring,England,1981,80
4076484,Rural-urban mobility in Thailand: a decision-making approach.,"This paper has analyzed a theoretical model of mobility decision-making. The model relies entirely on individual-level factors rather than macro-level factors as determinants of migration decision-making. The individual-level variables included in the model are: recent mobility history, urban social contacts, information about urban areas, evaluations of different locations, migration plans, and actual movements in the period subsequent to an initial interview. The empirical results indicate that with some exceptions there are relatively strong links of the type suggested in the model among these variables. The model was evaluated separately for two groups of villages for movement to Bangkok and for movement to Northeast Thai towns. Thus, four submodels were estimated, providing an opportunity to observe how robust the model is with respect to varying destinations and origins. Although certain differences are found among the four submodels, the overwhelming feature is their similarity. Where differences do exist, they generally reflect differences in the effectiveness of prior mobility as a predictor of other variables in the process. Clearly, a villager's previous history of movement is a key factor affecting subsequent movement and the entire decision-making process. The primary effect of having friends and relatives in a particular urban center is to increase the amount of information a villager has about that urban center. Information has a significant effect on evaluations and plans. Except in one submodel, evaluations have a significant effect on plans; and the existence of plans--which to some extent represent a culmination of social contacts, information, and evaluations--is the only factor other than previous mobility which has a significant direct effect on subsequent movement. Thai policy makers are searching for ways to stimulate the growth of regional urban growth centers and reduce the growth of Bangkok. From the standpoint of intervention, a key variable in this process would appear to be information. Not only is information level related to evaluations of an urban area and mobility plans, but, compared to other variables in the model, it appears to be relatively amenable to modification by inputs deriving from a source external to the village itself. It appears difficult to modify evaluations or migration plans directly, though both could be indirectly influenced by informational inputs. Movement history would be difficult, if not impossible, to manipulate; while villagers could be sponsored for short trips to town, this is not likely to produce much long-range effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Demography,1985 Nov,United States,1985,80

The specific behaviour examined is physician visits over a 12 month period. We find that previous experience with illness and perceived health status are important variables with respect to illness behaviour and that the relevance of these variables and social support vary considerably by level of psychological distress. While the addition of psychological distress as an explanatory variable makes little contribution, the variation in the power of the model to explain variation in behaviour across levels of distress is substantial. Our findings argue strongly for increased awareness of the role of social and psychological factors in illness behaviour, particularly among those who plan and deliver health care services.",Social science & medicine (1982),1984,England,1984,80

At the same time, elements in the labor movement, which has traditionally focused almost exclusively on obtaining higher wages and greater benefits for union members, now seem to be directing their attention to issues of workplace democracy and worker control over the production process and company policies. The research reported here investigates the determinants of worker autonomy and of workers' desire for increased worker control over the workplace.

The author continues the analysis by describing the liberal practice of medicine in the context of the terms of trade in the market for health services and professionals, which lead them to become small-businessmen in their profession. Liberal medicine develops when the unrestricted supply and demand for goods and services reaches the point where production and consumption are determined by systematic trade in a free market, without the restrictions and ties of an outdated social order.

HTLV-III antibodies were present in 35 (53%) of the 66 subjects tested in June, 1982. 4 of the seronegative subjects had HTLV-III antibodies when re-tested one year later, a seroconversion rate of 1.2% per month. In the HTLV-III seropositive subjects, AIDS developed at a rate of 6.9% per year (minimum incidence of AIDS = 4.6% per year) and other clinical signs of immunodeficiency (lesser AIDS) at 13.1% per year. All 6 of the AIDS cases and at least 8 of the 10 lesser AIDS cases had detectable HTLV-III antibodies 1 week to 21 months before diagnosis. Of 24 other subjects with stable lymphadenopathy, 19 (79%) had or acquired HTLV-III antibodies. Lower helper T-cell counts were very closely related to HTLV-III seropositivity (r = -0.53, p = 0.0001), even in the 26 healthy subjects with no clinical abnormalities (r = -0.37, p = 0.07). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the lifestyle risk factors for HTLV-III seropositivity were large number of homosexual partners (p less than or equal to 0.03) and receptive anal intercourse (p less than or equal to 0.03), with an apparent synergistic interaction between these two activities (chi 2 = 8.71, p = 0.003). These data suggest that frequent receptive anal intercourse with many homosexual partners predisposes to HTLV-III infection with the consequent emergence of lymphadenopathy and the various manifestations of lesser and fully fledged AIDS.","Lancet (London, England)",1984 Sep 29,England,1984,80

In Experiment 1, neonatally androgenized females engaged in play soliciting at a level equal to that of male controls and greater than that of nonandrogenized female controls. In Experiment 2, males and females were reared in unisexual and bisexual groups in order to compare long-term sex-related social experience effects on juvenile play soliciting. Males exposed only to other young males engaged in greater play soliciting than males exposed to both sexes; females, in contrast, were unaffected by sex of cagemates. Within rearing conditions, however, males engaged in greater play soliciting than females. The combined results suggest that perinatal gonadal androgen exposure effects on social play are prepotent and contribute essentially to sex differences in the initiation of social play behavior.",Behavioral neuroscience,1986 Apr,United States,1986,80
6285155,"Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus in pregnant women: social factors, and immune competence as determinants of lymphoproliferative diseases-a hypothesis.","In normal pregnant women, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) frequently occurs. Cellular immune responses are apparently suppressed, but high titer EBV-specific antibodies of IgG class may compensate. The antibodies cross the placenta and protect the infant against primary infection for many months. Reactivation of EBV in pregnancy and oral excretion of virus by normal pregnant women could be one explanation why young children in large sibships (among families of low social classes) become infected early in life. Infants are likely infected by EBV from their pregnant mothers who shed virus in saliva. Moreover, the natural protection for several months in the perinatal period against Burkitt lymphoma and fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases in congenitally immune deficient children is explained. The maturity and immunocompetence of the immune system at the time of primary infection by EBV and the size of the sibship seem to determine whether infectious mononucleosis occurs.

Lack of available kin, the presence of large kin networks, having kin confidants, and being old, poor, and female, or black inhibited service awareness.",The Gerontologist,1989 Aug,United States,1989,80
7264477,The holistic health movement: a survey and critique.,"This article discusses the nature and significance of the holistic health movement in four ways. First, a general characterization of the movement is proposed, based on shared commitment to five assumptions: (1) a positive view of health as well-being, (2) individual responsibility for health, (3) the importance of health education, (4) control of social and environmental determinants of health, and (5) low technology of ""natural"" therapeutic techniques. Second, a basic difference among advocates of holistic health/medicine is proposed in terms of the presence or absence of commitment to scientific method. Third, holistic health/medicine is briefly compared with concepts of holism in biology and in the social sciences. Finally, criticisms of each of the basic tenets of the holistic health movement are offered.",The Journal of medicine and philosophy,1981 May,United States,1981,80

In this context the secular decline in birth rates is understood as a consequence of changes in the social structure as well as of diffusion of social norms."" It is noted that for the period after 1920, and especially after 1950, no ""determinants"" exist that can completely explain fluctuations in marriages and births. ""Hence, the central thesis of this article is the following: There is no stable pattern of family formation in a modern industrial society and the number of children is not directly linked to mortality conditions or economic constraints. Subsequently, the article develops several hypotheses concerning the significance of marriage and parenting in the late 20th century, and points out that ups and downs in marriages, divorces, and births may be seen in analogy to other fashion-like processes (such as consumer behavior or social behavior).""

3068840,"Determinants of reproductive change in a traditional society: evidence from Matlab, Bangladesh.","A decade has elapsed since a project was launched in Matlab, Bangladesh to test the hypothesis that contraceptive services can induce and sustain fertility decline in a rural traditional population. The demographic impact of this project has been pronounced, lending support to the view that supply-side policies can succeed even where institutional supports for demand are weak. This paper reviews the relationship between the Bangladesh climate of demand and the Matlab system of supply with the aim of explaining how such effects arise. A sociologically appropriate system of supply can induce fertility change in a society where such change would not spontaneously arise. The study of programs and the ""sociology of the supply side"" thus deserve the same degree of rigor accorded to research on the ""sociology of demand.""",Studies in family planning,1988 Nov-Dec,United States,1988,80
2650741,Perinatal mortality in Belgium.,"Perinatal mortality in Belgium remains high compared with other countries of Western Europe, although a marked decrease was observed during the period from 1956 to 1984. Analysis of the death causes indicates that further progress is feasible. Social inequalities and geographic variation are persisting in spite of the long-established policy of social welfare and free access to health services. Most of the studies on perinatal mortality in Belgium are descriptive and based on data recorded in birth and infant death certificates. In the future, alternative sources of information should be used to analyze more precisely and to understand more clearly the interactions between the different determinants of perinatal mortality and to evaluate the impact of social and health services.",Biology of the neonate,1989,Switzerland,1989,80
17093748,[Frequent consumers of emergency psychiatric services in metropolitan Montreal area.].,"This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting.",Sante mentale au Quebec,1982,Canada,1982,80
6382590,Intelligence in schizophrenia: meta-analysis of the research.,"This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females.",Schizophrenia bulletin,1984,United States,1984,80

""The analysis first compares cause-of-death-specific infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality between each of the four cause-of-death models. Next, interest shifts to an examination of the variability among decedents, specific to cause of death, in a range of background, proximate, and immediate determinants of infant health and survival. Variability is evident in cause-specific mortality rates as well as in decedent characteristics across the cause-of-death models.

7100991,Social psychological determinants of patient satisfaction: a test of five hypothesis.,"Five hypothesis regarding the social psychological determinants of patient satisfaction were tested among patients attending the primary care clinics of a university medical center in Manhatten. The social psychological variables operationalized here were expectations, values, entitlement and perceived occurrences; the three dimensions of satisfaction studied were doctor conduct, convenience and general satisfaction. The social psychological variables together were found to explain only a small proportion of the variance in satisfaction, although their contribution varied with the dimension of satisfaction. Expectations consistantly explained most of the variance in satisfaction ratings; particularly noteworthy was the direct effect of prior expectations of the doctor's conduct on subsequent satisfaction with that dimension of the care received. Values had little independent effect on satisfaction, and the combination of values and expectations (their interaction) was unrelated to satisfaction. Feelings of entitlement were also unrelated to satisfaction ratings. There was some support for the discrepancy model, which holds that the greater the discrepancy between perceived occurrences and prior expectations the less the satisfaction. The importance of carrying out further methodological studies aimed at developing reliable measures of these constructs is stressed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1982,England,1982,80
3966042,Determinants of mother-infant interaction in adolescent mothers.,"Mother-infant interactions of adolescent and nonadolescent mothers are compared, and the impact of maternal age, ego development, education, and child care support on these interactions is examined. Thirty primiparous, white, lower- to middle-class mothers (half less than or equal to 17 years) and their healthy full-term infants (8 months) were studied. Interactions were videotaped during face-to-face interactions and teaching sessions. Child care support and ego development were assessed. During face-to-face interactions, only one difference was found between adolescent and nonadolescent mothers: nonadolescent mothers showed more positive affect toward infants. During teaching, nonadolescent mothers talked more, showed more positive affect toward infants, and demonstrated tasks more often. Individual differences during face-to-face interactions were more related to mothers' ego development and support whereas teaching interactions were mostly associated with maternal age. Thus, maternal age was a stronger predictor of interactive style during teaching. This may partially explain noted cognitive deficits in infants of teenage mothers. However, individual differences among all mothers in ego development, education, and support were significantly related to interactions. Thus, teenage mothers with less education and support and lower ego development may represent a higher risk subgroup of adolescent mothers providing less optimal care-giving environments for their infants.",Pediatrics,1985 Jan,United States,1985,80
7202850,Canalization of arousal in the preweanling rat: effects of amphetamine on aggregation with surrogate stimuli.,"Preweanling rats, 15 days of age, were placed in an unfamiliar cage containing 1 of a variety of surrogate conspecific stimuli. The surrogate stimuli consisted of a rat-sized aluminum tube covered with soft fluffy synthetic fur, a tanned rat pelt, felt, and an aluminum sheet. The surrogate was either maintained at ambient temperature or heated to body surface temperature (37 degrees C). The 1st experiment revealed that both furriness (length and softness of fur) and temperature of the surrogate stimulus are important determinants of conspecific aggregation (huddling). The 2nd experiment demonstrated that preference for the soft, fluffy surrogate was not mediated by temperature conservation by showing that the same huddling behavior was obtained when ambient temperature was raised to thermoneutrality (33 degrees C). The final experiment demonstrated that amphetamine restricted the range of surrogate stimuli that elicited huddling in the preweanling rat. The finding that amphetamine produces a steeper generalization gradient of approach to surrogate stimuli further confirms our previous hypothesis that amphetamine canalizes arousal toward salient environmental stimuli. These findings have implications for the use of amphetamines to treat hyperkinetic children.",Developmental psychobiology,1981 Mar,United States,1981,80
31968900,Determinants of behavioral rhythmicity during artificial menstrual cycles in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta).,"Reproductive success in many mammals depends on synchrony between copulation and ovulation, which is insured by the phenomenon of heat in the female. Certain anthropoid primates including rhesus monkeys do not show heat but may copulate throughout the menstrual cycle, especially when pairs are isolated from conspecifics. In social groups, however, mating mostly occurs around midcycle. We wished to test the hypothesis that copulations are more closely linked to ovulation when males have simultaneous access to several females in different cycle phases. Artificial menstrual cycles were therefore induced by giving hormones to ovariectomized female rhesus monkeys observed in small social groups that each consisted of four females and one male. The cycles of two hormone-treated femlab in each group were either made to synchronize or be offset by 7-day increments so that the estradiol peak of one female occurred 7 days before, and 7 and 14 days after, the estradiol peak of the other. Radioimmunoassay of plasma samples (N = 224) confirmed the timing of the estradiol peaks. Results from eight unique male-female groups (4 males, 8 females, 16 male-female pairs, 718 tests) fully supported the hypothesis. Compared with synchronized cycles, the amplitudes of rhythmic changes in offset cycles were reduced for ejaculations made by males but greatly enhanced for ejaculations received by females. We propose that this socio-hormonal integration of behavior in the group is highly adaptive and enhances the reproductive success of both males and females.",American journal of primatology,1988,United States,1988,80

Among the total of 85 participants, 78% considered that their health was good, 29% met family members and 75% friends at least once weekly. Fifty patients (65%) felt stressed in their daily lives which was definitely higher than in the normal population. All of the participants had altered their sexual behaviour in a manner which reduced the risk of HIV-transmission but 18 (21%) had had sexual behaviour known to transmit HIV within the past year. This behaviour occurred more frequently in young persons (p = 0.09) and in smokers (p = 0.03). In addition, no connection could be demonstrated between a series of possible determinants for this, which may, however, be due to the limited extent of the material.

A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour.",The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,1989 Dec,England,1989,80

3395696,Congenital determinants of violence.,"Specialization--the predisposition to violent behavior persisting over an extended period of time--is considered in relation to congenital factors, to determine whether such factors are contributory to this predisposition. Congenital factors include inherited characteristics and perinatal experiences. Evidence for inherited characteristics in criminal behavior is approached through family studies, the study of twins, and adoption studies. Of those three, adoption studies provide the most fertile ground for study. Predisposition toward criminal behavior is noted to be limited to property crime. The second congenital factor is the perinatal experience. Minor physical anomalies appear to be strongly related to hyperactivity and later criminal involvement, but only if the offender was reared in an unstable, nonintact family. Indices of perinatal problems relate to later violent crime, rather than to property crime, and may have as their basis some form of trauma occurring very early in life.",The Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,1988,United States,1988,80

Seventy-seven percent maintained their pledges for 1 week but only 19% for 2 years. Successful resolvers reported employing significantly more stimulus control, reinforcement, and willpower than the unsuccessful over the 2 years; social support and interpersonal strategies failed to predict success before 6 months but did so thereafter. Counterconditioning and fading were retrospectively nominated as the most efficacious coping strategies; paucity of willpower and failure of stimulus control were reported as the most hindering to maintenance. Fifty-three percent of the successful group experienced at least one slip, and the mean number of slips over the 2-year interval was 14.

2471142,Determinants of the nurse-patient relationship revisited.,"Rather than speaking broadly about the determinants of the nurse-patient relationship, as I did in my book, in this article I have focused more narrowly on psychiatric mental health nurses and their patients. I cited, as the chief influence on the context of the relationship between the two, the psychological changes concomitant with the stellar transition from the Piscean to the Aquarian Age and the burdens these changes impose on the psyche of the individual. I talked a bit about the paradoxical nature of the psyche and how it relates to paradoxical psychotherapeutic approaches. I mentioned win, win negotiations as being skills necessary for coping in the Aquarian Age. I also mentioned that our own value system, although absolute for us, is not necessarily binding on the other unless it is mutually agreed upon beforehand. In addition, I spoke about the possibility of many theories and methods, each equally valid and workable in the solution of a particular problem. I said our approach to the patient will depend on our role conception as psychotherapist, our typology, and concomitant with that, our model of psychological processes and the theoretical framework in which it is couched. I have stated what I consider the four key points for all of us to be aware of in order to negotiate the new psychology. We need to differentiate between needs, wants, and entitlement: we are entitled to our needs, but we are ultimately responsible for their fulfillment (which does not necessarily mean that we have to fulfill them ourselves). We need to be aware of the two-pronged aspect of every bit of communication; i.e., the simultaneous factual and directional message contained in each, and yet the selectivity of the tuning in by the receiver. We also need to be aware that any communication can imply a message about the object discussed or about one's subjective relation to it, as well as the confusion and rage that can be caused by ambiguities and the misunderstanding of which of the two has been meant. We have to learn to live with the fact that all of us have one area of our personality that is reasonably well adapted and another one that is still young and needs all our (and others') help that it can get.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Perspectives in psychiatric care,1985,United States,1985,80

It was hypothesized that Person-Environment (P-E) congruence, as assessed by the Environmental Perception, Preference and Importance Scale (EPPIS), would be related to (1) sex integration/segregation makeup of the health related facility (HRF) living units, and (2) quantity of social interaction between staff and residents. Analysis of sex by unit sex-type interaction for 60 residents' Person-Environment (P-E) congruence scores revealed that elderly females on sex-integrated units reported a higher level of P-E congruence than those residing on female-only units; males on sex-integrated units, in contrast, reported a poorer level of P-E congruence than males on sex -segregated units. Furthermore, behavioral observations of staff-resident verbal interactions confirmed the hypothesis that residents living on units with high staff-resident interaction perceived the environments more congruent with their preferences than residents on units low in verbal interaction. The observed relationships between the P-E congruence measure, resident-staff interaction, and unit sex-type were taken as further support for the relevance and value of the EPPIS measure as a tool for assessing and improving the institutional milieu.",Experimental aging research,1981 Winter,United States,1981,80
3608944,Seeking medical care for a breast cancer symptom: determinants of intentions to engage in prompt or delay behavior.,"This study examined the cognitive structures underlying women's intentions to delay or not delay seeking medical care for a breast cancer symptom. Middle-aged women imagined that they had just discovered a particular change in their breast, and they completed a questionnaire that assessed variables specified by Ajzen and Fishbein's theory of reasoned action with respect to two alternative courses of action: immediately calling the doctor (i.e., prompt behavior) and monitoring the breast change on one's own (i.e., delay behavior). Also assessed were variables external to the theory that were drawn from previous research on cancer delay. Results showed that intentions to delay were positively associated with having favorable attitudes toward delay and with perceived social pressure to delay; the attitudinal factor, however, was more influential than the social factor in determining intentions. Underlying favorable attitudes toward delay were beliefs that delay would be likely to result in maintaining control over and avoiding the disruption of one's own and others' lives but would be unlikely to result in negative health outcomes. No external variable was found to contribute to intentions to delay above and beyond attitudinal and normative considerations.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1987,United States,1987,80

An experimental population of Clethrionomys rufocanus consisting of laboratory-raised individuals with known origin and life history was introduced to a realistic competitive situation in the field. Successful females could be distinguished from nonsuccessful females on the basis of four individual attributes measured 25 d after they were released on the study plot, whereas males could not. The most consistent determinant of competitive success seemed to be the sex ratio of the litters in which females were born. Successful females originated from litters with a strongly female-biased sex ratio.

3628634,Vulnerability to life events exposure.,A theoretical model designed to assess the contribution of systematic factors contributing to vulnerability to life-events exposure is described. This model is applied to six-year longitudinal data on life events exposure for a sample of New Zealand women with school-aged children. The fitted model suggests that in the region of 30% of the variance in life-event reports over the six-year period was attributable to a common vulnerability factor. Modelling of this vulnerability factor suggested that two major determinants of vulnerability to life events were the level of social disadvantage of the woman and her level of neuroticism: women of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and women with high neuroticism scores showed a consistent tendency to report high life-event exposure during the six-year period. The implications of these findings are discussed.,Psychological medicine,1987 Aug,England,1987,80

7418140,The epidemiology of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The Lipid Research Clinics Program Prevalence Study. Summary.,"Correlates of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were studied in 4756 white males and females ages 20-59 years examined during a population survey conducted by 10 North American Lipid Research Clinics. Multivariable analysis was used to assess the relation of social, demographic, physical and behavioral characteristics for HDL cholesterol in each of the study populations and in subgroups defined by sex, age and gonadal hormone use. Characteristics associated with higher HDL cholesterol concentrations were a lean body habitus, not smoking, consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol, physical activity or exercise, membership in a high educational stratum, increased age and low dietary consumption of sucrose and starch. Each of these characteristics was examined in detail in its relation to HDL cholesterol concentrations in the respective chapters in this monograph; the purpose of the study reported here was to summarize the findings. When all variables were considered simultaneously in the analysis, body mass, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were the attributes most strongly and consistently associated with HDL cholesterol concentrations in the populations examined.

2489986,Determinants of contraceptive use dynamics: research needs on decision and choice.,"Because of the importance of contraceptive behaviour in most societies today a better understanding is needed of the social and behavioural factors affecting contraceptive decisions and choices of individuals and couples. This paper examines the need for longitudinal, theoretically-based studies of contraceptive use dynamics, including the timing, duration and interaction of reproductive events which may be more important than contraceptive technology in the social, cultural and economic context of fertility control. New research methods and appropriate analysis of data are relevant. Consideration of the social context is essential for the formulation and implementation of effective policies relating to the provision of contraceptive services.",Journal of biosocial science.

4095592,The stress concept as a problem for a 'theoretical pathology'.,"Theoretical pathology' is defined as the conceptual foundation of medicine. Research in this area is concerned with the analysis of explicit and implicit patterns of thought dominating research and practice. Using the example of the stress concept, it is suggested that it is a 'key word' with denotative and connotative meanings accessible to professional and laymen, contributing to explore the 'gray zone' between 'health' and 'disease' by linking psychological, social and biological determinants of 'well-being' and 'discomfort'. Examples of current research illustrate possible expansions of medical theorization.",Social science & medicine (1982),1985,England,1985,80

Data were also gathered concerning age, family size, birth order, socioeconomic status, race, and school grade. Results were subjected to a multivariate analysis and showed support for a multidimensional model of locus of control.

3762472,Body size of young Australians aged five to 16 years.,"In 1983-1984, 4578 Perth primary and secondary schoolchildren were studied. The selected sample was broadly representative of the ethnic groups that make up the Perth population and of the different social ranks within that population. The age, sex, weight, height, country of birth of the child and the parents, and occupation of the father were recorded for each subject. Weight, height and body mass index (BMI) increased with age. Age and sex were the most important determinants of body size. However, children of lower social rank and those with a southern European background were over-represented among the overweight children (greater than the 90th centile for BMI), particularly in adolescence. Children with an Asian background who were 11 years of age and younger were over-represented among the underweight children (less than or equal to the 10th centile for BMI). Results from this study indicate a continuing, though small (1.5 cm to 1.6 cm), secular increase in height over the past 13 to 14 years.",The Medical journal of Australia,1986 Oct 20,Australia,1986,80
25195529,Old age in sociocultural context: China and the United States.,"With the increasing interest in comparative studies of the elderly, China has become the focus of research attention. This society, which has been inaccessible to most Western researchers, offers a special site for studies of aging because of its sheer size as a world power, its relationship to Third World countries, and its population problem-a growing segment of elderly people. Available data from a variety of social science sources are utilized to compare how the sociocultural context of China and the United States impact differentially upon the older population in each society. Three major determinants specify the theoretical context: economic development (the level of production an economic system achieves); traditional cultural patterns (norms, roles, relationships); and the social control mechanisms (regulatory processes based upon the legal and sanctioning systems). These determinants provide a theoretical orientation for analyzing the outcome variables involved in the behavior and adaptation of the old. In American society, cultural norms and values are advantageous for active older persons in good health, particularly those with a favorable economic situation. In contemporary Chinese society, which blends traditional customs with the values of a revolutionary and changing society, there are advantages for the frail elderly.",Journal of aging studies,1987 Summer,England,1987,80
6667732,Second pregnancies among teenage mothers.,"An analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) finds that 82 percent of sexually active teenage mothers were using contraceptives in the year following the birth of their first child; the majority of those who practiced contraception used the pill. The proportion of black teenagers using no method of birth control was higher than that for white teenagers, and it increased over the course of the year. Rates of nonuse were particularly high among black women younger than 18, only 68 percent of whom practiced contraception (compared with 85 percent of whites the same age). Examination of the data by marital status shows that women who married while they were pregnant were the most likely to practice contraception in the year following their first birth, while those who were single at the time of first birth were the least likely to do so (89 versus 74 percent). Blacks constituted the majority of women who were not married at the time of first birth, and of all marital subgroups, single blacks had the highest rate of nonuse (29 percent). The probability of a pregnancy during the year following a first birth for all teenage mothers was 17 percent. Pregnancy rates among women with incomes less than 150 percent of poverty level were nearly twice as high as rates among women who had incomes above that level--21 percent vs. 11 percent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Family planning perspectives,1983 Nov-Dec,United States,1983,80

2707492,Alarm call responsivity of mallard ducklings: VIII. Interaction between developmental history and behavioral context.,"Mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) inhibit their vocal behavior upon hearing the maternal alarm call of their species. The present study assesses the interaction of the ducklings' experiential history with the environment in which they are tested. If ducklings are reared and tested to the alarm call in small social groups, they respond by dramatically inhibiting their vocalizations. If, however, socially reared ducklings are tested to the alarm call individually in an open field, responsiveness drops precipitously. In addition, individually reared ducklings respond at a far greater level to the alarm call when tested individually, not in groups. Thus, there is an interaction between the rearing history and the testing environment such that the same rearing history leads to different behavioral outcomes depending on the context in which the ducklings are observed. This demonstrates the importance of behavioral context, in addition to developmental history, as one of the determinants of behavior.",Developmental psychobiology,1989 Apr,United States,1989,80
10287174,Health policy and mental health.,"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Health promotion (Oxford, England)",1987,England,1987,80

Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes.

Results clearly indicated that naysaying and acquiescence occur more frequently among lower IQ individuals and naysaying occurs more frequently concerning prohibited behavior, whereas respondents acquiesce regarding desirable behavior. These results suggest that intellectual limitations predispose people to biased responding, whereas social desirability factors determine the type of bias.",American journal of mental deficiency,1982 Jul,United States,1982,80
6382590,Intelligence in schizophrenia: meta-analysis of the research.,"This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females.",Schizophrenia bulletin,1984,United States,1984,80
3434396,Influence of sex and gender roles on high school status systems.,"Past research has indicated significant sex differences in determinants of male and female high school students' status as measured by how subjects would like to have been remembered from their high school years. In order to determine if remembrance preference is sex or gender role related, 671 subjects were administered the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) and a questionnaire asking if they most wanted to be remembered from high school as a brilliant student, leader in activities, athletic star or most popular. Using both the median split and t-ratio procedures in scoring the BSRI, 206 subjects were selected because they were sex-typed (masculine males, feminine females), cross sex-typed (masculine females, feminine males), or androgynous (scoring high on both masculine and feminine traits). To find a model of best fit, the data were subjected to a log-linear analysis. The variables included were sex, gender role, and remembrance preference. Rather than sex being the influential factor, the model of best fit was a gender role by remembrance preference interaction. If subjects were masculine, they were more likely to choose athletic star than were feminine or androgynous subjects. Most popular and leader in activities were both more likely to be chosen by feminine and androgynous subjects. All groups chose brilliant student more often than any other category. It was concluded that some previously designated sex differences may instead be differences in gender role. Further research should address the distinction between the two.",Adolescence,1987 Winter,United States,1987,80
2661131,"Coronary heart disease: interplay between changing concepts of aetiology, risk distribution, and social strategies for prevention.","Epidemic diseases move in grand cycles, accompanying changes in culture, social organization, and environment. Coronary heart disease (CHD), a mass disease of twentieth century industrialized society, has a predominantly environmental aetiology. Although the major biomedical risk factors appear to have been identified over the past 40 years of epidemiological research, we are not certain why CHD is now on the wane in most Western nations. In Australia, CHD death rates have, since 1968, declined much more in professional and white-collar men than in blue-collar men. Any substantial reduction in CHD rates will require a generalized population shift towards a lower CHD risk profile. Numerically, the greatest gains should come from reducing the CHD risk of the bulk of the population, who are currently at medium risk of CHD. Notions of risk need, in the first instance, to be based on up-to-date knowledge of biomedical risk factors and mechanisms in order to develop optimal intervention strategies. A population-based strategy can be achieved via community education and structural modification of the social environment. The latter approach will require public health research into broader questions of the social-environmental influences on population cardiovascular health: for example, research into the social, political, and economic determinants of national food and nutrition policies; and into the various environmental (including workplace) changes that will facilitate risk-lowering behaviour. Hopefully, intervention strategies in such areas, set within a community development context, will be developed within the incipient National Program for Better Health.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Community health studies,1989,Australia,1989,80
2797981,Genetic and environmental determinants of growth in Mexican-Americans.,"Height and weight data from the Mexican-American portion of the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) are shown for children of ages 2 to 17 years and compared with data for non-Hispanic white children from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference curves. Differences in stature between the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the reference populations were minor prior to adolescence and could be entirely attributed to the greater poverty of Mexican-Americans. However, differences increased during adolescence (ie, median stature was less than the 25th percentile of the NCHS reference population at 17 years of age) and, in contrast with earlier ages, were independent of poverty. Similar growth patterns were observed in samples of upper-class subjects from Mexico and Guatemala. Nonetheless, the extent to which the short stature of Mexican-American adolescents is genetic is unclear because there is an apparent time trend toward greater stature in the Mexican-American population. In conclusion, the NCHS reference curves are appropriate growth standards for preadolescent Mexican-American children. Whether they are valid for Mexican-American adolescents remains unclear.",Pediatrics,1989 Nov,United States,1989,80

2746717,Psychological and environmental determinants of relapse in crack cocaine smokers.,"The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations.",Journal of substance abuse treatment,1989,United States,1989,80

The variables examined in relation to 'preference for institutional care' were those previously examined in relation to supporters' psychological well-being (Gilhooly, 1984). The results indicate that factors within the relationship between supporter and the dependent dementing relative are important determinants of motivation to continue giving support. Other variables significantly associated with advocacy of institutional care included the age of the supporter, supporter's contacts with friends, satisfaction with help from relatives, another dependent relative, and whether or not the supporter was employed. Help from the services and supporters' well-being were not significantly correlated with ratings of preference for institutional care.",The British journal of medical psychology,1986 Jun,England,1986,80

7282978,Anality: a theory of erotism and characterology.,"The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology.",American journal of psychoanalysis,1981 Spring,England,1981,80
10301136,Planning and management for health in periods of economic stringency and instability: a contingency approach.,"The mid-1970s marked the end of the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in history, and initiated in Europe--and other parts of the world--a period of economic stagnation and instability. Along with the prosperity explosion of the past, the pattern of health problems has changed and is still changing. Moreover, the demand for health care has kept on rising, without much improvement of health status in general. Thus, there is a critical need to rethink policies, and to ensure that future changes occur within the limits of shrinking resources and the allotted time-span. In particular, the change in priorities envisaged by the Health for All 2000 (HFA 2000) strategies will need to take place against the background of an ageing population, social instability, and continuing development of new lifestyles and persistent economic scarcity. It is by analysing that background that this article seeks to make recommendations as to how health planning and management might successfully cope with the policy reorientation of the HFA 2000 strategy. The structure of this article is as follows. Firstly, the changes taking place in planning conditions will be reviewed, and form the basis of a framework for subsequent analysis of the planning environment. Following this framework, some of the conflicts likely to be faced in planning and management will be discussed, many of which are the consequence of economic stringency and instability. Also the requirements for an improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of planning will be identified. Finally, a limited number of approaches to planning will be considered, for their appropriateness to the present-day economic circumstances. The point of view elucidated throughout is that there is no single solution which is 'best' under all circumstances. The conclusion, rather, is that the selection of particular theory or method of planning and management should depend both on the objectives of the decision maker and on the determinants of the planning environment. General prescriptions should not be made. At the same time, some elements have to be stressed in all types of planning, namely: the orientation towards outcomes or outputs of problems; the attention to long-term strategic thinking; and, the application of more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic approaches.",The International journal of health planning and management,1986 Apr-Jun,England,1986,80
7183557,Age and anomia in middle and later life: a multivariate analysis of a national sample of white men.,"Some social gerontologists have argued that the aged status in America results in distrust of and despair with the social order (anomia) independent of other determinants: lack of access to the means of achievement of life goals and social isolation. This argument was tested with a multivariate regression analysis utilizing data on 354 white men aged forty and older from the 1974 General Social Survey. The Srole anomia scale was used as the dependent variable. Multiple indicators of life chances and social participation were used; health and verbal intelligence were employed as controls. The results showed no relationship between age or other indicators of life chances and anomia, net of education and/or verbal intelligence. Prior studies reporting that age and anomia are causally related probably have done so due to lack of adequate control variables and/or due to cohort effects from the lesser education of the older population in the United States. Compared when employing appropriate controls, aged American males are not more anomic than middle-aged males.",International journal of aging & human development,1982-1983,United States,1982,80
7202850,Canalization of arousal in the preweanling rat: effects of amphetamine on aggregation with surrogate stimuli.,"Preweanling rats, 15 days of age, were placed in an unfamiliar cage containing 1 of a variety of surrogate conspecific stimuli. The surrogate stimuli consisted of a rat-sized aluminum tube covered with soft fluffy synthetic fur, a tanned rat pelt, felt, and an aluminum sheet. The surrogate was either maintained at ambient temperature or heated to body surface temperature (37 degrees C). The 1st experiment revealed that both furriness (length and softness of fur) and temperature of the surrogate stimulus are important determinants of conspecific aggregation (huddling). The 2nd experiment demonstrated that preference for the soft, fluffy surrogate was not mediated by temperature conservation by showing that the same huddling behavior was obtained when ambient temperature was raised to thermoneutrality (33 degrees C). The final experiment demonstrated that amphetamine restricted the range of surrogate stimuli that elicited huddling in the preweanling rat. The finding that amphetamine produces a steeper generalization gradient of approach to surrogate stimuli further confirms our previous hypothesis that amphetamine canalizes arousal toward salient environmental stimuli. These findings have implications for the use of amphetamines to treat hyperkinetic children.",Developmental psychobiology,1981 Mar,United States,1981,80
17093748,[Frequent consumers of emergency psychiatric services in metropolitan Montreal area.].,"This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting.",Sante mentale au Quebec,1982,Canada,1982,80

Fifty adult hypertensive patients at a health maintenance organization completed questionnaires and participated in home interviews over a 10-week period. Knowledge of medical regimens, information communication between the patient and the medical professionals, satisfaction with health-care providers, health locus of control, social support, and treatment disruption to life-style were assessed. Adherence was assessed through self-report and behavioral (i.e., pill-count ratio, percentage of kept medical appointments) indices. Finally, repeated blood-pressure measurements were obtained. Structural modeling procedures revealed that greater expectancy for internal control over health and hypertension, greater knowledge of the treatment regimen, and stronger social support were significant determinants of adherence; in turn, higher levels of adherence facilitated blood-pressure reduction.",Journal of behavioral medicine,1987 Aug,United States,1987,80

These records contained all theoretically relevant factors as well as demographic data. Analysis included the computation of odds ratios for foster care for each of 250 variables. A maximum likelihood logistic regression model was constructed to obtain the independent and cumulative contribution of each factor. Some expected variables such as parental stress factors (substance abuse) and types of abuse (burns and scalds) placed a child at a significant risk for placement in foster care (p less than 0.01). However, less obvious factors such as referral source (law enforcement agencies) or geographic area also placed children at risk. Overall, the model explained little of the variance of these decisions (R2 = 0.168) and poorly predicted placement (sensitivity 66.3 per cent, specificity 74.6 per cent). Using existing data, we were unable to adequately describe the decision process in selecting foster care.",American journal of public health,1981 Jul,United States,1981,80

Emotional distress, self-reported symptoms, avoidance behaviour, overprotection, pessimism and a diminished sexual activity were frequent, indicating a poor adaptation. These disturbances were apparent two months after the MI and remained stable. Psychological factors were stronger determinants of maladjustment than smoking, angina pectoris and recorded somatic illness. Neither severity of the infarction nor social and demographic factors determined maladjustment. Intervention must take place early and be directed to psychological factors as well as to the cardiac condition.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1984,England,1984,80

10281815,The changing structure of the health care delivery system in the United States.,"The historical equilibrium of the health care industry has been disturbed by recent and radical changes in both the financing of medical services and the structure of the industry. The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments. Because competition eliminates cross-subsidies, access to care, especially by the poor, is certain to become more precarious.",The Journal of medical practice management : MPM,1985 Jul,United States,1985,80

3384599,Determinants of emergency room visits for psychological problems in a general hospital.,"Determinants of emergency room visits for psychological reasons were studied prospectively for a four month period in an Indian General Hospital. Psychiatric emergencies constituted only 2% of all emergency visits. Most of the patients were new except for 7.4% who were already registered with the outpatient services of the psychiatry department. Males outnumbered females in a ratio of 2:1. Self-referrals constituted 77% of the samples; 21% of patients were brought by police. Two-thirds of the patients were brought owing to the severity of their clinical condition and the rest, one-third, for medico-legal and social reasons. Approximately 80% of the patients sought consultation within one month of the onset of illness episode. First episode of mental illness was within last one year of the emergency room visit in 60% patients. Past history of hospitalization for mental illness was obtained only in 10% of cases. The pattern suggested that there was no misuse of emergency services by psychiatric patients although 20% of the patients presented with social problems only which required social rather than psychiatric intervention.",The International journal of social psychiatry,1988 Spring,England,1988,80

Using a longitudinal data set from adult residents in Rhode Island, univariate, chi square, and logit analyses indicate associations between sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly and their mobility behavior. Mobility for assistance reasons is associated with older age, unmarried status, higher previous mobility, and renter status. Mobility in preparation for aging (e.g., to an elderly complex) is more likely for unmarried, previously mobile residents. Out-of-state mobility to amenity destinations is not limited to the elderly, but younger, married, more affluent elderly were more likely to make such moves.""",Economic geography,1985 Jan,United States,1985,80
3481909,The definition and classification of mental retardation.,"Problems with current definitions of mental retardation were recognized. Classification systems based on the behavioral capabilities of retarded persons were criticized since there are so many noncognitive determinants of performance. It was proposed that mental retardation be defined solely by IQ scores at least 2 SDs below the population mean. This suggestion was predicated on the view that the behavioral sciences currently have no better way to assess intellectual functioning. Etiology was seen as such a significant predictor of group differences that the organic, familial, and undifferentiated categories would be used in classification. Social adaptation and expected performance were seen as correlates of class membership rather than defining features of retardation, since they have no reliable method of measurement. Problems of labeling were discussed, but the practice was deemed useful if it leads to beneficial services and interventions.",Upsala journal of medical sciences. Supplement,1987,Sweden,1987,80

3754503,Determinants of social proximity in Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica): male behavior.,"Following opportunity to copulate with a female housed in an adjacent compartment, male Japanese quail spent 64% of their time near a window that provided visual access to the female (Experiment 1). This social proximity behavior persisted for at least 2 weeks of continual exposure to the window despite lack of further physical access to the female (Experiment 2) and was evident at all daylight hours (Experiment 3). Female Japanese quail stimulated more proximity behavior in male conspecifics than did other male Japanese quail or birds of other species (Experiments 4 and 5). However, many characteristics of the female quail were not critical. The female quail did not have to be previous sexual partners, familiar, sexually experienced, or reproductively competent to stimulate proximity behavior in males (Experiments 4 and 5). Experiment 6 demonstrated that the social proximity behavior was primarily a response to the visual aspects of the females. The results are discussed in relation to mate-guarding and surveillance behavior, and implications of the data for sexual classical conditioning of male Japanese quail are noted.","Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983)",1986 Mar,United States,1986,80

The Adjective Checklist provided a number of personality and cognitive-style variables. Two independent samples were assessed, a group of 54 undergraduate psychology students and a group of 39 mechanical engineering students. Subjects were classified as predominantly right-, left-, or bidirectional movers. Discriminant analyses significantly separated these groups in terms of checklist scales. Accuracy of classification was 51.9% in the psychology sample and 89.7% in the engineering sample.

2723595,Visit frequency for essential hypertension: observed associations.,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval.

2589474,"Nutritional determinants of high-altitude growth in Nunoa, Peru.","Data on nutritional intake and patterns of physical growth in the rural Andean community of Nunoa, Peru (elevation 4,000 m), are described and compared to data previously collected from this location. Food consumption data and selected anthropometric measures were obtained from a sample of 33 households. Estimates of caloric intake from this study are very similar to those obtained in Nunoa during the mid- and late 1960s. However, within the present sample, upper income (i.e., middle class) individuals have significantly higher caloric intakes than those of the lower income group and also appear to have an improved diet relative to individuals of 20 years ago. Anthropometric data show that children of the upper socioeconomic status (SES) group are significantly taller and heavier than the lower SES group children. Moreover, the children of the wealthier families are taller and heavier than the children measured 20 years ago at the same location, whereas the poorer children are not. These results indicate that nutritional factors have significantly contributed to the extreme pattern of slow growth previously reported for children of Nunoa and, moreover, demonstrate how social and environmental forces interact to create differential levels of stress that contribute to variation in biological well-being.",American journal of physical anthropology,1989 Nov,United States,1989,80
28466762,Determinants of mortality transition in developing countries before and after the Second World War: Some evidence from Cuba.,"Few studies provide an insight into what factors contributed to declines in the mortality rates of developing countries before the Second World War. In this paper, statistics on causes of death from Cuba, particularly Havana, are used to investigate what may have been some of the principal determinants of mortality decline in the developing world before the arrival of modern drugs and insecticides. Trends in cause-specific mortality are examined in the light of Cuba's social, economic, medical and public health history. The Cuban experience strongly suggests that in this country public health and sanitary reforms and nutritional improvements were largely responsible for initial declines in mortality throughout the first half of the twentieth century. One important finding is that the impact of these reforms and improved nutrition was greatly influenced by prevailing economic conditions. Periods of economic prosperity facilitated declines in mortality; but in times of adversity, the reverse occurred. It appears that during prosperous periods the maintenance and expansion of public health and sanitary facilities were made possible by increased public and private revenues, and that individuals had access to a more abundant diet. The severe economic crisis of the Great Depression had the opposite effect. With the appearance of sulphonamides in the late 1930s, antibiotics, and residual insecticides and other specific measures at the end of the Second World War, the relevance of economic conditions as a determinant of mortality decline diminished. Although this analysis points to the aforementioned trends, the Cuban experience also suggests that other factors enter into the process of declining mortality and that this phenomenon can only be explained as the result of the complex interplay of many forces.",Population studies,1981 Nov 1,England,1981,80
7259481,[Determinants of success in the treatment of smokers with the Hermano therapy (author's transl)].,"In 1973, 532 persons desiring to quit smoking and seeking the Hermano therapy of chirothesia were questioned prior to the ritual treatment session. Typical smoking behavior, social background, and personality tests were documented. At intervals of 4 months, 1 year, and 5 years after treatment the group was examined with a follow-up questionnaire. In two earlier studies Gmur evaluated the results of this treatment after 1 year and analyzed in detail the various factors which influence these results. The present paper investigates the determinations for success with a follow-up study 5 years after treatment. The analysis show that the treatment was seldom successful for persons with an accentuated addiction-like smoking behavior. There were no findings proving a correlation between personality pattern and/or sociodemographic data and treatment success. No criteria was found to suggest indications for the successful application of the Hermano therapy.",Archiv fur Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten,1981,Germany,1981,80
3723341,Observer judgments of acute pain: facial action determinants.,"We provided a microanalytic description of facial reactions to a series of painful and nonpainful electric shocks and examined the impact of these as discrete facial cues for observer judgments of acute pain. Thirty female volunteers were videotaped and reported their discomfort in response to electric shocks after earlier exposure to one of three social influence conditions: a tolerant model, an intolerant model, or neutral peer presence. We coded the videotapes for facial activity using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978b), and peer judges rated them for painful discomfort. Subjects exposed to a tolerant model reported no more discomfort than did subjects exposed to an intolerant model, despite receiving more intense levels of shock, but were judged by observers to be in more pain. Analyses of facial activity yielded consistent findings: Tolerant-model subjects, though reporting discomfort equivalent to that reported in other groups, displayed more pain-related facial activity (brow lowering, narrowing of the eye aperture from below, raising the upper lip, and blinking). There was a substantial direct relation between observer judgments of distress and discrete, pain-related facial actions (mean multiple R = .74 for the various shock levels rated). These data indicate that nonverbal expression yields information about the response to noxious stimulation that is non-redundant with self-report.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1986 Jun,United States,1986,80

Data from 115 sexually active women were analyzed using latent-variable structural equation models. Twenty-one variables are used to represent seven latent constructs: Parent Sexual Attitudes, Sexual Latency, Sexual Behavior, Dating Competence, Social Assertiveness, Subjective Masturbatory Responsiveness, and Subjective Coital Responsiveness. Two specific theories are tested with these constructs. Each theory predicts a different structural arrangement among these latent factors with the fundamental difference being whether behavior predicts responsiveness or vice-versa.

6544459,Dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status in the adult Danish population.,"The purpose of the present investigation was to study dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status in the adult Danish population. The study group comprised 5151 persons (86.7% of the original sample) who were interviewed in order to determine living conditions. Questions on dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status were included. 61% of the adult Danish population in the age group 20-69 had regular dental visits. Dental visit habits varied according to urbanization, age, sex and social group. Among well off persons 85% had regular dental visits as opposed to only 40% in the disadvantaged social group. Well off persons and persons with regular dental visits more often claimed good dental health than persons in the disadvantaged social group and among the non-regular visitors. In the higher social group 13% reported to have removable dentures in contrast to 51% in the disadvantaged social group. To isolate determinants of dental visits a multiple dummy-regression analysis was performed. Nearly 50% of the variation in dental visit habits was explained by the variables: urbanization, sex, age, perceived dental health status, education, work in exhausting jobs, income, social background and perceived psychological problems. Efforts to bring a greater part of the adult population in Denmark in contact with the dental health service system should consider these findings.",Scandinavian journal of primary health care,1984 Nov,United States,1984,80
4034814,Interpersonal behavior and therapeutic progress: therapists and clients rate themselves and each other.,"To measure the extent to which progress in psychotherapy can be predicted from the interpersonal styles of therapists and clients, 42 outpatients and their 11 therapists rated themselves and each other on Benjamin's Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) scales. In addition, therapists rated amount of client change and therapy success-failure, based on the outcome section of the Rogers and Dymond (1954) scale, and clients used the Strupp, Fox, and Lessler (1969) questionnaire to evaluate progress-to-date. Clients also completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) at the start of therapy and after they had completed at least 6 treatment sessions. Canonical analyses indicated that when optimally weighted, SASB scores can predict at least 65% of the reported progress variance, lending credence to claims that ""reflexive social behavior"" and ""the relationship"" are important determinants of certain aspects of therapeutic outcome. Consistent with previous literature, clients reported more satisfaction with therapy when they perceived their therapists as ""warm and freeing,"" but such perceptions were not systematically related to reported symptom reduction. Unfavorable self-concept ratings by therapists and therapist ratings of clients as ""helping or protecting,"" which suggest role reversal, were negatively associated with symptom amelioration.",Psychiatry,1985 Aug,United States,1985,80

Study population was a two-stage cluster sample of 5312 men and women, aged 25-64 (response 79.4%). Measurement instruments were interviews and a self-administered questionnaire. Type A was measured by the Framingham Type A behavior scale. In multiple logistic regression analyses. Type A behavior among men was studied as a function of various occupational positions [blue-collar, white-collar, civil (public) servants, self-employed], controlling for age, educational level, marital status, and interaction effects. In those analyses it was found that the occupational position 'self-employed' was the best predictor of Type A behavior (odds ratio 3.0 compared to blue-collar employees). Since most of the employed women were white-collar employees (a very homogeneous group) Type A behavior among women was studied as a function of full-time and part-time employment, with the same control variables as were included in the analyses for men. Taking into account the statistical significant interaction effect age by employment, it could be shown that the odds of being Type A for a 50 yr old woman was 3.5 compared to a housewife at the same age. In summary the findings show strong relationships between work situation and Type A behavior for both men and women. Especially the self-employed men have more Type A behavior patterns, so may have higher CHD risk.",Social science & medicine (1982),1989,England,1989,80

Ninety-five domestic chicks were reared in either a social environment or physical (tactile) isolation, and half in each rearing condition were reared and/or tested under conditions of visual restriction. As expected, social rearing was prerequisite to the manifestation of extended death feigning; however, the incidence and duration of death-feigning was attenuated by functional visual isolation of socially reared chicks during either rearing or testing.

Patients indicated which of 31 reasons for drug use were associated with various drugs. Four components emerged from this analysis, labeled Insight-Seeking, Therapeutic Needs, Sentience, and Pleasure-Seeking. Higher order factor analysis revealed the presence of a general factor, labeled General Sensation-Seeking. Multiple regression procedures were used to relate the derived dimensions to actual drug use behavior. The significant relationships observed among the factor analytic patterns in predicting overall drug involvement were shown to lead to increased explanation concerning interrelationships among personality needs and social resources. The findings suggested a number of hypotheses pertaining to increased understanding of motivational patterns underlying initiation and continuation of illicit drug use.",The International journal of the addictions,1981 Feb,United States,1981,80

A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour.",The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,1989 Dec,England,1989,80

3068840,"Determinants of reproductive change in a traditional society: evidence from Matlab, Bangladesh.","A decade has elapsed since a project was launched in Matlab, Bangladesh to test the hypothesis that contraceptive services can induce and sustain fertility decline in a rural traditional population. The demographic impact of this project has been pronounced, lending support to the view that supply-side policies can succeed even where institutional supports for demand are weak. This paper reviews the relationship between the Bangladesh climate of demand and the Matlab system of supply with the aim of explaining how such effects arise. A sociologically appropriate system of supply can induce fertility change in a society where such change would not spontaneously arise. The study of programs and the ""sociology of the supply side"" thus deserve the same degree of rigor accorded to research on the ""sociology of demand.""",Studies in family planning,1988 Nov-Dec,United States,1988,80

This study analyzes data relevant to both the individual and his or her environment from a large (N = 2265) national sample of low- and middle-income elderly. A recursive causal model is presented; the results indicate that perceived health and housing satisfaction contribute the most to well-being among the elderly. In addition, for men and women home ownership was not found to affect well-being positively. For men who owned their own homes lower scores on well-being were reported. The findings also indicate that while the quantity of neighbor interaction benefits the well-being of men, women benefit more from the positive sentiments of sociability in the neighborhood. This study emphasizes the importance of environmental satisfaction and neighborhood sociability as key determinants of well-being in later life.",International journal of aging & human development,1983-1984,United States,1983,80
28564235,"BODY SIZE, SPERM COMPETITION, AND DETERMINANTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN MALE SAVANNA BABOONS.","One component of sexual selection is sperm competition. It has been reasoned that the intensity of sperm competition may be reflected in the relative testicular sizes of animals. Among males residing in multimale breeding systems, testicular size is relatively larger than among males residing in unimale mating systems. Information on whether differences in testicular size within a species can account for differences in male reproductive success is unavailable for natural populations of primates. A population of six troops of savanna baboons in Kenya was surveyed for morphometric analysis, and one of these troops was the subject of extensive behavioral observations afterwards. Testicular weights could not be obtained, but measurements of linear dimensions were transformed into volumetric estimates. Male weight accounted for 30% of the variance in testicular volume. Neither body size nor testicular volume was associated with differences in male reproductive activity. The outcome of fights over access to females could not be related to male body size, and ejaculatory patterns of males were independent of testicle size. Both sperm competition and aggressive competition intensified during the four-day optimum conception period, but fights over access to consort females were infrequent. Among savanna baboons, the probability of an ejaculation resulting in a conception is fairly low, which may account for the infrequency of injurious fights. Although testicle size influences sperm production, it does not influence either the timing of mating or the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa, and both of these factors probably account for a substantial fraction of the variance in male baboon paternity. Sperm competition is an adjunct to agonistic competition as a mechanism affecting male baboon reproductive success. It is concluded that male reproductive success in baboons is affected more by social factors than by morphological traits associated with size.",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,1989 Nov,United States,1989,80
10287174,Health policy and mental health.,"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Health promotion (Oxford, England)",1987,England,1987,80
7419352,"Human food selection: why do we know so little, and what can we do about it?","Most of the 'variance' in human food selection can be attributed to culture and individual experience. It is argued that while rigorous research on biological determinants of food selection is very valuable, we must also invest heavily in more exploratory, social science oriented studies. Only in this way can we approach most of the major determinants of food choice. We must recognize that food selection is multidetermined and context dependent. At this early stage of scientific development in this field, we must be willing to consider tradeoffs between rigor or quantification and promising preliminary and qualitative studies.",International journal of obesity,1980,England,1980,80
3646999,Some determinants of stress in psychiatric nurses.,"This paper reports the results of an empirical study of psychological stress in nurses employed in a large Special Hospital and caring for mentally disturbed patients who may be a danger to themselves or to others. Such an environment would appear to be dangerous and stressful and the findings of this study show that this sample of nurses do indeed report relatively high levels of stress when compared to some other employed samples. Relationships between psychological distress, anxiety and depression and aspects of their jobs, such as job demands, supports and constraints, are discussed. Individual differences in experiences of stress are also considered.",International journal of nursing studies,1987,England,1987,80

For this sample of 1,224 persons aged 60 years or older, having nonkin advisers, membership in clubs, or contacts with other community agencies and availability of transportation, education, and moderate-size kin networks predicted service awareness. Lack of available kin, the presence of large kin networks, having kin confidants, and being old, poor, and female, or black inhibited service awareness.",The Gerontologist,1989 Aug,United States,1989,80
10281815,The changing structure of the health care delivery system in the United States.,"The historical equilibrium of the health care industry has been disturbed by recent and radical changes in both the financing of medical services and the structure of the industry. The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments. Because competition eliminates cross-subsidies, access to care, especially by the poor, is certain to become more precarious.",The Journal of medical practice management : MPM,1985 Jul,United States,1985,80
7145506,Moral reasoning and decisions in dilemmas of neonatal care.,"The relationship between levels of moral reasoning and decisions in dilemmas of neonatal care was investigated in a sample of 452 pediatricians. Subjects included residents, faculty members, and practitioners recruited from a variety of university-affiliated and community hospitals. It was hypothesized that physicians whose moral reasoning was more fully developed would less actively treat particular cases. Such cases might include those where a patient's family requested such a limit (designated ""negative family attitude"") or the quality of life likely to be led after therapy was so low as to preclude even a minimal degree of human activity or social interaction (designated ""unsalvageable prognosis""). The hypothesis was tested through the use of two questionnaires. The first questionnaire, devised by Crane, assessed the physician's reported degree of activism in treating six cases of infants born with severe defects. The structure of moral reasoning was measured by a second questionnaire, Rest's Defining Issue Test. Subjects were scored by the degree to which they use universal, ethical principles in resolving a series of moral dilemmas. Results of the absolute level of activism (Table 1) showed that among both residents and postresidents, the degree to which cases are actively treated depends, for salvageable patients, on the type of damage and on the possibility for research. Results involving moral reasoning showed a different pattern among residents and postresidents. Among residents, a significant correlation exists between principled reasoning and the absence of active treatment (r = - 0.41, Form A; r = - 0.23, Form B). As predicted, such correlations were strongest for cases of negative family attitude or of unsalvageable prognosis. The pattern of correlations among postresidents showed either no relationship to moral reasoning or the reverse of the residency pattern (r = -0.08, Form A; r = 0.30, Form B). The influence of the type of institution a resident operates within was assessed by analysis of variance. Inasmuch as moral reasoning and institutional type both had significant main effects (Form A), their magnitude differed. Institutional type accounted for 43% of the variation in mean activism scores whereas moral reasoning accounted for only 4%; however, because one could, a priori, expect institutional norms and customs to be powerful determinants of behavior, any additional, identifiable influence deserves attention. The structure of individuals' moral reasoning seems to be such an influence.",Pediatric research,1982 Oct,United States,1982,80
3791024,Long-term hospitalization of failure-to-thrive infants: developmental outcome at three years.,"The present study documented later developmental outcome in a group of 29 failure-to-thrive (FTT) infants who received extended hospitalization in infancy as an intervention for their growth failure. All infants were seen at approximately 3 years of age and were given standardized assessments of intellectual and physical development. A standard interview documented demographic variables, health problems, placements subsequent to hospitalization and additional psychological and medical treatment. Infants were divided into three groups dependent on medical and treatment factors. Means and percentages of occurrence of outcome variables were compared through either one-way ANOVAS or single sample chi-square tests with post hoc analyses. Correlational analyses were used to understand the relationships between outcome and relevant demographic, medical, and treatment variables. In general, the infants manifest persistent intellectual delays at follow-up despite maintenance of weight gains achieved during early hospitalization. More than half the group suffered from chronic health problems. A large percentage of infants had been removed from parental custody at the time of follow-up. Several demographic, medical, and treatment factors bore moderate relationships to developmental outcome. Infants who achieved more optimal growth tended to be full-term at birth, later born and without a question of physical abuse in their social histories. Intellectual functioning was related only to parental and caretaker socioeconomic status. Infants placed in foster care were unlikely to return to their families of origin. The findings suggest the need for further investigation into the determinants and outcome of extended hospitalization as a treatment for FTT.",Child abuse & neglect,1986,England,1986,80

3297402,Environmental and psychosocial determinants of sudden death.,"The risk factors for sudden coronary heart disease (CHD) death have been well described. Sudden CHD deaths should be classified as those occurring in individuals with and those in individuals without a prior history of clinical heart disease. The extent of coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac arrhythmias are the primary pathophysiologic determinants of ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Psychosocial factors influence the threshold of response to the numerous physical and social environmental stimuli that can precipitate sudden death. The degree of pathology is probably inversely related to the intensity of the stimuli necessary to precipitate sudden CHD death. In the presence of extensive disease the precipitants of sudden deaths are probably ubiquitous in the environment and unlikely to be prevented. Thus, prevention of the basic cardiac disease is of higher priority.",Circulation,1987 Jul,United States,1987,80
3420484,Determinants and consequences of alcohol abuse and cigarette consumption in Mamre.,"The extent, determinants and consequences of cigarette consumption and alcohol abuse in Mamre are investigated in this article. Among both males and females smoking rates were found to be higher in the 25-44-year-old group than in the 45-64-year group. Males smoked more than females. In the 25-44-year age group a relationship between employment status and smoking as well as between level of education and smoking was established. Odds ratios for smoking of 1,78 for males and 2,42 for females were found in the 25-44-year age group, while odds ratios in the unemployed group were 1,81 for males and 1,79 for females. Alcohol was reported to be a problem in 32.0% of households of which the head was an unskilled manual worker, compared with 9.1% of households of which the head was a professional or a white-collar worker. A positive association was found between alcohol being a problem in the household and the presence of a disabled person in the house, independent of employment status (odds ratio 1,8, 95% confidence interval 1,2-2,5). Respondents who viewed their health as satisfactory or bad were more likely than those with good or excellent health to come from households where alcohol was reported as a problem (odds ratio 1,9, 95% confidence interval 1,4-2,5).",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,1988 Oct 1,South Africa,1988,80
2892348,Increased activity of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase in myotonic dystrophy.,"The activity of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) and its determinants were studied in 17 patients with myotonic dystrophy. The gamma-GT activity was elevated in 11 patients and its mean value was five-fold higher than in healthy controls. The increase in gamma-GT could not be explained by factors generally known to result in a misleading elevation of gamma-GT. Most patients with elevated gamma-GT also had one or more other pathological laboratory tests related to hepatic function but none had a clinically significant liver disease. Serum gamma-GT activity was not related to the disability caused by dystrophy or to the level of serum creatine kinase suggesting that the elevation of serum gamma-GT is not an indication of a general cell membrane dysfunction. It is concluded that the increase in serum gamma-GT activity in patients with myotonic dystrophy is due to a real but mild liver involvement, which should be taken into account in the examination of these patients who often complain of gastrointestinal symptoms.",Acta medica Scandinavica,1987,Sweden,1987,80

Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines. Although many factors influenced tenure decisions, the achievement criteria were identified by members of all disciplines as the most important determinants during tenure review.",Nursing research,1989 Mar-Apr,United States,1989,80

These results are consistent with recent findings that the skill level of immigrants arriving within the last two decades is lower relative to that of immigrants arriving earlier.

2614331,Single mothers: their health and health service use.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate differences in reported health and health service use in single mothers. DESIGN: The study was a survey of data derived from the General Household Surveys conducted by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS). SETTING: The OPCS data are derived from samples of households throughout Great Britain. PARTICIPANTS: OPCS data for 1983 and 1984 were used, comprising approximately 60,000 individuals, of whom 793 were single mothers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five different health outcomes were examined, two on perceived morbidity and three on the use of health services. The chief determinants of health and health services use among single mothers were housing tenure, employment status and the age of the youngest child. Single mother status did not consistently contribute to self reported morbidity and uptake of care when adjusted for other social variables, but there was a difference between categories of single mother, with those who were separated/divorced and those who were widowed reporting more acute illness than those who were married. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that single mothers do not form a homogeneous group and that, if special consideration is to be given to them when planning and allocating health service resources, this needs to be taken into account in the context of other socioeconomic factors.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1989 Dec,England,1989,80
31968907,"Demography, ranging patterns, and activity budgets of black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus chamek) in the Manu National Park, Peru.","Results of a long-term field study on the ecology and social organization of two groups of black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus chamek) in Peru are reported. Demography, ranging patterns, and activity budgets provide insight into some of the proximate determinants of fission-fusion social organization in this species and illustrate the different strategies used by males and females to gain access to critical resources. Longitudinal data on known individuals provide evidence for male natal philopatry and female emigration at sexual maturity in this population. Interbirth intervals are long (mean = 34.5 months) in comparison with most other primate species, and 5 of 15 infants seen within a few days of birth died or disappeared before they were a year old. Home ranges are large (150-250 ha) and fairly discrete; overlap with neighboring groups is on the order of 10-15%. Males and females differed substantially in their ranging patterns; females, particularly those with infants, restricted much of their ranging to a ""core area"" 20-33% the size of the total group range, whereas males ranged more evenly over the entire area occupied by the group. Daily path length varied over almost an order of magnitude from 465 m to 4,070 m, with a mean of 1977 m. Males spent more time traveling and less time feeding than most females. These results are compared with those obtained in previous studies of Ateles and with similar data from other primate species to assess their implications for the evolution of fission-fusion sociality in spider monkeys. The ecological factors responsible for the evolution of very similar social organizations in spider monkeys and chimpanzees are discussed.",American journal of primatology,1988,United States,1988,80

The variables examined in relation to 'preference for institutional care' were those previously examined in relation to supporters' psychological well-being (Gilhooly, 1984). The results indicate that factors within the relationship between supporter and the dependent dementing relative are important determinants of motivation to continue giving support. Other variables significantly associated with advocacy of institutional care included the age of the supporter, supporter's contacts with friends, satisfaction with help from relatives, another dependent relative, and whether or not the supporter was employed. Help from the services and supporters' well-being were not significantly correlated with ratings of preference for institutional care.",The British journal of medical psychology,1986 Jun,England,1986,80

A review of empirical biographical studies is presented, which emphasize a conceptualization of behavior in older age at the interaction of past experience, current situation, and future time perspective of the individual. As an example it is discussed how the mother experiences and reacts to her last child's leaving home (""empty-nest-reaction""). An analysis of the data of the BLSA (1965-1977) demonstrated many patterns of change. It could be shown that there exists consistency as well as variability in personality variables. It could be shown that the biographical and social context was closely related to these interindividual differences in consistency and change. Conditions are multidimensional rather than uniform. This high degree of interindividual variability of change calls for a differential gerontology.",Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie,1980 Sep-Oct,Germany,1980,80

3559184,The effect of social support and the work environment upon burnout among nurses.,"Burnout among hospital-based nurses appears to be a serious problem affecting the delivery of health care. Findings from previous empirical research indicate that burnout among these nurses results from reactions to adversities inherent in the hospital work environment, and that burnout can lead nurses to change jobs and/or abandon the practice of nursing. This paper presents and discusses research findings on the effects of various aspects of the hospital work environment on burnout among nurses, and, in addition, evaluates the effects of social support in reducing and/or mitigating the relationship between negative aspects of the work environment and burnout. A multiple regression approach is employed to test the hypothesized model. The data were collected from a sample of nurses (n = 310) employed at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center (FAMC), Aurora, Colorado. The major determinants of burnout were found to be low job enhancement (autonomy, task orientation, clarity, innovation, and physical comfort); work pressure; and lack of supervisor support, along with the interaction term involving the combined effects of job enhancement and supervisor support. These predictors, in conjunction with demographic and job-related variables explained 53% of the variance in emotional exhaustion, a central component of the burnout syndrome.",Journal of human stress,1986 Spring,United States,1986,80

Food consumption data and selected anthropometric measures were obtained from a sample of 33 households. Estimates of caloric intake from this study are very similar to those obtained in Nunoa during the mid- and late 1960s. However, within the present sample, upper income (i.e., middle class) individuals have significantly higher caloric intakes than those of the lower income group and also appear to have an improved diet relative to individuals of 20 years ago. Anthropometric data show that children of the upper socioeconomic status (SES) group are significantly taller and heavier than the lower SES group children. Moreover, the children of the wealthier families are taller and heavier than the children measured 20 years ago at the same location, whereas the poorer children are not. These results indicate that nutritional factors have significantly contributed to the extreme pattern of slow growth previously reported for children of Nunoa and, moreover, demonstrate how social and environmental forces interact to create differential levels of stress that contribute to variation in biological well-being.",American journal of physical anthropology,1989 Nov,United States,1989,80

7326949,When rational men fall sick: an inquiry into some assumptions made by medical anthropologists.,"Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points.","Culture, medicine and psychiatry",1981 Dec,Netherlands,1981,80

The strongest correlates were self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in the ability to exercise in specific situations), perceived barriers to exercise, modeling, dietary habits, support from friends, and age. Smoking was inversely associated with exercise in men only.

3232413,The global impact of noncommunicable diseases: estimates and projections.,"With the aging of populations in developing countries there is both a demographic and an epidemiological transition which affects the impact of chronic degenerative diseases on the health status of the populations. Demographic transition takes place in countries where there are effective programmes of disease control which allow for survival during the early years of childhood and adolescence. This results in an increase in life expectancy which places larger proportions of the population in the age range (60 years and older) in which chronic degenerative diseases become the major determinants of health status. Epidemiological transition in diseases may also be brought about by shifts in social and economic patterns which favour detrimental changes in risk factors for the chronic degenerative diseases. Such changes may include health-related behaviour which augments dietary consumption of fats and alcohol, increases obesity, increases smoking and decreases physical activity. Such changes in risk-factor levels increase the prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases which manifest themselves at later ages, and for which early preventive actions could be cost-effective. In order to illustrate the impact of both demographic and risk-factor effects, analyses are made of the impact of increases in life expectancy on cause-specific mortality in both developing and developed countries. It is shown that there is great similarity in the effect of major noncommunicable diseases on the life expectancy of adults in both developed and developing countries. The major differences are seen to be in the proportions of deaths expected from such diseases as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cirrhosis; but not in the distribution of age at death which is the better measure of disease impact. Demographic analyses, computing indirect estimates of mortality, also demonstrate that there are currently more chronic disease deaths in developing than developed countries and that as expectation of life increases in developing countries the global chronic disease burden will be greatly concentrated in the developing countries. Analyses of risk-factor reduction by feasible intervention strategies, e.g. smoking cessation campaigns, treatment of high blood pressure, using relationships between risk factors and diseases established in longitudinal studies carried out in developed countries, point out that the effect of risk-factor control in long-living populations can be hidden by the dependency of risk factors and various related causes of death, e.g. smoking has an impact on lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease and emphysema, but at different ages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",World health statistics quarterly.

12282631,Population structure.,"This paper reviews recent new trends in population structure in the world and its major regions in order to access the determinants of those trends and explore issues regarding the recent and projected changes in the age structure of population and the relationships of those changes to social and economic development. In particular, the paper compares the change in age structure projected by the Population Division of the UN Secretariat in its most recent 3 series--namely, those completed in 1984, 1986, and 1988. By and large, the most recent UN assessment projects that a larger proportion of the world population will be aged 60 and over in 2000 and 2025 than was previously estimated. Those changes in projections can be observed for the world and for the more developed countries as a whole, and for the regions of Africa, Latin America, Northern America, East Asia, Europe, and Oceania. While the recommendations of the International Conference on Population called attention to the importance of changes in population structure, this paper recommends urgent government action in planning social programs for the aged because of the greater eminence of population aging in many settings. The case of Japan is used to illustrate the growing importance of increases in life expectancy as a determinant of age structure changes (in relation to fertility decline), a point that is reinforced through a cruder decomposition of UN estimates and projections for several European countries.",Population bulletin of the United Nations,1989,United States,1989,80
6106945,Economic aspects of village health.,"Given the poor quantity and quality of medical care in most villages in the developing countries, the economic determinants of village health are the supply of labour, the cash flow associated with that labour and the availability of land. The paper examines these in the three classical 'time periods', arguing that inability to meet labour peaks is of great significance in explaining seasonal shortage of food and chronic shortage of cash. It also explains community indifference to upkeep of social overhead capital. Substitution of capital goods for labour is socially differentiated, not least by labour availability, and leads inevitably to a regressive distribution of land and the creation or enlargement of a class of landless labourers. Under certain limited conditions this class may enjoy a rising real income with associated health-promotive expenditures. The more normal case, however, is extreme poverty, whether rural or urban, with all that that implies for the undermining of health. Land reform therefore becomes a necessary precondition of health promotion.","Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences",1980 Jul 28,England,1980,80
3453175,Psychosocial determinants of breast self-examination.,"To explore the psychosocial determinants of breast self-examination (BSE) among women, we studied a stratified random sample of 264 women students, faculty, and staff in a university community. The dependent variable of the study was self-reported frequency of BSE, and predictors included measures of general health predispositions, variables of the Health Belief Model, the impact of a woman's social network, a set of secondary non-health-related barriers and benefits, and the woman's evaluation of her personal health care system. Analysis of the data showed strong relationships between most of the predictor variables and BSE. Regression analysis showed that variables measuring a woman's recent experience in the health care system were stronger predictors of BSE practice than intrapersonal ""health belief"" variables. However, the independent variables included in the regression accounted for almost 35 percent of the total variance in BSE practice.",American journal of preventive medicine,1986 May-Jun,Netherlands,1986,80
3384599,Determinants of emergency room visits for psychological problems in a general hospital.,"Determinants of emergency room visits for psychological reasons were studied prospectively for a four month period in an Indian General Hospital. Psychiatric emergencies constituted only 2% of all emergency visits. Most of the patients were new except for 7.4% who were already registered with the outpatient services of the psychiatry department. Males outnumbered females in a ratio of 2:1. Self-referrals constituted 77% of the samples; 21% of patients were brought by police. Two-thirds of the patients were brought owing to the severity of their clinical condition and the rest, one-third, for medico-legal and social reasons. Approximately 80% of the patients sought consultation within one month of the onset of illness episode. First episode of mental illness was within last one year of the emergency room visit in 60% patients. Past history of hospitalization for mental illness was obtained only in 10% of cases. The pattern suggested that there was no misuse of emergency services by psychiatric patients although 20% of the patients presented with social problems only which required social rather than psychiatric intervention.",The International journal of social psychiatry,1988 Spring,England,1988,80
2738317,Personal and environmental determinants of activity involvement among elderly residents of congregate facilities.,"This study examined the personal and environmental factors related to the activity involvement of older people living in congregate residential settings. A sample of 1,428 residents in 42 such settings provided information about their activities, functioning, and background. Measures of facility features were also available. These data show that individuals are more likely to participate in facility-organized activities in settings where overall resident participation is greater, the average functioning of residents is lower, staffing is higher, and the program more structured. Participation in facility activities is not related to personal characteristics. In contrast, involvement in resident-initiated activities, both in the facility and in the community, is related to personal characteristics (being functionally intact, female, and better educated) and to facility features (larger size, lower staffing, greater autonomy and cohesiveness). The impact of some features varies depending on the functional capacity of the individual resident.",Journal of gerontology,1989 Jul,United States,1989,80
6474230,Illness behaviour: an exploration of determinants.,"The paper examines role of social support, structural-environmental and perceptual variables in explaining variation in illness behaviour in a sample of 240 adults with impaired hearing. The specific behaviour examined is physician visits over a 12 month period. We find that previous experience with illness and perceived health status are important variables with respect to illness behaviour and that the relevance of these variables and social support vary considerably by level of psychological distress. While the addition of psychological distress as an explanatory variable makes little contribution, the variation in the power of the model to explain variation in behaviour across levels of distress is substantial. Our findings argue strongly for increased awareness of the role of social and psychological factors in illness behaviour, particularly among those who plan and deliver health care services.",Social science & medicine (1982),1984,England,1984,80
6542479,Agonistic and reproductive interactions in Betta splendens.,"Reproductive and agonistic behaviors in Siamese fighting fish were investigated in eight experiments, and some consequences and determinants of these sequences were isolated. First, fights and the formation of dominance-subordinancy relations were studied. Second, it was determined that large body size as well as males' prior residency in a tank produced an agonistic advantage; the magnitude of this advantage was positively related to the duration of residency. Third, the prior-residency effect in Bettas was determined by males' familiarity with visual and/or tactile cues in their home tanks. Fourth, dominant males had greater access to living space and were more likely to display at a mirror, build nests, and approach females than were subordinates. Finally, it was discovered that chemical cues associated with presumedly inert plastic tank dividers influence Bettas' social behavior.","Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983)",1984 Dec,United States,1984,80
2928145,Tenure and the university reward structure.,"Reward allocation in selected American universities was investigated using tenure receipt as the most valuable faculty reward. Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines. Although many factors influenced tenure decisions, the achievement criteria were identified by members of all disciplines as the most important determinants during tenure review.",Nursing research,1989 Mar-Apr,United States,1989,80

Two studies are reported in this paper--the first concerns the determinants of economic values in a population of 16-17 year old British schoolchildren, and the second concerns economic preferences and knowledge in a larger group of slightly older adolescents. By-and-large the pattern of results is not dissimilar from other studies done on older children.

2692802,Health promotion in perspective.,"Our emphasis in the past has been on disease prevention rather than health promotion. This emphasis served us reasonably well when morbidity was high throughout society and when interventions at the community level were able to achieve massive reductions. It is not faring as well now that the major shared environmental determinants of disease have been controlled. The present situation calls for changes in individual health-related behaviour and individual clinical interventions to achieve comparable progress. As difficult to win as collective commitments to community-level interventions have been, compliance in a free society by often unmotivated persons in numerous individual instances of decision making in daily life is even more difficult. Health promotion offers the promise of a quantum leap in improving the health status of the community by participating in behaviour perceived as not only responsible but appropriate and desirable, providing positive reinforcement rather than anxiety-provoking caution. Favourable social trends, such as physical conditioning and dietary changes may be encouraged through media interventions. There are biological limitations to this approach, however. Many healthful practices confer little benefit on large groups of people and a few may be harmful to selected groups. Vigorous promotion of weight reduction and obesity control, for example, may lead to profound dissatisfaction with body image and to severely self-destructive behaviour among those prone to eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, and obsessive eating. Health promotion activities may fit well with social trends but their adverse potential can be aggravated because failure to comply can be penalized by peer disapproval in a way that disease prevention strategies usually are not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1989 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1989,80
7143281,Adjustment to life after stroke with special reference to sexual intercourse and leisure.,"Changes in frequency of sexual intercourse and of leisure activities were related to degree of physical impairment and levels of dependence in primary and secondary ADL in 110 subjects with one stroke. About 75% of the subjects reduced their frequency or ceased having intercourse and active leisure. While changes in frequency of intercourse were temporally independent, changes in leisure activities were less pronounced for subjects examined later than 12 months after the stroke than for those investigated earlier. For intercourse, primarily ADL-dependence and impaired cutaneous sensibility were major negative determinants. Moreover, subjects with previously known arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus had changed relatively less than those without these ailments, probably due to pre-stroke reductions. It is suggested that the marked changes in sexual and leisure activities are accomplished by unsuccessful coping with the vascular catastrophe and its sequelae. Aspects of coping problems, primarily the disease-related, but also those of intra- and inter-personal nature are discussed.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1982,England,1982,80
6512513,Curiosity and demographic factors as determinants of children's probability-learning strategies.,"Children's curiosity, gender, activity level, and socioeconomic status (SES) were related to their performance on a partially reinforced discrimination-learning task. The 38 boys and 37 girls were in the first grade and were all white. Three factors of curiosity (manipulatory, conceptual, and about the complex) were assessed. Performance on the learning task was scored for the number of correct responses (maximizing) and for the frequency of three-step sequences reflecting variability, systematic patterning, and perseveration. In general, the three curiosity factors related negatively to maximizing and perseveration and positively to variability. (The same effects were found for activity level.) Systematic patterning related positively to one curiosity type and negatively to another. Girls used less maximizing and more systematic patterning than boys. The response choices of girls were affected more by differences in conceptual curiosity and those of boys by differences in curiosity about the complex. Activity level was unrelated to gender but differed with SES. The findings demonstrate the role of different curiosity factors in shaping response sequences and suggest some reasons for children's choice of probability-learning strategies.",The Journal of genetic psychology,1984 Sep,United States,1984,80

Univariate analyses showed that for 525 men aged 45-64 y and free from cardiovascular diseases, indicators of body fatness were inversely related to the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, smoking, and coffee consumption. Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects. In lean people this association may be explained by a thermogenic effect of smoking.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1988 Apr,United States,1988,80

This is so despite the study population's high prevalence of respiratory disease and long history of exposure to crocidolite asbestos dust. This anomalous finding is explored in terms of some problems with studies generating normal values. In particular, the confounding effect of social class status on ethnic determinants of lung function is considered. Low 'normal' values for Blacks reported from South Africa and elsewhere are examined. The disadvantages to workers of being evaluated in relation to low norms are discussed in terms of preventive medicine and workmen's compensation.

Eleven independent variables pertaining to demographic and environmental characteristics were initially related to the frequency and topography of residents' maladaptive behavior. Multiple regression analysis revealed that maladaptive behaviors were related to sex, social age, chronological age, resident's time spent on outside activities, number of residents per direct-care staff member, presence of sensory handicaps, and ambulation. Results were related to existing literature and discussed in terms of their use for intervention efforts and differential assignment of resources.",American journal of mental deficiency,1986 Jul,United States,1986,80

Use of social drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and the oral contraceptive varied considerably within the sample, being appreciably greater in White subjects. 3. Paracetamol clearance was 21% slower in Asians than in Whites and half-life 18% longer. The total range of clearance was 1.86--6.78 ml min-1 kg-1. 4. Clearance was slower in women than in men, increased with increasing alcohol intake and cigarett consumption, and was more rapid in those women using the oral contraceptive. The effects of alcohol and the oral contraceptive were also found in White subjects alone. 5 The variables found to correlate independently with paracetamol clearance accounted for only 27% of the total sample variance, however, and are unlikely to be the major determinants of paracetamol elimination in man.",British journal of clinical pharmacology,1980 Jul,England,1980,80

4034814,Interpersonal behavior and therapeutic progress: therapists and clients rate themselves and each other.,"To measure the extent to which progress in psychotherapy can be predicted from the interpersonal styles of therapists and clients, 42 outpatients and their 11 therapists rated themselves and each other on Benjamin's Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) scales. In addition, therapists rated amount of client change and therapy success-failure, based on the outcome section of the Rogers and Dymond (1954) scale, and clients used the Strupp, Fox, and Lessler (1969) questionnaire to evaluate progress-to-date. Clients also completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) at the start of therapy and after they had completed at least 6 treatment sessions. Canonical analyses indicated that when optimally weighted, SASB scores can predict at least 65% of the reported progress variance, lending credence to claims that ""reflexive social behavior"" and ""the relationship"" are important determinants of certain aspects of therapeutic outcome. Consistent with previous literature, clients reported more satisfaction with therapy when they perceived their therapists as ""warm and freeing,"" but such perceptions were not systematically related to reported symptom reduction. Unfavorable self-concept ratings by therapists and therapist ratings of clients as ""helping or protecting,"" which suggest role reversal, were negatively associated with symptom amelioration.",Psychiatry,1985 Aug,United States,1985,80
3964428,Social play soliciting by male and female juvenile rats: effects of neonatal androgenization and sex of cagemates.,"Male and female juvenile rats were individually exposed to nonplayful juvenile social stimuli in a novel test of play-soliciting behavior to examine hormonal and experiential determinants of sex differences. In Experiment 1, neonatally androgenized females engaged in play soliciting at a level equal to that of male controls and greater than that of nonandrogenized female controls. In Experiment 2, males and females were reared in unisexual and bisexual groups in order to compare long-term sex-related social experience effects on juvenile play soliciting. Males exposed only to other young males engaged in greater play soliciting than males exposed to both sexes; females, in contrast, were unaffected by sex of cagemates. Within rearing conditions, however, males engaged in greater play soliciting than females. The combined results suggest that perinatal gonadal androgen exposure effects on social play are prepotent and contribute essentially to sex differences in the initiation of social play behavior.",Behavioral neuroscience,1986 Apr,United States,1986,80
6802782,Evaluation of personal health services as a basis for health planning. A review with applications for Israel.,"Health care systems throughout the world are being scrutinized because of their growing cost in relations to national wealth. At the same time, techniques for evaluating health care with respect to appropriateness, quality and resource allocation are being developed. These techniques are multifactorial since they must relate to all aspects of health care including: characteristics of the population being served; available health care resources; measures of the process and utilization of care; measures of health care outcomes; peer review, including quality assessment of health care providers; consumer attitudes, knowledge, and compliance; care provided for ""tracer"" or sample conditions; and economic cost-benefit studies. Evaluation in health care assumes that a health care system and the providers of health care within that system are responsible and accountable for the health status of the population. It must, however, recognize that health services are not the sole determinants of health status; social, economic and cultural factors also play key roles. A comprehensive approach to evaluation in health care is outlined in this review. Many of the components that are available in the Israeli health care system are described; others that remain to be developed are discussed. Evaluation is an integral part of a comprehensive health care system; the components of evaluation must be built into any national system. As long as rationality is expected of health care, evaluation is an essential element of the overall system.",Israel journal of medical sciences,1982 Feb,Israel,1982,80

Thus, depending on the way in which SC is handled in statistical analyses, the PB-IQ association may be either 'overadjusted' or 'underadjusted' for SC. Two assumptions that underlie the inclusion of SC in correlation/regression analyses of the PB-IQ relationship are: 1) SC is an interval scale and 2) the PB-IQ relationship is homogeneous in all social strata. Simulation analyses are presented to illustrate the impact that different values of the bivariate correlations PB-SC, IQ-SC, and PB-IQ have on the estimate of the PB-IQ adjusted for SC.

10287174,Health policy and mental health.,"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Health promotion (Oxford, England)",1987,England,1987,80
2514523,[Determinants of income and expenditure development in the annual reports of the health insurance of the Federal Republic of Germany].,"Contribution rates to the German statutory health insurance differ considerably between different sickness funds. While insurance benefits are largely standardized, these differences are widely regarded as a problem for the state's social policy. The health insurance bodies often offer hasty interpretations to justify the differences of contribution rates. These interpretations, however, cannot be checked on the basis of data from the annual reports of the health insurance. In reality, there is a number of determinants of the contribution rate which lie as well inside as outside the sphere of influence of the health insurance bodies. In order to estimate the respective impact of single determinants it is important to differentiate the health expenditures by age and sex of all insured persons (both the contribution paying members and their co-insured dependents). A further disentanglement of health expenditures into prices, quantities and structural components allows to identify the reasons of increases in health costs. This is also a necessary precondition for creating and implementing suitable measures that are directed to control health costs. At the same time, the improved information system of the statutory health insurance would contribute to a better understanding of the performance of the health system in general.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1989,Switzerland,1989,80
12282631,Population structure.,"This paper reviews recent new trends in population structure in the world and its major regions in order to access the determinants of those trends and explore issues regarding the recent and projected changes in the age structure of population and the relationships of those changes to social and economic development. In particular, the paper compares the change in age structure projected by the Population Division of the UN Secretariat in its most recent 3 series--namely, those completed in 1984, 1986, and 1988. By and large, the most recent UN assessment projects that a larger proportion of the world population will be aged 60 and over in 2000 and 2025 than was previously estimated. Those changes in projections can be observed for the world and for the more developed countries as a whole, and for the regions of Africa, Latin America, Northern America, East Asia, Europe, and Oceania. While the recommendations of the International Conference on Population called attention to the importance of changes in population structure, this paper recommends urgent government action in planning social programs for the aged because of the greater eminence of population aging in many settings. The case of Japan is used to illustrate the growing importance of increases in life expectancy as a determinant of age structure changes (in relation to fertility decline), a point that is reinforced through a cruder decomposition of UN estimates and projections for several European countries.",Population bulletin of the United Nations,1989,United States,1989,80

For males, it is estimated that approximately 20% of the Maori excess in mortality is associated with marked ethnic differences in socio-economic status. Of the remaining excess, an estimated 15% is linked with cigarette smoking, 10% with alcohol consumption (excluding accidental cause of deaths), 5% with obesity and 17% was due to accidents. However 36% of the non-social class related excess involved rheumatic and hypertensive heart disease, nephritis, bronchiectasis, diabetes and tuberculosis which were all associated with a Maori mortality five or more times that for non-Maoris. It is recommended that resources should be allocated so that Maori people can be employed to maintain contact with Maori patients with these diseases in order to improve health services utilisation and compliance with therapy. While it was not possible to determine socio-economic status for females from national mortality data, other findings were similar to those found for males except that mortality from coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease also contributed to the Maori excess.",The New Zealand medical journal,1984 Feb 22,New Zealand,1984,80

It was found that low mol. wt proteins and polypeptides are typical for the venoms of ants, social wasps and bees. Six species of ichneumonoid parasitic wasps lack these low mol. wt proteins. Except for bee venoms none of the low mol. wt proteins contain mannose. The venoms of ichneumonoid parasites and ants contained primarily acidic proteins, whereas those of social wasps and bees contained abundant neutral and basic proteins. Immunological analysis showed that a number of venom proteins from parasitic braconid (Chelonus) wasps shared conserved immunoreactive determinants with the venom proteins of higher Hymenoptera, including some not of parasitic habit.

7155014,Nocturnalism: an ethological theory of schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a human behavioral variant with a 1% phenotypic population frequency. As the major ""mental illness"" affecting human beings, it has defied all previous attempts to explain, predict or prevent its devastating clinical manifestations. In addition to unidentified nongenetic determinants, schizophrenia has genetic determinants in the absence of known specific neuropathological or biochemical correlates found in other entities conceptualized as genetic diseases. The fitness of schizophrenics is 0.7 of nonschizophrenics, and a 1% phenotypic population frequency is difficult to explain by mutation rate alone. An ethological theory of schizophrenia has been developed in which the genetic determinant is the nocturnal character of a postulated polymorphic trait termed when active. The nongenetic determinant is simply a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light. According to the author's theory, a schizophrenic individual could be processing information while awake and exposed to light with a brain that is processing information as though he were asleep. The empirical data from which the theory is constructed are presented. THe theory is capable of explaining clinical schizophrenia within an ethological paradigm and makes several predictions, the most significant of which is that the absence of a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light should ameliorate the major symptoms of clinical schizophrenia in individuals who possess its genetic determinant.",Medical hypotheses,1982 Nov,United States,1982,80
6518143,Lay theories of the causes of alcoholism.,"This paper investigates the range, structure and determinants of lay people's implicit theories of alcoholism. The different explicit medical and psychological theories are reviewed as are studies on lay beliefs about alcoholism and heavy drinking. After a number of interviews in which people were asked to list what they believed to be the major causes of alcoholism, 265 people completed a questionnaire in which they rated 30 explanations for their importance in explaining the causes of alcoholism. Females more than males believed alcoholics to be socially inadequate and anxious and that there was too much social pressure and not enough prohibitions against drinking. Middle-aged rather than younger or older people tended to explain alcoholism in terms of poor education, social and cultural pressures and biological or genetic mechanisms. However, there were few differences in the ratings of heavy, moderate, light and non-drinkers. Factor analysis revealed six factors labelled psychological stress, personal and social problems, psychoanalytic theories, sociocultural explanations, biological or genetic explanations and social desirability or pressure. The results are discussed in terms of the research on lay understandings of psychological and medical phenomena, and the relationship between explicit and implicit theories.",The British journal of medical psychology,1984 Dec,England,1984,80
3354493,"Energy intake, energy expenditure, and smoking in relation to body fatness: the Zutphen Study.","In 1965 within the Zutphen Study information on several possible determinants of body fatness (eg, energy intake, energy expenditure, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and smoking) was collected. Univariate analyses showed that for 525 men aged 45-64 y and free from cardiovascular diseases, indicators of body fatness were inversely related to the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, smoking, and coffee consumption. Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects. In lean people this association may be explained by a thermogenic effect of smoking.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1988 Apr,United States,1988,80
4049019,The treatment strategies of arthritis sufferers.,"This paper describes and analyses the reasons for variation in the treatment strategies used by arthritis sufferers. The research was undertaken among 103 people from the Australian city of Perth. Qualitative data was obtained from a clinical sample of 27 and, on the basis of that, an interview schedule was constructed and administered to a survey sample of 76 self-reported arthritis sufferers. Data collected included comprehensive case histories, knowledge and beliefs about arthritis, types of practitioners consulted and treatments used and a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. On the basis of analysis, four basic treatment strategies were discerned. Named after their most salient characteristics and ranging from least to most inclusive these were 'general practitioner and/or self care', 'medical and paramedical care', 'medical and alternative care' and use of 'all sources of care'. The most important determinants of treatment strategy were characteristics of disease--severity, mode of onset and period since onset. The longer the period since onset, the wider the range of treatments utilized. When onset occurred at a relatively young age and when progression was rapid, the more frequently alternative services and treatments were employed. Disease characteristics were followed in importance by socioeconomic factors. Use of the less inclusive strategies was related to social class; with working class people relying primarily on 'general practitioner and/or self care' and middle class people using 'medical and paramedical care'. However, when onset and progression were rapid, the disease was severe and the person relatively young socioeconomic factors were of lesser importance and people from all classes made use of the more inclusive strategies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Social science & medicine (1982),1985,England,1985,80

A developmental perspective.",A developmental approach to the study of feeding is proposed that considers social complexity and its biological mediation as core determinants of later ingestive patterns. Evidence is presented for opioid-mediated influences of milk and its major constituents and for nonopioid-mediated channels for contact comfort. Consideration of these factors might help us better understand some of the determinants of human feeding disorders such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa.,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,1989,United States,1989,80
3494378,Determinants of microangiopathy in growth-onset diabetes. With special reference to retinopathy and glycaemic control.,"In a quasi-experiment all diabetic children in a defined area were exposed either to an intense clinical treatment or served as a constructed control. The cohort of 146 diabetics was observed prospectively for at least 15 years as to diabetic control, mainly glycosuria, and cross-sectionally examined for microangiopathy on four occasions. Data on family background, social situation, smoking, blood pressure, biochemical status, anthropometry, HLA factors and mortality were also gathered. Throughout the analysis duration was considered and treated as a concomitant variable. Two different strategies have been followed in the analysis, one trying to predict microangiopathy at a fixed and predetermined duration, the other to study determinants of the pattern of microangiopathy occurrence over time. Multiple logistic regression and Cox analysis have been used to fit these strategies. The prevalence of microaneurysms or more advanced stages of retinopathy at 10 years duration was 30 per cent and within 20 years 81 per cent. About 52 per cent had haemorrhages after 20 years. Mild and severe nephropathy after 20 years have been contracted by 50 and 15 per cent respectively. No clear sex differences were seen. Variables significantly explaining retinopathy within 10 years were post-pubertal duration, blood pressure, place of medical supervision and the HLA/DR4 marker. The mean glycosuria was high during puberty irrespective of age at onset. The overall pattern of retinopathy occurrence seemed to be influenced by place of medical supervision, age at onset, blood pressure, family history of ischaemic heart disease and glycemic control. For the progression of retinopathy the role of factors reflecting medical supervision and control of diabetes seemed even greater. Even after accounting for degree of diabetic control the experimental group had a more favourable outcome, suggesting additional quality of care components. Mild nephropathy was less predictable from the above risk factors while previous findings of the important role of elevated blood pressure for severe nephropathy was confirmed. We estimate that half of retinopathy cases were preventable by the ""experimental"" care and conclude the near-normalization of glycaemia under routine conditions favourably influences the development of diabetic retinopathy.",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica.

Surviving family members were interviewed by trained social workers, and information was collected on symptoms of the disease that led to death. The completed questionnaires were reviewed by a panel of local physicians and a cause of death was assigned by the panel. Maternal mortality was a leading cause of death, second only to heart disease. There were 190 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths and 45 maternal deaths per 100,000 married women aged between 15 and 49 years. Most of the maternal deaths (63%) were due to direct obstetric causes of which haemorrhage was the main cause. Another 27% of the maternal deaths were due to indirect obstetric causes of which rheumatic heart disease was the main cause.",British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,1989 Jan,England,1989,80

The series constituted all patients with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver (primary only), gallbladder, and pancreas recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1971-1975 (8,802 cases). Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes. These associations are most likely to be mediated by dietary habits. No clear-cut association was found for other cancers.",Preventive medicine,1986 Mar,United States,1986,80

Four biannual school-based surveys were conducted over two years. A cohort of 72 smokers was identified and followed to determine who continued smoking and who quit. Discriminant analysis was used to study social, psychological, and environmental factors predictive of quitting smoking. Compared to continuing smokers, quitters reported having fewer friends and siblings who smoked, they were less likely to view the cigarette smoker's image as positive, and lived in families where parental involvement with teenagers was high (based on the reports of parents). These results are consistent with the view that social influences are strong determinants of patterns of adolescent smoking behaviour.",Scandinavian journal of primary health care,1988 Sep,United States,1988,80

Cross-study comparisons and correlational data suggest schedule (concurrent > single access to nicotine and placebo), duration of exposure (longer > shorter exposure), and setting (therapeutic > experimental settings) also increase the reinforcing effect of nicotine.

Information from social records, a structured psychological interview, and projective tests did not support the notion that men with sex chromosome anomalies are particularly violent or aggressive. Hormonally, XYY men had significantly higher concentrations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than matched control groups. In contrast, XXY men had higher levels of LH, FSH, and prolactin, but low concentrations of testosterone. There was a significantly positive relation among all subjects as well as XY controls alone between plasma testosterone level and evidence of criminal convictions. A proportionate increase in testosterone levels was noted when subjects were divided into nondelinquents, delinquents without violent convictions, and delinquents with violent convictions. The relation between testosterone level and criminal behavior was not reflected in measures of aggression derived from the psychological interview and projective tests. There was no specific evidence that testosterone is a mediating factor in the criminal behavior of XYY men.",Archives of general psychiatry,1984 Jan,United States,1984,80
2801277,"Family environment, affect, ambivalence and decisions about unplanned adolescent pregnancy.","This study investigated the relationships among family environment, demographic measures, the decisions made by unintentionally pregnant adolescents regarding postdelivery plans and the certainty with which these decisions were made. Subjects were 175 pregnant adolescents, ages 14 through 22, who intended to carry their pregnancies to term. Greater uncertainty was associated with living with both natural parents or with mother only. Higher levels of negative affect were related to lower levels of perceived family cohesion, independence, expressiveness, and intellectual-cultural orientation. Age, trimester of pregnancy, and family constellation also were related to levels of negative affect. Discriminant analysis revealed that subjects choosing adoption were more likely to be older and to be white than were those choosing to keep the child. They also tended to perceive higher levels of expressiveness and independence in their families. The implications of these findings for the delivery of services and for future research efforts in this area are discussed.",Adolescence,1989 Fall,United States,1989,80
3359393,Some determinants of individual differences in the behaviour of children of parentally deprived parents.,"Parents who had been placed in an orphanage as children rated the behaviour of all their children who were between the ages of 6-18 years on a children's behaviour survey instrument. All families were intact and the parents had not requested professional help for marital problems. A significant number of relationships were found between parental background variables and higher reported levels of conflict with siblings and with parents, dependent-unassertive behaviour, and undemandingness in the children. Although sampling difficulties preclude generalization, the results suggest that repercussion of events in the lives of the first and second generation that are usually pathogenic may be seen in the third generation, even when the second generation may not be grossly adversely affected. These events most frequently related to individual differences in the third generation in the area of undercontrol of aggression directed toward parents and siblings.",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

3237851,"Physiological, environmental, and subjective determinants of food intake in humans: a meal pattern analysis.","The spontaneous food intake of 31 adult humans was investigated with diary self-reports of ingestive behaviors and subjective hunger over 7 consecutive days. Meals were identified, using five different definitions, and their composition of total calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein was estimated from a computer file of the nutritive value of foods. These data were analyzed by intercorrelating meal sizes with intermeal intervals, estimated stomach contents and self-reported hunger with univariate and multiple correlation techniques. Human feeding was found to be regulated on the basis of preprandial factors; the premeal interval, estimated premeal stomach content, and self-reported hunger significantly correlating with the meal size. These correlations were significant regardless of whether the meal was evaluated as spontaneous or constrained by external factors, but were stronger when the meals occurred without other people being present. The postprandial relationship between the meal size and the duration of the postmeal interval, which is present in nonhuman species, was only present in humans when meals that were eaten alone were considered separately. This suggests that the species differences may be due to the social context of observation. The intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein was found to have a suppressive effect on subsequent intake and subjective hunger through their contributions to total food energy ingested. Protein, however, was found to suppress subsequent intake and subjective hunger independent of its contribution to total calories, suggesting that the macronutrients have differing satiating properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Physiology & behavior,1988,United States,1988,80

3232413,The global impact of noncommunicable diseases: estimates and projections.,"With the aging of populations in developing countries there is both a demographic and an epidemiological transition which affects the impact of chronic degenerative diseases on the health status of the populations. Demographic transition takes place in countries where there are effective programmes of disease control which allow for survival during the early years of childhood and adolescence. This results in an increase in life expectancy which places larger proportions of the population in the age range (60 years and older) in which chronic degenerative diseases become the major determinants of health status. Epidemiological transition in diseases may also be brought about by shifts in social and economic patterns which favour detrimental changes in risk factors for the chronic degenerative diseases. Such changes may include health-related behaviour which augments dietary consumption of fats and alcohol, increases obesity, increases smoking and decreases physical activity. Such changes in risk-factor levels increase the prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases which manifest themselves at later ages, and for which early preventive actions could be cost-effective. In order to illustrate the impact of both demographic and risk-factor effects, analyses are made of the impact of increases in life expectancy on cause-specific mortality in both developing and developed countries. It is shown that there is great similarity in the effect of major noncommunicable diseases on the life expectancy of adults in both developed and developing countries. The major differences are seen to be in the proportions of deaths expected from such diseases as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cirrhosis; but not in the distribution of age at death which is the better measure of disease impact. Demographic analyses, computing indirect estimates of mortality, also demonstrate that there are currently more chronic disease deaths in developing than developed countries and that as expectation of life increases in developing countries the global chronic disease burden will be greatly concentrated in the developing countries. Analyses of risk-factor reduction by feasible intervention strategies, e.g. smoking cessation campaigns, treatment of high blood pressure, using relationships between risk factors and diseases established in longitudinal studies carried out in developed countries, point out that the effect of risk-factor control in long-living populations can be hidden by the dependency of risk factors and various related causes of death, e.g. smoking has an impact on lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease and emphysema, but at different ages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",World health statistics quarterly.

3803557,Adolescent pregnancy in the United States: an interstate analysis.,"Rates of teenage pregnancy, birth and abortion vary greatly among states. Because states that have high birthrates tend to have low abortion rates, pregnancy levels vary much less than do the birth and abortion measures. The role of unintended pregnancy is highlighted by the fact that in states that have very high pregnancy rates, the adolescent abortion rate is higher than the birthrate and the abortion rate combined in states that have the lowest pregnancy rates. A series of multivariate analyses that controlled for the percentage of the state population that was black, poor and metropolitan showed that social factors tend to be more important determinants of state differences in teenage pregnancy, birth and abortion levels than are policy-related variables, particularly for whites. Nevertheless, some policy measures have important associations for both races, especially for blacks. Social factors. High rates of population growth and residential mobility over the previous decade, a high crime rate, a high teenage suicide rate, extensive circulation of sexually explicit magazines, a large percentage not voting in elections and a high level of stress are all associated with high pregnancy-related rates for teenagers. The percentage of children living in female-headed households correlates positively with abortion and pregnancy levels among white teenagers, but has no significant association with the birthrate. The percentage of a state's population that belongs to fundamentalist religious groups is positively associated with adolescent birthrates. Political liberalism correlates with relatively low pregnancy rates and birthrates but with a somewhat higher likelihood of pregnancies being terminated by abortion. In states where women's status is higher, birthrates are lower, but abortion levels are higher. Policy measures. States that have high proportions of teenagers dropping out of school and of young women not graduating from high school tend to have high pregnancy rates and birthrates and a somewhat lower proportion of pregnancies ending in abortion. Increased spending on education is associated with relatively high abortion rates (and, therefore, pregnancy rates). The higher the teacher-student ratio, the lower the adolescent birthrate and the more likely the pregnant teenager is to have an abortion. Welfare payments to teenage mothers are negatively associated with both black and white teenage birthrates, and higher maximum payments are associated with relatively high abortion levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Family planning perspectives,1986 Sep-Oct,United States,1986,80
6656327,The determinants of dropping out of care among hypertensive patients receiving a behavioral intervention.,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension.",Medical care,1983 Oct,United States,1983,80
3395696,Congenital determinants of violence.,"Specialization--the predisposition to violent behavior persisting over an extended period of time--is considered in relation to congenital factors, to determine whether such factors are contributory to this predisposition. Congenital factors include inherited characteristics and perinatal experiences. Evidence for inherited characteristics in criminal behavior is approached through family studies, the study of twins, and adoption studies. Of those three, adoption studies provide the most fertile ground for study. Predisposition toward criminal behavior is noted to be limited to property crime. The second congenital factor is the perinatal experience. Minor physical anomalies appear to be strongly related to hyperactivity and later criminal involvement, but only if the offender was reared in an unstable, nonintact family. Indices of perinatal problems relate to later violent crime, rather than to property crime, and may have as their basis some form of trauma occurring very early in life.",The Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,1988,United States,1988,80
6505746,Primary health care in practice: a study in Mozambique.,"This study investigates the delivery of all aspects of Primary Health Care (PHC) in a case study of one urban health centre in Maputo, Mozambique. Within the context of overall social and economic change, Mozambique has given priority to primary health care as the driving force in its newly developed National Health Service. The urban and rural health centres are intended to be the principal vehicles for PHC delivery, and in this study one of Maputo's recently opened health centres was investigated by observing all clinic sessions, interviewing all health centre workers and collecting data from health centre records. It was found that a dichotomy exists between the tasks ascribed to the health centre in the PHC framework, and the feasibility of their execution given existing personnel and material resources. This derives in part from lack of involvement of PHC practitioners in the organisation and planning of PHC, plus resource allocation which remains in favour of secondary and tertiary rather than primary care. Prevention is accorded priority in PHC theory, yet investigation showed that the major demand on the health centre is for curative care. The quality of both curative and preventive care was evaluated and the need for training in specialist diagnostic skills, and a more socially-based understanding of the determinants of health status and risk emerged, respectively for the groups of workers in the two sectors. The level of contact between the curative and preventive sectors was investigated as was the integration of the health centre into the health service as a whole. The problems arising in these areas must be viewed in the context of the very recent development of a National Health Service in a country where, previously, curative care was available only in urban areas and virtually no preventive programmes existed. This study shows that significant steps are being taken to develop a comprehensive PHC programme in Maputo. More important still will be the extension of this level of care provision to the country as a whole.",Social science & medicine (1982),1984,England,1984,80

On the research status and importance of personal resources in managing daily stresses and life change events].,"In recent developmental and psychosomatic studies the focus shifts from pathogenic to health protective factors. Literature on coping with daily stresses, life events and biographic determinants is reviewed. Despite conceptual (negative health definitions, divergent theoretical backgrounds and values) and methodological problems (reliance on self-report and trait measurement) moderate, however consistent health protective affects of personal resources are shown. These are mainly generalized attitudes of persons toward self and their environment (e.g. optimism, internal locus of control, self-efficacy, commitment). Contrasting influential concepts (sense of coherence, hardiness) the bias toward self-reliant, internal control as health protective resource is criticized and a plea is made for conjoint consideration of health-protective influences of social relationships.","Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie",1989 Dec,Germany,1989,80

Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1986 Feb,United States,1986,80

Significant social-psychological factors at each step of the loop process contribute to the development of migration streams along a predictable pattern. The general model of the loop process shows that the migration stream is 1st sparked when labor is recruited from less developed countries for work in developed industrialized countries. Once the social process of migration has begun, it tends to acquire a self-feeding character. Social and economic change in sending and receiving societies brought about by migration make further migration more likely. The case of the Mexico-US-Mexico loop process is analyzed. This case illustrates the effects of socioeconomic stratification that occurs in communities where the migration loop process reaches a certain level of maturity. The majority of a town's population may become committed to migration as a way of life. Eventually, wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of those that are most able to migrate. Thus, migrants may become a new elite segment of rural populations that were once relatively homogenous societies. Further research of the migration loop process should be conducted. At least in the case of Mexico, the socioeconomic stratification in the villages and towns acting as sources of migration loops with destinations in the US have significant internal economic, social, and political implications.","International migration (Geneva, Switzerland)",1988 Mar,Switzerland,1988,80
6701567,"Social support and mental health: direct, protective and compensatory effects.","This study deals with the relationship between social support and mental health. This relationship was conceptualized as a multi-faceted one which may be understood in terms of direct (main), protective (buffering) and compensatory effects. Hypotheses relating to these effects were evaluated in terms of spousal/community support and job strains (pressure, autonomy, opportunities) among a sample of 455 married males who were employed on a full-time basis. Results indicated that spousal support generally had more important implications for psychological well-being than did community support. However, the relative impact of these different sources of support appeared to be related to the degree to which the mental health symptomology reported was affectively defined. With respect to protective effects, spousal support was found to moderate the relationship between certain job strains (pressure) and mental health. No protective effects were found for community support. Tests of the hypothesis that community support compensates for low levels of spousal support were made in terms of both direct and protective effects. No direct effect compensation was observed. However, protective effect compensation was observed for certain job strains (opportunities) and was relevant to a wide range of symptomology. The overall results suggest a primary/secondary hierarchy of supports and strains in which primary supports (e.g. spousal) assume a protective function with respect to secondary strains (e.g. job) while secondary supports (e.g. community) do not protect individuals from primary strains (e.g. spousal). Secondary supports have a protective function for secondary strains in the absence of primary supports. It is further suggested that sex roles may be important determinants of the availability and use of different support sources.",Social science & medicine (1982),1984,England,1984,80
7372385,Determinants of the occupational strategies adopted by British hospital nurses.,"This paper focuses on the position of the nurse in the division of labor in health care and the occupational strategies British hospital nurses have adopted in response to their changing employement situation. The authors suggest a Marxist framework as an alternative to current approaches to the study of occupational strategy, which tend to focus on the level of distribution relations. An adequate analysis of the situation of hospital nurses, the paper suggests, depends upon locating the occupation within the wider setting of the mode of control and delivery of health care. The central feature of this setting is the dominance of medicine and medical technology, and the main factors shaping it are the activities of individual capitalists involved in the health industry and the State operating within the constraints of capital in general and within the context of class struggle. It is suggested that the characteristic feature of nurses' occupational strategy--the vacillation between professionalism and unionism--can best be understood in relation to the changing mode of control and delivery of health care and nurses' contradictory position within the social relations that constitute that mode.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1980,United States,1980,80
3481909,The definition and classification of mental retardation.,"Problems with current definitions of mental retardation were recognized. Classification systems based on the behavioral capabilities of retarded persons were criticized since there are so many noncognitive determinants of performance. It was proposed that mental retardation be defined solely by IQ scores at least 2 SDs below the population mean. This suggestion was predicated on the view that the behavioral sciences currently have no better way to assess intellectual functioning. Etiology was seen as such a significant predictor of group differences that the organic, familial, and undifferentiated categories would be used in classification. Social adaptation and expected performance were seen as correlates of class membership rather than defining features of retardation, since they have no reliable method of measurement. Problems of labeling were discussed, but the practice was deemed useful if it leads to beneficial services and interventions.",Upsala journal of medical sciences. Supplement,1987,Sweden,1987,80

Sociomedical research focuses on human behavior and its social, economic, cultural, and psychological determinants. Thus, the author urges sociomedical researchers--primarily medical sociologists, medical anthropologists, social psychologists, and public health economists--to explore the cultural, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors contributing to the current 'epidemic' of genital chlamydial infection, a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that is found worldwide and has now supplanted gonorrhea as the most common STD in the industrialized nations. Control of this STD is particularly important because of its grave consequences for women's and maternal/child health; these include ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and neonatal morbidity. Before effective prevention and control programs can be realized, however, beliefs and behaviors surrounding such areas as sexuality, fertility, contraception, STDs, hygiene, and health care must be discerned for widely based populations in both industrialized and nonindustrialized nations.",Social science & medicine (1982),1987,England,1987,80

3426705,Alcohol and ambience: social and environmental determinants of intake and mood.,"An experiment was conducted in which 66 male subjects were given access to alcohol (20% vol.) and fruit juice to be mixed and tasted ad lib. A factorial design included social vs. solitary drinking conditions, laboratory vs. informal setting, and variable exposure to music. The amount of ethanol consumed (g/kg body weight) was used as an unobtrusive measure of preferred intake. The reciprocal relationship between mood and consumption was analyzed by LISREL. While euphoria has usually been perceived as a consequence of drinking, the only plausible fit to a LISREL model was obtained by assuming that the disposition to drink would be increased by positive mood changes occurring during the drinking session. An analogy between social drinking and adjunctive behaviour was supported, as alcohol consumption was directly affected by time-dependent environmental factors such as company and music. Since the presence of company also stimulated positive mood and alleviated boredom, consumption was precipitated by company indirectly as well as directly. These results emphasize the importance of direct as well as indirect environmental influences on spontaneous alcohol intake during social drinking.","Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire).

Classmate, parent, teacher, and friend social support all were significant predictors of self-esteem. Family conflict and organization were also significantly associated with self-esteem, as were microstressors. The overall model of significant predictor variables accounted for 66% of the variance in general self-esteem. General self-esteem also was significantly predictive of depressive symptomatology. The findings suggest a number of factors which are potentially modifiable and which might enhance general self-esteem in children with visible physical handicaps.",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,1989 Feb,United States,1989,80
12282631,Population structure.,"This paper reviews recent new trends in population structure in the world and its major regions in order to access the determinants of those trends and explore issues regarding the recent and projected changes in the age structure of population and the relationships of those changes to social and economic development. In particular, the paper compares the change in age structure projected by the Population Division of the UN Secretariat in its most recent 3 series--namely, those completed in 1984, 1986, and 1988. By and large, the most recent UN assessment projects that a larger proportion of the world population will be aged 60 and over in 2000 and 2025 than was previously estimated. Those changes in projections can be observed for the world and for the more developed countries as a whole, and for the regions of Africa, Latin America, Northern America, East Asia, Europe, and Oceania. While the recommendations of the International Conference on Population called attention to the importance of changes in population structure, this paper recommends urgent government action in planning social programs for the aged because of the greater eminence of population aging in many settings. The case of Japan is used to illustrate the growing importance of increases in life expectancy as a determinant of age structure changes (in relation to fertility decline), a point that is reinforced through a cruder decomposition of UN estimates and projections for several European countries.",Population bulletin of the United Nations,1989,United States,1989,80

The analysis is based upon original survey data from 2,446 women in Venezuela and related literature. The results suggest that both positive attitudes and contraceptive accessibility are major determinants of contraception but at the aggregate level neither has a decisive advantage over the other. The three best predictors of contraceptive use are: specific contraceptive attitudes, social support, and accessibility of contraceptives. Their impacts on behavior are direct and additive; however, their impacts vary significantly by education and number of living children. In general attitude change strategy is more effective with younger women while improving accessibility affects older women more often. Implications for policy and programs are presented.",International quarterly of community health education,1981 Jan 1,United States,1981,80
10284405,"Costs, commitment, and rewards: factors influencing the design and implementation of internal labor markets.","Much research on internal labor markets has been hampered by the failure to differentiate the wide variety of ILMs, by accounts of their determinants that too heavily emphasize isolated causal factors, by the lack of detailed material describing the economic and organizational dimensions of their design and implementation, and by the neglect of managerial perceptions of and motivations for constructing ILMs. This paper presents detailed case studies of three organizations that have constructed very different ILMs. Based on this material, a model of the determinants of ILMs is developed that centers around the concepts of costs, commitment, and rewards and that attempts to assess the interactions of effects of markets and hierarchies on ILMs. The model is built on the premise that the underlying imperatives typically held to affect ILMs are inevitably filtered through managerial beliefs and the constraints on managerial decision making. The implications of these findings for theory and research on ILMs are discussed.",Administrative science quarterly,1987 Jun,United States,1987,80
3701582,Objective determinants of perceived social support.,"Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1986 Feb,United States,1986,80
3619612,Employment after spinal cord injury.,"A predictive model for employment after spinal cord injury was developed. The study population consisted of 154 spinal cord injured persons who were treated at our hospital between 1973 and 1979, and followed for seven years after injury. Demographic, social, and injury severity data were abstracted from each subject's hospital record. Motivation to work, employment history, and sources of postinjury financial support, were assessed by a vocational rehabilitation counselor. The study population was divided into four groups: persons continuously unemployed after injury, homemakers, students, and those employed at some time during the seven-year follow-up period. Stepwise discriminant analysis was used to develop a predictive model that ultimately included seven variables: gender, motivation to work, whether the patient's last job required ambulation, race, educational level, a functional ability score, and whether the patient had children. The model correctly classified 82% of those persons who were continuously unemployed, 100% of homemakers, 63% of students, and 72% of employed subjects. Overall, 79% of subjects were classified correctly. The most important classification errors were between the unemployed and employed groups. Seventeen percent of employed patients were incorrectly classified as unemployed, and 11% of unemployed patients were incorrectly classified as employed. Although there are other determinants of postinjury vocational status, individual potential can be assessed by means of a comparatively small set of predictor variables.",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,1987 Aug,United States,1987,80
3867226,Atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents. XII. Smoking behaviour and its determinants in 12-18-year-old subjects.,"The cross-sectional study of 1980 for atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents aimed at a wide coverage of the relevant relationships of the smoking behaviour to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. The initiation and establishment of the smoking habits were primarily viewed as a function of the youngsters' main socializing agents: the peer group and the family. A subpopulation comprising 1,790 children and adolescents aged 12, 15 and 18 years of the total sample was included in the study on smoking behaviour. The information on smoking habits was collected in connection with the medical examination in a solitary room where the youngsters could respond undisturbed. Data on the children's families were obtained by means of a general questionnaire filled out by the parents. The prevalence of daily smoking was 1% in the 12-year-old, 10% in the 15-year-old, and 30% in the 18-year-old subjects. The best friend's behaviour was the best predictor of an adolescent's smoking behaviour, although the family had retained its role as an important model as regards the learning of smoking behaviour. Quitting school turned out to be a major event leading to an increased risk of becoming a habitual smoker. No clear associations between socioeconomic status of the family and daily smoking were found, except that farmers' children had generally lower rates of daily smoking than children from other socioeconomic groups. First contacts with tobacco formed part of a normal behaviour pattern at a certain age, and this experimentation was unrelated to a later regular habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica.

4061712,A cross-cultural comparison of health status values.,"The extent to which the values attached to health states are similar in different cultures or social groups is important for understanding health and illness behaviors and for developing standardized health status measures. A cross-cultural study was conducted to compare the health status values obtained in a United States population (Seattle, Washington) with those from another English-speaking culture (London, England) on the Sickness Impact Profile, a standardized measure composed of 136 items. London judges rated the severity of dysfunction described in each item on an equal interval scale using the same methods of scaling and analysis employed in the Seattle study. A regression of English mean item values on US mean values yielded a slope of 1.00 and an intercept of -0.07, indicating that judges gave strikingly similar ratings to most items. Agreement was higher at the more severe end of the dysfunction continuum than at the least severe end, a finding consistent with the notion that what constitutes health is more difficult to define than what constitutes illness. While a universal conception of dysfunction may exist in English-speaking societies, the social and cultural determinants of health status values deserve more systematic study.",American journal of public health,1985 Dec,United States,1985,80

Data are analyzed from questionnaires administered to 387 males and females. It was found that future work-family plans were closely tied to sex role orientations of adolescents of both sexes. However, self-esteem, evaluation of the relative difficulty of male-female sex roles, and projected childlessness were salient to sex role attitudes of females but not of males. Positive evaluations of self were related to non-traditional sex role orientations among females. Maternal employment differentially affected male and female children. Sons of women in high-status occupations were reluctant to get involved in a two-career family with children. Mothers' occupational status had little influence on the plans or sex role attitudes of daughters. The results indicate that future research should investigate whether maternal employment in high-status occupations, while providing a wider range of acceptable models for girls, may serve as a negative model for boys.",Adolescence,1988 Winter,United States,1988,80

7282978,Anality: a theory of erotism and characterology.,"The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology.",American journal of psychoanalysis,1981 Spring,England,1981,80

We assessed heredity for atopy, number of infections, and duration of breast feeding as determinants of atopy. During the first year of life 14 infants has signs of atopy. During the second year parents reported signs of atopy in a further 31. Heredity was the only significant predictor of atopy. Atopy was seen in 33% of infants with a positive heredity and in 16% without family history for atopy. The duration of breast feeding affected the incidence of atopy only among the infants without family history for atopy: fewer in the short breast feeding group (1/18) had atopy than in the long breast feeding group (5/13). Duration of breast feeding did not associate with incidence of respiratory infections. Diarrhoea was more common in the short breast feeding group than in the long breast feeding group during the first year of life. We conclude that prolonging exclusive breast feeding from the median of 70 days to nine months did not contribute to the prevention of infantile atopy and respiratory tract infections.",Archives of disease in childhood,1987 Mar,England,1987,80

4049019,The treatment strategies of arthritis sufferers.,"This paper describes and analyses the reasons for variation in the treatment strategies used by arthritis sufferers. The research was undertaken among 103 people from the Australian city of Perth. Qualitative data was obtained from a clinical sample of 27 and, on the basis of that, an interview schedule was constructed and administered to a survey sample of 76 self-reported arthritis sufferers. Data collected included comprehensive case histories, knowledge and beliefs about arthritis, types of practitioners consulted and treatments used and a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. On the basis of analysis, four basic treatment strategies were discerned. Named after their most salient characteristics and ranging from least to most inclusive these were 'general practitioner and/or self care', 'medical and paramedical care', 'medical and alternative care' and use of 'all sources of care'. The most important determinants of treatment strategy were characteristics of disease--severity, mode of onset and period since onset. The longer the period since onset, the wider the range of treatments utilized. When onset occurred at a relatively young age and when progression was rapid, the more frequently alternative services and treatments were employed. Disease characteristics were followed in importance by socioeconomic factors. Use of the less inclusive strategies was related to social class; with working class people relying primarily on 'general practitioner and/or self care' and middle class people using 'medical and paramedical care'. However, when onset and progression were rapid, the disease was severe and the person relatively young socioeconomic factors were of lesser importance and people from all classes made use of the more inclusive strategies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Social science & medicine (1982),1985,England,1985,80

HTLV-III antibodies were present in 35 (53%) of the 66 subjects tested in June, 1982. 4 of the seronegative subjects had HTLV-III antibodies when re-tested one year later, a seroconversion rate of 1.2% per month. In the HTLV-III seropositive subjects, AIDS developed at a rate of 6.9% per year (minimum incidence of AIDS = 4.6% per year) and other clinical signs of immunodeficiency (lesser AIDS) at 13.1% per year. All 6 of the AIDS cases and at least 8 of the 10 lesser AIDS cases had detectable HTLV-III antibodies 1 week to 21 months before diagnosis. Of 24 other subjects with stable lymphadenopathy, 19 (79%) had or acquired HTLV-III antibodies. Lower helper T-cell counts were very closely related to HTLV-III seropositivity (r = -0.53, p = 0.0001), even in the 26 healthy subjects with no clinical abnormalities (r = -0.37, p = 0.07). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the lifestyle risk factors for HTLV-III seropositivity were large number of homosexual partners (p less than or equal to 0.03) and receptive anal intercourse (p less than or equal to 0.03), with an apparent synergistic interaction between these two activities (chi 2 = 8.71, p = 0.003). These data suggest that frequent receptive anal intercourse with many homosexual partners predisposes to HTLV-III infection with the consequent emergence of lymphadenopathy and the various manifestations of lesser and fully fledged AIDS.","Lancet (London, England)",1984 Sep 29,England,1984,80
3186028,The changing patterns of disease.,"The pattern of disease in New Zealand is changing and will continue to do so. Some trends are predictable, while others (such as the epidemic of AIDS) may be unexpected. Analysis of past improvements in health suggests that medical research would be more productive if greater attention were paid to the external influences and personal behaviour which are the chief determinants of health. Apart from such general implications, analysis of the changing patterns of disease is vital as a stimulus and guide for medical research of all kinds. More effective monitoring of disease trends in New Zealand will require improvement in the quality and timeliness of routine health statistics, and training of adequate numbers of epidemiologists to analyse and interpret the data. Such developments are essential if medical research is to make a full contribution to the health of New Zealanders.",The New Zealand medical journal,1988 Oct 26,New Zealand,1988,80
7145506,Moral reasoning and decisions in dilemmas of neonatal care.,"The relationship between levels of moral reasoning and decisions in dilemmas of neonatal care was investigated in a sample of 452 pediatricians. Subjects included residents, faculty members, and practitioners recruited from a variety of university-affiliated and community hospitals. It was hypothesized that physicians whose moral reasoning was more fully developed would less actively treat particular cases. Such cases might include those where a patient's family requested such a limit (designated ""negative family attitude"") or the quality of life likely to be led after therapy was so low as to preclude even a minimal degree of human activity or social interaction (designated ""unsalvageable prognosis""). The hypothesis was tested through the use of two questionnaires. The first questionnaire, devised by Crane, assessed the physician's reported degree of activism in treating six cases of infants born with severe defects. The structure of moral reasoning was measured by a second questionnaire, Rest's Defining Issue Test. Subjects were scored by the degree to which they use universal, ethical principles in resolving a series of moral dilemmas. Results of the absolute level of activism (Table 1) showed that among both residents and postresidents, the degree to which cases are actively treated depends, for salvageable patients, on the type of damage and on the possibility for research. Results involving moral reasoning showed a different pattern among residents and postresidents. Among residents, a significant correlation exists between principled reasoning and the absence of active treatment (r = - 0.41, Form A; r = - 0.23, Form B). As predicted, such correlations were strongest for cases of negative family attitude or of unsalvageable prognosis. The pattern of correlations among postresidents showed either no relationship to moral reasoning or the reverse of the residency pattern (r = -0.08, Form A; r = 0.30, Form B). The influence of the type of institution a resident operates within was assessed by analysis of variance. Inasmuch as moral reasoning and institutional type both had significant main effects (Form A), their magnitude differed. Institutional type accounted for 43% of the variation in mean activism scores whereas moral reasoning accounted for only 4%; however, because one could, a priori, expect institutional norms and customs to be powerful determinants of behavior, any additional, identifiable influence deserves attention. The structure of individuals' moral reasoning seems to be such an influence.",Pediatric research,1982 Oct,United States,1982,80
6667732,Second pregnancies among teenage mothers.,"An analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) finds that 82 percent of sexually active teenage mothers were using contraceptives in the year following the birth of their first child; the majority of those who practiced contraception used the pill. The proportion of black teenagers using no method of birth control was higher than that for white teenagers, and it increased over the course of the year. Rates of nonuse were particularly high among black women younger than 18, only 68 percent of whom practiced contraception (compared with 85 percent of whites the same age). Examination of the data by marital status shows that women who married while they were pregnant were the most likely to practice contraception in the year following their first birth, while those who were single at the time of first birth were the least likely to do so (89 versus 74 percent). Blacks constituted the majority of women who were not married at the time of first birth, and of all marital subgroups, single blacks had the highest rate of nonuse (29 percent). The probability of a pregnancy during the year following a first birth for all teenage mothers was 17 percent. Pregnancy rates among women with incomes less than 150 percent of poverty level were nearly twice as high as rates among women who had incomes above that level--21 percent vs. 11 percent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Family planning perspectives,1983 Nov-Dec,United States,1983,80
6338092,Biomedical and social determinants of cognitive impairment in the elderly.,"Studies in age-related cognitive changes do not necessarily take into account the clinical and social phenomena associated with age that may have more effect on cognition than does psychologic senescence. Clinically inapparent biologic deterioration, drugs, mild dementia, and atypically presenting depression may influence cognition. Selection bias may skew the results of studies on the elderly when control groups are made up of undergraduates or of ""normal"" elderly whose normality is taken for granted rather than verified. The epiphenomena of aging, such as retirement, social isolation, and bereavement, which are not inherent in the aging process, influence cognition, as do labeling and learned helplessness. Laboratory-based tests of cognition may not sufficiently resemble real-life conditions to have validity. Future research will be shaped by how we conceptualize the relation between aging and intellectual function.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,1983 Mar,United States,1983,80
3867226,Atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents. XII. Smoking behaviour and its determinants in 12-18-year-old subjects.,"The cross-sectional study of 1980 for atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents aimed at a wide coverage of the relevant relationships of the smoking behaviour to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. The initiation and establishment of the smoking habits were primarily viewed as a function of the youngsters' main socializing agents: the peer group and the family. A subpopulation comprising 1,790 children and adolescents aged 12, 15 and 18 years of the total sample was included in the study on smoking behaviour. The information on smoking habits was collected in connection with the medical examination in a solitary room where the youngsters could respond undisturbed. Data on the children's families were obtained by means of a general questionnaire filled out by the parents. The prevalence of daily smoking was 1% in the 12-year-old, 10% in the 15-year-old, and 30% in the 18-year-old subjects. The best friend's behaviour was the best predictor of an adolescent's smoking behaviour, although the family had retained its role as an important model as regards the learning of smoking behaviour. Quitting school turned out to be a major event leading to an increased risk of becoming a habitual smoker. No clear associations between socioeconomic status of the family and daily smoking were found, except that farmers' children had generally lower rates of daily smoking than children from other socioeconomic groups. First contacts with tobacco formed part of a normal behaviour pattern at a certain age, and this experimentation was unrelated to a later regular habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica.

2650741,Perinatal mortality in Belgium.,"Perinatal mortality in Belgium remains high compared with other countries of Western Europe, although a marked decrease was observed during the period from 1956 to 1984. Analysis of the death causes indicates that further progress is feasible. Social inequalities and geographic variation are persisting in spite of the long-established policy of social welfare and free access to health services. Most of the studies on perinatal mortality in Belgium are descriptive and based on data recorded in birth and infant death certificates. In the future, alternative sources of information should be used to analyze more precisely and to understand more clearly the interactions between the different determinants of perinatal mortality and to evaluate the impact of social and health services.",Biology of the neonate,1989,Switzerland,1989,80
2660269,[Epidemiology and heterogeny].,"The innovation of epidemiology plays a crucial role in the development of the health sciences. The authors emphasize the importance of epistemological analysis related to scientific and technical production. They focus on the theoretical and methodological contributions of the principal Latin American groups in the field of epidemiology, stating their main accomplishments, issues and potentials. When reviewing those conceptual and practical innovations, the authors analyse the effects of broader historical conditions on scientific work. To them, Latin American contemporary innovative epidemiological research and production have developed clearly differentiated principles, methods and technical projections which have led to a movement of critical or 'social' epidemiology. The functionalist approach of conventional epidemiology, characterized by an empiricist viewpoint, is being overcome by a more rigorous and analytical approach. This new epidemiological approach, in which the authors as members of CEAS (Health Research and Advisory Center) are working, has selectively incorporated some of the technical instruments of conventional epidemiology, subordinating them to a different theoretical and logical paradigm. The new framework of this group explains the need to consider the people's objective situation and necessities, when constructing scientific interpretations and planning technical action. In order to accomplish this goal, epidemiological reasoning has to reflect the unity of external epidemiological facts and associations, the so-called phenomenological aspect of health, with the underlying determinants and conditioning processes or internal relations, which are the essence of the health-disease production and distribution process. Epidemiological analysis is considered not only as a problem of empirical observation but as a process of theoretical construction, in which there is a dynamic fusion of deductive and inductive reasoning.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Social science & medicine (1982),1989,England,1989,80

First, a general characterization of the movement is proposed, based on shared commitment to five assumptions: (1) a positive view of health as well-being, (2) individual responsibility for health, (3) the importance of health education, (4) control of social and environmental determinants of health, and (5) low technology of ""natural"" therapeutic techniques. Second, a basic difference among advocates of holistic health/medicine is proposed in terms of the presence or absence of commitment to scientific method. Third, holistic health/medicine is briefly compared with concepts of holism in biology and in the social sciences. Finally, criticisms of each of the basic tenets of the holistic health movement are offered.",The Journal of medicine and philosophy,1981 May,United States,1981,80
6584748,Determinants of differences in mortality between New Zealand Maoris and non-Maoris aged 15-64.,"Maori mortality is compared with that of other New Zealanders aged 15-64 in the period 1974 to 1978. For males, it is estimated that approximately 20% of the Maori excess in mortality is associated with marked ethnic differences in socio-economic status. Of the remaining excess, an estimated 15% is linked with cigarette smoking, 10% with alcohol consumption (excluding accidental cause of deaths), 5% with obesity and 17% was due to accidents. However 36% of the non-social class related excess involved rheumatic and hypertensive heart disease, nephritis, bronchiectasis, diabetes and tuberculosis which were all associated with a Maori mortality five or more times that for non-Maoris. It is recommended that resources should be allocated so that Maori people can be employed to maintain contact with Maori patients with these diseases in order to improve health services utilisation and compliance with therapy. While it was not possible to determine socio-economic status for females from national mortality data, other findings were similar to those found for males except that mortality from coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease also contributed to the Maori excess.",The New Zealand medical journal,1984 Feb 22,New Zealand,1984,80

Data were collected from 43 subjects, 6 to 35 months after they had elective hip or knee arthroplasties. The subjects responded to a mail survey that defined before surgery and after recovery functioning in relation to 22 activities of daily living representing personal care, housework-yard work, and recreation-social activities. Approximately 65% of the subjects reported no change in their ability to perform the 22 surveyed activities. Psychosocial variables appeared to be significant determinants of function.

Eleven independent variables pertaining to demographic and environmental characteristics were initially related to the frequency and topography of residents' maladaptive behavior. Multiple regression analysis revealed that maladaptive behaviors were related to sex, social age, chronological age, resident's time spent on outside activities, number of residents per direct-care staff member, presence of sensory handicaps, and ambulation. Results were related to existing literature and discussed in terms of their use for intervention efforts and differential assignment of resources.",American journal of mental deficiency,1986 Jul,United States,1986,80

10301136,Planning and management for health in periods of economic stringency and instability: a contingency approach.,"The mid-1970s marked the end of the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in history, and initiated in Europe--and other parts of the world--a period of economic stagnation and instability. Along with the prosperity explosion of the past, the pattern of health problems has changed and is still changing. Moreover, the demand for health care has kept on rising, without much improvement of health status in general. Thus, there is a critical need to rethink policies, and to ensure that future changes occur within the limits of shrinking resources and the allotted time-span. In particular, the change in priorities envisaged by the Health for All 2000 (HFA 2000) strategies will need to take place against the background of an ageing population, social instability, and continuing development of new lifestyles and persistent economic scarcity. It is by analysing that background that this article seeks to make recommendations as to how health planning and management might successfully cope with the policy reorientation of the HFA 2000 strategy. The structure of this article is as follows. Firstly, the changes taking place in planning conditions will be reviewed, and form the basis of a framework for subsequent analysis of the planning environment. Following this framework, some of the conflicts likely to be faced in planning and management will be discussed, many of which are the consequence of economic stringency and instability. Also the requirements for an improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of planning will be identified. Finally, a limited number of approaches to planning will be considered, for their appropriateness to the present-day economic circumstances. The point of view elucidated throughout is that there is no single solution which is 'best' under all circumstances. The conclusion, rather, is that the selection of particular theory or method of planning and management should depend both on the objectives of the decision maker and on the determinants of the planning environment. General prescriptions should not be made. At the same time, some elements have to be stressed in all types of planning, namely: the orientation towards outcomes or outputs of problems; the attention to long-term strategic thinking; and, the application of more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic approaches.",The International journal of health planning and management,1986 Apr-Jun,England,1986,80
3501048,Differences in determinants of physician use between aged and middle-aged persons.,"The authors examined whether there are differences in the determinants of physician use between aged and middle-aged individuals. Data were obtained through interviews and medical records from a probability sample of 460 individuals aged 45-89 years old. Physical health measures were important predictors for both age groups, but there were differences in the relative importance of specific variables. The number of diagnoses was more important in predicting physician use for the middle-aged and bed days was more significant for the aged. Psychologic factors played a slightly greater role in predicting physician use for the aged, and enabling and predisposing variables were somewhat more important for the middle-aged. Utilization during the year before the interview was associated with subsequent physician use for both age groups, but the correlation was weaker among the aged. Age differences in the predictors of physician use are believed to result from the unique illness response elicited by chronic, as opposed to acute, illness.",Medical care,1987 Dec,United States,1987,80

In order to study the further course of neurotic disorders and their determinants, as well as the issues of social rehabilitation and psychoprophylactic interferences, 56 patients were studied again after 6 to 8 years. For each of the symptom complexes investigated, the course had distinct features determined primarily by adaptation-compensatory capabilities of personality, and the ""system of psychological defense"". Most unfavorable was the course of hysterical disorders. Therapeutic policy in these patients should be grounded upon the psychotherapeutic measures aimed at finding the ways that would be psychologically adequate for changing the patients' attitudes and restoring their adaptation.","Zhurnal nevropatologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

10281815,The changing structure of the health care delivery system in the United States.,"The historical equilibrium of the health care industry has been disturbed by recent and radical changes in both the financing of medical services and the structure of the industry. The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments. Because competition eliminates cross-subsidies, access to care, especially by the poor, is certain to become more precarious.",The Journal of medical practice management : MPM,1985 Jul,United States,1985,80

Mobility in preparation for aging (e.g., to an elderly complex) is more likely for unmarried, previously mobile residents. Out-of-state mobility to amenity destinations is not limited to the elderly, but younger, married, more affluent elderly were more likely to make such moves.""",Economic geography,1985 Jan,United States,1985,80

This paper seeks to examine factors that may influence these perceptions. Beliefs about the seriousness of eleven childhood illnesses are compared in four groups of parents. Significant differences were evident between the groups of parents depending upon their experiences with illness. For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes. These results are interpreted within an information processing model. Implications of the findings for social psychological models of health care behaviour are discussed.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1986,England,1986,80

The purpose was to analyse the factors influencing their use of available Social Insurance and Welfare services. The participants were interviewed and their medical records studied. Compared to the total population their level of education was lower and fewer were active in the work force. Available social insurance benefits had been obtained by almost half of the patients with hemophilia and osteogenesis imperfecta, but very few with asthma/allergy and rheumatic disease. Patients with high family income and/or high educational level had received relatively more social insurance benefits than others. Men had obtained more benefits than women and young patients more than the older ones. The need for practical welfare services was high, particularly in families where a parent or daughter looked after the patient, where the patient had several additional diagnoses, and among the female patients. There was a higher unmet need for welfare services among patients suffering from asthma/allergy and rheumatic diseases than among those with hemophilia and osteogenesis imperfecta.

7155014,Nocturnalism: an ethological theory of schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a human behavioral variant with a 1% phenotypic population frequency. As the major ""mental illness"" affecting human beings, it has defied all previous attempts to explain, predict or prevent its devastating clinical manifestations. In addition to unidentified nongenetic determinants, schizophrenia has genetic determinants in the absence of known specific neuropathological or biochemical correlates found in other entities conceptualized as genetic diseases. The fitness of schizophrenics is 0.7 of nonschizophrenics, and a 1% phenotypic population frequency is difficult to explain by mutation rate alone. An ethological theory of schizophrenia has been developed in which the genetic determinant is the nocturnal character of a postulated polymorphic trait termed when active. The nongenetic determinant is simply a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light. According to the author's theory, a schizophrenic individual could be processing information while awake and exposed to light with a brain that is processing information as though he were asleep. The empirical data from which the theory is constructed are presented. THe theory is capable of explaining clinical schizophrenia within an ethological paradigm and makes several predictions, the most significant of which is that the absence of a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light should ameliorate the major symptoms of clinical schizophrenia in individuals who possess its genetic determinant.",Medical hypotheses,1982 Nov,United States,1982,80
25195529,Old age in sociocultural context: China and the United States.,"With the increasing interest in comparative studies of the elderly, China has become the focus of research attention. This society, which has been inaccessible to most Western researchers, offers a special site for studies of aging because of its sheer size as a world power, its relationship to Third World countries, and its population problem-a growing segment of elderly people. Available data from a variety of social science sources are utilized to compare how the sociocultural context of China and the United States impact differentially upon the older population in each society. Three major determinants specify the theoretical context: economic development (the level of production an economic system achieves); traditional cultural patterns (norms, roles, relationships); and the social control mechanisms (regulatory processes based upon the legal and sanctioning systems). These determinants provide a theoretical orientation for analyzing the outcome variables involved in the behavior and adaptation of the old. In American society, cultural norms and values are advantageous for active older persons in good health, particularly those with a favorable economic situation. In contemporary Chinese society, which blends traditional customs with the values of a revolutionary and changing society, there are advantages for the frail elderly.",Journal of aging studies,1987 Summer,England,1987,80
3060449,Determinants of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays: a pilot study.,"Estimates of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays have always been varied, and given Medicare's new Prospective Payment System (PPS) based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), they are likely to have changed again. Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement.",Health services research,1988 Dec,United States,1988,80
3175556,The role of personal beliefs and social influences as determinants of respirator use among construction painters.,"The purpose of this study was to identify and rank potential determinants of respirator use among painters in the construction industry. As part of a health survey of union painters, 169 male spray painters were questioned about their own beliefs concerning the consequences of wearing cartridge respirators, as well as about the perceived attitudes of others in the workplace toward respirators. Intended respirator use was more strongly associated with beliefs than was past use. The most important beliefs concerned discomfort or inconvenience. Other determinants that were associated with respirator use were respirator availability, cigarette smoking, and social influences. It was concluded that the most effective intervention strategy to increase respirator use would be multidimensional and that efforts to change only a worker's beliefs may have limited success.","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",1988 Aug,Finland,1988,80
12179093,The determinants and consequences of female migration in Thailand.,"Female migration in Thailand, especially from rural areas to the Bangkok Metropolis, is an important migratory phenomenon which leads to an unfavorable population distribution. Generally the migration level in Thailand is low but many women from the rural areas, especially from the Northeast Region, move to Bangkok Metropolis to seek work. Findings reveal that the majority of migrants are young, single women. Women migrants find it relatively easy to participate in the Bangkok labor market.

3232579,"The relationship of self-esteem, maternal employment, and work-family plans to sex role orientations of late adolescents.","Self-esteem, maternal employment, and work-family plans are examined in relation to sex role orientations of late adolescents. Data are analyzed from questionnaires administered to 387 males and females. It was found that future work-family plans were closely tied to sex role orientations of adolescents of both sexes. However, self-esteem, evaluation of the relative difficulty of male-female sex roles, and projected childlessness were salient to sex role attitudes of females but not of males. Positive evaluations of self were related to non-traditional sex role orientations among females. Maternal employment differentially affected male and female children. Sons of women in high-status occupations were reluctant to get involved in a two-career family with children. Mothers' occupational status had little influence on the plans or sex role attitudes of daughters. The results indicate that future research should investigate whether maternal employment in high-status occupations, while providing a wider range of acceptable models for girls, may serve as a negative model for boys.",Adolescence,1988 Winter,United States,1988,80
3563565,Patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter: social psychological determinants.,"Patient-practitioner transactions in the ambulatory setting have become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years. In particular, there is growing interest in providing empirical support for our anecdotal, 'common-sense' notions that clinical encounter experiences are a major determinant of outcomes such as the patient's satisfaction with the encounter. The present study was designed to look at this issue and addressed the following two research questions: Is there a relationship between fulfillment of patient requests for services and patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter? and What degree of satisfaction is explained by the qualities of the encounter as compared to the characteristics of the patient, physician, and system of health care? Four newly-developed instruments were administered to a convenience sample of 144 adult patients and their physicians prior to and following actual visits to a University Family Practice Center. Meeting patients' requests increased their satisfaction with the encounter. At least 19% of the variance in patient satisfaction could be attributed to request fulfillment. The implications of these findings for future research into the doctor-patient relationship are discussed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1987,England,1987,80

Two studies are reported in this paper--the first concerns the determinants of economic values in a population of 16-17 year old British schoolchildren, and the second concerns economic preferences and knowledge in a larger group of slightly older adolescents. By-and-large the pattern of results is not dissimilar from other studies done on older children.

Antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) were detected by solid phase radioimmunoassay in 83.8% of the recruits. Antibody frequency varied significantly in the various geographic regions of Greece and was inversely related to the size of the community. It was further shown that the prevalence of HAV infection was highly related to the recruit's social class and years of education as well as number of siblings and number of persons per room. These findings in accordance with previous reported data show that hepatitis A is hyperendemic and should be regarded as a childhood infection in Greece. Prevailing socioeconomic, hygienic living and housing conditions should be considered as the main epidemiologic determinants of HAV infections.",American journal of epidemiology,1980 Oct,United States,1980,80
3222582,Predictors of non-adoption of cigarette smoking following experimentation.,"The Childhood Antecedents of Smoking Study (CASS) investigated patterns of cigarette smoking among junior and senior high school students in an upper midwest school district. Four biannual school-based surveys were conducted over two years. A cohort of 72 smokers was identified and followed to determine who continued smoking and who quit. Discriminant analysis was used to study social, psychological, and environmental factors predictive of quitting smoking. Compared to continuing smokers, quitters reported having fewer friends and siblings who smoked, they were less likely to view the cigarette smoker's image as positive, and lived in families where parental involvement with teenagers was high (based on the reports of parents). These results are consistent with the view that social influences are strong determinants of patterns of adolescent smoking behaviour.",Scandinavian journal of primary health care,1988 Sep,United States,1988,80

3874527,On processes of peer influences in adolescent drug use: a developmental perspective.,"Data from longitudinal studies of adolescents carried out over the last ten years are reviewed to provide an integrated and dynamic perspective on the nature of friendships and processes of peer influence in adolescent drug involvement, within a general developmental perspective. Four interrelated questions are examined: What individual attributes are especially important in the formation of friendships among adolescents? Which of two processes, selection or socialization, account for the similarity in values and behaviors observed in ongoing friendship dyads, and how important is similarity in friendship formation and dissolution? What is the nature of friends' influence as compared to parents', and in which domains of adolescent's life do these influences exert themselves? What mechanisms, role modeling or social learning, underlie processes of interpersonal influences? Relational dyadic and triadic samples of adolescents matched to a parent and/or a best friend and observed at one point in time as well as over time provide important and relatively rare sources of data on processes of interpersonal influence. Sociodemographic characteristics are the strongest determinants of friendship formation, with participation in illicit drugs following next in importance. Both selection (assortative pairing) and socialization contribute to observed similarity in friendship pairs. Adolescents coordinate their choice of friends and their values and behaviors, in particular the use of marijuana, so as to maximize congruency in the friendship dyad. If there is a state of unbalance such that the friend's attitude or behavior is inconsistent with the adolescent's, the adolescent will either break off the friendship and seek another friend or will keep the friend and modify his or her own behavior. Both parents and peers can have strong influences on adolescents, depending upon the arena of influence. Parents are especially important for future life plans, while peers are most important for involvement in illicit drug use. However, for drug use itself, there are different patterns of influence depending upon the stage of drug involvement. Peers are especially important for initiation into marijuana use, while parental factors gain in importance in the transition from marijuana use to the use of other illicit drugs. Interpersonal influences of peers on ongoing marijuana and alcohol use result from modeling and imitation more than from social reinforcement and the transmission of values.",Advances in alcohol & substance abuse,1985 Spring-Summer,United States,1985,80
2766211,The role of child psychiatrists as consultants to day cares.,"An increasing number of mothers of preschool children in Canada (either by choice or economic necessity) have entered the work force. It is estimated for example that 58-80% of mothers of preschool children are working. In Canada in 1986, 51.6% of women in the work force had children under the age of five (1). It is beyond the scope and intent of this paper to discuss the merits (or possible harm) of day care per se. The aim of this paper is to discuss aspects of the quality of day care, and how this might be improved by child psychiatrists being involved in day care centres and in their organization. Few would doubt that the emotional climate and the development of trusting relationships to significant others, in the first year of life, are essential determinants of the healthy personality. Hence the quality of the day care experience of small children is an essential area of study for the child psychiatrist which is as yet insufficiently recognized. This paper discusses what has been learned from the literature and from experience as a consultation-liaison child psychiatrist to a day care centre. A case example illustrates some of the important issues.",Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie,1989 Aug,United States,1989,80

Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,1986 Nov-Dec,United States,1986,80

3130744,Determinants of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human milk.,"In a longitudinal pilot study on the course of the PCB concentration in human milk during six months of lactation, some important PCB determinants could be studied in 23 women and their infants. PCB values were within the range of those found in the literature. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the association of the mean PCB concentration over the first half year of lactation with maternal parameters, such as age, height, weight, previous lactation period, education, occupation, residence, smoking, drinking and dietary habits as well as the infant parameters gestational age, birthweight and weight gain in the first six months of life. Since the PCB concentration on fat basis and the fat content of the milk were strongly inversely related, statistical analyses were carried out both on fat and on milk basis. In univariate analyses the PCB concentration on fat basis was most strongly associated with pre- versus post-pregnancy weight gain, age and occupation. After multiple regression analysis PCB concentration on fat basis remained significantly associated with weight gain changes and remained borderline (p less than 0.10) significantly related with occupation. The pre-pregnancy Quetelet Index of the mother (height/weight) and the estimated PCB content of the diet (primarily fish) were strongly correlated with the PCB concentration on milk basis. Only the Quetelet Index remained significantly related after multiple regression analysis.",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,1988 Jan,Sweden,1988,80
7418140,The epidemiology of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The Lipid Research Clinics Program Prevalence Study. Summary.,"Correlates of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were studied in 4756 white males and females ages 20-59 years examined during a population survey conducted by 10 North American Lipid Research Clinics. Multivariable analysis was used to assess the relation of social, demographic, physical and behavioral characteristics for HDL cholesterol in each of the study populations and in subgroups defined by sex, age and gonadal hormone use. Characteristics associated with higher HDL cholesterol concentrations were a lean body habitus, not smoking, consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol, physical activity or exercise, membership in a high educational stratum, increased age and low dietary consumption of sucrose and starch. Each of these characteristics was examined in detail in its relation to HDL cholesterol concentrations in the respective chapters in this monograph; the purpose of the study reported here was to summarize the findings. When all variables were considered simultaneously in the analysis, body mass, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were the attributes most strongly and consistently associated with HDL cholesterol concentrations in the populations examined. These empirical findings from a cross-sectional study replicated across diverse populations were used to derive speculative estimates of the potential for modification of population levels of HDL cholesterol, consistent with hygienic intervention and lifestyle changes. The results of the study were considered in the context of the literature on determinants of HDL cholesterol.",Circulation,1980 Nov,United States,1980,80
3501048,Differences in determinants of physician use between aged and middle-aged persons.,"The authors examined whether there are differences in the determinants of physician use between aged and middle-aged individuals. Data were obtained through interviews and medical records from a probability sample of 460 individuals aged 45-89 years old. Physical health measures were important predictors for both age groups, but there were differences in the relative importance of specific variables. The number of diagnoses was more important in predicting physician use for the middle-aged and bed days was more significant for the aged. Psychologic factors played a slightly greater role in predicting physician use for the aged, and enabling and predisposing variables were somewhat more important for the middle-aged. Utilization during the year before the interview was associated with subsequent physician use for both age groups, but the correlation was weaker among the aged. Age differences in the predictors of physician use are believed to result from the unique illness response elicited by chronic, as opposed to acute, illness.",Medical care,1987 Dec,United States,1987,80
3435040,Growth of children from 0-5 years: with special reference to mother's smoking in pregnancy.,"A cohort of 1163 pregnant women in two small towns in South Wales, UK, was identified and followed until the children born to them were five years of age. Growth in these children is described and a number of determinants identified. Social-class differences were very small at birth but differences in height became clear by the age of two years and in head circumference before this. In height the differences were largely accounted for by greater growth in social class I, but there was a gradient in head circumference throughout all the social classes. The social class effects gradually increased as the children became older. Parity of the mothers had a small effect on size at birth but age of the mother had no effect once parity was allowed for. Data on illnesses in the children were collected but no effect on growth could be detected. By far the most important determinant of growth which could be controlled is maternal smoking. About 40% of the women smoked, about 17% heavily (15 or more cigarettes per day) and the prevalence of smoking altered little during pregnancy. There was a graded effect of smoking on growth up to a 9% deficit in birth-weight, a 2% deficit in length at birth and a 1.5% deficit in head circumference in the babies born to the mothers who smoked most heavily (25 or more cigarettes per day) compared with non-smokers.

In concentrating on the 'push' factors responsible for gross out-migration over the period 1966-71, the study considers aspects of several dimensions: spatial, economic, social, ethnic and demographic. However, in order to explore the ramifications of interaction between migration and these multifaceted factors, a model is construed which dwells not only on the forces responsible for out-migration, per se, but also on those capable of regulating rural economic structure and agricultural welfare.""",Transactions (Institute of British Geographers : 1965),1980,England,1980,80

25195529,Old age in sociocultural context: China and the United States.,"With the increasing interest in comparative studies of the elderly, China has become the focus of research attention. This society, which has been inaccessible to most Western researchers, offers a special site for studies of aging because of its sheer size as a world power, its relationship to Third World countries, and its population problem-a growing segment of elderly people. Available data from a variety of social science sources are utilized to compare how the sociocultural context of China and the United States impact differentially upon the older population in each society. Three major determinants specify the theoretical context: economic development (the level of production an economic system achieves); traditional cultural patterns (norms, roles, relationships); and the social control mechanisms (regulatory processes based upon the legal and sanctioning systems). These determinants provide a theoretical orientation for analyzing the outcome variables involved in the behavior and adaptation of the old. In American society, cultural norms and values are advantageous for active older persons in good health, particularly those with a favorable economic situation. In contemporary Chinese society, which blends traditional customs with the values of a revolutionary and changing society, there are advantages for the frail elderly.",Journal of aging studies,1987 Summer,England,1987,80

To explore these stereotypes, alcohol consumption patterns were compared in a survey of 298 Chinese, 295 Japanese and 280 Koreans in Los Angeles. Heavy drinking was found in each of the Asian groups. Gender specific logistic regression models were used to illustrate the differences in the drinking patterns of the Asian-American groups and to clarify the determinants of drinking. The greatest proportion of heavy drinking was found among the Japanese and the lowest among the Chinese. Having friends who drank was the only social factor consistently related to Asian drinking behavior.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1989 Jan,United States,1989,80

Seventy-three girls and 75 boys were interviewed about their future hopes and fears. The content and extension of each aim and fear as well as the amount of planning, knowledge, and perceived locus of control involved was estimated from answers. The contents of aims and fears were closely related to the developmental tasks. Nearly half the subjects were afraid of war. The extension of subjects' future orientation decreased, whereas their knowledge about the future increased with age. The subjects from the higher social classes were oriented farther into the future than those from the lower classes. An interpretation emphasizing the importance of the principal developmental tasks on young people's future orientation is discussed.",Adolescence,1987 Winter,United States,1987,80
3288230,Preventing cigarette smoking among school children.,"Research to develop and ensure diffusion of smoking prevention programs must (a) be based on an appreciation of the social, psychological, and biological determinants at each stage in the onset process, (b) disentangle major interactions between program content, participant, provider, and setting factors as they determine impact, and (c) ensure both that diffusion is based on empirically grounded principles and that the process is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated. Sufficient evidence supports the tentative conclusion that social influence curricula can be efficacious--at least with some youth. However, we lack key information for diffusion, in particular concerning provider and setting factors. Thus, a cautious advance to diffusion research is recommended, noting that there is much we do not know, and that the public health need for applications must be balanced with continuing research to clarify for whom and under what circumstances current curricula work. At the same time, there should be strong continuing research to improve current interventions, especially for high risk populations.",Annual review of public health,1988,United States,1988,80
3175556,The role of personal beliefs and social influences as determinants of respirator use among construction painters.,"The purpose of this study was to identify and rank potential determinants of respirator use among painters in the construction industry. As part of a health survey of union painters, 169 male spray painters were questioned about their own beliefs concerning the consequences of wearing cartridge respirators, as well as about the perceived attitudes of others in the workplace toward respirators. Intended respirator use was more strongly associated with beliefs than was past use. The most important beliefs concerned discomfort or inconvenience. Other determinants that were associated with respirator use were respirator availability, cigarette smoking, and social influences. It was concluded that the most effective intervention strategy to increase respirator use would be multidimensional and that efforts to change only a worker's beliefs may have limited success.","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",1988 Aug,Finland,1988,80
2738616,A measure of survival time for long-term follow-up studies of the elderly.,"Studies of determinants of longevity in the elderly by means of a follow-up study are usually based on samples with a wide age range and some selectivity. This poses the problem of constructing a measure of longevity that: (1) will make subjects in the sample comparable regarding survival time, independent of their age and sex; (2) is suitable for long-term follow-up studies; (3) can be used to check the absence or presence of selectivity of the sample with regard to longevity; (4) improves the comparability of studies with different designs and sampling schemes; (5) can take the mortality development over time into account. An individual measure of survival time is presented that satisfies these requirements: the realized probability of dying (RPD). Its construction is described. The RPD is derived from population life tables based on age, year of birth, and sex. For each subject, the relative position on the survival curve within the birth cohort is determined. In an illustration, the RPD is applied to data from a 28-year follow-up study of the elderly in the Netherlands. A comparison is made with other survival measures commonly used in this type of study. It is concluded that the RPD is a powerful and valid measure of longevity in elderly subjects, and that it can be useful in the study of determinants of longevity.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,1989,United States,1989,80

Two sets of factors are examined: social characteristics of the adopters are used to test Rogers's and Shoemaker's contention that discontinuers have more traditional values than continuers; and the adoption decision process is analyzed to identify the relationship of communication factors to discontinuance. Although number of children and experience of method problems were the major determinants of discontinuance, unfavorable information from friends and other birth control users was a significant factor.

7226684,Teenage pregnancy in perspective.,"In an effort to provide the clinician with suggestions for preventive and remedial approaches to adolescent pregnancy, the nature, medical, social, economic, and psychological aspects of the problem are reviewed and discussed. While the rate of adolescent pregnancy is declining, there are more than 560,000 deliveries to teenagers annually. Medical risks are significantly diminished by early and comprehensive prenatal care. The major complications continue to be social and economic. Lower I.Q.s in offspring of adolescent mothers have been reported. Failure to complete high school significantly increases the risk of unemployment, trapping the premature parent and her offspring in a web of poverty. A lack of a sense of future and viable alternatives may legitimize the option of motherhood in the minds of many adolescent girls. Furthermore, an ignorance and a denial of sexuality combined with the developmental imperatives of experimentation and rebellion place the adolescent at high risk for pregnancy.",Clinical pediatrics,1981 May,United States,1981,80
4035721,The impact of development and population policies on fertility in India.,"This article examines the impact of development and population policies on fertility decline and regional variations in India during the 1970s. Indicators of development at the household level include female literacy and education, infant mortality, and poverty; at the village level they include availability of such social services as schools, medical facilities, and transportation and communication facilities. Multiple regression analysis of data aggregated at the state level demonstrates that conditions conducive to fertility decline include high adult female literacy and low infant mortality as indicators of social development, and high contraceptive use and, to a lesser extent, high female age at marriage as proximate determinants of fertility. There are reasons to believe that India's national family planning program contributed to the decline in fertility observed since the 1960s. The pace of fertility decline in the future will depend upon the pace of infant mortality decline, enhancement in female education, and improvements in family planning programs.",Studies in family planning,1985 Jul-Aug,United States,1985,80

Fertility (children ever-born) and mortality (number of children who had died postnatally) data were obtained from interviews, along with data on the characteristics of the mothers, fathers, and the households. Contraceptive use was recorded on a subsample of 167 mothers of 5-year old children. Following factor analyses, three variables were selected for analysis: Years of schooling of the father and the mother and the type of fuel used for cooking. Father's education and type of fuel were significantly related to maternal fertility, while only the educational attainment of the mother was related to child mortality and survival. When contraceptive use was included in the ANCOVA in the subsample, it was a significant determinant of fertility, while father's education became nonsignificant. In terms of mortality, contraceptive use was a significant determinant, while the significance of the mother's education fell to a borderline value (P = 0.084).",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,1989,United States,1989,80

2700144,"Sexual behaviour in pregnancy, after childbirth and during breast-feeding.","Sexual and marital relationships change throughout marriage and the transition to parenthood can be seen as a psychosocial crisis. Recent studies do not support the finding of Masters and Johnson (1966) that there is a mid-trimester rise in sexual responsiveness. Sexual behaviour decreases towards the end of pregnancy and a number of studies have found that in the majority of mothers there is only a slow return to pre-pregnancy levels in the first postnatal year. Some of the factors influencing the rate of return are discussed. Breast-feeding is important because of the hormonal changes it produces and it has been said to stimulate sexual feelings in both mother and baby. There is some evidence that breast-feeding has an adverse effect on sexuality in the first postnatal year. It is not clear whether this could be related to differences in hormone levels or differences in feeding behaviour. Fatigue and contraception have largely been ignored in studies of factors influencing postnatal sexual behaviour. Women who went on to breast-feed were found to be very similar on antenatal measures of sexual behaviour to those who went on to bottle-feed. The method of feeding is the major influence on the hormonal status, and the experience of painful intercourse reported by breast-feeding mothers may be related to low oestrogen levels. Breast-feeding persistence is influenced by both social and psychological factors and its effect on sexual behaviour is discussed.",Bailliere's clinical obstetrics and gynaecology,1989 Dec,England,1989,80
4031402,Relevance of personality traits to adjustment in group living situations.,"The study replicates and extends recent work on personality determinants of adjustment. Personality traits and adjustment criteria were selected for relevance to one type of real-life setting (public housing for the elderly that includes a senior center). Personality traits were measured by observer ratings; criteria, by self-report of respondents and perceptions of them by other residents and staff. In concurrent and longitudinal analyses controlling effects of competence and social status, personality traits accounted for significant and meaningful variance in all criteria, and the salience of particular traits varied across criteria. The results are consistent with earlier studies regarding the importance of extraversion and neuroticism to subjective well-being and suggest that they are relevant also to adjustment as perceived by others. The additional traits of congeniality, culture, and nosiness/gossip were related to both inner and outer adjustment measures in the type of situations studied.",Journal of gerontology,1985 Sep,United States,1985,80

Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension.",Medical care,1983 Oct,United States,1983,80
20841128,Psychosocial environment: a health promotion model.,"This article presents a multidimensional model of psychosocial determinants of health behavior for health promotion research and policy analysis. Frequently, health promotion focuses almost exclusively on intrapsychic determinants and on individual level behavior. Based upon Field Theory and attitude theories, this proposed model holds that in populations with comparable sociodemographic and biological status (exogenous variables) a health behavior is a function of direct and interaction effects of five key intrapsychic and external variables. These are: behavioral intentions, social support, accessibility of means for action, personal autonomy, and action situation. Empirical tests with cross-cultural studies in Venezuela, Kenya, and the Philippines provide substantial support for the model. The findings suggest that while health promotion strategies should deal with intrapsychic determinants of behavior, key extrapsychic factors (such as social support, quality and accessibility of health care measures, and situational factors) all have direct and independent effects on health behavior as well. Health promotion research and interventions which aim exclusively at intrapsychic determinants would thus have rather limited overall value. The article discusses key research and policy implications of the model presented.",International quarterly of community health education,1983 Jan 1,United States,1983,80
12280179,Distinctively elderly mobility: types and determinants.,"""Distinctive types of mobility are identified for the [U.S.] elderly, many of whom also move for traditional reasons. Using a longitudinal data set from adult residents in Rhode Island, univariate, chi square, and logit analyses indicate associations between sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly and their mobility behavior. Mobility for assistance reasons is associated with older age, unmarried status, higher previous mobility, and renter status. Mobility in preparation for aging (e.g., to an elderly complex) is more likely for unmarried, previously mobile residents. Out-of-state mobility to amenity destinations is not limited to the elderly, but younger, married, more affluent elderly were more likely to make such moves.""",Economic geography,1985 Jan,United States,1985,80
7372385,Determinants of the occupational strategies adopted by British hospital nurses.,"This paper focuses on the position of the nurse in the division of labor in health care and the occupational strategies British hospital nurses have adopted in response to their changing employement situation. The authors suggest a Marxist framework as an alternative to current approaches to the study of occupational strategy, which tend to focus on the level of distribution relations. An adequate analysis of the situation of hospital nurses, the paper suggests, depends upon locating the occupation within the wider setting of the mode of control and delivery of health care. The central feature of this setting is the dominance of medicine and medical technology, and the main factors shaping it are the activities of individual capitalists involved in the health industry and the State operating within the constraints of capital in general and within the context of class struggle. It is suggested that the characteristic feature of nurses' occupational strategy--the vacillation between professionalism and unionism--can best be understood in relation to the changing mode of control and delivery of health care and nurses' contradictory position within the social relations that constitute that mode.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1980,United States,1980,80
28514037,"Socioeconomic correlates of fertility, mortality, and child survival in mothers from a disadvantaged, urban Guatemalan community.","Social and economic determinants of fertility, mortality, and child survival were studied in a sample of 519 mothers from EL Progreso, a disadvantaged community located on the outskirts of Guatemala city. Fertility (children ever-born) and mortality (number of children who had died postnatally) data were obtained from interviews, along with data on the characteristics of the mothers, fathers, and the households. Contraceptive use was recorded on a subsample of 167 mothers of 5-year old children. Following factor analyses, three variables were selected for analysis: Years of schooling of the father and the mother and the type of fuel used for cooking. Father's education and type of fuel were significantly related to maternal fertility, while only the educational attainment of the mother was related to child mortality and survival. When contraceptive use was included in the ANCOVA in the subsample, it was a significant determinant of fertility, while father's education became nonsignificant. In terms of mortality, contraceptive use was a significant determinant, while the significance of the mother's education fell to a borderline value (P = 0.084).",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,1989,United States,1989,80
3819251,Biological and sociocultural determinants of successful lactation among women in eastern Connecticut.,"Postpartum factors affecting the duration of lactation were identified for 250 women through a telephone survey. The survey examined the behaviors and attitudes of women who had chosen to nurse and who were still nursing at 2 weeks postpartum. Sixty percent of the mothers nursed their infants after delivery. However, by 10 weeks postpartum, only 34% of the babies were still breast fed. By self-report, the most significant factors associated with the maintenance of lactation at 10 weeks were related to perinatal hospital protocol, especially letting the infant suckle soon after birth. Other significant predictors of successful lactation outcome included early milk ""let down,"" little use of supplemental formula, the mother's expectation at parturition of an extended nursing period, her feeling well and being satisfied with her body weight, her previous successful experience with lactation, and her perception that she feeds her infant on demand. Few of the women who had stopped nursing after 2 weeks sought advice on breast feeding from anyone other than the pediatrician. Most coped with their nursing problems themselves. The data reinforce the importance of labor and delivery practices that support early maternal-infant contact. They also suggest the use of infant health indexes and weight and height percentile placement records rather than reliance solely on weight gain as the index of lactation adequacy. Further, they indicate the need for clinical intervention before 2 weeks postpartum.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1987 Mar,United States,1987,80
7467670,[Conditions and processes of aging - biographical determinants].,"The high degree of interindividual variability of processes of aging is mentioned and biographical factors influencing age stage and processes of aging were analyzed. A review of empirical biographical studies is presented, which emphasize a conceptualization of behavior in older age at the interaction of past experience, current situation, and future time perspective of the individual. As an example it is discussed how the mother experiences and reacts to her last child's leaving home (""empty-nest-reaction""). An analysis of the data of the BLSA (1965-1977) demonstrated many patterns of change. It could be shown that there exists consistency as well as variability in personality variables. It could be shown that the biographical and social context was closely related to these interindividual differences in consistency and change. Conditions are multidimensional rather than uniform. This high degree of interindividual variability of change calls for a differential gerontology.",Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie,1980 Sep-Oct,Germany,1980,80
6701567,"Social support and mental health: direct, protective and compensatory effects.","This study deals with the relationship between social support and mental health. This relationship was conceptualized as a multi-faceted one which may be understood in terms of direct (main), protective (buffering) and compensatory effects. Hypotheses relating to these effects were evaluated in terms of spousal/community support and job strains (pressure, autonomy, opportunities) among a sample of 455 married males who were employed on a full-time basis. Results indicated that spousal support generally had more important implications for psychological well-being than did community support. However, the relative impact of these different sources of support appeared to be related to the degree to which the mental health symptomology reported was affectively defined. With respect to protective effects, spousal support was found to moderate the relationship between certain job strains (pressure) and mental health. No protective effects were found for community support. Tests of the hypothesis that community support compensates for low levels of spousal support were made in terms of both direct and protective effects. No direct effect compensation was observed. However, protective effect compensation was observed for certain job strains (opportunities) and was relevant to a wide range of symptomology. The overall results suggest a primary/secondary hierarchy of supports and strains in which primary supports (e.g. spousal) assume a protective function with respect to secondary strains (e.g. job) while secondary supports (e.g. community) do not protect individuals from primary strains (e.g. spousal). Secondary supports have a protective function for secondary strains in the absence of primary supports. It is further suggested that sex roles may be important determinants of the availability and use of different support sources.",Social science & medicine (1982),1984,England,1984,80

2740928,"Migration, acculturation and utilization of primary health care.","This study explored the roles of acculturation, urban-rural provenance and length of residence as determinants of the utilization pattern of first line health services by Moroccan, Turkish and Italian migrants in Belgium. Concurrently, utilization characteristics were recorded in Belgian reference patients. With increasing acculturation the demand for preventive care decreased, vague complaints became more prevalent, the delay before consulting for a curative problem shortened and the prognosis improved. There was no correlation between the occurrence of psychological problems and acculturation but, except for 15-44 year old female migrants, the rate of social problems was negatively associated with this study factor. Migrants with an urban background consulted earlier and presented more frequently vague complaints than migrants from rural provenance. We observed no significant influence of length of residence on utilization characteristics and only a marginal influence on morbidity pattern. Although acculturation seems to be a strong determinant of the migrant's utilization pattern of primary health care services, it does not consistently lead to a decrease of utilization differentials with the Belgian reference population. This may imply that there is a need for public health interventions targeted at ethnic minorities.",Social science & medicine (1982),1989,England,1989,80

They were then tested twice a week individually and twice a week socially from 2 to 6 1/2 months of age in a playroom, utilizing multiple categories of behavior. The mother-only-reared juveniles were hyperactive in both object play (when tested individually) and social play. The brooder-only-reared kittens displayed enhanced socially directed behavior and were generally hypergregarious, whereas the brooder-littermate-reared kittens displayed retarded social behavior. Observations indicated that littermate-deprived kittens did not learn social communication skills and that some prolonged separation effects existed for littermate-reared kittens. The results suggest that the determinants of social play are more complex than the determinants of object play.",Developmental psychobiology,1980 May,United States,1980,80

An experimental population of Clethrionomys rufocanus consisting of laboratory-raised individuals with known origin and life history was introduced to a realistic competitive situation in the field. Successful females could be distinguished from nonsuccessful females on the basis of four individual attributes measured 25 d after they were released on the study plot, whereas males could not. The most consistent determinant of competitive success seemed to be the sex ratio of the litters in which females were born. Successful females originated from litters with a strongly female-biased sex ratio.

3434387,School counselors as gatekeepers: guidance in poor versus affluent neighborhoods.,"Previous studies reveal that career guidance is usually based on a mixture of meritocratic criteria (academic ability and achievement) and nonmeritocratic considerations (students' SES and their social labeling by counselors). The present study argues that school counselors in affluent neighborhoods emphasize the meritocratic criteria, while those in poorer neighborhoods tend to focus on the more nonmeritocratic. This hypothesis is examined in a random sample of 210 male, primary school graduates from the 10 state schools of an Israeli town, 125 of whom are from schools in affluent neighborhoods, and 85 from schools in poorer neighborhoods. A path analysis of determinants of guidance to specific high school tracks shows that students' ethnicity and labeling as problematic directly affect guidance by counselors only in the poor neighborhoods. The effect of students' ""problems"" is due to their being labeled as problematic with respect to psychological or physical attributes rather than to behavioral problems at school. The findings are subsequently interpreted as reflecting a patronizing attitude toward lower status students by counselors. Additional studies which may further elaborate the determinants of guidance in poor versus affluent neighborhoods are proposed.",Adolescence,1987 Fall,United States,1987,80
3305594,Perceptions of body size and obesity: a selected review of the literature.,"In this article, the literature on body image and related obesity perceptions is discussed. Research findings which span a 20 year period are summarized. Initially, Cheryl Rittenbaugh's concept of obesity as 'a culture bound syndrome' serves as a rationale for understanding sociocultural dimensions of body size perceptions. In this regard, the premise that perceptions of obesity and overweight have cultural determinants is substantiated in the reviewed literature. Societal preferences for body build and size and attitudes about weight are examined as a framework for understanding the impact that social perceptions have on individuals who are either overweight or obese. As a result of negative attitudes toward fatness, stigmatization of overweight people has been consistently documented. In related studies, investigators have centered on self-perceptions of obese and overweight individuals. According to the data, the existence of body image disturbance among extremely overweight individuals is a common phenomenon. However, evidence is also presented that suggests that normal weight individuals (especially women) may also have difficulty in accurately assessing their body size. The final focus of this paper is the relationship between body image and weight change behavior. As indicated in the discussion, this area of research has received the least amount of attention in the literature, and the present findings are contradictory. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research directions.",Journal of community health,1987 Summer-Fall,Netherlands,1987,80
3300728,The phenomenon of famine.,"Famines are sustained, extreme shortages of food among discrete populations sufficient to cause high rates of mortality. Signs and symptoms of prolonged food deprivation include loss of fat and subcutaneous tissue, depression, apathy, and weakness, which progress to immobility and death of the individual, often from superimposed respiratory or other infections. The social consequences of famines are disruption from mass migrations of people in search of food, breakdown of social behavior, abandonment of cooperative effort, loss of personal pride and sense of family ties, and finally a struggle for individual survival. Famines have been common ever since the development of agriculture made human settlements possible. Food shortages due to crop failures caused by natural disasters including poor weather, insect plagues, and plant diseases; crop destruction due to warfare; and enforced starvation as a political tool are by no means the only causative factors. Many of the worst famines have been due to poor distribution of existing food supplies, either because of inequities that result in a lack of purchasing power on the part of the poor or because of political interference with normal distribution or relief movements of food. Europe and Asia, which in the past experienced frequent severe famines, sometimes with deaths in the hundreds of thousands or millions, have now largely eliminated famines through social and technological change. However, in Africa, political and social factors have destroyed the capacity of many populations to survive drought-induced variations in local food supplies and prices. Thus, famines are due to varying combinations of inadequacy of food supplies for whatever reason and the inability of populations to acquire food because of poverty, civil disturbances, or political interference. Despite the role of natural causes, the conclusion is inescapable that modern famines, like most of those in history, are man-made.",Annual review of nutrition,1987,United States,1987,80

Ninety-five domestic chicks were reared in either a social environment or physical (tactile) isolation, and half in each rearing condition were reared and/or tested under conditions of visual restriction. As expected, social rearing was prerequisite to the manifestation of extended death feigning; however, the incidence and duration of death-feigning was attenuated by functional visual isolation of socially reared chicks during either rearing or testing. It was concluded that visual novelty of the environment is the minimal condition for sustained death feigning by young chicks in the daylight hours.",The American journal of psychology,1980 Jun,United States,1980,80

Nothing is known about the ecology of sexual abuse, and studies of physical abuse and neglect have done little more than demonstrate co-variation between reported incidence and neighborhood population and housing characteristics. Study findings reveal that (a) five of the seven community characteristics are significant and independent correlates of neglect, and four are correlates of abuse; (b) the strongest predictors of both types of maltreatment are percentage of families with income less than 200% of poverty and percent of vacant housing; and (c) the pattern of co-variation between the two economic stress indicators and three inadequate social support indicators are consistent with the ecological hypothesis.

A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour.",The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,1989 Dec,England,1989,80

3749967,"Rumor, misinformation and oral contraceptive use in Egypt.",Rumor and misinformation about oral contraceptives continue to prevail in much of Egypt. This study tests the hypothesis that rumor involvement can have a negative and independent impact on pill usage by focusing on a common misbelief that the pill causes 'weakness'. The data comes from a 1981-1982 national self-weighted sample survey of 3283 currently married men and women dealing with family planning and mass media behaviors. The analyses confirm that rumor involvement decreases the probability of current or future pill use by previous users and by those who have never used it. Correct knowledge about the pill is shown to enhance pill usage as do other determinants such as social support for birth control and the desire for no more children. The importance of providing strong contraceptive education programs giving deeper consideration to contraceptive and related health beliefs in delivering fertility regulation services is highlighted.,Social science & medicine (1982),1986,England,1986,80
3407490,Parents' behavioral norms as predictors of adolescent sexual activity and contraceptive use.,"The influence of parental factors on adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive use has been examined previously, and findings have been contradictory. Previous studies, which found little relationship between parental norms and adolescent sexual activity, have been limited by their failure to recognize developmental differences in the relative weight of parent and peer influences between younger and older teens and by use of selected samples, resulting in a restriction of range. The current study differs in that it utilizes a clustered sample household survey of 329 males and females, aged 14 to 17, and 470 of their parents. Using multiple regression analysis, it was found that parents' reported behavioral norms account for 5% of the variance in whether adolescents have had intercourse, and for 33% of the variance in use of contraception at last intercourse. The study suggests that while parents' normative beliefs have limited effect in the decision to become sexually active, they have considerable impact on later contraceptive use.",Adolescence,1988 Summer,United States,1988,80
6504868,Economics and extended longevity: a case study.,"Preventive and therapeutic advances have brought life expectancy in the United States to well over 70 years and have shifted mortality causes from acute to chronic diseases, the determinants of which are genetics, lifestyle, the environment, and aging itself. Plausible approaches to chronic disease prevention are likely to increase longevity further, with some foreseeable effects on demographic and economic projections. Primarily, longevity advances would swell forecasts of population size, and would thus have to be met by production advances in order to maintain or improve living standards. This study, a restricted example, considers the probable demographic and economic consequences of a limited prevention program in the context of the Ford Motor Company, based on actual experience and certain expectations up to the year 2000. According to the results, prevention would reduce outlays for life insurance, disability, and health care, but would also generate the higher costs of extending pension plans. Undoubtedly, prevention will continue to be highly ranked in society's pursuit of happiness, and society must prepare to meet its effects with appropriate social and economic policies.",Preventive medicine,1984 Jul,United States,1984,80

10301136,Planning and management for health in periods of economic stringency and instability: a contingency approach.,"The mid-1970s marked the end of the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in history, and initiated in Europe--and other parts of the world--a period of economic stagnation and instability. Along with the prosperity explosion of the past, the pattern of health problems has changed and is still changing. Moreover, the demand for health care has kept on rising, without much improvement of health status in general. Thus, there is a critical need to rethink policies, and to ensure that future changes occur within the limits of shrinking resources and the allotted time-span. In particular, the change in priorities envisaged by the Health for All 2000 (HFA 2000) strategies will need to take place against the background of an ageing population, social instability, and continuing development of new lifestyles and persistent economic scarcity. It is by analysing that background that this article seeks to make recommendations as to how health planning and management might successfully cope with the policy reorientation of the HFA 2000 strategy. The structure of this article is as follows. Firstly, the changes taking place in planning conditions will be reviewed, and form the basis of a framework for subsequent analysis of the planning environment. Following this framework, some of the conflicts likely to be faced in planning and management will be discussed, many of which are the consequence of economic stringency and instability. Also the requirements for an improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of planning will be identified. Finally, a limited number of approaches to planning will be considered, for their appropriateness to the present-day economic circumstances. The point of view elucidated throughout is that there is no single solution which is 'best' under all circumstances. The conclusion, rather, is that the selection of particular theory or method of planning and management should depend both on the objectives of the decision maker and on the determinants of the planning environment. General prescriptions should not be made. At the same time, some elements have to be stressed in all types of planning, namely: the orientation towards outcomes or outputs of problems; the attention to long-term strategic thinking; and, the application of more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic approaches.",The International journal of health planning and management,1986 Apr-Jun,England,1986,80
20841084,Factors in consistency between attitudes and behavior: implications for policies and programs.,"The paper deals with the factors which affect contraceptive attitudes, behaviors, and the relationship between the two. The analysis is based upon original survey data from 2,446 women in Venezuela and related literature. The results suggest that both positive attitudes and contraceptive accessibility are major determinants of contraception but at the aggregate level neither has a decisive advantage over the other. The three best predictors of contraceptive use are: specific contraceptive attitudes, social support, and accessibility of contraceptives. Their impacts on behavior are direct and additive; however, their impacts vary significantly by education and number of living children. In general attitude change strategy is more effective with younger women while improving accessibility affects older women more often. Implications for policy and programs are presented.",International quarterly of community health education,1981 Jan 1,United States,1981,80

The theory was based on the results of brain damage (encephalopathy) research, which distinguishes between primary and secondary symptoms of mental retardation. The importance of social factors such as family conditions for development was demonstrated in a variety of studies, including research with adopted children. Positive results have been achieved with early education programming for developmentally disabled children, as well as with medical treatment for some genetically induced metabolic disorders. Results from longitudinal studies suggest that intelligence continues to develop in educable mentally retarded adolescents. New diagnostic methods have been developed; test of motor skills, visuomotor coordination, and a developmental test for young infants.

2916712,Determinants of recovery 12 months after hip fracture: the importance of psychosocial factors.,"The independent contributions to recovery from hip fracture of psychosocial factors including depression, personality, social connectedness, and self-rated health were studied in 219 women age 59 and older (mean age 78.5) who were community dwelling prior to fracture. Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery.",American journal of public health,1989 Mar,United States,1989,80

Social class, marital status, employment status, and distance from health centre, all show small but significant associations with self-referral. For social class the effect appears to be mediated by symptoms. People in social classes IV and V, women who are widowed, divorced or separated, and people who live near the health centre are more likely to visit their general practitioner.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1983,England,1983,80
2746717,Psychological and environmental determinants of relapse in crack cocaine smokers.,"The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations.",Journal of substance abuse treatment,1989,United States,1989,80
3292101,Drugs in human milk. Clinical pharmacokinetic considerations.,"Drugs ingested by a lactating mother would be expected to appear in human milk to some extent and be ingested by a breast-feeding infant. Drugs pass from maternal plasma into milk by passive diffusion and are distributed within the aqueous, protein and lipid phases of milk. Distribution into milk will be affected by physiochemical characteristics of the drug: acid-base characteristics, relative protein binding in plasma and milk, and lipid solubility, as well as milk composition. The milk-to-plasma concentration ratio is the most commonly quoted index of drug distribution into human milk. However, calculation of the daily infant dose of drug ingested in milk, and from this the dose in milk relative to the maternal dose on a weight-adjusted basis, is a more relevant indicator of infant exposure to a drug. This is particularly true for drugs with a high volume of distribution, for which only a small proportion of the mother's dose is contained within the plasma and available for distribution into milk. A better indication of infant exposure to a drug is the steady-state plasma drug concentration in a breast-feeding infant, the major determinants of which are the dose rate (via milk) and the oral availability and clearance in the infant. Although in neonates the rate of absorption may be different from adults, there is little evidence that its extent is significantly different. Clearance, however, is impaired in very young infants, particularly if premature. The decreased clearance would result in a proportional increase in steady-state plasma concentrations in the breast-feeding infant. Consideration of the dose ingested in milk and the approximate clearance in infants of different ages allows estimation of likely steady-state plasma concentrations in breast-feeding infants. From these considerations, recommendations regarding the safety of drugs during breast-feeding can be made. Drugs which are very toxic or have dose-independent toxicity should be considered separately. Recommendations regarding 'social' drugs such as nicotine, alcohol, caffeine and theobromine are particularly difficult, as doses are uncontrolled and vary variable.",Clinical pharmacokinetics,1988 Apr,Switzerland,1988,80

Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods.",Journal of biosocial science. Supplement,1989,England,1989,80
3060449,Determinants of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays: a pilot study.,"Estimates of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays have always been varied, and given Medicare's new Prospective Payment System (PPS) based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), they are likely to have changed again. Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement.",Health services research,1988 Dec,United States,1988,80

3566318,Prolonged exclusive breast feeding and heredity as determinants in infantile atopy.,"We followed 183 infants for two years, 31 of whom were breast fed less than three and a half months (median 70 days; short breast feeding group) and a further 31 of whom were exclusively breast fed for more than nine months (long breast feeding group). We assessed heredity for atopy, number of infections, and duration of breast feeding as determinants of atopy. During the first year of life 14 infants has signs of atopy. During the second year parents reported signs of atopy in a further 31. Heredity was the only significant predictor of atopy. Atopy was seen in 33% of infants with a positive heredity and in 16% without family history for atopy. The duration of breast feeding affected the incidence of atopy only among the infants without family history for atopy: fewer in the short breast feeding group (1/18) had atopy than in the long breast feeding group (5/13). Duration of breast feeding did not associate with incidence of respiratory infections. Diarrhoea was more common in the short breast feeding group than in the long breast feeding group during the first year of life. We conclude that prolonging exclusive breast feeding from the median of 70 days to nine months did not contribute to the prevention of infantile atopy and respiratory tract infections.",Archives of disease in childhood,1987 Mar,England,1987,80

In six studies involving 11,000 adults resident in the USA, France and Denmark forced expiratory volume in 1 second was related to social class and/or one of a number of other factors including education, area of residence and housing status. Trends in three other studies involving approximately 15,000 children resident in the UK and the USA were similar.

The hypothesis that the health care belief model would be predictive of medication-taking behavior was validated. A pilot study was constructed which investigated the comparative responses of compliant and noncompliant epileptic outpatients to questions regarding demographic, clinical history, and attitudinal characteristics. Noncompliant patients were characterized as having a longer duration of epilepsy, more complicated dosage regimens, and more changes in medication. In addition, noncompliant patients both demonstrated more confusion over medication directions and less insight into the need for anticonvulsants and feared addiction to their medication. They had a lower level of satisfaction with their health care and were more frequently subject to the social complications of epilepsy. The authors suggest that a more holistic approach be taken when attempting to reverse noncompliant behavior.",Drug intelligence & clinical pharmacy,1981 Jul-Aug,United States,1981,80

6736597,"The determinants of health policy, a case study: regulating safety and health at the workplace in Sweden.","This article analyzes and criticizes the "" technocratic "" view of occupational health and safety policies, which sees the values of the personnel in ""post-industrial"" regulatory agencies as the most important determinant of those policies. It takes an alternate position, which explains occupational health and safety policies as primarily resulting from the different degrees of political power of the two major classes (capital and labor), and from the set of influences exerted on the regulatory agencies by the instruments (e.g., parties, unions, trade organizations) of those classes. It shows how an analysis of the historical evolution of those classes in Sweden and their conflict in both civil and political societies explains Swedish occupational health and safety policies better than a mere analysis of the regulators' views. And it concludes that the occupational health and safety policies in Sweden are not identical to those in the U.S.--as the "" technocratic "" theorists assume--but rather offer more protection to the workers than U.S. policies do. This situation is a result of labor having more power in Sweden than it has in the U.S. The different class formations and class behavior in the two societies are compared, and the implications of this comparison for occupational health and safety policies are discussed.","Journal of health politics, policy and law",1984 Spring,United States,1984,80

3234016,On the expression of psychosis in different cultures: schizophrenia in an Indian and in a Nigerian community.,"This sub-study of the WHO Determinants of Outcome of Severe Mental Disorders research project was aimed at characterizing the behavioral and expressive qualities of schizophrenia in two highly diverse cultures. Early research has indicated that the core elements involving affect, perceptual and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia are highly similar in form in most cultures of the world. Much of the cross-cultural literature emphasizes, however, strong differences in the ways in which schizophrenia is actually expressed and manifested in different settings. The basic methodology for psychiatric description and diagnosis in the WHO program was the Present State Examination. In five of the field centers a method for investigating the expressive quality and the social behavior of patients in their own communities through the eyes of significant others was applied. This method was then subjected to psychometric tests of cross-cultural applicability and found to be valid for comparing behavior across settings. The expressive patterns of the Indian and Nigerian patients were studied from two perspectives. Indian schizophrenics were described by family members as manifesting a more affective and ""self-centered"" orientation; the Nigerian patients presented with a highly suspicious, bizarre, anxious quality to the basic behavioral pattern. The main features of pathology were in general accord with the descriptions of indigenous psychiatrists. The special qualities of the psychosis in the two cultures were interpreted against the background of traditional psychopathological and anthropologic theories concerning the psychodynamics and the influence of differing social conflictual themes in the two cultures. Analysis of psychopathology in this manner was found to enhance understanding of underlying mechanisms and the role of cultural conflicts in its expression.","Culture, medicine and psychiatry",1988 Sep,Netherlands,1988,80

22077172,"Social, cultural, and economic determinants of age at birth of first child in Peninsular Malaysia.","Summary In order to unravel the complex set of the determinants of fertility, we suggest that the child-bearing process be separated into a sequence of events and intervals. As the first step in the child-bearing process, age at first birth is a critical variable. Using data from the 1966-67 West Malaysia Family Survey, we formulate and test a model of the cultural, social and economic determinants of the timing of first birth among a sample of mothers, aged 30-44. Social origins, measured by the woman's father's occupation and the woman's birthplace are not important determinants, but education, early work experience, and ethnicity exercise very strong effects on the age at first birth. Age at first marriage mediates much of the effect of background variables, which suggest that there is little use of contraception to plan the first birth interval. The strong effect of ethnicity is consistent with a cultural interpretation, but important qualifications are noted.",Population studies,1980 Nov,England,1980,80

2709190,A hypothesis for the pathogenesis of essential hypertension: the initiating factors.,"A longitudinal study of rural-urban migration from a low blood pressure community was completed in 1985. It is suggested that the rapid increase in blood pressure observed with acculturation in this study constitutes a new dynamic model for the early phase of human essential hypertension. Analysis of data derived from this study indicates that increases in dietary sodium, weight gain and sympathetic tone (possibly reflecting acute environmental stress) are important determinants of the early blood pressure rise. It is proposed that a defence reaction occurs in response to environmental stress which maintains or increases cardiorenal sympathetic outflow, thereby overriding the negative feedback inhibition of sympathetic activity which otherwise occurs when dietary sodium is suddenly increased. The antinatriuretic response results in an early volume-dependent rise in blood pressure. We also propose that variation in individual blood pressure responses to migration may be explained not only by quantum differences in the two environmental factors, but also by a genetically-determined failure of adaptation to the combined effects of these stimuli on renal tubular reabsorption of sodium.",Journal of hypertension.

One-hundred forty-seven elders, 9 per cent of the original cohort, entered a LTC institution during the six-year investigation. Using logistic multiple regression, we examine the predictive power of 19 independent variables grouped into six categories: demographic characteristics, attitude, social context, long-term care needs, physical disability, and mental/emotional disability. Five variables are significantly related to institutionalization: advancing age, using ambulatory aids, mental disorientation, living alone, and using assistance to perform ""instrumental"" ADL (activities of daily living). These results may be helpful to those trying to target non-institutional services to elders for use as substitutes for institutional long-term care.

A total fertility rate (TFR) of 0.75 births per woman is estimated from the model, compared with a TFR of 1.24 actually observed from the survey. The estimated TFR (0.75) results from the assumed total fecundity (TF) of 15.30 births per woman being inhibited by the indexes of the proximate determinants of fertility, most notably non-marriage (.280), contraception (.315), and induced abortion (.586). The effects of two other proximate determinants, lactational infecundability and spousal separation, were negligible. Comparative data from other countries confirm that the study area has very low levels of fertility and marriage, a very high prevalence of induced abortion, and a small effect of lactational infecundability. The extremely low level of fertility was, thus, achieved through a high level of induced abortion. Future research needs and policy implications associated with the study are discussed.",Studies in family planning,1987 Jul-Aug,United States,1987,80
4076484,Rural-urban mobility in Thailand: a decision-making approach.,"This paper has analyzed a theoretical model of mobility decision-making. The model relies entirely on individual-level factors rather than macro-level factors as determinants of migration decision-making. The individual-level variables included in the model are: recent mobility history, urban social contacts, information about urban areas, evaluations of different locations, migration plans, and actual movements in the period subsequent to an initial interview. The empirical results indicate that with some exceptions there are relatively strong links of the type suggested in the model among these variables. The model was evaluated separately for two groups of villages for movement to Bangkok and for movement to Northeast Thai towns. Thus, four submodels were estimated, providing an opportunity to observe how robust the model is with respect to varying destinations and origins. Although certain differences are found among the four submodels, the overwhelming feature is their similarity. Where differences do exist, they generally reflect differences in the effectiveness of prior mobility as a predictor of other variables in the process. Clearly, a villager's previous history of movement is a key factor affecting subsequent movement and the entire decision-making process. The primary effect of having friends and relatives in a particular urban center is to increase the amount of information a villager has about that urban center. Information has a significant effect on evaluations and plans. Except in one submodel, evaluations have a significant effect on plans; and the existence of plans--which to some extent represent a culmination of social contacts, information, and evaluations--is the only factor other than previous mobility which has a significant direct effect on subsequent movement. Thai policy makers are searching for ways to stimulate the growth of regional urban growth centers and reduce the growth of Bangkok. From the standpoint of intervention, a key variable in this process would appear to be information. Not only is information level related to evaluations of an urban area and mobility plans, but, compared to other variables in the model, it appears to be relatively amenable to modification by inputs deriving from a source external to the village itself. It appears difficult to modify evaluations or migration plans directly, though both could be indirectly influenced by informational inputs. Movement history would be difficult, if not impossible, to manipulate; while villagers could be sponsored for short trips to town, this is not likely to produce much long-range effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Demography,1985 Nov,United States,1985,80
6106945,Economic aspects of village health.,"Given the poor quantity and quality of medical care in most villages in the developing countries, the economic determinants of village health are the supply of labour, the cash flow associated with that labour and the availability of land. The paper examines these in the three classical 'time periods', arguing that inability to meet labour peaks is of great significance in explaining seasonal shortage of food and chronic shortage of cash. It also explains community indifference to upkeep of social overhead capital. Substitution of capital goods for labour is socially differentiated, not least by labour availability, and leads inevitably to a regressive distribution of land and the creation or enlargement of a class of landless labourers. Under certain limited conditions this class may enjoy a rising real income with associated health-promotive expenditures. The more normal case, however, is extreme poverty, whether rural or urban, with all that that implies for the undermining of health. Land reform therefore becomes a necessary precondition of health promotion.","Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences",1980 Jul 28,England,1980,80

An emphasis on the interventions directed at control of the above mentioned variables may prove most helpful in reducing infant and child mortality in a rural area.",Indian journal of pediatrics,1989 Nov-Dec,India,1989,80

Surviving family members were interviewed by trained social workers, and information was collected on symptoms of the disease that led to death. The completed questionnaires were reviewed by a panel of local physicians and a cause of death was assigned by the panel. Maternal mortality was a leading cause of death, second only to heart disease. There were 190 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths and 45 maternal deaths per 100,000 married women aged between 15 and 49 years. Most of the maternal deaths (63%) were due to direct obstetric causes of which haemorrhage was the main cause. Another 27% of the maternal deaths were due to indirect obstetric causes of which rheumatic heart disease was the main cause.",British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,1989 Jan,England,1989,80
6737214,Social and emotional loneliness: an examination of Weiss's typology of loneliness.,"This study examined Weiss' conceptualization of social and emotional loneliness. Using data from an extensive survey of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Iowa, we measured social and emotional loneliness, students' affective and behavioral reactions to loneliness, students' social relationships, and their judgments of the degree to which their relationships supply the six social provisions described by Weiss. As expected, we found differences in the subjective experiences of social and emotional loneliness, although both forms of loneliness were also characterized by a common core of experiences. The results generally supported Weiss's ideas concerning the determinants of social and emotional loneliness. Predictions concerning the affective and behavioral consequences associated with each type of loneliness, however, were only partly supported, although the two forms of loneliness were associated with different affective reactions and coping behaviors. The implications of these findings for Weiss's typology of loneliness are discussed.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1984 Jun,United States,1984,80
3819251,Biological and sociocultural determinants of successful lactation among women in eastern Connecticut.,"Postpartum factors affecting the duration of lactation were identified for 250 women through a telephone survey. The survey examined the behaviors and attitudes of women who had chosen to nurse and who were still nursing at 2 weeks postpartum. Sixty percent of the mothers nursed their infants after delivery. However, by 10 weeks postpartum, only 34% of the babies were still breast fed. By self-report, the most significant factors associated with the maintenance of lactation at 10 weeks were related to perinatal hospital protocol, especially letting the infant suckle soon after birth. Other significant predictors of successful lactation outcome included early milk ""let down,"" little use of supplemental formula, the mother's expectation at parturition of an extended nursing period, her feeling well and being satisfied with her body weight, her previous successful experience with lactation, and her perception that she feeds her infant on demand. Few of the women who had stopped nursing after 2 weeks sought advice on breast feeding from anyone other than the pediatrician. Most coped with their nursing problems themselves. The data reinforce the importance of labor and delivery practices that support early maternal-infant contact. They also suggest the use of infant health indexes and weight and height percentile placement records rather than reliance solely on weight gain as the index of lactation adequacy. Further, they indicate the need for clinical intervention before 2 weeks postpartum.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1987 Mar,United States,1987,80
3858734,Health insurance coverage amongst families with school aged children.,"The level of private medical insurance coverage was studied in a sample of 1106 seven year old children and their families who were participants in the Christchurch Child Development Study. In the last seven years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of families who were covered by private medical insurance: in 1977 an estimated 18% of families had coverage and by 1984, this figure had risen to 43%. Levels of coverage were correlated with a large number of factors associated with family social background including single parenthood, low income, poor parental education, Polynesian ethnicity, depressed living standards, family size and parental age. However, multivariate analysis suggested that the primary determinants of insurance coverage were family earning power and family structure. The social implications of these findings are discussed.",The New Zealand medical journal,1985 Jun 12,New Zealand,1985,80
6285155,"Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus in pregnant women: social factors, and immune competence as determinants of lymphoproliferative diseases-a hypothesis.","In normal pregnant women, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) frequently occurs. Cellular immune responses are apparently suppressed, but high titer EBV-specific antibodies of IgG class may compensate. The antibodies cross the placenta and protect the infant against primary infection for many months. Reactivation of EBV in pregnancy and oral excretion of virus by normal pregnant women could be one explanation why young children in large sibships (among families of low social classes) become infected early in life. Infants are likely infected by EBV from their pregnant mothers who shed virus in saliva. Moreover, the natural protection for several months in the perinatal period against Burkitt lymphoma and fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases in congenitally immune deficient children is explained. The maturity and immunocompetence of the immune system at the time of primary infection by EBV and the size of the sibship seem to determine whether infectious mononucleosis occurs. Gammaglobulin derived from human cord blood may be a valuable source of viral-specific antibodies for serotherapy in immune deficient patients.",Medical hypotheses,1982 Apr,United States,1982,80
7282978,Anality: a theory of erotism and characterology.,"The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology.",American journal of psychoanalysis,1981 Spring,England,1981,80

Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,1986 Nov-Dec,United States,1986,80

This paper seeks to examine factors that may influence these perceptions. Beliefs about the seriousness of eleven childhood illnesses are compared in four groups of parents. Significant differences were evident between the groups of parents depending upon their experiences with illness. For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes. These results are interpreted within an information processing model. Implications of the findings for social psychological models of health care behaviour are discussed.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1986,England,1986,80

Fifty adult hypertensive patients at a health maintenance organization completed questionnaires and participated in home interviews over a 10-week period. Knowledge of medical regimens, information communication between the patient and the medical professionals, satisfaction with health-care providers, health locus of control, social support, and treatment disruption to life-style were assessed. Adherence was assessed through self-report and behavioral (i.e., pill-count ratio, percentage of kept medical appointments) indices. Finally, repeated blood-pressure measurements were obtained. Structural modeling procedures revealed that greater expectancy for internal control over health and hypertension, greater knowledge of the treatment regimen, and stronger social support were significant determinants of adherence; in turn, higher levels of adherence facilitated blood-pressure reduction.",Journal of behavioral medicine,1987 Aug,United States,1987,80

The incidence of CPTH has been 44%. Age of the patients ranged between 4 and 69 years. Clinical pictures included closed head injuries of different degree of severity: mild, moderate and severe. Time of onset, headache frequency, character, intensity, duration and associated symptoms showed a great degree of variability. However, chronic muscle contraction headache was the commonest clinical syndrome followed by migraine. Moderate correlations have been found between the severity of CPTH disturbance of consciousness, following the head trauma, and positive findings at CT scan. Moreover the comparison of personality profiles (MMPI) of CPTH (n=26) with a post-traumatic control group, without headache (n=17) showed higher scores on hypocondriasis, depression, hysteria and schizophrenia scales only in the severe CPTH group. Age of the patients, duration of unconsciousness, neurological deficits, course length and pending litigation or compensations were unrelated to the occurrence and outcome of CPTH. These findings suggest the importance of both physical and psychological determinants (social or emotional maladjustment) in the pathogenesis of CPTH.",Journal of neurosurgical sciences,1983 Jul-Sep,Italy,1983,80

Questionnaires and a brief interview covered the psychological and social data while the somatic variables were recorded in a standardized medical examination. Emotional distress, self-reported symptoms, avoidance behaviour, overprotection, pessimism and a diminished sexual activity were frequent, indicating a poor adaptation. These disturbances were apparent two months after the MI and remained stable. Psychological factors were stronger determinants of maladjustment than smoking, angina pectoris and recorded somatic illness. Neither severity of the infarction nor social and demographic factors determined maladjustment. Intervention must take place early and be directed to psychological factors as well as to the cardiac condition.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1984,England,1984,80

6736597,"The determinants of health policy, a case study: regulating safety and health at the workplace in Sweden.","This article analyzes and criticizes the "" technocratic "" view of occupational health and safety policies, which sees the values of the personnel in ""post-industrial"" regulatory agencies as the most important determinant of those policies. It takes an alternate position, which explains occupational health and safety policies as primarily resulting from the different degrees of political power of the two major classes (capital and labor), and from the set of influences exerted on the regulatory agencies by the instruments (e.g., parties, unions, trade organizations) of those classes. It shows how an analysis of the historical evolution of those classes in Sweden and their conflict in both civil and political societies explains Swedish occupational health and safety policies better than a mere analysis of the regulators' views. And it concludes that the occupational health and safety policies in Sweden are not identical to those in the U.S.--as the "" technocratic "" theorists assume--but rather offer more protection to the workers than U.S. policies do. This situation is a result of labor having more power in Sweden than it has in the U.S. The different class formations and class behavior in the two societies are compared, and the implications of this comparison for occupational health and safety policies are discussed.","Journal of health politics, policy and law",1984 Spring,United States,1984,80

The quality and availability of these records vary from place to place, but generally speaking, in the case of the Netherlands, they are of high quality since population registration at the municipal level was required by law. The source of information for the local records are the population registers (Bevolkings Registers) which were originally constructed on the basis of information obtained from the 1850 population census....""",The International migration review,1987 Spring,United States,1987,80

Among the total of 85 participants, 78% considered that their health was good, 29% met family members and 75% friends at least once weekly. Fifty patients (65%) felt stressed in their daily lives which was definitely higher than in the normal population. All of the participants had altered their sexual behaviour in a manner which reduced the risk of HIV-transmission but 18 (21%) had had sexual behaviour known to transmit HIV within the past year. This behaviour occurred more frequently in young persons (p = 0.09) and in smokers (p = 0.03). In addition, no connection could be demonstrated between a series of possible determinants for this, which may, however, be due to the limited extent of the material.

Withdrawal aggression was measured after the removal of a subcutaneous morphine pellet or after precipitation by naloxone in naive mice and after removal of a morphine pellet in mice with prior fighting experience. In naive mice, removal of a morphine pellet led to increases in attack bites and threats but naloxone-precipitated withdrawal led to decreases in these behaviors and to increases in defensive posturing, escape attempts and vocalizations. Prior fighting experience abolished the enhanced attack behaviors of resident mice following morphine pellet removal, but led to heightened defensive behavior in intruder mice. The behavior of intruder mice appeared more sensitive to naloxone administration than the behavior of resident mice; naloxone influenced not only intruder defensive behavior, but also other non-aggressive behaviors. The social role of the drug recipient and his prior history of aggressive behavior are important determinants of morphine and naloxone effects on aggression.",Psychopharmacology,1986,Germany,1986,80
2529668,[A historico-social approach to the medical scientific theory of Ludwik Fleck (1896-1961)].,"Ludwik Fleck has shown in his discussion of the logical empirism of the Vienna Circle that his concept of reality presupposes an unproven logico-structural correspondence between the world and the formal logical structure of language, i.e. between reality and thought. Upon this questionable foundation he proceeds to develop his own position concerning the theory of medical science. He claims that scientific knowledge is at no time exempt from cultural, historical and social conditions, of which scientific knowledge itself is a function. These conditions find expression in the style of thought of a particular epoch (""Denkstil"") as well as in the interaction of the participating scientists (""Denkkollektiv""). Flecks merits for having explicated the conditionality of the process of scientific knowledge over against positivistic thought have been honourably elaborated in many studies. The present study offers an analysis of the manner in which the Fleck position attempts to serve as an explanation of change in the content and style of thought in history. It will be made clear that these changes and developments can only be explained as the result of the interaction and competition among the collectives of scientists and thinkers. Fleck deprives his socio-historical position of its logical foundation by radicalizing these conditions in such a manner that they become fundamental determinants of human thought generally and for the individual scientist particularly. As a consequence, from the perspective in which the thought of the individual is thus determined, he can neither establish a convincing theory for changes in thought in history nor for the human relations obtaining within the collective of scientists and thinkers.",Sudhoffs Archiv,1989,Germany,1989,80

All are based on the assumption that there are biological regulating processes of body weight (and with this also of feelings of hunger, appetite and satiation as the determinants of food intake), nevertheless the resulting body weight can be inconsistent with social standards and individual self-concepts. In this case a cognitive control of food intake (dieting behaviour) is activated for weight regulation, which in turn interacts with biological regulatory mechanisms, and as a result leads to specific behavioural dispositions which can be supported by experiments.",International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

A variety of sessions conducted on an inpatient treatment unit were designed to stimulate contingencies maintaining aggression and disruption in the subjects' natural environments. The basic analog conditions included: instructional demands, contingent social disapproval, and structured play. In addition, variations of the three basic conditions were developed based on informal observation and parental reports of naturally occurring contingencies. Results showed considerable variability both between and within subjects. However, for each subject a specific analog condition was shown to produce relatively higher rates of aberrant behavior. Subsequently, behavioral treatments based on assessment results were successfully implemented with two of the subjects. Results are discussed in terms of the importance and practical limitations of conducting systematic assessment of aberrant repertoires in developmentally delayed clients.",Applied research in mental retardation,1986,United States,1986,80

Using logistic multiple regression, we examine the predictive power of 19 independent variables grouped into six categories: demographic characteristics, attitude, social context, long-term care needs, physical disability, and mental/emotional disability. Five variables are significantly related to institutionalization: advancing age, using ambulatory aids, mental disorientation, living alone, and using assistance to perform ""instrumental"" ADL (activities of daily living). These results may be helpful to those trying to target non-institutional services to elders for use as substitutes for institutional long-term care.

Growth in these children is described and a number of determinants identified. Social-class differences were very small at birth but differences in height became clear by the age of two years and in head circumference before this. In height the differences were largely accounted for by greater growth in social class I, but there was a gradient in head circumference throughout all the social classes. The social class effects gradually increased as the children became older. Parity of the mothers had a small effect on size at birth but age of the mother had no effect once parity was allowed for. Data on illnesses in the children were collected but no effect on growth could be detected. By far the most important determinant of growth which could be controlled is maternal smoking. About 40% of the women smoked, about 17% heavily (15 or more cigarettes per day) and the prevalence of smoking altered little during pregnancy. There was a graded effect of smoking on growth up to a 9% deficit in birth-weight, a 2% deficit in length at birth and a 1.5% deficit in head circumference in the babies born to the mothers who smoked most heavily (25 or more cigarettes per day) compared with non-smokers.

3407490,Parents' behavioral norms as predictors of adolescent sexual activity and contraceptive use.,"The influence of parental factors on adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive use has been examined previously, and findings have been contradictory. Previous studies, which found little relationship between parental norms and adolescent sexual activity, have been limited by their failure to recognize developmental differences in the relative weight of parent and peer influences between younger and older teens and by use of selected samples, resulting in a restriction of range. The current study differs in that it utilizes a clustered sample household survey of 329 males and females, aged 14 to 17, and 470 of their parents. Using multiple regression analysis, it was found that parents' reported behavioral norms account for 5% of the variance in whether adolescents have had intercourse, and for 33% of the variance in use of contraception at last intercourse. The study suggests that while parents' normative beliefs have limited effect in the decision to become sexually active, they have considerable impact on later contraceptive use.",Adolescence,1988 Summer,United States,1988,80

As the first step in the child-bearing process, age at first birth is a critical variable. Using data from the 1966-67 West Malaysia Family Survey, we formulate and test a model of the cultural, social and economic determinants of the timing of first birth among a sample of mothers, aged 30-44. Social origins, measured by the woman's father's occupation and the woman's birthplace are not important determinants, but education, early work experience, and ethnicity exercise very strong effects on the age at first birth. Age at first marriage mediates much of the effect of background variables, which suggest that there is little use of contraception to plan the first birth interval.

Methods for developing a standardized surveillance system for a multicenter study of surgical infections.,"The postoperative wound infection experience in 11 Israeli hospitals was investigated with two objectives: (1) to utilize the variability among hospitals for a better understanding of the determinants of these infections, and (2) to present surgeons and infection control teams with information upon which they can take action. This article summarizes the methods that were applied to maximize the uniformity of information obtained from hospitals. (1) The same kind of patients were sampled in every hospital. (2) The data collection system was standardized, and analyzed for errors. The overall error rate was small (2%) but there were potential problem areas, such as missing information on underlying diagnoses (12%). Few errors (1%) were found in the nurses' observations of the wounds. (3) All wound infections were diagnosed in a uniform manner by convening a panel of four specialists at the central Israeli Study of Surgical Infections (ISSI) office. (4) The definition of infection that was finally chosen for this multicenter study had to be broadened to include, in addition to pus, ""discharge other than pus,"" because of the higher reliability among panel members. This definition was also clinically valid in terms of morbidity. (5) The rate of postdischarge infections was estimated and was not found to be related to the discharge policies in the various hospitals.",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,1988 Jun,United States,1988,80

The investigation is done by means of a single equation framework model, which is applied to U.S. Bureau of the Census data. The results indicate that ""the migration-related growth of non-white populations in northern metropolitan areas during the 1960s was...importantly and directly associated both with the level of employment opportunities as measured by the proportion of the non-white population of labor force age officially employed in the mainstream economy of an SMSA and with the SMSA rate of net migration occurring over the preceding 10-year period, which indicates the role of chain migration.""",The Review of Black political economy,1984 Winter,United States,1984,80
2489983,Sociodemographic determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka: 1975-82.,"The determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka are examined during a period in which contraceptive prevalence increased by over 60% and involved substantial use of sterilization and traditional methods. Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods.",Journal of biosocial science. Supplement,1989,England,1989,80

The causes of this decline have thus far not been established. Six major strategies for investigating determinants of ischemic heart disease mortality trends are discussed in this review: (1) analyses of mortality data; (2) morbidity surveillance; (3) surveillance of change in medical care; (4) surveillance of cardiovascular risk factors; (5) social and ecological surveillance; (6) experimental and quasi-experimental community approaches. The rationale, problems and limitations of each are discussed.",Journal of chronic diseases,1982,England,1982,80
3169388,Perinatal risk factors and minor neurological dysfunction: significance for behaviour and school achievement at nine years.,"A prospective study was carried out on 133 neurologically deviant infants, 205 with mild abnormalities and 230 normal newborns to compare behavioural and cognitive development with neonatal and nine-year-old neurological condition. Overtly handicapped children were excluded. Major determinants of school failure were the severity of minor neurological dysfunction (MND) and social class. Main risk factors for distractable and clumsy behaviour were MND classification and male sex; for troublesome behaviour male sex and interval complications after two years of age; and for timid behaviour, family adversity. Definite neonatal neurological deviancy contributed both directly and by its association with MND to problems in behaviour and scholastic abilities. Mild neonatal neurological abnormalities and adverse obstetrical events contributed only indirectly to behavioural and learning problems. Preterm birth (less than 34 weeks) was the sole obstetric variable directly related to some of the outcome variables. The difference between home and school perception of the children's behaviour is emphasized.",Developmental medicine and child neurology,1988 Aug,England,1988,80

This evolution reflects changes in the patterns of diseases and deaths that have occurred in our time and has placed new emphasis on preventing avoidable, premature deaths.

2740943,[Fertility and health in Mexico].,"Fertility, health, and family planning are not independent factors, but rather involve a series of biological and social mechanisms in close interaction with one another. The impact that a high fertility rate has on health is reflected mainly in a rise in the rates of maternal and child mortality. Similarly, fertility has a greater negative effect upon the health of groups characterized by high reproductive risk, high parity, short intergenesic intervals, and unwanted pregnancies. On the other hand, family planning -and specifically the use of contraceptive methods-helps to achieve a lowering of the fertility rate and also has a positive effect on maternal-child health. This situation can be observed in the case of Mexico, where fertility rates and tendencies, as well as maternal and child mortality, have been reduced during the past decade.",Salud publica de Mexico,1989 Mar-Apr,Mexico,1989,80

The 1985 AANS presidential address.,"Several important events that have played a major role in shaping the destiny of neurological surgery are recounted: the birth of neurosurgery; the founding of scientific surgery; the origin and evolution of microvascular technique in cerebrovascular surgery. In each case, the clinical breakthroughs stemmed from an apparently irrelevant basic laboratory investigation. Also, in each case, the transfer of the laboratory results to the bedside required clinicians who were prepared by training and knowledge to recognize the clinical significance of the fundamental observations. History tells us that if we are to sustain neurological surgery as a vibrant surgical specialty, we must continue to give top priority to the preparation of young minds through education and research. It is more important to understand this now than ever before, because never before have we been so preoccupied with social and economic issues: a preoccupation that is threatening to divert our attention from the main determinants of our specialty's future viability--the acquisition and application of new knowledge.",Journal of neurosurgery,1985 Oct,United States,1985,80
2916712,Determinants of recovery 12 months after hip fracture: the importance of psychosocial factors.,"The independent contributions to recovery from hip fracture of psychosocial factors including depression, personality, social connectedness, and self-rated health were studied in 219 women age 59 and older (mean age 78.5) who were community dwelling prior to fracture. Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery.",American journal of public health,1989 Mar,United States,1989,80

7031748,The development of sexuality and eroticism in humankind.,"Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expression. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppression of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotosexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiencies, or hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes.",The Quarterly review of biology,1981 Dec,United States,1981,80
3266155,Household composition choices of older unmarried women.,"This article extends previous research on the household composition of older unmarried women, using a statistical model that treats each of a woman's surviving children as a distinct potential provider of a shared household. Additional possibilities--living alone, living with other nuclear-family relatives, and living with others--are also recognized, providing a varied range of household-structure opportunities for older women. The approach allows us to identify individual child attributes associated with the propensity to coreside with the older unmarried mother. The results confirm earlier findings regarding the importance of income, age, and disability status as determinants of the household composition of older women. We find, however, that unmarried children, especially sons, are more likely to share a household with an elderly mother than are married children. Working reduces the likelihood that a married daughter will live with her older mother. Overall, the findings suggest that the attributes, more so than the sheer numbers, of living children influence the household structure of their mothers.",Demography,1988 Aug,United States,1988,80

This paper argues that the popularity of compliance and the uncertainty over its determinants can be understood if compliance is analyzed as an ideology that assumes and justifies physician authority. I explore compliance as a problematic concept, looking at its assumptions and its influences on clinical practice. The concept of patient compliance has a social history linked to the struggle to create and maintain physician control over infant feeding technology earlier in this century. But while physicians were successful in that struggle, they have never exercised complete control over health care products. Compliance must be reconceptualized and its research reoriented if it is accurately to portray medication usage and related health behaviors outside the clinic.",Social science & medicine (1982),1988,England,1988,80

Variability is evident in cause-specific mortality rates as well as in decedent characteristics across the cause-of-death models. These findings suggest that more attention be given to the mode of identifying cause of death in studies of infant mortality.""

Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described. It was found that smoking, work experience, and age were the most important determinants of self assessed respiratory conditions. When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas. Respiratory conditions were affected by the age of housing, and flats were found to be worse than houses. High rise flats were worse than low or medium rise flats.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1985 Mar,England,1985,80
4031402,Relevance of personality traits to adjustment in group living situations.,"The study replicates and extends recent work on personality determinants of adjustment. Personality traits and adjustment criteria were selected for relevance to one type of real-life setting (public housing for the elderly that includes a senior center). Personality traits were measured by observer ratings; criteria, by self-report of respondents and perceptions of them by other residents and staff. In concurrent and longitudinal analyses controlling effects of competence and social status, personality traits accounted for significant and meaningful variance in all criteria, and the salience of particular traits varied across criteria. The results are consistent with earlier studies regarding the importance of extraversion and neuroticism to subjective well-being and suggest that they are relevant also to adjustment as perceived by others. The additional traits of congeniality, culture, and nosiness/gossip were related to both inner and outer adjustment measures in the type of situations studied.",Journal of gerontology,1985 Sep,United States,1985,80

All families were intact and the parents had not requested professional help for marital problems. A significant number of relationships were found between parental background variables and higher reported levels of conflict with siblings and with parents, dependent-unassertive behaviour, and undemandingness in the children. Although sampling difficulties preclude generalization, the results suggest that repercussion of events in the lives of the first and second generation that are usually pathogenic may be seen in the third generation, even when the second generation may not be grossly adversely affected. These events most frequently related to individual differences in the third generation in the area of undercontrol of aggression directed toward parents and siblings.",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

3494378,Determinants of microangiopathy in growth-onset diabetes. With special reference to retinopathy and glycaemic control.,"In a quasi-experiment all diabetic children in a defined area were exposed either to an intense clinical treatment or served as a constructed control. The cohort of 146 diabetics was observed prospectively for at least 15 years as to diabetic control, mainly glycosuria, and cross-sectionally examined for microangiopathy on four occasions. Data on family background, social situation, smoking, blood pressure, biochemical status, anthropometry, HLA factors and mortality were also gathered. Throughout the analysis duration was considered and treated as a concomitant variable. Two different strategies have been followed in the analysis, one trying to predict microangiopathy at a fixed and predetermined duration, the other to study determinants of the pattern of microangiopathy occurrence over time. Multiple logistic regression and Cox analysis have been used to fit these strategies. The prevalence of microaneurysms or more advanced stages of retinopathy at 10 years duration was 30 per cent and within 20 years 81 per cent. About 52 per cent had haemorrhages after 20 years. Mild and severe nephropathy after 20 years have been contracted by 50 and 15 per cent respectively. No clear sex differences were seen. Variables significantly explaining retinopathy within 10 years were post-pubertal duration, blood pressure, place of medical supervision and the HLA/DR4 marker. The mean glycosuria was high during puberty irrespective of age at onset. The overall pattern of retinopathy occurrence seemed to be influenced by place of medical supervision, age at onset, blood pressure, family history of ischaemic heart disease and glycemic control. For the progression of retinopathy the role of factors reflecting medical supervision and control of diabetes seemed even greater. Even after accounting for degree of diabetic control the experimental group had a more favourable outcome, suggesting additional quality of care components. Mild nephropathy was less predictable from the above risk factors while previous findings of the important role of elevated blood pressure for severe nephropathy was confirmed. We estimate that half of retinopathy cases were preventable by the ""experimental"" care and conclude the near-normalization of glycaemia under routine conditions favourably influences the development of diabetic retinopathy.",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica.

Analyzing these different kinds of material, the importance of a differential approach to the multidimensionally determined situation of men in old age was stressed; on the other hand, it seemed to be possible to identify certain ""typical"" characteristics at least for the present cohorts of old-aged men (e.g. importance of the quality of marital life, significance of being free of stress, tendency of experiential integration etc.).",Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie,1986 Jul-Aug,Germany,1986,80
6737214,Social and emotional loneliness: an examination of Weiss's typology of loneliness.,"This study examined Weiss' conceptualization of social and emotional loneliness. Using data from an extensive survey of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Iowa, we measured social and emotional loneliness, students' affective and behavioral reactions to loneliness, students' social relationships, and their judgments of the degree to which their relationships supply the six social provisions described by Weiss. As expected, we found differences in the subjective experiences of social and emotional loneliness, although both forms of loneliness were also characterized by a common core of experiences. The results generally supported Weiss's ideas concerning the determinants of social and emotional loneliness. Predictions concerning the affective and behavioral consequences associated with each type of loneliness, however, were only partly supported, although the two forms of loneliness were associated with different affective reactions and coping behaviors. The implications of these findings for Weiss's typology of loneliness are discussed.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1984 Jun,United States,1984,80
3686078,Patient-doctor communication on smoking and drinking: lifestyle in medical consultations.,"Lifestyles of groups and individuals are significant determinants of the health status of a population. Behaviour with respect to such areas as alcohol, food, drugs, tobacco, physical exercise, etc., correlates with medical and social well-being and are thus on the agenda for modern health care. The present article reports a study of how such lifestyle habits, notably alcohol and tobacco consumption, are addressed in medical consultations. The results indicate that the areas of smoking and drinking are sensitive and that specific communicative strategies are used for introducing these topics and for eliciting information. Smoking habits are addressed in 75% of the consultations and alcohol habits in 30%. In most cases, the information exchanged is shallow and gives only a fragmentary picture of patients' habits. There is little evidence of attempts to influence patients' attitudes and behaviours and the physicians do not contextualise possible relationships between such lifestyle habits and health in the light of their medical knowledge. In this sense, a potentially very influential face-to-face encounter is not used as a vehicle for attempting to eliminate such significant causes of poor health.",Social science & medicine (1982),1987,England,1987,80

6541496,Sex and strain related effects of melatonin and 5-methoxytryptophol on open field behaviour in paired mice.,"The effects of two methoxyindoles, melatonin (MEL) and 5-methoxytryptophol (5-MTL), on partner investigation and other aspects of pair behaviour in the open field, were observed on male and female mice of the albino TO, and the pigmented C57BL/6 strains. Both indole derivatives are major secretory products of rodent (and human) pineal glands. They were administered by i.p. injection (100 micrograms/kg) to both members of the pair 1 h before each 10 min open field exposure. The testing took place on 3 consecutive days. There were no significant differences in behaviour over days, and group means were used in subsequent data analysis (MANOVA and Dunnet's test). Males, more socially active than the females in both strains, responded to MEL by a reduction in contact time; 5-MTL had the same effect on C57 males (TO males showed no change). Females, on the other hand, did not respond to MEL, and increased their social contact seeking after 5-MTL. There was no consistent effect of either indole on locomotion, and erratic (TO strain only) effects on defaecation. The data are discussed in terms of possible actions of pineal indoles on determinants of social behaviour.",Behavioural brain research,1984 Aug,Netherlands,1984,80

One hundred and twenty male subjects were randomly given success or failure feedback on an intellectual task. They then participated in a separate ""wine-tasting"" experiment in which they were allowed to regulate alcohol consumption. As predicted, high self-conscious subjects who had received failure feedback drank significantly more wine than did high self-conscious subjects who received success feedback. Consumption by low self-conscious subjects fell between these extremes and did not vary as a function of success and failure. Additional data indicated that these results were mediated by differential sensitivity to the positive or negative implications of success/failure by high and low self-conscious subjects.

3874527,On processes of peer influences in adolescent drug use: a developmental perspective.,"Data from longitudinal studies of adolescents carried out over the last ten years are reviewed to provide an integrated and dynamic perspective on the nature of friendships and processes of peer influence in adolescent drug involvement, within a general developmental perspective. Four interrelated questions are examined: What individual attributes are especially important in the formation of friendships among adolescents? Which of two processes, selection or socialization, account for the similarity in values and behaviors observed in ongoing friendship dyads, and how important is similarity in friendship formation and dissolution? What is the nature of friends' influence as compared to parents', and in which domains of adolescent's life do these influences exert themselves? What mechanisms, role modeling or social learning, underlie processes of interpersonal influences? Relational dyadic and triadic samples of adolescents matched to a parent and/or a best friend and observed at one point in time as well as over time provide important and relatively rare sources of data on processes of interpersonal influence. Sociodemographic characteristics are the strongest determinants of friendship formation, with participation in illicit drugs following next in importance. Both selection (assortative pairing) and socialization contribute to observed similarity in friendship pairs. Adolescents coordinate their choice of friends and their values and behaviors, in particular the use of marijuana, so as to maximize congruency in the friendship dyad. If there is a state of unbalance such that the friend's attitude or behavior is inconsistent with the adolescent's, the adolescent will either break off the friendship and seek another friend or will keep the friend and modify his or her own behavior. Both parents and peers can have strong influences on adolescents, depending upon the arena of influence. Parents are especially important for future life plans, while peers are most important for involvement in illicit drug use. However, for drug use itself, there are different patterns of influence depending upon the stage of drug involvement. Peers are especially important for initiation into marijuana use, while parental factors gain in importance in the transition from marijuana use to the use of other illicit drugs. Interpersonal influences of peers on ongoing marijuana and alcohol use result from modeling and imitation more than from social reinforcement and the transmission of values.",Advances in alcohol & substance abuse,1985 Spring-Summer,United States,1985,80

Classmate, parent, teacher, and friend social support all were significant predictors of self-esteem. Family conflict and organization were also significantly associated with self-esteem, as were microstressors.

6644542,Predicting contraceptive behavior from attitudes: a comparison of within- versus across-subjects procedures.,"Within- versus across-subjects procedures for predicting behavior from attitudes were contrasted. Each procedure requires a comparison among attitudes in order to generate a prediction; the comparison is either among the same attitudes held by different people (across subjects) or among different attitudes held by the same person (within subject). It was hypothesized that the within-subject model provides a more adequate explanation of behavior from attitudinal constructs and, hence, more accurate prediction of behavior from attitudes than does the across-subjects model. To test this view, a sample of 349 married couples was administered a questionnaire containing measures of three attitudinal components--affect, cognition, and conation--toward each of four contraceptive methods--oral contraceptives, IUD, diaphragm, and condoms. Contraceptive behavior was assessed 1 year later. In support of the hypothesis, the within-subject predictions bore a significantly stronger relation to the behavioral criteria than did the across-subjects predictions. This effect was consistent for each of the three components of attitude, for the prediction of behavior and behavioral intention, for male and female respondents, and for a variety of contraceptive behaviors. In addition, both the within- and the across-subjects analyses demonstrated a clear rank ordering in the predictive validity of the three attitudinal components: Conation was a better predictor of behavior than was affect, which, in turn, was better than cognition.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1983 Nov,United States,1983,80
4061712,A cross-cultural comparison of health status values.,"The extent to which the values attached to health states are similar in different cultures or social groups is important for understanding health and illness behaviors and for developing standardized health status measures. A cross-cultural study was conducted to compare the health status values obtained in a United States population (Seattle, Washington) with those from another English-speaking culture (London, England) on the Sickness Impact Profile, a standardized measure composed of 136 items. London judges rated the severity of dysfunction described in each item on an equal interval scale using the same methods of scaling and analysis employed in the Seattle study. A regression of English mean item values on US mean values yielded a slope of 1.00 and an intercept of -0.07, indicating that judges gave strikingly similar ratings to most items. Agreement was higher at the more severe end of the dysfunction continuum than at the least severe end, a finding consistent with the notion that what constitutes health is more difficult to define than what constitutes illness. While a universal conception of dysfunction may exist in English-speaking societies, the social and cultural determinants of health status values deserve more systematic study.",American journal of public health,1985 Dec,United States,1985,80
6667732,Second pregnancies among teenage mothers.,"An analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) finds that 82 percent of sexually active teenage mothers were using contraceptives in the year following the birth of their first child; the majority of those who practiced contraception used the pill. The proportion of black teenagers using no method of birth control was higher than that for white teenagers, and it increased over the course of the year. Rates of nonuse were particularly high among black women younger than 18, only 68 percent of whom practiced contraception (compared with 85 percent of whites the same age). Examination of the data by marital status shows that women who married while they were pregnant were the most likely to practice contraception in the year following their first birth, while those who were single at the time of first birth were the least likely to do so (89 versus 74 percent). Blacks constituted the majority of women who were not married at the time of first birth, and of all marital subgroups, single blacks had the highest rate of nonuse (29 percent). The probability of a pregnancy during the year following a first birth for all teenage mothers was 17 percent. Pregnancy rates among women with incomes less than 150 percent of poverty level were nearly twice as high as rates among women who had incomes above that level--21 percent vs. 11 percent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Family planning perspectives,1983 Nov-Dec,United States,1983,80
3244671,Determinants of serum alpha-tocopherol in Finnish adults.,"The relationship between serum alpha-tocopherol level and many of its possible determinants was studied in 1,373 cancer-free Finnish men and women age 40-79 years. Dietary data were available from a subsample of 301 persons. The mean alpha-tocopherol level in the serum samples stored at -20 degrees C was 8.6 mg/liter among men and 10.5 mg/liter among women. Intake of margarine, vegetable oils, and green vegetables predicted the serum level of alpha-tocopherol. Altogether six food groups accounted for about 10% of the variation. The levels also varied with age, geographical area, type of population, occupation, socioeconomic status, and marital status. They were positively correlated with serum cholesterol and serum vitamin A in both sexes, and with body mass index and serum selenium in men. Altogether these variables accounted for over 40% of the variation in alpha-tocopherol levels. The level of serum alpha-tocopherol, which is associated with the dietary intake of vitamin E, is dependent upon living conditions.",Preventive medicine,1988 Nov,United States,1988,80

The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance. Although laymen had roughly similar rank orderings for the 13 homogeneous clusters of items, blacks indicated greater concern over breakdowns in social orientation than whites, while the opposite pattern held for traditionally defined psychopathy (internal distresses). Upper-class concerns were, comparatively, with cognitive dysfunction, middle-class with moral and social responsibility, and lower-class with social inadequacies.",American journal of community psychology,1980 Oct,England,1980,80
2797981,Genetic and environmental determinants of growth in Mexican-Americans.,"Height and weight data from the Mexican-American portion of the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) are shown for children of ages 2 to 17 years and compared with data for non-Hispanic white children from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference curves. Differences in stature between the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the reference populations were minor prior to adolescence and could be entirely attributed to the greater poverty of Mexican-Americans. However, differences increased during adolescence (ie, median stature was less than the 25th percentile of the NCHS reference population at 17 years of age) and, in contrast with earlier ages, were independent of poverty. Similar growth patterns were observed in samples of upper-class subjects from Mexico and Guatemala. Nonetheless, the extent to which the short stature of Mexican-American adolescents is genetic is unclear because there is an apparent time trend toward greater stature in the Mexican-American population. In conclusion, the NCHS reference curves are appropriate growth standards for preadolescent Mexican-American children. Whether they are valid for Mexican-American adolescents remains unclear.",Pediatrics,1989 Nov,United States,1989,80

6656327,The determinants of dropping out of care among hypertensive patients receiving a behavioral intervention.,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension.",Medical care,1983 Oct,United States,1983,80

Data are analyzed from questionnaires administered to 387 males and females. It was found that future work-family plans were closely tied to sex role orientations of adolescents of both sexes. However, self-esteem, evaluation of the relative difficulty of male-female sex roles, and projected childlessness were salient to sex role attitudes of females but not of males. Positive evaluations of self were related to non-traditional sex role orientations among females. Maternal employment differentially affected male and female children. Sons of women in high-status occupations were reluctant to get involved in a two-career family with children. Mothers' occupational status had little influence on the plans or sex role attitudes of daughters. The results indicate that future research should investigate whether maternal employment in high-status occupations, while providing a wider range of acceptable models for girls, may serve as a negative model for boys.",Adolescence,1988 Winter,United States,1988,80

6584748,Determinants of differences in mortality between New Zealand Maoris and non-Maoris aged 15-64.,"Maori mortality is compared with that of other New Zealanders aged 15-64 in the period 1974 to 1978. For males, it is estimated that approximately 20% of the Maori excess in mortality is associated with marked ethnic differences in socio-economic status. Of the remaining excess, an estimated 15% is linked with cigarette smoking, 10% with alcohol consumption (excluding accidental cause of deaths), 5% with obesity and 17% was due to accidents. However 36% of the non-social class related excess involved rheumatic and hypertensive heart disease, nephritis, bronchiectasis, diabetes and tuberculosis which were all associated with a Maori mortality five or more times that for non-Maoris. It is recommended that resources should be allocated so that Maori people can be employed to maintain contact with Maori patients with these diseases in order to improve health services utilisation and compliance with therapy. While it was not possible to determine socio-economic status for females from national mortality data, other findings were similar to those found for males except that mortality from coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease also contributed to the Maori excess.",The New Zealand medical journal,1984 Feb 22,New Zealand,1984,80
3070761,Medical compliance as an ideology.,"Medical compliance researchers have produced more than 4000 scientific papers in the past two decades, but their research into the determinants of non-compliance has been inconclusive. This paper argues that the popularity of compliance and the uncertainty over its determinants can be understood if compliance is analyzed as an ideology that assumes and justifies physician authority. I explore compliance as a problematic concept, looking at its assumptions and its influences on clinical practice. The concept of patient compliance has a social history linked to the struggle to create and maintain physician control over infant feeding technology earlier in this century. But while physicians were successful in that struggle, they have never exercised complete control over health care products. Compliance must be reconceptualized and its research reoriented if it is accurately to portray medication usage and related health behaviors outside the clinic.",Social science & medicine (1982),1988,England,1988,80

Generally the migration level in Thailand is low but many women from the rural areas, especially from the Northeast Region, move to Bangkok Metropolis to seek work. Findings reveal that the majority of migrants are young, single women. Women migrants find it relatively easy to participate in the Bangkok labor market. Service work is the main source of employment. For the temporary migrants, it was found that those from the Northeast Region tend to return to their hometown in higher proportion than those from other regions. This was particularly so among young women migrants.",Population geography : a journal of the Association of Population Geographers of India,1983 Jun-Dec,India,1983,80

Evidence from southern Africa, and particularly from Swaziland, where a resurgence of malaria has occurred in the absence of pesticide-resistant strains of Anopheles mosquitoes, suggests that changes in agroecosystems, labor utilization and settlement patterns, which are also associated with large-scale agricultural development, may play an equally important role in the resurgence of malaria.

7020985,Alcohol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: causal inference from diverse study designs.,"The association between reported alcohol intake and plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration is examined in an effort to establish whether it was a cause-and-effect basis. A cross-sectional descriptive study of several populations reveals a strong and consistent dose-response pattern: Social drinkers have mean HDL cholesterol levels that are higher than those of teetotalers by as much as 33%. Cross-sectional analyses in another epidemiological study reveal the association to be independent of potential confounding factors such as smoking and body weight, and longitudinal analyses suggest that it is also not a result of certain unmeasured sources of confounding. A small experiment reveals a 15% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels among social drinkers who abstain from alcohol from a 2-week period. The evidence supports the conclusion that alcohol habits are probably one of the determinants of plasma HDL cholesterol level. A clarification of the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical medicine awaits future clinical efforts.",Circulation,1981 Sep,United States,1981,80
3585703,Personal and contextual determinants of coping strategies.,"This study examined personal and contextual predictors of active and avoidance coping strategies in a community sample of over 400 adults and in a sample of over 400 persons entering psychiatric treatment for unipolar depression. Sociodemographic factors of education and income (except for active-cognitive coping), personality dispositions of self-confidence and an easy-going manner, and contextual factors of negative life events and family support each made a significant incremental contribution to predicting active and avoidance coping. Among both healthy adults and patients, active and avoidance coping were positively associated with negative life events. Individuals who had more personal and environmental resources were more likely to rely on active coping and less likely to use avoidance coping. Moreover, for both groups, most of the predictors continued to show significant relations with active and avoidance coping strategies even after the stable component in coping was controlled in a longitudinal design. A comprehensive framework to understand the determinants of coping can be of practical value in suggesting points for therapeutic interventions aimed at fostering more adaptive coping efforts.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1987 May,United States,1987,80

As part of a health survey of union painters, 169 male spray painters were questioned about their own beliefs concerning the consequences of wearing cartridge respirators, as well as about the perceived attitudes of others in the workplace toward respirators. Intended respirator use was more strongly associated with beliefs than was past use. The most important beliefs concerned discomfort or inconvenience. Other determinants that were associated with respirator use were respirator availability, cigarette smoking, and social influences. It was concluded that the most effective intervention strategy to increase respirator use would be multidimensional and that efforts to change only a worker's beliefs may have limited success.","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",1988 Aug,Finland,1988,80
7249932,Determinants of compliance in epileptic outpatients.,"The authors have investigated reasons for medication compliance in a population of epileptic patients. The hypothesis that the health care belief model would be predictive of medication-taking behavior was validated. A pilot study was constructed which investigated the comparative responses of compliant and noncompliant epileptic outpatients to questions regarding demographic, clinical history, and attitudinal characteristics. Noncompliant patients were characterized as having a longer duration of epilepsy, more complicated dosage regimens, and more changes in medication. In addition, noncompliant patients both demonstrated more confusion over medication directions and less insight into the need for anticonvulsants and feared addiction to their medication. They had a lower level of satisfaction with their health care and were more frequently subject to the social complications of epilepsy. The authors suggest that a more holistic approach be taken when attempting to reverse noncompliant behavior.",Drug intelligence & clinical pharmacy,1981 Jul-Aug,United States,1981,80
17093748,[Frequent consumers of emergency psychiatric services in metropolitan Montreal area.].,"This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting.",Sante mentale au Quebec,1982,Canada,1982,80

Similar data for women are somewhat conflicting. There is clear evidence that Adventists have lower serum total cholesterol and lower serum HDL cholesterol with the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol being similar to that of non-Adventists. The risk relationships of this ratio may differ in different populations. There is a certain amount of evidence that vegetarians may have lower blood pressures but this is not clearly supported by data from Seventh-day Adventists. The lower risk for IHD in Adventist men, at least, is probably related to their dietary habits, nonsmoking status, possibly their better exercise habits, and greater social support.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1988 Sep,United States,1988,80
3780230,Determinants of oral contraceptive use in northern Italy.,"Socio-demographic characteristics, general lifestyle habits, reproductive and medical histories were compared of 328 women who had ever used oral contraceptives and 2306 never users from a case-control surveillance conducted in Northern Italy. Oral contraceptive use was positively and strongly related with the level of education and indicators of social class. The rate ratio of ever use (adjusted for age and diagnostic category) was 3.3 for women with 12 years of education or more compared with less than 7 years, and 3.0 for women of highest compared with lowest social class. The frequency of pill use was lower among never married women, and significantly elevated among smokers (rate ratio = 2.4 for heavy smokers). In contrast, no relation was evident between alcohol or coffee consumption and pill use. Likewise, ever users of oral contraceptives were not significantly different from women who had never used the pill with regard to major reproductive factors (parity and age at first pregnancy) or several medical variables of potential interest (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), with the only possible exclusion of obesity which was less frequent among pill users. Thus, this study indicates that the major determinants of the persistently low frequency of oral contraceptive use in this Northern Italian population are social rather than reproductive or medical factors. These findings have important implications for epidemiological research on oral contraceptive and disease in this population, and underline the importance of selection and screening of oral contraceptive users on the basis of knowledge of medical factors and lifestyle habits.",Contraception,1986 Aug,United States,1986,80

In Experiment 1, neonatally androgenized females engaged in play soliciting at a level equal to that of male controls and greater than that of nonandrogenized female controls. In Experiment 2, males and females were reared in unisexual and bisexual groups in order to compare long-term sex-related social experience effects on juvenile play soliciting. Males exposed only to other young males engaged in greater play soliciting than males exposed to both sexes; females, in contrast, were unaffected by sex of cagemates. Within rearing conditions, however, males engaged in greater play soliciting than females. The combined results suggest that perinatal gonadal androgen exposure effects on social play are prepotent and contribute essentially to sex differences in the initiation of social play behavior.",Behavioral neuroscience,1986 Apr,United States,1986,80

Case registers of stone patients were maintained in the hospitals for 2 years; they included out-patients and in-patients. The annual registration rate was 22/100,000 population. Additional information was available for 1980 from Hospital Activity Analysis and the annual rate was 28/100,000. It is suggested that this is the best estimate of the incidence of renal stones in England and Wales. The rate ranged from 56/100,000 in Canterbury to 15/100,000 in Burton-on-Trent. The incidence of renal stones was higher in towns with better social and economic conditions.

3538185,Social and biocultural determinants of food selection.,"Health professionals concerned with improving the nutritional status of populations are facing numerous problems ranging from emaciation to overnutrition. This review article addresses the complexity, the relative significance and the interaction of factors leading to the nutritional profile of specific groups and individuals. When availability of food is threatened, the programs designed to reduce the incidence of malnutrition must balance the food supply with energy resources and population needs as well as encourage economic improvement of food distribution systems. For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection. Excessive austerity in food use negates the pleasure of eating, a useful mechanism in food choice ensuring food diversity.",Progress in food & nutrition science,1986,England,1986,80

This paper seeks to examine factors that may influence these perceptions. Beliefs about the seriousness of eleven childhood illnesses are compared in four groups of parents. Significant differences were evident between the groups of parents depending upon their experiences with illness. For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes. These results are interpreted within an information processing model. Implications of the findings for social psychological models of health care behaviour are discussed.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1986,England,1986,80

3169388,Perinatal risk factors and minor neurological dysfunction: significance for behaviour and school achievement at nine years.,"A prospective study was carried out on 133 neurologically deviant infants, 205 with mild abnormalities and 230 normal newborns to compare behavioural and cognitive development with neonatal and nine-year-old neurological condition. Overtly handicapped children were excluded. Major determinants of school failure were the severity of minor neurological dysfunction (MND) and social class. Main risk factors for distractable and clumsy behaviour were MND classification and male sex; for troublesome behaviour male sex and interval complications after two years of age; and for timid behaviour, family adversity. Definite neonatal neurological deviancy contributed both directly and by its association with MND to problems in behaviour and scholastic abilities. Mild neonatal neurological abnormalities and adverse obstetrical events contributed only indirectly to behavioural and learning problems. Preterm birth (less than 34 weeks) was the sole obstetric variable directly related to some of the outcome variables. The difference between home and school perception of the children's behaviour is emphasized.",Developmental medicine and child neurology,1988 Aug,England,1988,80
12283031,Determinants of family size preferences in Pakistan.,"""The paper attempts to investigate and identify some of the most important predictors of family size-preferences in Pakistan. Based on cross-sectional data relating to 9,416 currently married women, the results of this study suggest that having one or more sons in the family is the principal predictor of the desired family size. Yet another important predictor is the education of the wife which plays a critical role in the family size determination. The study shows that the preferences for family size do not vary greatly between urban and rural areas.""",Pakistan development review,1989 Autumn,Pakistan,1989,80
2740928,"Migration, acculturation and utilization of primary health care.","This study explored the roles of acculturation, urban-rural provenance and length of residence as determinants of the utilization pattern of first line health services by Moroccan, Turkish and Italian migrants in Belgium. Concurrently, utilization characteristics were recorded in Belgian reference patients. With increasing acculturation the demand for preventive care decreased, vague complaints became more prevalent, the delay before consulting for a curative problem shortened and the prognosis improved. There was no correlation between the occurrence of psychological problems and acculturation but, except for 15-44 year old female migrants, the rate of social problems was negatively associated with this study factor. Migrants with an urban background consulted earlier and presented more frequently vague complaints than migrants from rural provenance. We observed no significant influence of length of residence on utilization characteristics and only a marginal influence on morbidity pattern. Although acculturation seems to be a strong determinant of the migrant's utilization pattern of primary health care services, it does not consistently lead to a decrease of utilization differentials with the Belgian reference population. This may imply that there is a need for public health interventions targeted at ethnic minorities.",Social science & medicine (1982),1989,England,1989,80
12285842,Effect of female education on the proximate determinants of fertility in Bangladesh.,"""This paper investigates the effect of female education on fertility in Bangladesh...through three proximate determinants of fertility: marriage, postpartum non-susceptibility to conception, and contraception.... The analysis found that a small amount of education tends to increase fertility.... The effect of education on proximate determinants shows that it is positive for postpartum non-susceptibility to conception, [while] in contrast it is negative for marriage and contraception. Therefore, [the] contribution of the duration of postpartum non-susceptibility is stronger for less educated women, while marriage and contraception have important effects when education is high at the individual level.""",Rural demography,1989,Bangladesh,1989,80
6512513,Curiosity and demographic factors as determinants of children's probability-learning strategies.,"Children's curiosity, gender, activity level, and socioeconomic status (SES) were related to their performance on a partially reinforced discrimination-learning task. The 38 boys and 37 girls were in the first grade and were all white. Three factors of curiosity (manipulatory, conceptual, and about the complex) were assessed. Performance on the learning task was scored for the number of correct responses (maximizing) and for the frequency of three-step sequences reflecting variability, systematic patterning, and perseveration. In general, the three curiosity factors related negatively to maximizing and perseveration and positively to variability. (The same effects were found for activity level.) Systematic patterning related positively to one curiosity type and negatively to another. Girls used less maximizing and more systematic patterning than boys. The response choices of girls were affected more by differences in conceptual curiosity and those of boys by differences in curiosity about the complex. Activity level was unrelated to gender but differed with SES. The findings demonstrate the role of different curiosity factors in shaping response sequences and suggest some reasons for children's choice of probability-learning strategies.",The Journal of genetic psychology,1984 Sep,United States,1984,80
7202850,Canalization of arousal in the preweanling rat: effects of amphetamine on aggregation with surrogate stimuli.,"Preweanling rats, 15 days of age, were placed in an unfamiliar cage containing 1 of a variety of surrogate conspecific stimuli. The surrogate stimuli consisted of a rat-sized aluminum tube covered with soft fluffy synthetic fur, a tanned rat pelt, felt, and an aluminum sheet. The surrogate was either maintained at ambient temperature or heated to body surface temperature (37 degrees C). The 1st experiment revealed that both furriness (length and softness of fur) and temperature of the surrogate stimulus are important determinants of conspecific aggregation (huddling). The 2nd experiment demonstrated that preference for the soft, fluffy surrogate was not mediated by temperature conservation by showing that the same huddling behavior was obtained when ambient temperature was raised to thermoneutrality (33 degrees C). The final experiment demonstrated that amphetamine restricted the range of surrogate stimuli that elicited huddling in the preweanling rat. The finding that amphetamine produces a steeper generalization gradient of approach to surrogate stimuli further confirms our previous hypothesis that amphetamine canalizes arousal toward salient environmental stimuli. These findings have implications for the use of amphetamines to treat hyperkinetic children.",Developmental psychobiology,1981 Mar,United States,1981,80
7424897,Epidemiologic characteristics of hepatitis A virus infections in Greece.,"The major epidemiologic characteristics of hepatitis A virus (NAV) infections in Greece were studied in a sample of 877 Air Force recruits, 19-25 years old coming from every geographic region of Greece. Antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) were detected by solid phase radioimmunoassay in 83.8% of the recruits. Antibody frequency varied significantly in the various geographic regions of Greece and was inversely related to the size of the community. It was further shown that the prevalence of HAV infection was highly related to the recruit's social class and years of education as well as number of siblings and number of persons per room. These findings in accordance with previous reported data show that hepatitis A is hyperendemic and should be regarded as a childhood infection in Greece. Prevailing socioeconomic, hygienic living and housing conditions should be considered as the main epidemiologic determinants of HAV infections.",American journal of epidemiology,1980 Oct,United States,1980,80
2802928,Genetic and perinatal determinants of structural brain deficits in schizophrenia.,"Using a subsample from the Copenhagen schizophrenia high-risk project, we examined the contributions of schizophrenic genetic liability and perinatal complications to computed tomographic (CT) measurements of ventricular enlargement and cortical and cerebellar abnormalities. A factor analysis of six CT measurements yielded two significant factors. One factor reflected multisite neural deficits as evidenced by abnormality of the cerebellar vermis and widening of the sylvian and interhemispheric fissures and cortical sulci. The other factor reflected periventricular damage as evidenced by enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles. Because all of the subjects had schizophrenic mothers, the major source of genetic variation is contributed by the diagnostic status of their fathers. In a stepwise multiple-regression analysis, it was determined that the multisite neural deficits factor was significantly related to genetic risk for schizophrenia (as measured by schizophrenia spectrum illness in the subjects' fathers) but was unrelated to pregnancy or delivery complications or to weight at birth. Periventricular damage was highly and significantly correlated with the number of complications suffered at delivery, but only among subjects with an elevated genetic risk. Although limited by a small sample size, these results suggest that the two types of CT abnormalities in schizophrenia may reflect partially independent processes based on different combinations of genetic and perinatal influences.",Archives of general psychiatry,1989 Oct,United States,1989,80

3975667,Maintenance of psychosocial attitudes in medical students.,"Attitudes of medical students towards the psychosocial aspects of illness is of serious concern to medical educators. It is thought that medical students are overwhelmingly disease-oriented and not sufficiently sensitive to the role of the psychological, emotional, sociological and economic factors in the etiology and management of illness. In the present study the ATSIM (Attitudes Towards Social Issues in Medicine) was presented to third year medical students and compared with their responses obtained 2 years previously when they were first year students. The data suggest that third year medical students have positive attitudes towards certain psychosocial issues (the importance of social factors as determinants of health or illness, the role of preventive medicine in maintaining health, the role of physician-patient interactions in patient care). These attitudes were positive during the students' first year and have been maintained during the course of medical school. These finding are contrary to previous studies which indicate a deterioration in attitudes during the course of medical school.",Social science & medicine (1982),1985,England,1985,80
3723341,Observer judgments of acute pain: facial action determinants.,"We provided a microanalytic description of facial reactions to a series of painful and nonpainful electric shocks and examined the impact of these as discrete facial cues for observer judgments of acute pain. Thirty female volunteers were videotaped and reported their discomfort in response to electric shocks after earlier exposure to one of three social influence conditions: a tolerant model, an intolerant model, or neutral peer presence. We coded the videotapes for facial activity using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978b), and peer judges rated them for painful discomfort. Subjects exposed to a tolerant model reported no more discomfort than did subjects exposed to an intolerant model, despite receiving more intense levels of shock, but were judged by observers to be in more pain. Analyses of facial activity yielded consistent findings: Tolerant-model subjects, though reporting discomfort equivalent to that reported in other groups, displayed more pain-related facial activity (brow lowering, narrowing of the eye aperture from below, raising the upper lip, and blinking). There was a substantial direct relation between observer judgments of distress and discrete, pain-related facial actions (mean multiple R = .74 for the various shock levels rated). These data indicate that nonverbal expression yields information about the response to noxious stimulation that is non-redundant with self-report.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1986 Jun,United States,1986,80
6838152,Menarche in athletes: a synthesis and hypothesis.,"The determinants of the timing of menarche are many, and it is difficult to isolate a single factor which may delay or accelerate this maturational event. Menarche, on average, occurs later in athletes, including ballet dancers, than in the general population. With few exceptions, the data are consistent across several countries. Swimmers are an exception to the tendency towards later menarche in athletes. In all samples of swimmers surveyed but one, menarche tends to approximate the average for the general population. The menarcheal data are consistent with other indices of biological maturity status, i.e., skeletal age and secondary sex character development. The data dealing with the effects of intensive physical training on menarche are reviewed and given the number of factors involved, it is difficult to implicate training as a factor which specifically delays menarche. A two-part hypothesis for the apparent maturity delay in athletes is thus suggested. The hypothesis combines biological selective factors (i.e., physique and skill) and social factors. Family size and composition, however, must receive more consideration. Family size influences the timing of menarche and such a trend is apparent in data for several groups of athletes.",Annals of human biology,1983 Jan-Feb,England,1983,80
3426705,Alcohol and ambience: social and environmental determinants of intake and mood.,"An experiment was conducted in which 66 male subjects were given access to alcohol (20% vol.) and fruit juice to be mixed and tasted ad lib. A factorial design included social vs. solitary drinking conditions, laboratory vs. informal setting, and variable exposure to music. The amount of ethanol consumed (g/kg body weight) was used as an unobtrusive measure of preferred intake. The reciprocal relationship between mood and consumption was analyzed by LISREL. While euphoria has usually been perceived as a consequence of drinking, the only plausible fit to a LISREL model was obtained by assuming that the disposition to drink would be increased by positive mood changes occurring during the drinking session. An analogy between social drinking and adjunctive behaviour was supported, as alcohol consumption was directly affected by time-dependent environmental factors such as company and music. Since the presence of company also stimulated positive mood and alleviated boredom, consumption was precipitated by company indirectly as well as directly. These results emphasize the importance of direct as well as indirect environmental influences on spontaneous alcohol intake during social drinking.","Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire).

4049019,The treatment strategies of arthritis sufferers.,"This paper describes and analyses the reasons for variation in the treatment strategies used by arthritis sufferers. The research was undertaken among 103 people from the Australian city of Perth. Qualitative data was obtained from a clinical sample of 27 and, on the basis of that, an interview schedule was constructed and administered to a survey sample of 76 self-reported arthritis sufferers. Data collected included comprehensive case histories, knowledge and beliefs about arthritis, types of practitioners consulted and treatments used and a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. On the basis of analysis, four basic treatment strategies were discerned. Named after their most salient characteristics and ranging from least to most inclusive these were 'general practitioner and/or self care', 'medical and paramedical care', 'medical and alternative care' and use of 'all sources of care'. The most important determinants of treatment strategy were characteristics of disease--severity, mode of onset and period since onset. The longer the period since onset, the wider the range of treatments utilized. When onset occurred at a relatively young age and when progression was rapid, the more frequently alternative services and treatments were employed. Disease characteristics were followed in importance by socioeconomic factors. Use of the less inclusive strategies was related to social class; with working class people relying primarily on 'general practitioner and/or self care' and middle class people using 'medical and paramedical care'. However, when onset and progression were rapid, the disease was severe and the person relatively young socioeconomic factors were of lesser importance and people from all classes made use of the more inclusive strategies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Social science & medicine (1982),1985,England,1985,80

The prevalence of caries is high in the sample: 1. 31.5% of the children aged 5 to 6 are free of caries (according to the WHO objectives, 50% of the children aged 5 to 6 should have no caries), 2. the mean number of decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMF/T index) in children aged 11 to 12 is 6.6 (The DMF/T should be less than or equal to 3). The frequency of toothbrushing is distributed as follows: 23% of the children brush their teeth once a week or less, 46% brush their teeth once a day, and 31% brush their teeth twice a day or more. The purpose and the frequency of the consultations at the dentist's office have been examined: 15% of the children never consult the dentist, 44% consult the dentist in case of toothache, and 41% go to the dentist's office for screening or control. Only 3.2% of the children use regularly and appropriately fluoride tablets. Since the variance of the results is large, it is difficult to distinguish explaining variables or determinants. However, the data indicate that social groups show differences in DMF indices as well as in the behaviors associated with dental hygiene and prevention.",Archives belges = Belgisch archief,1989,Belgium,1989,80

7100991,Social psychological determinants of patient satisfaction: a test of five hypothesis.,"Five hypothesis regarding the social psychological determinants of patient satisfaction were tested among patients attending the primary care clinics of a university medical center in Manhatten. The social psychological variables operationalized here were expectations, values, entitlement and perceived occurrences; the three dimensions of satisfaction studied were doctor conduct, convenience and general satisfaction. The social psychological variables together were found to explain only a small proportion of the variance in satisfaction, although their contribution varied with the dimension of satisfaction. Expectations consistantly explained most of the variance in satisfaction ratings; particularly noteworthy was the direct effect of prior expectations of the doctor's conduct on subsequent satisfaction with that dimension of the care received. Values had little independent effect on satisfaction, and the combination of values and expectations (their interaction) was unrelated to satisfaction. Feelings of entitlement were also unrelated to satisfaction ratings. There was some support for the discrepancy model, which holds that the greater the discrepancy between perceived occurrences and prior expectations the less the satisfaction. The importance of carrying out further methodological studies aimed at developing reliable measures of these constructs is stressed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1982,England,1982,80
2892348,Increased activity of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase in myotonic dystrophy.,"The activity of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) and its determinants were studied in 17 patients with myotonic dystrophy. The gamma-GT activity was elevated in 11 patients and its mean value was five-fold higher than in healthy controls. The increase in gamma-GT could not be explained by factors generally known to result in a misleading elevation of gamma-GT. Most patients with elevated gamma-GT also had one or more other pathological laboratory tests related to hepatic function but none had a clinically significant liver disease. Serum gamma-GT activity was not related to the disability caused by dystrophy or to the level of serum creatine kinase suggesting that the elevation of serum gamma-GT is not an indication of a general cell membrane dysfunction. It is concluded that the increase in serum gamma-GT activity in patients with myotonic dystrophy is due to a real but mild liver involvement, which should be taken into account in the examination of these patients who often complain of gastrointestinal symptoms.",Acta medica Scandinavica,1987,Sweden,1987,80

Of the 585 women who participated, 459 were consecutive gynecological in- or outpatients, and 126 were selected from visitors in general practice. Data was analysed by multivariate test statistics. After correction for present age and social class, the duration of use of OC (DOC) among women 15-34 years of age correlated negatively to age at menarche and coital debut and positively to number of sexual partners, oral-genital sexual practice, and number of pelvic inflammatory diseases. Among women over 35, DOC was positively associated only to cigarette smoking. No correlation was found to coital frequency (whether earlier, present or during pregnancy or menstruation), number of births and abortions, or to social classification. In epidemiological research on benefits and risks of oral contraceptives, confounding influence of one or more variables is of crucial importance.

3237851,"Physiological, environmental, and subjective determinants of food intake in humans: a meal pattern analysis.","The spontaneous food intake of 31 adult humans was investigated with diary self-reports of ingestive behaviors and subjective hunger over 7 consecutive days. Meals were identified, using five different definitions, and their composition of total calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein was estimated from a computer file of the nutritive value of foods. These data were analyzed by intercorrelating meal sizes with intermeal intervals, estimated stomach contents and self-reported hunger with univariate and multiple correlation techniques. Human feeding was found to be regulated on the basis of preprandial factors; the premeal interval, estimated premeal stomach content, and self-reported hunger significantly correlating with the meal size. These correlations were significant regardless of whether the meal was evaluated as spontaneous or constrained by external factors, but were stronger when the meals occurred without other people being present. The postprandial relationship between the meal size and the duration of the postmeal interval, which is present in nonhuman species, was only present in humans when meals that were eaten alone were considered separately. This suggests that the species differences may be due to the social context of observation. The intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein was found to have a suppressive effect on subsequent intake and subjective hunger through their contributions to total food energy ingested. Protein, however, was found to suppress subsequent intake and subjective hunger independent of its contribution to total calories, suggesting that the macronutrients have differing satiating properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Physiology & behavior,1988,United States,1988,80
7326949,When rational men fall sick: an inquiry into some assumptions made by medical anthropologists.,"Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points.","Culture, medicine and psychiatry",1981 Dec,Netherlands,1981,80

6738684,[The formation of eating behavior].,"Food behaviour involves the totality of the actions of man which aim at satisfying his nutritional need. It is based on psychical reflection, decision and assessment processes. Food behaviour has social and historical determinants and forms accordingly to the dialectic relation of biological, social and economic conditions. Hunger, thirst and appetite are perceived as nutritional need which results from the requirements of energy, nutrients and liquid, and is satisfied by the food behaviour in conformity with the actual material potential, situational influences, subjective ideas, interests, attitudes and knowledge as well as other psychical properties. Consequently, food behaviour is rich in variations with dynamic and conservative features. Motives as well as will components are essential constituent conditions of food behaviour. For this reason, empirical studies arteo provide psychological cognition concerning the subjective reflection of the nutritional requirements, the requirement-standard integration, the sensation of stimulation and the decision-making in food behaviour, the ultimate goal being to deduce measures for food behaviour guidance.",Die Nahrung,1984,Germany,1984,80

A review of these findings revealed literature in the early stages of development. Nothing is known about the ecology of sexual abuse, and studies of physical abuse and neglect have done little more than demonstrate co-variation between reported incidence and neighborhood population and housing characteristics. Study findings reveal that (a) five of the seven community characteristics are significant and independent correlates of neglect, and four are correlates of abuse; (b) the strongest predictors of both types of maltreatment are percentage of families with income less than 200% of poverty and percent of vacant housing; and (c) the pattern of co-variation between the two economic stress indicators and three inadequate social support indicators are consistent with the ecological hypothesis.

3720261,Impact of chronic arthritis in the elderly.,"These case histories illustrate how medical, psychosocial, cultural and economic factors affect the elderly with chronic arthritis. Physicians need to be aware of their patient's attitudes, concerns, support systems and goals resulting from a lifetime of experience, to provide the most appropriate and effective care. 'Images of future are usually only caricatures of the present' (Starr, 1982), but based on current demography, one can predict trends for the future. It is likely that the elderly of the future will be better off financially, better educated, healthier, more politically connected and strident, but their social support systems will be less effective. The last stems from trends such as declining birth rate, an increasingly mobile society, diminished importance of the nuclear family, and the diminishing attractiveness of professions involved with providing maintenance care. This suggests that the physician and nurse, being the primary gatekeepers for the care of and services for the elderly, must be even more attentive to the non-biological determinants of arthritis disability.",Clinics in rheumatic diseases,1986 Apr,England,1986,80

Three domains of determinants are identified (personal psychological resources of parents, characteristics of the child, and contextual sources of stress and support), and a process model of competent parental functioning is offered on the basis of the analysis. The model presumes that parental functioning is multiply determined, that sources of contextual stress and support can directly affect parenting or indirectly affect parenting by first influencing individual psychological well-being, that personality influences contextual support/stress, which feeds back to shape parenting, and that, in order of importance, the personal psychological resources of the parent are more effective in buffering the parent-child relation from stress than are contextual sources of support, which are themselves more effective than characteristics of the child.",Child development,1984 Feb,United States,1984,80
3205187,Social issues in medicine: a follow-up comparison of senior-year medical students' attitudes with contemporaries in non-medical faculties.,"A comparison of first-year medical students' attitudes to social issues in medicine with attitudes of non-medical first-year students in 1983 found that the medical group was less conservative towards general social issues but more conservative in relation to those areas which closely affect the doctor's role, particularly the place of allied health professions and government intervention in health care. This paper reports a follow-up study of the same groups of students when they had reached senior years in their respective courses. While medical student conservatism on general social issues continues to be no greater than other student groups there is a marked increase in conservatism of attitudes towards government involvement in health care and regulation of costs. Attitudes to allied health professions and preventive care remain unchanged but senior medical students are significantly less likely to recognize social factors as determinants of illness than they were when they commenced the study of medicine. Specific curricular attention to social and behavioural medicine does not appear to counteract the predominantly biomedical perspective students experience in teaching hospitals, the major venue for their clinical education.",Medical education,1988 Sep,England,1988,80
3130744,Determinants of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human milk.,"In a longitudinal pilot study on the course of the PCB concentration in human milk during six months of lactation, some important PCB determinants could be studied in 23 women and their infants. PCB values were within the range of those found in the literature. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the association of the mean PCB concentration over the first half year of lactation with maternal parameters, such as age, height, weight, previous lactation period, education, occupation, residence, smoking, drinking and dietary habits as well as the infant parameters gestational age, birthweight and weight gain in the first six months of life. Since the PCB concentration on fat basis and the fat content of the milk were strongly inversely related, statistical analyses were carried out both on fat and on milk basis. In univariate analyses the PCB concentration on fat basis was most strongly associated with pre- versus post-pregnancy weight gain, age and occupation. After multiple regression analysis PCB concentration on fat basis remained significantly associated with weight gain changes and remained borderline (p less than 0.10) significantly related with occupation. The pre-pregnancy Quetelet Index of the mother (height/weight) and the estimated PCB content of the diet (primarily fish) were strongly correlated with the PCB concentration on milk basis. Only the Quetelet Index remained significantly related after multiple regression analysis.",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,1988 Jan,Sweden,1988,80
7246836,Determinants of foster care placement for the maltreated child.,"This study examined the records of the North Carolina Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect to determine which social, family, and child characteristics were most influential in the decision to place a child in foster care. These records contained all theoretically relevant factors as well as demographic data. Analysis included the computation of odds ratios for foster care for each of 250 variables. A maximum likelihood logistic regression model was constructed to obtain the independent and cumulative contribution of each factor. Some expected variables such as parental stress factors (substance abuse) and types of abuse (burns and scalds) placed a child at a significant risk for placement in foster care (p less than 0.01). However, less obvious factors such as referral source (law enforcement agencies) or geographic area also placed children at risk. Overall, the model explained little of the variance of these decisions (R2 = 0.168) and poorly predicted placement (sensitivity 66.3 per cent, specificity 74.6 per cent). Using existing data, we were unable to adequately describe the decision process in selecting foster care.",American journal of public health,1981 Jul,United States,1981,80

6382590,Intelligence in schizophrenia: meta-analysis of the research.,"This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females.",Schizophrenia bulletin,1984,United States,1984,80

Factors specifically considered include sex, skid row status, social class, and abnormal use of drugs of dependence, the amount of alcohol consumed and duration of drinking, drinking pattern, and type of beverage. While heavy drinking is of primary importance, the physical disease profile found in hazardous drinkers is modified by certain host and environmental characteristics.

Absence of family imprints can result in the development of deviant childhood behavior and loss of identity. In two black racial groups in dissimilar world areas and sampling (Kenya, Africa and Newark, N.J.), five familial determinants interfered with the development of culturally accepted family imprints and led to deviant and criminal behavior. It is suggested that if these deterrents, namely poverty, lack of family authority figures, rejection of of the individual child, absence of family cohesiveness, and loss of individual identity within the family, were altered in their development by family therapy techniques, then criminal and deviant behavior would be decreased.",Journal of forensic sciences,1980 Jan,United States,1980,80
10256650,Correlates of life expectancy in less developed countries.,"Analyses were performed to investigate several hypotheses concerning the multiple determinants of levels of life expectancy in developing countries in recent decades and some possible explanation for the observed variations in amount of gain in life expectancy from the 1950's to the 1970's. The findings were significant. For level of life expectancy the results of this present work conform by and large to results of other scholars in this area, although the present work is unique in that only developing countries were included. From the 1960's to the 1970's there has been a shift in the relative importance of economic indicators and general social indicators in favor of the social indicators. In the period 1960-65 some 70% of the variation in levels of life expectancy was associated with per capita income and literacy rates in a ratio of about three to two in favor of the economic variable. By 1970-75 the ratio has become six to one in favor of literacy. In addition, the multivariate model showed that the sanitation variables began to appear as significant correlates of levels of life expectancy in the more recent time period, playing a larger role than level of income per capita. Work pursued as part of a separate but concurrent project explored explicitly this three-way interaction between literacy, life expectancy and sanitation.",Health policy and education,1982 Mar,Netherlands,1982,80
3538185,Social and biocultural determinants of food selection.,"Health professionals concerned with improving the nutritional status of populations are facing numerous problems ranging from emaciation to overnutrition. This review article addresses the complexity, the relative significance and the interaction of factors leading to the nutritional profile of specific groups and individuals. When availability of food is threatened, the programs designed to reduce the incidence of malnutrition must balance the food supply with energy resources and population needs as well as encourage economic improvement of food distribution systems. For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection. Excessive austerity in food use negates the pleasure of eating, a useful mechanism in food choice ensuring food diversity.",Progress in food & nutrition science,1986,England,1986,80

""Since nineteenth century emigration took place mostly through primary contacts this article will examine the newly established immigrant settlements as 'communities transplanted'...which directs our research to include local municipal records such as population censuses, population registers (which were supplemented after 1861 with registers of in- and out-migration), tax records, and records of vital events like marriage, birth and death registers. The quality and availability of these records vary from place to place, but generally speaking, in the case of the Netherlands, they are of high quality since population registration at the municipal level was required by law. The source of information for the local records are the population registers (Bevolkings Registers) which were originally constructed on the basis of information obtained from the 1850 population census....""",The International migration review,1987 Spring,United States,1987,80

There was correlation between functional capacity and ability of self-care as well as some social determinants. However, no association was found with employment rate or certain other determinants of independent living, such as going on a holiday. We conclude that the severity of the lesion is a fundamental factor in determining the outcome, but factors related to personal and psychosocial variables, not easily measured, also have great influence on the rehabilitation process.",International disability studies,1989 Oct-Dec,Switzerland,1989,80
3729384,Analysis of environmental determinants of aggression and disruption in mentally retarded children.,"This study evaluated methods for empirically identifying environmental determinants of aggressive and disruptive behavior in three developmentally delayed children. A variety of sessions conducted on an inpatient treatment unit were designed to stimulate contingencies maintaining aggression and disruption in the subjects' natural environments. The basic analog conditions included: instructional demands, contingent social disapproval, and structured play. In addition, variations of the three basic conditions were developed based on informal observation and parental reports of naturally occurring contingencies. Results showed considerable variability both between and within subjects. However, for each subject a specific analog condition was shown to produce relatively higher rates of aberrant behavior. Subsequently, behavioral treatments based on assessment results were successfully implemented with two of the subjects. Results are discussed in terms of the importance and practical limitations of conducting systematic assessment of aberrant repertoires in developmentally delayed clients.",Applied research in mental retardation,1986,United States,1986,80

2772105,Situational determinants of cardiovascular and emotional reactivity in high and low hostile men.,"Various epidemiologic studies have found that high scores on the Cook and Medley Hostility (Ho) scale are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), severity of atherosclerosis, and all-cause mortality. One plausible biological mechanism suspected of contributing to increased risk of CHD is sympathetic nervous system-mediated hyperresponsivity to environmental stressors. The present study evaluated cardiovascular reactivity among young men with high versus low Ho scores during performance of an anagram task with or without harassment. Compared to performing the task alone, harassment led to increased cardiovascular arousal that was more pronounced for the high Ho subjects than the low Ho subjects. Moreover, harassment produced increases in self-rated anger, irritation, and tension, but it was only among those subjects with high Ho scores that increased anger and irritation were associated with enhanced cardiovascular arousal. While suggesting a role for anger- and irritation-induced cardiovascular arousal in pathogenesis of CHD, these findings indicate that situation characteristics mediate the relationship between Ho scores and cardiovascular reactivity, and that there may be a differential biological link between anger/irritation and cardiovascular responses in men with high and low Ho scores.",Psychosomatic medicine,1989 Jul-Aug,United States,1989,80

Data are taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience and concern some 5,000 U.S. women followed from 1968 to 1978. ""Among all groups examined, age at first birth tends to increase as education levels increase, and married women with spouses present tend to be older than other women at first childbirth. Among whites, all economic influences considered--hourly pay rate, nonmarket income, and work during the year prior to childbearing--have a significant influence in deferring first childbirth, but family background does not. Among blacks, family background plays a significant role in determining age at first childbirth, but only one economic influence--the hourly pay rate--is significant.""",Contemporary policy issues,1987 Apr,United States,1987,80

First, fights and the formation of dominance-subordinancy relations were studied. Second, it was determined that large body size as well as males' prior residency in a tank produced an agonistic advantage; the magnitude of this advantage was positively related to the duration of residency. Third, the prior-residency effect in Bettas was determined by males' familiarity with visual and/or tactile cues in their home tanks. Fourth, dominant males had greater access to living space and were more likely to display at a mirror, build nests, and approach females than were subordinates. Finally, it was discovered that chemical cues associated with presumedly inert plastic tank dividers influence Bettas' social behavior.","Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983)",1984 Dec,United States,1984,80
7057020,"Economic dependency, health services, and health: the case of Lesotho.","This article is concerned with two factors affecting the health status of the people of Lesotho: (1) the nation's function as a reserve labor economy (that is, the primary source of income for about half the country's male labor force is employment in South Africa); and (2) the health care system (its size, composition, accessibility, and efficiency). Although such apparently diverse factors usually are analyzed independently, they might be combined to provide a more complete understanding of the determinants of health and disease. The paper reaches the conclusion that any substantive solutions to the problems of Lesotho will be found primarily in the wider southern Africa setting, and not within the context of small, dependent national states. At the same time, these small, dependent national states must make development decisions considering existing geopolitical realities. Foresightful decision making on these issues could both contribute immediately to the health of the people of Lesotho, and also increase in longer-term possibilities for a better life for all the people of southern Africa.","Journal of health politics, policy and law",1982 Winter,United States,1982,80

Ninety-five domestic chicks were reared in either a social environment or physical (tactile) isolation, and half in each rearing condition were reared and/or tested under conditions of visual restriction. As expected, social rearing was prerequisite to the manifestation of extended death feigning; however, the incidence and duration of death-feigning was attenuated by functional visual isolation of socially reared chicks during either rearing or testing. It was concluded that visual novelty of the environment is the minimal condition for sustained death feigning by young chicks in the daylight hours.",The American journal of psychology,1980 Jun,United States,1980,80

Twenty-one variables are used to represent seven latent constructs: Parent Sexual Attitudes, Sexual Latency, Sexual Behavior, Dating Competence, Social Assertiveness, Subjective Masturbatory Responsiveness, and Subjective Coital Responsiveness. Two specific theories are tested with these constructs. Each theory predicts a different structural arrangement among these latent factors with the fundamental difference being whether behavior predicts responsiveness or vice-versa. Two alternate models were found to reflect the data adequately. In both instances, attitudes predicted behavior and, in general, orgasmic responsiveness tended to be a function of behavior.",Journal of sex & marital therapy,1984 Winter,England,1984,80

This model is applied to six-year longitudinal data on life events exposure for a sample of New Zealand women with school-aged children. The fitted model suggests that in the region of 30% of the variance in life-event reports over the six-year period was attributable to a common vulnerability factor. Modelling of this vulnerability factor suggested that two major determinants of vulnerability to life events were the level of social disadvantage of the woman and her level of neuroticism: women of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and women with high neuroticism scores showed a consistent tendency to report high life-event exposure during the six-year period. The implications of these findings are discussed.,Psychological medicine,1987 Aug,England,1987,80

Reporting on empirically based evidence of the situation of elderly men. ad 1. The following contextual aspects of the male aging process were under consideration: generalized and personalized images of elderly men, subjective reports on ""male aging"", changing images of the male sex role and the aging role, male sex role typing across the life span, middle and late adulthood as relevant lifespan segments preceding old age, and sociodemographic and health statistics concerning the situation in which elderly men live. ad 2. The report on empirically based data on the psychosocial situation of old aged men included the following aspects: Social roles of men in old age, comparisons between elderly men and elderly women and between elderly and younger men, interindividual variability (classifications) among the group of old-aged men and early antecedents as ""predictors"" of life satisfaction in old age. Analyzing these different kinds of material, the importance of a differential approach to the multidimensionally determined situation of men in old age was stressed; on the other hand, it seemed to be possible to identify certain ""typical"" characteristics at least for the present cohorts of old-aged men (e.g. importance of the quality of marital life, significance of being free of stress, tendency of experiential integration etc.).",Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie,1986 Jul-Aug,Germany,1986,80
3323587,[Motives and interpersonal functions of aggression].,"In this review, the author theoretically and empirically examined motives and interpersonal functions of aggression. A factor-analysis of Averill's questionnaire items on anger revealed that motives involved in aggressive responses were clustered into two groups: the hostile and the instrumental. It was also clarified that an individual is likely to engage in aggression particularly when some hostile motives are evoked. Concerning the interpersonal functions, the author proposed that aggression might serve four principal goals. (1) Aggression can be generated as an avoidance response to an aversive stimulus, such as frustration, annoyance, or pain, and so on. It depends on the severity of the stimulus. It was however emphasized that aggression is also mediated by social cognition, such as an attribution of intent to a harm-doer. (2) Aggression can be used as a means of coercing the other person into doing something. An individual is likely to use such a power strategy if he/she is lacking in self-confidence or a perspective for influencing the target person by more peaceful strategies. (3) Aggression can be interpreted as a punishment when it is directed toward a transgressor. In this case, aggression is motivated by restoration of a social justice, and thus its intensity is determined by the perceived moral responsibility of the transgressor. Further, it was indicated that aggression is intensified if it is justified as a sanctional conduct against the immoral. (4) Aggression can be also evoked when an individual's social identity is threatened. It was suggested that impression management motives are involved in aggression by an unexpected finding that the presence of audience or the identifiability rather facilitated retaliative aggression. The aggression-inhibition effect of apology was also explained in terms of impression management. In conclusion, it was presented that aggression is a behavioral strategy as an attempt to resolve interpersonal conflicts including physical or psychological annoyance, the other person's disobedience, perceived injustice, and a threat to one's social identity. Whether one's aggression is performed or not depends on a number of intra- and inter-personal determinants, particularly on social cognitive processes such as attribution, inference, prediction and other judgements.",Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology,1987 Jun,Japan,1987,80
7372385,Determinants of the occupational strategies adopted by British hospital nurses.,"This paper focuses on the position of the nurse in the division of labor in health care and the occupational strategies British hospital nurses have adopted in response to their changing employement situation. The authors suggest a Marxist framework as an alternative to current approaches to the study of occupational strategy, which tend to focus on the level of distribution relations. An adequate analysis of the situation of hospital nurses, the paper suggests, depends upon locating the occupation within the wider setting of the mode of control and delivery of health care. The central feature of this setting is the dominance of medicine and medical technology, and the main factors shaping it are the activities of individual capitalists involved in the health industry and the State operating within the constraints of capital in general and within the context of class struggle. It is suggested that the characteristic feature of nurses' occupational strategy--the vacillation between professionalism and unionism--can best be understood in relation to the changing mode of control and delivery of health care and nurses' contradictory position within the social relations that constitute that mode.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1980,United States,1980,80
3916715,"Behavior, lifestyle, and socioeconomic variables as determinants of health status: implications for health policy development.","Health promotion has become an official health policy of this country, and it is being pursued through efforts to change individuals' health-related behavior. This approach is based on the assumption that it is in fact an individual's behavior that most directly determines his or her health status. But how good is the evidence that supports this assumption? Specifically, is the evidence sufficient for this assumption to outweigh the long-standing finding that social and economic conditions have a strong relationship to health status? The major support for the behavior approach derives from the coronary heart disease risk-factor studies and the Alameda County Study. In a series of reports over time, the relationship between individuals' health practices and their health status generally, as well as that between heart disease and cancer specifically, have been established by these studies. These observations, however, have not been confirmed when deliberate efforts have been made to change those practices. The evidence in support of the importance of social and economic conditions to health status has been documented through a long series of studies in this country, which have found a direct relationship between individuals' socioeconomic status and their health status. This relationship, however, has not in this country been tested by intervention. Only a few studies have examined the interrelationship between these two approaches to health promotion, but the evidence to date has failed to suggest that either one is the mediator of the other. We must, therefore, conclude that pursuing a policy of health promotion based on either approach to the exclusion of the other would indeed be short-sighted health policy.",American journal of preventive medicine,1985 Sep-Oct,Netherlands,1985,80

Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery.",American journal of public health,1989 Mar,United States,1989,80

A cross-sectional descriptive study of several populations reveals a strong and consistent dose-response pattern: Social drinkers have mean HDL cholesterol levels that are higher than those of teetotalers by as much as 33%. Cross-sectional analyses in another epidemiological study reveal the association to be independent of potential confounding factors such as smoking and body weight, and longitudinal analyses suggest that it is also not a result of certain unmeasured sources of confounding. A small experiment reveals a 15% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels among social drinkers who abstain from alcohol from a 2-week period. The evidence supports the conclusion that alcohol habits are probably one of the determinants of plasma HDL cholesterol level. A clarification of the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical medicine awaits future clinical efforts.",Circulation,1981 Sep,United States,1981,80

Plausible approaches to chronic disease prevention are likely to increase longevity further, with some foreseeable effects on demographic and economic projections. Primarily, longevity advances would swell forecasts of population size, and would thus have to be met by production advances in order to maintain or improve living standards. This study, a restricted example, considers the probable demographic and economic consequences of a limited prevention program in the context of the Ford Motor Company, based on actual experience and certain expectations up to the year 2000. According to the results, prevention would reduce outlays for life insurance, disability, and health care, but would also generate the higher costs of extending pension plans.

Growth in these children is described and a number of determinants identified. Social-class differences were very small at birth but differences in height became clear by the age of two years and in head circumference before this. In height the differences were largely accounted for by greater growth in social class I, but there was a gradient in head circumference throughout all the social classes. The social class effects gradually increased as the children became older. Parity of the mothers had a small effect on size at birth but age of the mother had no effect once parity was allowed for. Data on illnesses in the children were collected but no effect on growth could be detected. By far the most important determinant of growth which could be controlled is maternal smoking. About 40% of the women smoked, about 17% heavily (15 or more cigarettes per day) and the prevalence of smoking altered little during pregnancy. There was a graded effect of smoking on growth up to a 9% deficit in birth-weight, a 2% deficit in length at birth and a 1.5% deficit in head circumference in the babies born to the mothers who smoked most heavily (25 or more cigarettes per day) compared with non-smokers. There effects decreased with age but there were still residual effects at age five years.",Annals of human biology,1987 Nov-Dec,England,1987,80
12281022,Socio-economic stratification generated by international migration loops.,"This paper analyzes the migration phenomenon within a framework that treats migration movements as continuous loops, from the country of origin to the destination and back. Significant social-psychological factors at each step of the loop process contribute to the development of migration streams along a predictable pattern. The general model of the loop process shows that the migration stream is 1st sparked when labor is recruited from less developed countries for work in developed industrialized countries. Once the social process of migration has begun, it tends to acquire a self-feeding character. Social and economic change in sending and receiving societies brought about by migration make further migration more likely. The case of the Mexico-US-Mexico loop process is analyzed. This case illustrates the effects of socioeconomic stratification that occurs in communities where the migration loop process reaches a certain level of maturity. The majority of a town's population may become committed to migration as a way of life. Eventually, wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of those that are most able to migrate. Thus, migrants may become a new elite segment of rural populations that were once relatively homogenous societies. Further research of the migration loop process should be conducted. At least in the case of Mexico, the socioeconomic stratification in the villages and towns acting as sources of migration loops with destinations in the US have significant internal economic, social, and political implications.","International migration (Geneva, Switzerland)",1988 Mar,Switzerland,1988,80
3834353,Cancer in Hispanics in Los Angeles County.,"Using ethnicity of surname, nativity, residential social class, and inferred age at migration to characterize and subdivide Hispanics in Los Angeles, we compared risk ratios and proportional incidence ratios to examine the patterns of occurrence of selected neoplasms within the Hispanic community. Common neoplasms for which Hispanics have high, low, and intermediary risk were examined in detail. Although the patterns expected on the basis of current concepts of etiology were generally found and served to reinforce presumptions about the biologic significance of the risk factors, a number of observations cannot be explained easily with current knowledge. The risks for stomach and bowel cancers do not conform to the mirror-image patterns to be expected on the basis of inverse patterns of dietary acculturation. Incidence of cancer of the breast, in contrast to that of cervix, does not appear to reflect early cultural practice. Consistent details in the patterns of cancers of the bladder, rectum, ovary, prostate, and possibly pancreas imply unrecognized determinants of disease. Gallbladder cancer in Hispanic women is the disease most closely tied to Hispanic origin or culture, or both, but the ethnic pattern in women differs greatly from that in men.",National Cancer Institute monograph,1985 Dec,United States,1985,80
24896982,"An experimental model of aggressive dominance in Xiphophorus Helleri (pisces, poeciliidae).","An experimental model was constructed using seven postulates derived from the experimental results of Zayan (1974, 1975a,b,c, 1976). The model specifies the relative importance of several asymmetries in predicting aggressive dominance in Xiphophorus helleri . These asymmetries concern difference between duellists with respect to: prior residence in the tested area (vs intrusion); immediate social experiences of dominance or submission; social isolation; individual familiarity and recognition. The predictions of the general model were checked experimentally and confirmed; a multiple orthogonal regression accounted for about 97% of the variance in our experimental results. The basic experimental results serving as postulates were confirmed and could be generalized; a new synthetic and predictive model was formulated concerning the determinants of aggressive dominance in Xiphophorus .",Behavioural processes,1985 Jan,Netherlands,1985,80
6814269,A prospective study of long-term care institutionalization among the aged.,"A statewide probability sample of 1,625 elders living in Massachusetts are studied prospectively to identify key determinants of long-term care (LTC) institutionalization. One-hundred forty-seven elders, 9 per cent of the original cohort, entered a LTC institution during the six-year investigation. Using logistic multiple regression, we examine the predictive power of 19 independent variables grouped into six categories: demographic characteristics, attitude, social context, long-term care needs, physical disability, and mental/emotional disability. Five variables are significantly related to institutionalization: advancing age, using ambulatory aids, mental disorientation, living alone, and using assistance to perform ""instrumental"" ADL (activities of daily living). These results may be helpful to those trying to target non-institutional services to elders for use as substitutes for institutional long-term care. They may also help explain why recent experimental tests of substituting non-institutional care for institutional services have been less than successful.",American journal of public health,1982 Dec,United States,1982,80
3251009,Epidemiological aspects of suicide among the young in selected European countries.,"Trends in reported suicide rates were analysed for the ages 5-24 years in 21 selected European countries in 1970-74 and 1980-84. In children the precision of the rates was found to be low though there appeared to be a trend to increased suicide in boys. In adolescent and young adult males, however, there was a definite increase in suicide over the period studied, and this was much more marked than in females, in whom the rates had declined in eight countries. The Belgian situation was investigated in detail. Increases were most pronounced in 20-24 year-old males. Around 1981, about half of youth suicides were committed by firearms and medicaments, and these methods showed the largest increases in risk. The estimated under-reporting error diminished with increasing age and over the past ten years. It was larger in females, but did not bias the trends substantially. On the aggregated level, youth suicide was found most strongly associated with indicators of anomie and social isolation. The relevance of these findings in the search for determinants and for preventive strategies is discussed.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1988 Sep,England,1988,80

The causes of this decline have thus far not been established. Six major strategies for investigating determinants of ischemic heart disease mortality trends are discussed in this review: (1) analyses of mortality data; (2) morbidity surveillance; (3) surveillance of change in medical care; (4) surveillance of cardiovascular risk factors; (5) social and ecological surveillance; (6) experimental and quasi-experimental community approaches. The rationale, problems and limitations of each are discussed.",Journal of chronic diseases,1982,England,1982,80
4076484,Rural-urban mobility in Thailand: a decision-making approach.,"This paper has analyzed a theoretical model of mobility decision-making. The model relies entirely on individual-level factors rather than macro-level factors as determinants of migration decision-making. The individual-level variables included in the model are: recent mobility history, urban social contacts, information about urban areas, evaluations of different locations, migration plans, and actual movements in the period subsequent to an initial interview. The empirical results indicate that with some exceptions there are relatively strong links of the type suggested in the model among these variables. The model was evaluated separately for two groups of villages for movement to Bangkok and for movement to Northeast Thai towns. Thus, four submodels were estimated, providing an opportunity to observe how robust the model is with respect to varying destinations and origins. Although certain differences are found among the four submodels, the overwhelming feature is their similarity. Where differences do exist, they generally reflect differences in the effectiveness of prior mobility as a predictor of other variables in the process. Clearly, a villager's previous history of movement is a key factor affecting subsequent movement and the entire decision-making process. The primary effect of having friends and relatives in a particular urban center is to increase the amount of information a villager has about that urban center. Information has a significant effect on evaluations and plans. Except in one submodel, evaluations have a significant effect on plans; and the existence of plans--which to some extent represent a culmination of social contacts, information, and evaluations--is the only factor other than previous mobility which has a significant direct effect on subsequent movement. Thai policy makers are searching for ways to stimulate the growth of regional urban growth centers and reduce the growth of Bangkok. From the standpoint of intervention, a key variable in this process would appear to be information. Not only is information level related to evaluations of an urban area and mobility plans, but, compared to other variables in the model, it appears to be relatively amenable to modification by inputs deriving from a source external to the village itself. It appears difficult to modify evaluations or migration plans directly, though both could be indirectly influenced by informational inputs. Movement history would be difficult, if not impossible, to manipulate; while villagers could be sponsored for short trips to town, this is not likely to produce much long-range effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Demography,1985 Nov,United States,1985,80
2709190,A hypothesis for the pathogenesis of essential hypertension: the initiating factors.,"A longitudinal study of rural-urban migration from a low blood pressure community was completed in 1985. It is suggested that the rapid increase in blood pressure observed with acculturation in this study constitutes a new dynamic model for the early phase of human essential hypertension. Analysis of data derived from this study indicates that increases in dietary sodium, weight gain and sympathetic tone (possibly reflecting acute environmental stress) are important determinants of the early blood pressure rise. It is proposed that a defence reaction occurs in response to environmental stress which maintains or increases cardiorenal sympathetic outflow, thereby overriding the negative feedback inhibition of sympathetic activity which otherwise occurs when dietary sodium is suddenly increased. The antinatriuretic response results in an early volume-dependent rise in blood pressure. We also propose that variation in individual blood pressure responses to migration may be explained not only by quantum differences in the two environmental factors, but also by a genetically-determined failure of adaptation to the combined effects of these stimuli on renal tubular reabsorption of sodium.",Journal of hypertension.

2911699,Determinants of well-being in primary caregivers of spinal cord injured persons.,"A study of well-being in middle-aged and elderly spinal cord injured persons (Decker & Schulz, 1985) found that long-term coping was facilitated by the presence of a primary support person or caregiver. The purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of life satisfaction and depression in 67 primary caregivers of middle-aged and elderly spinal cord injured persons. The study revealed that the availability of social support and feelings of control over one's life were important determinants of caregivers' well-being. In addition, those caregivers spending more time each day assisting the disabled person and feeling burdened by these responsibilities experienced more depression and less life satisfaction. In working with spinal cord injured persons, rehabilitation nurses must consider the well-being of the spinal cord injured person/primary caregiver dyad as an important focus of nursing assessment and intervention.",Rehabilitation nursing : the official journal of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses,1989 Jan-Feb,United States,1989,80
6520656,Smoking and pregnancy.,"Smoking during pregnancy is associated with many adverse outcomes, including fetal and neonatal death. These consequences are tragic in many ways, but perhaps the greatest tragedy is that they are preventable if the smoker ceases to smoke during pregnancy. Although in some instances the so-called constitutional hypothesis is difficult to disprove, the available evidence seems more than convincing that it is smoking itself, and not the smoker's unique constitution, that is responsible. Cessation from smoking is clearly advisable at any time, but more so during pregnancy when every cigarette affects both the smoker and her unborn child.",Journal of psychoactive drugs,1984 Oct-Dec,United States,1984,80
2589474,"Nutritional determinants of high-altitude growth in Nunoa, Peru.","Data on nutritional intake and patterns of physical growth in the rural Andean community of Nunoa, Peru (elevation 4,000 m), are described and compared to data previously collected from this location. Food consumption data and selected anthropometric measures were obtained from a sample of 33 households. Estimates of caloric intake from this study are very similar to those obtained in Nunoa during the mid- and late 1960s. However, within the present sample, upper income (i.e., middle class) individuals have significantly higher caloric intakes than those of the lower income group and also appear to have an improved diet relative to individuals of 20 years ago. Anthropometric data show that children of the upper socioeconomic status (SES) group are significantly taller and heavier than the lower SES group children. Moreover, the children of the wealthier families are taller and heavier than the children measured 20 years ago at the same location, whereas the poorer children are not. These results indicate that nutritional factors have significantly contributed to the extreme pattern of slow growth previously reported for children of Nunoa and, moreover, demonstrate how social and environmental forces interact to create differential levels of stress that contribute to variation in biological well-being.",American journal of physical anthropology,1989 Nov,United States,1989,80

3992291,Socialization and interpersonal environment in nurses' affective reactions to work.,"The dominant explanation of nurses' affective experience in work is the conflict between the beliefs and expectations developed during the formal training process (education) and the role definitions in the hospital work setting. Specifically, it is generally proposed that baccalaureate trained nurses experience this person-role conflict more than the associate or diploma trained nurse because baccalaureate training instills more beliefs/expectations that conflict with the hospital nursing role. However, research has not sufficiently compared the effect of 'socialization' variables like education with other variables found to affect the work experience. This study uses path analysis to explore the relative effects of education, length of experience and the measured interpersonal work environment across types of person-role conflicts, on overall job satisfaction and on propensity to leave. The results show that the interpersonal factors are the paramount determinants of the measured person-role conflicts and, as well, have a greater effect than education and experience on job satisfaction. Also, education and length of experience have greater direct than indirect effects on propensity to leave, indicating that their effects are not via causality of job-related stress. Implications for programs designed to improve the nurse's work experience and affects are discussed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1985,England,1985,80

The number of categories important in determining retirement was greater for white men than for black men and increased with increase in economic level. Retirement was found to have few consequences, being important mainly with respect to health and economic matters. Blacks and poverty level men were minimally affected by retirement, the impact of retirement probably being somewhat ameliorated by age-determined income maintenance programs and subsidies. Men at the marginal economic level were affected most adversely.",Journal of gerontology,1985 Jan,United States,1985,80
2723595,Visit frequency for essential hypertension: observed associations.,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services.",The Journal of family practice,1989 Jun,United States,1989,80
31968907,"Demography, ranging patterns, and activity budgets of black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus chamek) in the Manu National Park, Peru.","Results of a long-term field study on the ecology and social organization of two groups of black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus chamek) in Peru are reported. Demography, ranging patterns, and activity budgets provide insight into some of the proximate determinants of fission-fusion social organization in this species and illustrate the different strategies used by males and females to gain access to critical resources. Longitudinal data on known individuals provide evidence for male natal philopatry and female emigration at sexual maturity in this population. Interbirth intervals are long (mean = 34.5 months) in comparison with most other primate species, and 5 of 15 infants seen within a few days of birth died or disappeared before they were a year old. Home ranges are large (150-250 ha) and fairly discrete; overlap with neighboring groups is on the order of 10-15%. Males and females differed substantially in their ranging patterns; females, particularly those with infants, restricted much of their ranging to a ""core area"" 20-33% the size of the total group range, whereas males ranged more evenly over the entire area occupied by the group. Daily path length varied over almost an order of magnitude from 465 m to 4,070 m, with a mean of 1977 m. Males spent more time traveling and less time feeding than most females. These results are compared with those obtained in previous studies of Ateles and with similar data from other primate species to assess their implications for the evolution of fission-fusion sociality in spider monkeys. The ecological factors responsible for the evolution of very similar social organizations in spider monkeys and chimpanzees are discussed.",American journal of primatology,1988,United States,1988,80
6684973,Identifying determinants of risk of sexual victimization of youth: a multivariate approach.,"The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts.",Child abuse & neglect,1983,England,1983,80

The study calls attention to the importance of fathers' drinking, life events, social class relations and a generalized alienation from self, work and society for understanding frequency of intoxication and masculine and feminine orientations during alcohol use. A path analysis suggests that the men and women who become intoxicated may regain a sense of self and relationships to others that they do not have in sober everyday life.

6143404,Determinants of drug use: a test of the coping hypothesis.,"This paper uses a national probability sample to examine major correlates of drug use among American adults. Demographic correlates of alcohol, cigarette, marijuana, tranquilizer, sleeping pill and stimulant use are explained in terms of a self medication or coping perspective of drug use. Two analysis procedures are used. In the first, respondents were asked to list strategies they use when they have problems. These responses are 'broken down' by drug use categories or 'taking pills'. In the second procedure, attempts are made to interpret the correlations between age, sex, marital status, education and drug use by introducing variables which measure how respondents were experiencing fundamental aspects of their lives (role stress items) and mental health variables. A substantial portion of the variance in drug use that is explained by demographic variables appears to operate through social role and mental health variables, that is, these latter variables interpret the demographic/drug use relationships in a way that is consistent with a coping perspective. The authors conclude that these data and this analysis provided cautious support for a coping perspective.",Social science & medicine (1982),1984,England,1984,80

The present study was a random sample (N = 295) of households in Los Angeles with Japanese surnames. Japanese Americans born in the United States tended to drink less than those born in Japan. The study also observed significant gender differences in Japanese American drinking behavior which were attributed to ascribed social roles. Other demographic and social determinants of drinking were examined through two logistic regression models. The first model predicted drinking (as opposed to abstaining), while the other distinguished heavy drinkers from those who drank alcohol in more moderate amounts.

Of interest is the proposition that levels of achievement, aggression, and psychological distress are partly determined by corresponding levels of competition and interpersonal intensity; however, in the presence of high levels of social synergy, aggression and psychological distress are lowered without affecting the level of achievement. We have tested the implied linear relationships, using blind ratings (of five variables assessed from ethnographic extracts) obtained from ten cross-cultural scholars, and a Social Development Index (from Tatje and Naroll) to indicate achievement.

Then a multivariate (proportional hazard) analysis showed that socioeconomic factors including residence, caste status and education influence the breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea periods. There was no effect of maternal age on the length of breast-feeding, but mean length of post-partum amenorrhoea varied with age.

6644542,Predicting contraceptive behavior from attitudes: a comparison of within- versus across-subjects procedures.,"Within- versus across-subjects procedures for predicting behavior from attitudes were contrasted. Each procedure requires a comparison among attitudes in order to generate a prediction; the comparison is either among the same attitudes held by different people (across subjects) or among different attitudes held by the same person (within subject). It was hypothesized that the within-subject model provides a more adequate explanation of behavior from attitudinal constructs and, hence, more accurate prediction of behavior from attitudes than does the across-subjects model. To test this view, a sample of 349 married couples was administered a questionnaire containing measures of three attitudinal components--affect, cognition, and conation--toward each of four contraceptive methods--oral contraceptives, IUD, diaphragm, and condoms. Contraceptive behavior was assessed 1 year later. In support of the hypothesis, the within-subject predictions bore a significantly stronger relation to the behavioral criteria than did the across-subjects predictions. This effect was consistent for each of the three components of attitude, for the prediction of behavior and behavioral intention, for male and female respondents, and for a variety of contraceptive behaviors. In addition, both the within- and the across-subjects analyses demonstrated a clear rank ordering in the predictive validity of the three attitudinal components: Conation was a better predictor of behavior than was affect, which, in turn, was better than cognition.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1983 Nov,United States,1983,80

6382590,Intelligence in schizophrenia: meta-analysis of the research.,"This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females.",Schizophrenia bulletin,1984,United States,1984,80

Both patients subsequently had dramatic negative reactions to the therapeutic efforts of physicians caring for them. Various social, experiential, and characterologic determinants are discussed. In addition, the authors argue that the illness served important organizing functions: it sheltered these patients from the exigencies of everyday life; it allowed them to defeat the physician's efforts to effect a cure; and, finally, the disfigured physical state appeared to correspond to their internalized defective self-image and self-esteem.",General hospital psychiatry,1987 Jan,United States,1987,80

The first section will discuss: (1) the concept of culture, (2) hierarchical levels of human behavior determinants, (3) the cultural variability continuum, and (4) the concept of self. The second section will discuss: (1) epidemiology, (2) culture and clinical phenomenology in severe disorders, and (3) culture as an etiological determinant. The paper closes with a discussion of some conclusions and suggestions for future research.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica. Supplementum,1988,Denmark,1988,80
3437081,The determinants and structure of adolescents' beliefs about the economy.,"Although it is of both practical and theoretical importance very little work has been done on adolescents' knowledge of, and beliefs about, the economy. Two studies are reported in this paper--the first concerns the determinants of economic values in a population of 16-17 year old British schoolchildren, and the second concerns economic preferences and knowledge in a larger group of slightly older adolescents. By-and-large the pattern of results is not dissimilar from other studies done on older children. The results are discussed in terms of the literature on economic socialization.",Journal of adolescence,1987 Dec,England,1987,80
7208724,Socio-cultural factors in the development of anorexia nervosa.,"A population of professional dance (N = 183) and modelling (N = 56) students, who by career choice must focus increased attention and control over their body shapes, was studied. Height and weight data were obtained on all subjects. In addition, a questionnaire that is useful in assessing the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), was administered. Results of these tests were compared with those of normal female university students (N = 59), patients with anorexia nervosa (N = 68), and music students (N = 35). Anorexia nervosa and excessive dieting concerns were overrepresented in the dance and modelling students. Twelve cases (6.5%) of primary anorexia nervosa were detected in the dance group. All but one case developed the disorder while studying dance. Within the dance group those from the most competitive environments had the greatest frequency of anorexia nervosa. These data suggest that both pressures to be slim and achievement expectations are risk factors in the development of anorexia nervosa. The influence of socio-cultural determinants are discussed within the context of anorexia nervosa as a multidetermined disorder.",Psychological medicine,1980 Nov,England,1980,80
6849845,Epidemiological determinants of vesicovaginal fistulas.,"Between 1969 and 1980 1443 patients with vesicovaginal fistulas were operated on in Ahmadu Bello University Hospital in Northern Nigeria. They have been studied in relation to their obstetric, social and environmental background. The preventable nature of the lesion was explored particularly with respect to age, parity and obstructed labour, and to traditional practices including 'gishiri cutting', which alone accounts for 13% of all the fistulas. Vesicovaginal fistulas are still a major cause for concern in many developing countries; measures for prevention include universal education and improved status of women in society as well as improved and accessible medical services.",British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,1983 May,England,1983,80
6644542,Predicting contraceptive behavior from attitudes: a comparison of within- versus across-subjects procedures.,"Within- versus across-subjects procedures for predicting behavior from attitudes were contrasted. Each procedure requires a comparison among attitudes in order to generate a prediction; the comparison is either among the same attitudes held by different people (across subjects) or among different attitudes held by the same person (within subject). It was hypothesized that the within-subject model provides a more adequate explanation of behavior from attitudinal constructs and, hence, more accurate prediction of behavior from attitudes than does the across-subjects model. To test this view, a sample of 349 married couples was administered a questionnaire containing measures of three attitudinal components--affect, cognition, and conation--toward each of four contraceptive methods--oral contraceptives, IUD, diaphragm, and condoms. Contraceptive behavior was assessed 1 year later. In support of the hypothesis, the within-subject predictions bore a significantly stronger relation to the behavioral criteria than did the across-subjects predictions. This effect was consistent for each of the three components of attitude, for the prediction of behavior and behavioral intention, for male and female respondents, and for a variety of contraceptive behaviors. In addition, both the within- and the across-subjects analyses demonstrated a clear rank ordering in the predictive validity of the three attitudinal components: Conation was a better predictor of behavior than was affect, which, in turn, was better than cognition.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1983 Nov,United States,1983,80
2529668,[A historico-social approach to the medical scientific theory of Ludwik Fleck (1896-1961)].,"Ludwik Fleck has shown in his discussion of the logical empirism of the Vienna Circle that his concept of reality presupposes an unproven logico-structural correspondence between the world and the formal logical structure of language, i.e. between reality and thought. Upon this questionable foundation he proceeds to develop his own position concerning the theory of medical science. He claims that scientific knowledge is at no time exempt from cultural, historical and social conditions, of which scientific knowledge itself is a function. These conditions find expression in the style of thought of a particular epoch (""Denkstil"") as well as in the interaction of the participating scientists (""Denkkollektiv""). Flecks merits for having explicated the conditionality of the process of scientific knowledge over against positivistic thought have been honourably elaborated in many studies. The present study offers an analysis of the manner in which the Fleck position attempts to serve as an explanation of change in the content and style of thought in history. It will be made clear that these changes and developments can only be explained as the result of the interaction and competition among the collectives of scientists and thinkers. Fleck deprives his socio-historical position of its logical foundation by radicalizing these conditions in such a manner that they become fundamental determinants of human thought generally and for the individual scientist particularly. As a consequence, from the perspective in which the thought of the individual is thus determined, he can neither establish a convincing theory for changes in thought in history nor for the human relations obtaining within the collective of scientists and thinkers.",Sudhoffs Archiv,1989,Germany,1989,80
7397056,Environmental factors affecting paracetamol metabolism in London factory and office workers.,"A Paracetamol elimination was measured, using serial saliva samples, in 114 London factory and office workers, 76 Whites and 38 Asian immigrants. 2. Use of social drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and the oral contraceptive varied considerably within the sample, being appreciably greater in White subjects. 3. Paracetamol clearance was 21% slower in Asians than in Whites and half-life 18% longer. The total range of clearance was 1.86--6.78 ml min-1 kg-1. 4. Clearance was slower in women than in men, increased with increasing alcohol intake and cigarett consumption, and was more rapid in those women using the oral contraceptive. The effects of alcohol and the oral contraceptive were also found in White subjects alone. 5 The variables found to correlate independently with paracetamol clearance accounted for only 27% of the total sample variance, however, and are unlikely to be the major determinants of paracetamol elimination in man.",British journal of clinical pharmacology,1980 Jul,England,1980,80
3232413,The global impact of noncommunicable diseases: estimates and projections.,"With the aging of populations in developing countries there is both a demographic and an epidemiological transition which affects the impact of chronic degenerative diseases on the health status of the populations. Demographic transition takes place in countries where there are effective programmes of disease control which allow for survival during the early years of childhood and adolescence. This results in an increase in life expectancy which places larger proportions of the population in the age range (60 years and older) in which chronic degenerative diseases become the major determinants of health status. Epidemiological transition in diseases may also be brought about by shifts in social and economic patterns which favour detrimental changes in risk factors for the chronic degenerative diseases. Such changes may include health-related behaviour which augments dietary consumption of fats and alcohol, increases obesity, increases smoking and decreases physical activity. Such changes in risk-factor levels increase the prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases which manifest themselves at later ages, and for which early preventive actions could be cost-effective. In order to illustrate the impact of both demographic and risk-factor effects, analyses are made of the impact of increases in life expectancy on cause-specific mortality in both developing and developed countries. It is shown that there is great similarity in the effect of major noncommunicable diseases on the life expectancy of adults in both developed and developing countries. The major differences are seen to be in the proportions of deaths expected from such diseases as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cirrhosis; but not in the distribution of age at death which is the better measure of disease impact. Demographic analyses, computing indirect estimates of mortality, also demonstrate that there are currently more chronic disease deaths in developing than developed countries and that as expectation of life increases in developing countries the global chronic disease burden will be greatly concentrated in the developing countries. Analyses of risk-factor reduction by feasible intervention strategies, e.g. smoking cessation campaigns, treatment of high blood pressure, using relationships between risk factors and diseases established in longitudinal studies carried out in developed countries, point out that the effect of risk-factor control in long-living populations can be hidden by the dependency of risk factors and various related causes of death, e.g. smoking has an impact on lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease and emphysema, but at different ages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",World health statistics quarterly.

2641329,Attributions of responsibility in adolescent cancer patients and their parents.,"Attributions of responsibility have been shown to be important determinants of illness behavior in adults. This study examines the salience of attributional judgements among adolescents with cancer. Patients and their parents were categorized according to their attributions of responsibility for the cause of and solution to the adolescent's health problems into one of four attributional models. Of the four possible models, only two were represented: the medical and compensatory. Only 37.5% of parent/child pairs were concordant for model choice. Patients whose attributions conformed to those of the compensatory model sought more information (F = 5.1, (P = .03), were satisfied with the information supplied (F = 3.5, P = .07), and expressed the belief that a greater percentage of prescribed medications needed to be taken if a cure was to result (F = 4.1, P = .05). Side effects were more often experienced by patients whose responsibility attributions exemplified the medical model (F = 5.09, P = .03). Model concordance did not relate to parent/child agreement on health-related beliefs, patient age, sex, or compliance measures (P greater than .05). No relationship was found between parent-child model concordance and patient's self-reported medication compliance. The present data do not support the notion that attributions of responsibility for cause and solution of cancer should be important targets of interventions designed to increase medication compliance among cancer patients.",Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,1989,England,1989,80
3990300,Subjective effects of alcohol: the influence of setting and individual differences in alcohol expectancies.,"Contemporary theorists view many alcohol effects as complex functions of a number of interacting variables ranging from pharmacological factors (e.g., limb of the blood alcohol curve), environmental factors (e.g., setting) and dispositional factors (e.g., individually held expectations concerning the effects of alcohol). To examine this general model, the joint effects on subjective state of beverage (alcohol vs placebo), of setting (alone vs group) and of individual differences in alcohol expectancies were examined in a sample of 98 men social drinkers. Assessment of subjective state included measures of both mood and perceived physical sensations. The results demonstrated the complex determinants of subjective effects of alcohol and illustrated the difficulty of making strong generalizations concerning the subjective effects of alcohol. Alcohol consumption, alcohol expectancies and setting appear to have both independent and interacting effects on subjective state. These effects appear to vary in importance across the types of effects considered and the time since drinking.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1985 Mar,United States,1985,80
3874527,On processes of peer influences in adolescent drug use: a developmental perspective.,"Data from longitudinal studies of adolescents carried out over the last ten years are reviewed to provide an integrated and dynamic perspective on the nature of friendships and processes of peer influence in adolescent drug involvement, within a general developmental perspective. Four interrelated questions are examined: What individual attributes are especially important in the formation of friendships among adolescents? Which of two processes, selection or socialization, account for the similarity in values and behaviors observed in ongoing friendship dyads, and how important is similarity in friendship formation and dissolution? What is the nature of friends' influence as compared to parents', and in which domains of adolescent's life do these influences exert themselves? What mechanisms, role modeling or social learning, underlie processes of interpersonal influences? Relational dyadic and triadic samples of adolescents matched to a parent and/or a best friend and observed at one point in time as well as over time provide important and relatively rare sources of data on processes of interpersonal influence. Sociodemographic characteristics are the strongest determinants of friendship formation, with participation in illicit drugs following next in importance. Both selection (assortative pairing) and socialization contribute to observed similarity in friendship pairs. Adolescents coordinate their choice of friends and their values and behaviors, in particular the use of marijuana, so as to maximize congruency in the friendship dyad. If there is a state of unbalance such that the friend's attitude or behavior is inconsistent with the adolescent's, the adolescent will either break off the friendship and seek another friend or will keep the friend and modify his or her own behavior. Both parents and peers can have strong influences on adolescents, depending upon the arena of influence. Parents are especially important for future life plans, while peers are most important for involvement in illicit drug use. However, for drug use itself, there are different patterns of influence depending upon the stage of drug involvement. Peers are especially important for initiation into marijuana use, while parental factors gain in importance in the transition from marijuana use to the use of other illicit drugs. Interpersonal influences of peers on ongoing marijuana and alcohol use result from modeling and imitation more than from social reinforcement and the transmission of values.",Advances in alcohol & substance abuse,1985 Spring-Summer,United States,1985,80
2723595,Visit frequency for essential hypertension: observed associations.,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services.",The Journal of family practice,1989 Jun,United States,1989,80

2926632,Intrapersonal and social comparison determinants of happiness: a range-frequency analysis.,"Examined whether intrapersonal comparisons and social comparisons operate in similar ways to determine ratings of happiness. Events were varied to create positively and negatively skewed distributions. The events in each distribution were ascribed to either a single person or a group of people; Ss rated how happy they would feel if they experienced specific events within the distribution. Ratings for both intrapersonal and social comparisons were fit well by Parducci's (1984) range-frequency theory. Individual events received higher ratings when presented within the positively skewed context. Overall happiness, as measured by both the mean of the happiness ratings as well as direct ratings, was highest for the negatively skewed distributions. The effects of skewing were more pronounced for intrapersonal comparisons, but ratings were more closely defined by the range of experimental stimuli for social comparisons.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1989 Mar,United States,1989,80
6148471,Determinants of retrovirus (HTLV-III) antibody and immunodeficiency conditions in homosexual men.,"A cohort of homosexual men at high risk of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was monitored to examine the relation between lifestyle, clinical conditions, T-lymphocyte subsets, and antibody to the AIDS-associated human retrovirus, human T-cell leukaemia virus III (HTLV-III). HTLV-III antibodies were present in 35 (53%) of the 66 subjects tested in June, 1982. 4 of the seronegative subjects had HTLV-III antibodies when re-tested one year later, a seroconversion rate of 1.2% per month. In the HTLV-III seropositive subjects, AIDS developed at a rate of 6.9% per year (minimum incidence of AIDS = 4.6% per year) and other clinical signs of immunodeficiency (lesser AIDS) at 13.1% per year. All 6 of the AIDS cases and at least 8 of the 10 lesser AIDS cases had detectable HTLV-III antibodies 1 week to 21 months before diagnosis. Of 24 other subjects with stable lymphadenopathy, 19 (79%) had or acquired HTLV-III antibodies. Lower helper T-cell counts were very closely related to HTLV-III seropositivity (r = -0.53, p = 0.0001), even in the 26 healthy subjects with no clinical abnormalities (r = -0.37, p = 0.07). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the lifestyle risk factors for HTLV-III seropositivity were large number of homosexual partners (p less than or equal to 0.03) and receptive anal intercourse (p less than or equal to 0.03), with an apparent synergistic interaction between these two activities (chi 2 = 8.71, p = 0.003). These data suggest that frequent receptive anal intercourse with many homosexual partners predisposes to HTLV-III infection with the consequent emergence of lymphadenopathy and the various manifestations of lesser and fully fledged AIDS.","Lancet (London, England)",1984 Sep 29,England,1984,80

The ubiquity of lying and others forms of deception suggests that they have ""normal"" aspects, but lying which is persistent or destructive to the quality of a person's life becomes pathological. Lying has many determinants, including developmental, biological, social, and psychodynamic. Antisocial, histrionic, narcissistic, borderline, and compulsive personalities have been associated with lying.

Current knowledge suggests that fundamental male-female differences do not exist as far as the etiology or symptomatology of these disorders is concerned. Given such similarities, the lower incidence among males suggests biological, social and intrapsychic determinants, that can be conceived to be more active in female versus male populations.",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

3806448,"Determinants of beliefs about illness: a study of parents of children with diabetes, asthma, epilepsy, and no chronic illness.","Social psychological models of health care behaviour frequently take as their starting point perception of the illness. This paper seeks to examine factors that may influence these perceptions. Beliefs about the seriousness of eleven childhood illnesses are compared in four groups of parents. Significant differences were evident between the groups of parents depending upon their experiences with illness. For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes. These results are interpreted within an information processing model. Implications of the findings for social psychological models of health care behaviour are discussed.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1986,England,1986,80
6634993,Experience-based vocalization of male mice to female chemosignals.,"Previous experimentation led to a suggestion that pituitary-mediated metabolites present in female urine are important determinants of stimulus potency in eliciting 70 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations from adult male mice (Mus musculus). In the present experiment this hypothesis was reexamined, taking into account the prior experience of the male test subjects. Male mice were given social experience with either hypophysectomized females or intact, normal females and were then monitored for ultrasonic vocalizations to chemosensory stimuli from both. Results indicated that males (1) will emit ultrasonic vocalizations to urine from hypophysectomized females and (2) tend to preferentially emit ultrasound to stimuli from the type of female previously encountered during the social experience regimen. It is proposed that the previously reported lack of ultrasound emission by males to chemosignals from hypophysectomized females can be accounted for via straightforward associative learning mechanisms.",Physiology & behavior,1983 Sep,United States,1983,80
6701567,"Social support and mental health: direct, protective and compensatory effects.","This study deals with the relationship between social support and mental health. This relationship was conceptualized as a multi-faceted one which may be understood in terms of direct (main), protective (buffering) and compensatory effects. Hypotheses relating to these effects were evaluated in terms of spousal/community support and job strains (pressure, autonomy, opportunities) among a sample of 455 married males who were employed on a full-time basis. Results indicated that spousal support generally had more important implications for psychological well-being than did community support. However, the relative impact of these different sources of support appeared to be related to the degree to which the mental health symptomology reported was affectively defined. With respect to protective effects, spousal support was found to moderate the relationship between certain job strains (pressure) and mental health. No protective effects were found for community support. Tests of the hypothesis that community support compensates for low levels of spousal support were made in terms of both direct and protective effects. No direct effect compensation was observed. However, protective effect compensation was observed for certain job strains (opportunities) and was relevant to a wide range of symptomology. The overall results suggest a primary/secondary hierarchy of supports and strains in which primary supports (e.g. spousal) assume a protective function with respect to secondary strains (e.g. job) while secondary supports (e.g. community) do not protect individuals from primary strains (e.g. spousal). Secondary supports have a protective function for secondary strains in the absence of primary supports. It is further suggested that sex roles may be important determinants of the availability and use of different support sources.",Social science & medicine (1982),1984,England,1984,80
6892318,Determinants of foster care placement for the maltreated child.,"This study examined the records of the North Carolina Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect to determine which social, family, and child characteristics were most influential in the decision to place a child in foster care. These records contained all theoretically relevant factors as well as demographic data. Analysis included the computation of odds ratios for foster care for each of 250 variables. A maximum likelihood logistic regression model was constructed to obtain the independent and cumulative contribution of each factor. Some expected variables such as parental stress factors (substance abuse) and types of abuse (burns and scalds) placed a child at a significant risk for placement in foster care (p less than 0.01). However, less obvious factors such as referral source (law enforcement agencies) or geographic area also placed children at risk. Overall, the model explained little of the variance of these decisions (R2 = 0.168) and poorly predicted placement (sensitivity 66.3 per cent, specificity 74.6 per cent). Using existing data, we were unable to adequately describe the decision process in selecting foster care.",Child abuse & neglect,1982,England,1982,80

3399999,Temporal and social aspects of gonorrhea transmission: the force of infectivity.,"Theoretical consideration of the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) suggests that the key determinants of transmission dynamics are the duration of infectiousness and the extent to which subgroups in the population interact sexually. We used two empirical correlates to represent these concepts: (1) the force of infectivity, calculated by summing all the days of potential infectivity (the time between last sexual exposure and treatment of the contact) generated by a given case, and then summing the days for all cases within a given subgroup; (2) self-selection, representing the observed probability that members of a given subgroup select sexual partners from within their own group. Using data gathered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, we estimated that a single group i.e., black, male, heterosexual, military personnel residing in the core areas, generated 27% of the force of infectivity. Subgroups that select greater than 50% of their sexual partners from outside their sociodemographic boundaries generated a rate for the force of infectivity that was 4.5 times higher than the rate for self-selectors. These findings confirm the core group theory and suggest strategies for control of STD.",Sexually transmitted diseases,1988 Apr-Jun,United States,1988,80

3529422,Marital context and post-infarction quality of life: is it social support or something more?,"The development of a theory of quality of life following serious illness is currently an important field of endeavour in rehabilitation research. The interpersonal relationships of people and elements of the self-concept appear to be salient factors in causal models of subjective well-being. One such model developed to explain characteristic levels of well-being was used in a longitudinal study of adaptation to a first myocardial infarction. Data were collected from a national sample of male cardiac patients and their spouses on the illness and marital situation as predictors of long-term well-being or ill-being. Analyses of data from the first three waves of the study, which is to extend over 5 years after the onset of illness, are to be discussed in the paper. Marital status, the emotional quality of the spouse relationship and long-standing marital stressors were found to have direct and indirect effects on the two dimensions of the Bradburn Affect Balance Scale. The same is true of continuing problems associated with the heart attack relative to perceptions of having coped effectively with the after effects of illness. Differences in self-esteem and personal competence were suggested as mediators of socio-environmental and illness-related influences. The two-factor conception of well-being developed was found to be a useful framework for investigating positive and negative aspects of psychosocial rehabilitation. The same factors that explain differences between happy and unhappy people in social indicators research also appeared to be determinants of different trajectories of adaptation in the wake of a life-threatening illness. Previous research using theoretical models from stress research has overemphasized psychosocial morbidity and stress management and neglected positive processes of adaptation. The identification of love resources related to positive feeling states and life satisfaction has, therefore, not received the attention it deserves. This is especially the case regarding an overemphasis of the concept of social support as a buffer of stress. Instruments were developed to measure high and low marital intimacy, as well as chronic marital role strains, and these measures appeared to explain different trajectories of adjustment to cardiac disease. The two-factor model appears to be useful for future work on quality of life with chronic illness. The same is true of four marital contexts of rehabilitation that were identified in the study.",Social science & medicine (1982),1986,England,1986,80
6143404,Determinants of drug use: a test of the coping hypothesis.,"This paper uses a national probability sample to examine major correlates of drug use among American adults. Demographic correlates of alcohol, cigarette, marijuana, tranquilizer, sleeping pill and stimulant use are explained in terms of a self medication or coping perspective of drug use. Two analysis procedures are used. In the first, respondents were asked to list strategies they use when they have problems. These responses are 'broken down' by drug use categories or 'taking pills'. In the second procedure, attempts are made to interpret the correlations between age, sex, marital status, education and drug use by introducing variables which measure how respondents were experiencing fundamental aspects of their lives (role stress items) and mental health variables. A substantial portion of the variance in drug use that is explained by demographic variables appears to operate through social role and mental health variables, that is, these latter variables interpret the demographic/drug use relationships in a way that is consistent with a coping perspective. The authors conclude that these data and this analysis provided cautious support for a coping perspective.",Social science & medicine (1982),1984,England,1984,80
3064632,Teenage alcohol use in the Australian twin register: genetic and social determinants of starting to drink.,"Retrospective information about teenage alcohol use was obtained from 1589 adult twin pairs aged 20-30 years from the Australian twin register. Twin pairs were highly concordant both for teenage drinking (or abstinence) and for early versus late onset of drinking. Sociodemographic variables (e.g., paternal occupation and parental religious affiliation) and psychosocial variables (e.g., personality and attitudinal traits), assessed when the twins were adults, were comparatively poor predictors of teenage drinking. Environmental influences on onset of drinking appeared to be sex-specific, i.e., uncorrelated over twins from unlike-sex pairs. Among drinkers, early versus late onset of drinking was more strongly influenced by inherited factors in females, but by shared features of the social environment (e.g., family background or school experience) in males.","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",1988 Dec,England,1988,80
6701954,Advertising family planning in the press: direct response results from Bangladesh.,"In 1977 and again in 1982, a series of couponed ads were run in three major Bangladeshi newspapers to test the relative effectiveness of different family planning themes. The ads offered a free booklet about methods of family planning (1977) or ""detailed information on contraceptives"" (1982) in the context of family health, the wife's happiness, the children's future, and family economics. The most effective ads, by a highly significant margin, were those stressing the importance of family economics (food and shelter) and the children's (sons') future. The least effective ads stressed the benefits of family planning for the wife.",Studies in family planning,1984 Jan-Feb,United States,1984,80

This overview includes a review of social network concepts; and analysis of the multiple determinants of social networks; an analysis of the varied effects of social networks; and the implications for policies and practices of community mental health centers. This paper adopts the view that the concept of social network is a useful tool in examining both the functional and the dysfunctional influences of one's primary group on individual adaption.",Community mental health journal,1980 Spring,United States,1980,80

Especially the influence of characteristics of the delivery system (e.g. differences between urban and rural regions) and characteristics of users (e.g. social class) are investigated. In this article the conceptual frame of the study is described. The model is based on assumptions of the action-decision-theory. It structures the process of decision and action into four phases: the first two, perception and interpretation, are summarized as ""process of attention""; the subsequent ones, coping and evaluation, as ""process of acting"". The model describes the social system (the total of demographic, socio-structural and socio-economic variables) and the memory system (contained within the individual life history) as mediating factors influencing the decision to act.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1986,Switzerland,1986,80
2649990,Family-oriented prevention of cardiovascular disease: a social epidemiological approach.,"A social epidemiological approach has been used to study social factors associated with chronic disease, as well as to promote community-oriented intervention programs to modify risk for cardiovascular disease. The present review suggests using a social epidemiological approach in a third way; to promote efforts directed toward family-oriented primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is presented which shows an association between three family social factors (marital status, family socioeconomic status, family size) and risk for cardiovascular disease. The real determinants of risk, however, may be the underlying health-related behaviors indicated by each of these factors. Evidence is also presented which shows the importance of a fourth family social factor (family age) in promoting effective health education efforts to modify risk. Thus, a social epidemiological approach is more valuable than a single discipline-based approach in identifying, understanding, and modifying family social influences on cardiovascular risk.",Social science & medicine (1982),1989,England,1989,80
3399999,Temporal and social aspects of gonorrhea transmission: the force of infectivity.,"Theoretical consideration of the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) suggests that the key determinants of transmission dynamics are the duration of infectiousness and the extent to which subgroups in the population interact sexually. We used two empirical correlates to represent these concepts: (1) the force of infectivity, calculated by summing all the days of potential infectivity (the time between last sexual exposure and treatment of the contact) generated by a given case, and then summing the days for all cases within a given subgroup; (2) self-selection, representing the observed probability that members of a given subgroup select sexual partners from within their own group. Using data gathered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, we estimated that a single group i.e., black, male, heterosexual, military personnel residing in the core areas, generated 27% of the force of infectivity. Subgroups that select greater than 50% of their sexual partners from outside their sociodemographic boundaries generated a rate for the force of infectivity that was 4.5 times higher than the rate for self-selectors. These findings confirm the core group theory and suggest strategies for control of STD.",Sexually transmitted diseases,1988 Apr-Jun,United States,1988,80

Data were also gathered concerning age, family size, birth order, socioeconomic status, race, and school grade. Results were subjected to a multivariate analysis and showed support for a multidimensional model of locus of control. There was no difference in expectancy of control for negative academic events between delinquents and nondelinquents. In general, birth order and delinquency were the two most important determinants of locus of control. Results are discussed in terms of previous literature on locus of control with particular consideration paid to expectations of control.",Adolescence,1984 Summer,United States,1984,80
3992291,Socialization and interpersonal environment in nurses' affective reactions to work.,"The dominant explanation of nurses' affective experience in work is the conflict between the beliefs and expectations developed during the formal training process (education) and the role definitions in the hospital work setting. Specifically, it is generally proposed that baccalaureate trained nurses experience this person-role conflict more than the associate or diploma trained nurse because baccalaureate training instills more beliefs/expectations that conflict with the hospital nursing role. However, research has not sufficiently compared the effect of 'socialization' variables like education with other variables found to affect the work experience. This study uses path analysis to explore the relative effects of education, length of experience and the measured interpersonal work environment across types of person-role conflicts, on overall job satisfaction and on propensity to leave. The results show that the interpersonal factors are the paramount determinants of the measured person-role conflicts and, as well, have a greater effect than education and experience on job satisfaction. Also, education and length of experience have greater direct than indirect effects on propensity to leave, indicating that their effects are not via causality of job-related stress. Implications for programs designed to improve the nurse's work experience and affects are discussed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1985,England,1985,80
2529668,[A historico-social approach to the medical scientific theory of Ludwik Fleck (1896-1961)].,"Ludwik Fleck has shown in his discussion of the logical empirism of the Vienna Circle that his concept of reality presupposes an unproven logico-structural correspondence between the world and the formal logical structure of language, i.e. between reality and thought. Upon this questionable foundation he proceeds to develop his own position concerning the theory of medical science. He claims that scientific knowledge is at no time exempt from cultural, historical and social conditions, of which scientific knowledge itself is a function. These conditions find expression in the style of thought of a particular epoch (""Denkstil"") as well as in the interaction of the participating scientists (""Denkkollektiv""). Flecks merits for having explicated the conditionality of the process of scientific knowledge over against positivistic thought have been honourably elaborated in many studies. The present study offers an analysis of the manner in which the Fleck position attempts to serve as an explanation of change in the content and style of thought in history. It will be made clear that these changes and developments can only be explained as the result of the interaction and competition among the collectives of scientists and thinkers. Fleck deprives his socio-historical position of its logical foundation by radicalizing these conditions in such a manner that they become fundamental determinants of human thought generally and for the individual scientist particularly. As a consequence, from the perspective in which the thought of the individual is thus determined, he can neither establish a convincing theory for changes in thought in history nor for the human relations obtaining within the collective of scientists and thinkers.",Sudhoffs Archiv,1989,Germany,1989,80
28514037,"Socioeconomic correlates of fertility, mortality, and child survival in mothers from a disadvantaged, urban Guatemalan community.","Social and economic determinants of fertility, mortality, and child survival were studied in a sample of 519 mothers from EL Progreso, a disadvantaged community located on the outskirts of Guatemala city. Fertility (children ever-born) and mortality (number of children who had died postnatally) data were obtained from interviews, along with data on the characteristics of the mothers, fathers, and the households. Contraceptive use was recorded on a subsample of 167 mothers of 5-year old children. Following factor analyses, three variables were selected for analysis: Years of schooling of the father and the mother and the type of fuel used for cooking. Father's education and type of fuel were significantly related to maternal fertility, while only the educational attainment of the mother was related to child mortality and survival. When contraceptive use was included in the ANCOVA in the subsample, it was a significant determinant of fertility, while father's education became nonsignificant. In terms of mortality, contraceptive use was a significant determinant, while the significance of the mother's education fell to a borderline value (P = 0.084).",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,1989,United States,1989,80
6541496,Sex and strain related effects of melatonin and 5-methoxytryptophol on open field behaviour in paired mice.,"The effects of two methoxyindoles, melatonin (MEL) and 5-methoxytryptophol (5-MTL), on partner investigation and other aspects of pair behaviour in the open field, were observed on male and female mice of the albino TO, and the pigmented C57BL/6 strains. Both indole derivatives are major secretory products of rodent (and human) pineal glands. They were administered by i.p. injection (100 micrograms/kg) to both members of the pair 1 h before each 10 min open field exposure. The testing took place on 3 consecutive days. There were no significant differences in behaviour over days, and group means were used in subsequent data analysis (MANOVA and Dunnet's test). Males, more socially active than the females in both strains, responded to MEL by a reduction in contact time; 5-MTL had the same effect on C57 males (TO males showed no change). Females, on the other hand, did not respond to MEL, and increased their social contact seeking after 5-MTL. There was no consistent effect of either indole on locomotion, and erratic (TO strain only) effects on defaecation. The data are discussed in terms of possible actions of pineal indoles on determinants of social behaviour.",Behavioural brain research,1984 Aug,Netherlands,1984,80
22085142,The timing of Spanish marriages a socio-statistical study.,"Abstract A sample survey of 2,012 married and single women aged 18-59 in Madrid was in part focused on causes of late marriage, which has for a long time been characteristic of Spain. It was found that age at marriage was not related to a variety of socio-economic measures, to parental restrictions on courtship, nor to birth order or number of siblings. Direct economic motivations appear to have affected length of courtship but scarcely age at marriage. Ages at marriage differ in different areas of Madrid, even when key demographic and social variables are controlled; and evidence from a sub-sample of interviews suggests that it may be a characteristic of different families. Along with clear evidence of normative patterns supporting long courtships and late marriages, such data point to the potential importance of sociological variables, and to the need for similar research on determinants of men's ages at marriage.",Population studies,1983,England,1983,80

Two sets of factors are examined: social characteristics of the adopters are used to test Rogers's and Shoemaker's contention that discontinuers have more traditional values than continuers; and the adoption decision process is analyzed to identify the relationship of communication factors to discontinuance. Although number of children and experience of method problems were the major determinants of discontinuance, unfavorable information from friends and other birth control users was a significant factor.

""The fertility measure used in this analysis is the number of children ever born to a woman. An attempt is made first to establish the differential in fertility levels between urban and rural areas after necessary control of the demographic factors..., and then the possible explanation of the differential is sought in terms of socio-economic variables such as education of the respondent, and occupation, work pattern, work status and place of work of the respondent as well as that of the husband."" Data concerning the fertility differentials and the associated explanatory variables are presented in tables and charts. ""The results tend to show that the countries of Asia are undergoing similar patterns of fertility transition as was experienced in the advanced countries.

This study uses a national sample of women of childbearing age gathered by the Sri Lanka World Fertility Survey in 1975 to assess four possible reasons for differential contraceptive use: (1) differences in socioeconomic position; (2) cultural differences; (3) minority status; and (4) differential access to family planning services. The first three explanations focus on differences in the demand for contraception while the fourth explanation focuses on differences in the availability of contraceptives. The socioeconomic, cultural, and minority status hypotheses fail to explain the higher contraceptive use among the Sinhalese. The evidence is consistent with the idea that ethnic differences in contraceptive use were largely caused by differential access to family planning services.",Studies in family planning,1984 Sep-Oct,United States,1984,80
2723595,Visit frequency for essential hypertension: observed associations.,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval.

10281815,The changing structure of the health care delivery system in the United States.,"The historical equilibrium of the health care industry has been disturbed by recent and radical changes in both the financing of medical services and the structure of the industry. The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments.

3227364,"Effects of HIV infection, perceived health and clinical status on a cohort at risk for AIDS.","Data from a general population sample of 621 healthy homosexual men are used to evaluate the social and emotional effects of HIV antibody status, clinical signs detected by medical examination, and subjectively perceived symptoms. Participants are unaware of their serologic status at the time of data collection, thus allowing the effects of the virus to be separated from reactions to the knowledge of serologic status. The data show that seropositivity for HIV is not associated with elevated levels of social or emotional impairment. Clinical signs lead to impairment in baseline data, but these effects do not persist at a second wave. This weakening suggests that the effects are mediated by psychological pathways rather than biologic ones. This suspicion is confirmed in further analyses, which show that the effects of clinical signs are mediated by subjectively perceived symptoms. These results show that neither social nor emotional impairment is likely to be a prodromal sign of HIV infection in otherwise healthy homosexual men. The substantial levels of distress found among these men is more directly influenced by psychological determinants than biologic ones. This suggests that physicians should be aware of the psychological toll imposed on gay men who develop health problems in the current atmosphere of uncertainty regarding risk of AIDS.",Social science & medicine (1982),1988,England,1988,80

3237851,"Physiological, environmental, and subjective determinants of food intake in humans: a meal pattern analysis.","The spontaneous food intake of 31 adult humans was investigated with diary self-reports of ingestive behaviors and subjective hunger over 7 consecutive days. Meals were identified, using five different definitions, and their composition of total calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein was estimated from a computer file of the nutritive value of foods. These data were analyzed by intercorrelating meal sizes with intermeal intervals, estimated stomach contents and self-reported hunger with univariate and multiple correlation techniques. Human feeding was found to be regulated on the basis of preprandial factors; the premeal interval, estimated premeal stomach content, and self-reported hunger significantly correlating with the meal size. These correlations were significant regardless of whether the meal was evaluated as spontaneous or constrained by external factors, but were stronger when the meals occurred without other people being present. The postprandial relationship between the meal size and the duration of the postmeal interval, which is present in nonhuman species, was only present in humans when meals that were eaten alone were considered separately. This suggests that the species differences may be due to the social context of observation. The intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein was found to have a suppressive effect on subsequent intake and subjective hunger through their contributions to total food energy ingested. Protein, however, was found to suppress subsequent intake and subjective hunger independent of its contribution to total calories, suggesting that the macronutrients have differing satiating properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Physiology & behavior,1988,United States,1988,80

Motor activity was monitored from postnatal Days 13 to 21 as photocell interruptions in figure-eight mazes and comparisons were made between pups maintained in a nest box containing a dam and siblings and allowed access to the maze for 23 hr/day, pups tested daily for 1 hr/day vs pups tested only on postnatal Days 15, 18, or 21, pups tested daily for either 5 min, 30 min, or 1 hr/day, and pups tested daily for 30 min/day either singly in a maze, paired with a littermate, or paired with an anesthetized pup of the same age. A monotonic increase in activity was seen for nest-box testing, minimal developmental change was seen for pups tested on only a single day or for pups tested with an anesthetized pup, whereas all other groups showed an inverted U-shaped profile of activity which was influenced by the duration of testing and/or the presence of a littermate.

A sample of 1,428 residents in 42 such settings provided information about their activities, functioning, and background. Measures of facility features were also available. These data show that individuals are more likely to participate in facility-organized activities in settings where overall resident participation is greater, the average functioning of residents is lower, staffing is higher, and the program more structured. Participation in facility activities is not related to personal characteristics. In contrast, involvement in resident-initiated activities, both in the facility and in the community, is related to personal characteristics (being functionally intact, female, and better educated) and to facility features (larger size, lower staffing, greater autonomy and cohesiveness). The impact of some features varies depending on the functional capacity of the individual resident.",Journal of gerontology,1989 Jul,United States,1989,80

The variables examined in relation to 'preference for institutional care' were those previously examined in relation to supporters' psychological well-being (Gilhooly, 1984). The results indicate that factors within the relationship between supporter and the dependent dementing relative are important determinants of motivation to continue giving support. Other variables significantly associated with advocacy of institutional care included the age of the supporter, supporter's contacts with friends, satisfaction with help from relatives, another dependent relative, and whether or not the supporter was employed. Help from the services and supporters' well-being were not significantly correlated with ratings of preference for institutional care.",The British journal of medical psychology,1986 Jun,England,1986,80

PCB values were within the range of those found in the literature. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the association of the mean PCB concentration over the first half year of lactation with maternal parameters, such as age, height, weight, previous lactation period, education, occupation, residence, smoking, drinking and dietary habits as well as the infant parameters gestational age, birthweight and weight gain in the first six months of life. Since the PCB concentration on fat basis and the fat content of the milk were strongly inversely related, statistical analyses were carried out both on fat and on milk basis. In univariate analyses the PCB concentration on fat basis was most strongly associated with pre- versus post-pregnancy weight gain, age and occupation. After multiple regression analysis PCB concentration on fat basis remained significantly associated with weight gain changes and remained borderline (p less than 0.10) significantly related with occupation. The pre-pregnancy Quetelet Index of the mother (height/weight) and the estimated PCB content of the diet (primarily fish) were strongly correlated with the PCB concentration on milk basis. Only the Quetelet Index remained significantly related after multiple regression analysis.",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,1988 Jan,Sweden,1988,80
12338071,Socio-economic determinants of mortality in industrialized countries.,"In the early 1950s, it was generally considered that social mortality differentials appeared during the 1st stages of industrialization and would be resolved with the socialization of health services. Admittedly, at that time, the spectacular progress achieved through antibiotics encouraged the belief that health was merely a matter of medicine and that the institution of a social security scheme would suffice for minimizing the risks of death that were not directly involved in the natural differences between individuals. 30 years have passed and the expectation of life has lengthened (although less than anticipated), but the social differences remain. They are, in fact, by no means attributable to lack of medical science. The elimination of the most discriminating causes of death (alcoholism, accidents, suicide, tuberculosis, etc.) is less dependent on further scientific progress than on a complete change in living conditions and behavior. The reduction in the excess mortality of the poorer classes from other causes (cancer, cardiovascular diseases, etc.) again calls more for a thorough cultural transformation of the least privileged social categories than for the discovery of new therapies or increased expenditure on hospitals. Faced with a mortality that is already very unequal (selection, differential risks), the various social categories behave in basically different ways, which, while aggravating the real inequities, lead to an apparent morbidity that is inversely proportional to true morbidity and to a more prompt and frequent use of medical care among the social categories in which true morbidity is lowest. Inequality with respect to death is only 1 dimension of social inequality. It was an illusion to imagine that 1 could be eliminated without the other. Today that illusion has been destroyed. That does not mean that the present situation must be accepted. Inequality with respect of death is still 1 of the most disgraceful consequences of social inequality and its abolition must still be our aim. Obviously, however, this aim cannot be achieved through the health services alone.",Population bulletin of the United Nations,1980,United States,1980,80

While the recommendations of the International Conference on Population called attention to the importance of changes in population structure, this paper recommends urgent government action in planning social programs for the aged because of the greater eminence of population aging in many settings. The case of Japan is used to illustrate the growing importance of increases in life expectancy as a determinant of age structure changes (in relation to fertility decline), a point that is reinforced through a cruder decomposition of UN estimates and projections for several European countries.",Population bulletin of the United Nations,1989,United States,1989,80
6684973,Identifying determinants of risk of sexual victimization of youth: a multivariate approach.,"The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts.",Child abuse & neglect,1983,England,1983,80
2746717,Psychological and environmental determinants of relapse in crack cocaine smokers.,"The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations.",Journal of substance abuse treatment,1989,United States,1989,80
6856718,Eye contact: the core of interpersonal relatedness.,"This essay will attempt to show, citing evidence from diverse sources, that eye contact plays a central role in interpersonal relations. The eyes preface most new relationships, overshadowing other sensory inputs while transmitting a wide assortment of emotional cues. Visual behavior may at times prove decisive in assuring survival, in amorous encounters, and in clarifying interpersonal motives. Ocular performance, a final common pathway for many social, cultural and emotional determinants, is a crucial factor in defining relationships and in allowing reciprocal influences to be exchanged as persons relate. In psychiatric patients, ocular behavior may provide clues to diagnosis. A common finding in such persons is gaze aversion, a social avoidance phenomenon which indicates a desire to attenuate the interpersonal experience and thereby decrease anxiety.",Psychiatry,1983 May,United States,1983,80
3168891,[Liberal medicine and the labor market in health care. What is liberal medicine?].,"This article analyses the practice of what is termed ""liberal medicine""--which has paralleled developments in how society is organized--and examines its historical and social determinants. The evolution of the term ""liberal"" over the centuries, to its present meaning of ""practicing the profession as a self-employed physician,"" is discussed. The author continues the analysis by describing the liberal practice of medicine in the context of the terms of trade in the market for health services and professionals, which lead them to become small-businessmen in their profession. Liberal medicine develops when the unrestricted supply and demand for goods and services reaches the point where production and consumption are determined by systematic trade in a free market, without the restrictions and ties of an outdated social order. But legitimacy and controls related to the rules and regulations of the State, and of professional organizations do exist. This field of study will be examined further in future publications by the author, and by others interested in the problems of the labor force in the health sector.",Educacion medica y salud,1988,United States,1988,80

Surviving family members were interviewed by trained social workers, and information was collected on symptoms of the disease that led to death. The completed questionnaires were reviewed by a panel of local physicians and a cause of death was assigned by the panel. Maternal mortality was a leading cause of death, second only to heart disease. There were 190 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths and 45 maternal deaths per 100,000 married women aged between 15 and 49 years. Most of the maternal deaths (63%) were due to direct obstetric causes of which haemorrhage was the main cause. Another 27% of the maternal deaths were due to indirect obstetric causes of which rheumatic heart disease was the main cause.",British journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,1989 Jan,England,1989,80

This paper seeks to examine factors that may influence these perceptions. Beliefs about the seriousness of eleven childhood illnesses are compared in four groups of parents. Significant differences were evident between the groups of parents depending upon their experiences with illness. For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes. These results are interpreted within an information processing model. Implications of the findings for social psychological models of health care behaviour are discussed.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1986,England,1986,80

Higher incidence of low birth weight for black infants cannot be explained away as a result of black/white differences in age or education of mothers, prenatal care, parity or length of birth intervals.

The prevalence of malnutrition (low weight for age, length for age, and weight for length) was smallest in those children breast-fed for 3 to 6 months, but after this age nutritional status appeared to be worse in those breast-fed for longer. Children still being breast-fed at the time of the survey presented with a significantly higher prevalence of low weight for length than those who had been totally weaned, and those receiving breast-plus bottle-feeding presented with intermediate levels. This association could not be explained by a number of possible confounding variables using a multiple logistic regression analysis.

7355038,Psychosocial adjustment of latency-aged diabetics: determinants and relationship to control.,"The relationship of psychosocial adjustment, family functioning, self-esteem, and diabetic control was studied in 20 latency-aged diabetic children and their parents. Moderate to severe adjustment problems were found in 11 (55%) of the patients. Child self-esteem, parental self-esteem, and family functioning, as scored by standard instruments, were all significantly greater in the group of children considered to be well-adjusted as compared to the maladjusted group (P less than .05 to .001). Of these, parental self-esteem appeared to correlate most closely with the child's adjustment. Twenty-four-hour urinary glucose excretion was two- to threefold greater in maladjusted as compared to well-adjusted patients (71 +/- 20 vs 20 +/- 5 gm, P less than .05). These data suggest that psychosocial adjustment problems frequently occur in latency-aged children with diabetes, are associated with poorer chemical control, and require a family-centered approach to intervention and management.",Pediatrics,1980 Jan,United States,1980,80

However, no association was found with employment rate or certain other determinants of independent living, such as going on a holiday.

2707518,The Swedish childhood diabetes study--social and perinatal determinants for diabetes in childhood.,"Using the Swedish childhood diabetes register, a nationwide, case-referent study was performed from September 1, 1985 to August 31, 1986. Based on the information from a mailed questionnaire sent to all incident diabetic children and for each diabetic child - two referent children matched according to age, sex, and county, we have analysed perinatal events and aspects of the social environment as possible risk factors for Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes in childhood. A significantly larger proportion of the mothers of the diabetic children were older than 40 years compared to those of the referent children (33% and 24%, p = 0.01 respectively). A smaller percentage of mothers of the diabetic children had a high educational level compared to mothers of referent children (10% and 15%, p = 0.03 respectively) and 39% of the fathers of the diabetic children were manual workers compared to 31% of the fathers of referent children (p = 0.03). Perinatal events did not differ between diabetic and referent children. In children 0-6 years, the duration of breast-feeding was significantly shorter in diabetic children than among referent children (median duration for diabetic children 5 months compared to 6 months for referent children p = 0.03). When considering the presence of Type 1 diabetes among relatives, maternal age over 40 years, low educational level of the mother, and the father being a manual worker as risk factors, the presence of 1 to 4 of any of these risk factors increased the relative risk for Type 1 diabetes cumulatively from 1.2-7.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Diabetologia,1989 Jan,Germany,1989,80
3227366,Self-assessment of health before and after a myocardial infarction.,"Self-evaluated health represents an important aspect of quality of life that may influence the rehabilitation process after a major illness. However, health is a multi-dimensional concept and relatively little is known about the determinants of, and the interrelationships between the separate aspects of health. In a prospective longitudinal study of myocaridal infarction (MI) patients, two indices of self-evaluated health, maximal physical ability (MPA) and perceived global health (PGH), were used. On the average, both ratings were clearly reduced compared with pre-MI levels even as long as 3-5 yr after the MI. Females and older patients indicated lower MPA before and after the MI, whereas PGH was not related to any sociodemographic variable. The severity of the MI appeared to be of relatively limited importance for self-evaluated health. Heart-related symptoms before and after the MI were more strongly related to lower MPA, whereas non-cardiac health problems and psychological distress more clearly influenced PGH. However, initial illness perceptions were of some importance for both health perceptions. The data suggest that to some extent self-evaluated health can be influenced by educational or psychological support in order to faccilitate readaption and recovery after a MI.",Social science & medicine (1982),1988,England,1988,80

Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described.

When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas.

6984992,An approach to the detection of malnutrition in rural children using socio-economic indices and level of education of mother as proxy.,"The hypothesis that social indices and educational level of mother are potential sources of childhood malnutrition was tested in Kampumbu, Zambia. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, protein and albumin levels in children were studied in relation to malnutrition. Six hundred and fifty rural children (306 males and 344 females) aged one and fourteen years exposed to various types of diet and environmental factors were selected randomly. Data on economic status, diet environment and educational attainment as well as other demographic information were collected. The major epidemiological findings were that the difference in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by income) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis was significant (X2 = 4.1, P less than 0.025), and the relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level. Similarly, there was a very significant difference (X2 = 7.4, P less than 0.005) in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by house grades) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis. The estimated relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level.

3392764,Determinants of growth in the first 6 months of life among the urban poor in Sudan.,"This paper presents part of a longitudinal study carried out in the three towns of Khartoum Province in the period December 1983 to April 1985. It was attempting to determine the duration of satisfactory breast-feeding in healthy breast-fed infants of mothers attending maternal and child health centres in the three towns; Khartoum, Khartoum-North and Omdurman. The main objective of the present paper is to compare samples from the three towns in terms of the factors affecting weight gain. Four hundred and thirty-nine infants were recruited at birth and home visited every 2 weeks. At each visit weight was measured and it was recorded whether any supplements had been given and whether the child had been ill. Length was measured every 4 weeks. There were significant differences between the samples from the three towns in attained weights and weight increments. Weight gains were lowest in the Khartoum North sample in the first 3 months, but from 3 to 6 months were highest, almost equalling the NCHS reference. In the Khartoum and Omdurman samples growth from 0 to 3 months exceeded the reference but from 3 to 6 months was less than the reference. Fifty per cent of infants were supplemented by 13 weeks in the Omdurman sample; the median time of supplementation in the other two samples was 17 weeks. Only in Khartoum did delaying supplementation seem to benefit growth. Infections were most common among the Omdurman sample.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",The Journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,1988 Jun,England,1988,80

2692802,Health promotion in perspective.,"Our emphasis in the past has been on disease prevention rather than health promotion. This emphasis served us reasonably well when morbidity was high throughout society and when interventions at the community level were able to achieve massive reductions. It is not faring as well now that the major shared environmental determinants of disease have been controlled. The present situation calls for changes in individual health-related behaviour and individual clinical interventions to achieve comparable progress. As difficult to win as collective commitments to community-level interventions have been, compliance in a free society by often unmotivated persons in numerous individual instances of decision making in daily life is even more difficult. Health promotion offers the promise of a quantum leap in improving the health status of the community by participating in behaviour perceived as not only responsible but appropriate and desirable, providing positive reinforcement rather than anxiety-provoking caution. Favourable social trends, such as physical conditioning and dietary changes may be encouraged through media interventions. There are biological limitations to this approach, however. Many healthful practices confer little benefit on large groups of people and a few may be harmful to selected groups. Vigorous promotion of weight reduction and obesity control, for example, may lead to profound dissatisfaction with body image and to severely self-destructive behaviour among those prone to eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, and obsessive eating. Health promotion activities may fit well with social trends but their adverse potential can be aggravated because failure to comply can be penalized by peer disapproval in a way that disease prevention strategies usually are not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1989 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1989,80

2801628,Ethical dilemmas in community intervention.,"Ethics code books provide only general guidelines and are inadequate in resolving explicit ethical dilemmas that frequently occur in community intervention. Ethical choices often reflect personal values as well as professional role proscriptions and are difficult to resolve for a number of reasons. It often is not clear to whom the interventionist should be accountable, or what the long-range impact may be of specific programs that seem to have short-term benefit. Value clashes can occur between consultants and consultees, even when both groups believe that they represent the best interests of vulnerable client groups. Since personal values are important determinants of ethical choices, whenever possible, they should be communicated openly so community groups can understand the interventionist's values before community projects begin. It also is important to share ethical dilemmas with professional colleagues in order to provide community psychologists with constructive feedback from their professional peers, and to help others anticipate similar value conflicts in their own work. These points are illustrated by discussion of the vignettes presented by O'Neill (1989) and by additional examples drawn from my own experience.",American journal of community psychology,1989 Jun,England,1989,80

It discusses a variety of factors that are usually overlooked-including the appearance of costs and benefits over time, the role of cues to action, the problem of competing life demands, and the ways that actual decision behavior differs from the rational ideal implicit in expectancy-value and utility theories. Such considerations suggest that the adoption of new precautions should be viewed as a dynamic process with many determinants. The framework of a model that is able to accommodate these additional factors is described. This alternative model portrays the precaution adoption process as an orderly sequence of qualitatively different cognitive stages. Data illustrating a few of the suggestions made in the article are presented, and implications for prevention programs are discussed.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1988,United States,1988,80

First, fights and the formation of dominance-subordinancy relations were studied. Second, it was determined that large body size as well as males' prior residency in a tank produced an agonistic advantage; the magnitude of this advantage was positively related to the duration of residency. Third, the prior-residency effect in Bettas was determined by males' familiarity with visual and/or tactile cues in their home tanks. Fourth, dominant males had greater access to living space and were more likely to display at a mirror, build nests, and approach females than were subordinates. Finally, it was discovered that chemical cues associated with presumedly inert plastic tank dividers influence Bettas' social behavior.","Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983)",1984 Dec,United States,1984,80

Urinary sodium excretion was determined, and was used as an estimate of sodium (salt) intake. Other measures taken were, most preferred concentration of salt in soup, blood pressure, body weight and height, along with questionnaires on general food preferences, attitudes to adding table salt to foods, and the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). Table salt (7 per cent) and cooking salt (8 per cent) were found to account for only a small proportion of total sodium intake, the major part (89 per cent) being from non-discretionary salt present in foods. Subjects, divided on the basis of table salt use and total intake, were found to differ in the most preferred concentration of salt in soup, but not in their sensitivity to variations from their ideal. Table salt use was predicted very well by the individual's attitude, and to a lesser extent by perceived social pressure. The only other variable related to higher table salt use was a lower preference for fruit on the general food preferences questionnaire. The lower preference for fruit was also related to higher total salt intake, which was also predicted by a lower neuroticism score on the EPI. While extraversion was positively related to non-discretionary salt intake, this relationship was not significant for total salt intake.",Human nutrition. Applied nutrition,1986 Jun,England,1986,80

Offspring of lead treated parents were reared on 0.1% PbAc until weaning, and also given 0.5% PbAc to drink for 3 weeks prior to testing (Pb2 group). Offspring of untreated parents were either given 0.5% PbAc to drink (Pb1 group) or maintained on tap water throughout (Control group).

Equal per capita expenditures, however, are not a reasonable goal; these can mask wide variations in program content, efficiency, and quality of care.",The American journal of psychiatry,1981 Jul,United States,1981,80
3678537,The influence of the family on premarital sexual attitudes and behavior.,"This research has expanded our understanding of the determinants of adolescent sexuality in several directions. We have used a study of mothers and children to construct and estimate a model of the intergenerational transmission of sexual attitudes and behavior. With data collected from both mothers and children, we were able to proceed further than most past research and to consider both the attitudes and behaviors of mothers as reported by the mothers themselves. These data permitted an investigation of the determinants of maternal attitudes concerning adolescent sexuality as well as an examination of the influences of the attitudes and experiences of mothers on the attitudes, perceptions, and behavior of children. Obviously, limiting the study to white families prevents generalization of our findings to other subgroups of the population. The findings demonstrate the importance and relevance of parental and adolescent attitudes in understanding adolescent sexuality. Premarital sexuality is a salient issue to both young people and their parents. There are, however, very important and substantial differences in the attitudes of parents and children. On average, the attitudes of young people today are much less restrictive than those of their parents, reflecting either life cycle differences or the impact of social change. The intergenerational difference is recognized by young people themselves and probably affects the ability of parents to assist their maturing children in adjusting to and dealing with their sexuality--a difficulty likely to be reflected in the relative lack of success sexually active young people have in preventing pregnancy. Our findings also add to the research literature in demonstrating that although children, on average, have more permissive attitudes than their parents, the attitudes of individual parents tend to be reflected in the attitudes of individual children. Children whose mothers have less restrictive attitudes have, on average, less restrictive attitudes themselves. Further, the attitudes of mothers are also reflected in the behavior of their children, so on average, mothers with more permissive attitudes have children who are more sexually active. The influence of maternal attitudes, however, is stronger for children's attitudes than for their behavior. Of course, variability in children's attitudes and behavior--and even their perceptions of maternal attitudes--can only be partially explained by the attitudes of their mothers; but presumably, if the attitudes of other important family members, including fathers and siblings, were known, the prediction of adolescent attitudes would improve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Demography,1987 Aug,United States,1987,80

3867226,Atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents. XII. Smoking behaviour and its determinants in 12-18-year-old subjects.,"The cross-sectional study of 1980 for atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents aimed at a wide coverage of the relevant relationships of the smoking behaviour to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. The initiation and establishment of the smoking habits were primarily viewed as a function of the youngsters' main socializing agents: the peer group and the family. A subpopulation comprising 1,790 children and adolescents aged 12, 15 and 18 years of the total sample was included in the study on smoking behaviour. The information on smoking habits was collected in connection with the medical examination in a solitary room where the youngsters could respond undisturbed. Data on the children's families were obtained by means of a general questionnaire filled out by the parents. The prevalence of daily smoking was 1% in the 12-year-old, 10% in the 15-year-old, and 30% in the 18-year-old subjects. The best friend's behaviour was the best predictor of an adolescent's smoking behaviour, although the family had retained its role as an important model as regards the learning of smoking behaviour. Quitting school turned out to be a major event leading to an increased risk of becoming a habitual smoker. No clear associations between socioeconomic status of the family and daily smoking were found, except that farmers' children had generally lower rates of daily smoking than children from other socioeconomic groups. First contacts with tobacco formed part of a normal behaviour pattern at a certain age, and this experimentation was unrelated to a later regular habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica.

Results clearly indicated that naysaying and acquiescence occur more frequently among lower IQ individuals and naysaying occurs more frequently concerning prohibited behavior, whereas respondents acquiesce regarding desirable behavior. These results suggest that intellectual limitations predispose people to biased responding, whereas social desirability factors determine the type of bias.",American journal of mental deficiency,1982 Jul,United States,1982,80

2916712,Determinants of recovery 12 months after hip fracture: the importance of psychosocial factors.,"The independent contributions to recovery from hip fracture of psychosocial factors including depression, personality, social connectedness, and self-rated health were studied in 219 women age 59 and older (mean age 78.5) who were community dwelling prior to fracture. Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery.",American journal of public health,1989 Mar,United States,1989,80
2711410,Comparative studies on the protein composition of hymenopteran venom reservoirs.,"The proteins of venom reservoirs from 25 hymenopteran species from 21 genera were investigated with regard to their protein composition and immunological similarities. It was found that low mol. wt proteins and polypeptides are typical for the venoms of ants, social wasps and bees. Six species of ichneumonoid parasitic wasps lack these low mol. wt proteins. Except for bee venoms none of the low mol. wt proteins contain mannose. The venoms of ichneumonoid parasites and ants contained primarily acidic proteins, whereas those of social wasps and bees contained abundant neutral and basic proteins. Immunological analysis showed that a number of venom proteins from parasitic braconid (Chelonus) wasps shared conserved immunoreactive determinants with the venom proteins of higher Hymenoptera, including some not of parasitic habit. Implications of phylogenetic relationships among hymenopteran species are discussed.",Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,1989,England,1989,80
3883893,"Social factors in psychopathology: stress, social support, and coping processes.","Our review has focused centrally on the etiologic significance of social factors in the development of psychopathology. Our implicit assumption has been that social factors in general, and stressors in particular, may play a causal role in the development of psychopathology. Yet the evidence is clear that the vast majority of people who are exposed to stressful life events or to chronic stress situations do not develop significant psychiatric impairments. For this reason, research interest over the past decade has shifted to factors like social support and coping strategies that may ameliorate the impact of stress. We have examined some of the important empirical results from recent studies of stress, support, and coping, and we have discussed ways in which these new understandings have informed long-standing attempts to explain group differences in emotional functioning. In each section of the review we have attempted not only to summarize existing results but also to provide some evaluation of the literature and suggestions for future research. It is important to recognize that the contributors to the work reviewed here do not all share a common research agenda. Some of them are primarily committed to unraveling the psychosocial determinants of a particular clinical disorder. Others are mainly concerned with the effects of a particular stressor. Still others are interested in the processes that link stress to health across a broad array of stress situations and health outcomes. In the face of these diverse interests, it is little wonder that our understanding of social factors in psychopathology is uneven. There is good reason to believe, however that these diverse strands of research are beginning to converge on a common conception of the stress process and on a common research design. The conception at present is only in rough form, but its outlines are nonetheless capable of description. At its center is the notion that stress exposure sets off a process of adaptation. It recognizes that this process unfolds over time, and it acknowledges that this process is modified by structural factors as well as by personal dispositions and vulnerabilities. There is growing recognition that the analysis of this process requires longitudinal methods. Also, it is becoming increasingly clear that experimental interventions are required to unravel the parts of this process that link stress and health. It is too early to know if this nascent convergence will lead to an integrative theory of adaptation, yet it is almost certain to promote methodological and conceptual rigor and facilitate replication and cumulation of findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Annual review of psychology,1985,United States,1985,80

2529668,[A historico-social approach to the medical scientific theory of Ludwik Fleck (1896-1961)].,"Ludwik Fleck has shown in his discussion of the logical empirism of the Vienna Circle that his concept of reality presupposes an unproven logico-structural correspondence between the world and the formal logical structure of language, i.e. between reality and thought. Upon this questionable foundation he proceeds to develop his own position concerning the theory of medical science. He claims that scientific knowledge is at no time exempt from cultural, historical and social conditions, of which scientific knowledge itself is a function. These conditions find expression in the style of thought of a particular epoch (""Denkstil"") as well as in the interaction of the participating scientists (""Denkkollektiv""). Flecks merits for having explicated the conditionality of the process of scientific knowledge over against positivistic thought have been honourably elaborated in many studies. The present study offers an analysis of the manner in which the Fleck position attempts to serve as an explanation of change in the content and style of thought in history. It will be made clear that these changes and developments can only be explained as the result of the interaction and competition among the collectives of scientists and thinkers. Fleck deprives his socio-historical position of its logical foundation by radicalizing these conditions in such a manner that they become fundamental determinants of human thought generally and for the individual scientist particularly. As a consequence, from the perspective in which the thought of the individual is thus determined, he can neither establish a convincing theory for changes in thought in history nor for the human relations obtaining within the collective of scientists and thinkers.",Sudhoffs Archiv,1989,Germany,1989,80

7090573,Health education for social change: a strategy for public health in the US.,"Health education aimed mainly at changing individual behaviour and lifestyle faces growing challenges. Recent research suggests that broader economic, social and environmental forces are the determinants of many diseases and of behaviours that contribute to ill health. Furthermore, health education programmes seeking only to change behaviour have not been particularly effective in making significant improvements in morbidity or mortality. Finally, behavior change strategies locate the problem within the individual, leading to a tendency to blame the victim for the disease. This paper offers an alternative approach to health education, an approach which seeks to involve citizens in identifying and addressing social and environmental threats to health. From the practices of the women's health movement, the movement for occupational safety and health and the environmental movement in the United States in the last decade, an expanded foundation for health education is suggested. The following principles are illustrated: 1. Health education programmes must include informational, behavioural, political, legal and economic components; 2. Health education for social change recognizes the political character of health and disease; 3. Health education efforts can be rooted in popular struggles for a more just and humane society. 4. Health education activities should address people's day-to-day concerns about their lives and their health. The paper concludes with some specific recommendations on how health educators can include action for social change in their practice.",International journal of health education,1982,Switzerland,1982,80
3686078,Patient-doctor communication on smoking and drinking: lifestyle in medical consultations.,"Lifestyles of groups and individuals are significant determinants of the health status of a population. Behaviour with respect to such areas as alcohol, food, drugs, tobacco, physical exercise, etc., correlates with medical and social well-being and are thus on the agenda for modern health care. The present article reports a study of how such lifestyle habits, notably alcohol and tobacco consumption, are addressed in medical consultations. The results indicate that the areas of smoking and drinking are sensitive and that specific communicative strategies are used for introducing these topics and for eliciting information. Smoking habits are addressed in 75% of the consultations and alcohol habits in 30%. In most cases, the information exchanged is shallow and gives only a fragmentary picture of patients' habits. There is little evidence of attempts to influence patients' attitudes and behaviours and the physicians do not contextualise possible relationships between such lifestyle habits and health in the light of their medical knowledge. In this sense, a potentially very influential face-to-face encounter is not used as a vehicle for attempting to eliminate such significant causes of poor health.",Social science & medicine (1982),1987,England,1987,80
2802928,Genetic and perinatal determinants of structural brain deficits in schizophrenia.,"Using a subsample from the Copenhagen schizophrenia high-risk project, we examined the contributions of schizophrenic genetic liability and perinatal complications to computed tomographic (CT) measurements of ventricular enlargement and cortical and cerebellar abnormalities. A factor analysis of six CT measurements yielded two significant factors. One factor reflected multisite neural deficits as evidenced by abnormality of the cerebellar vermis and widening of the sylvian and interhemispheric fissures and cortical sulci. The other factor reflected periventricular damage as evidenced by enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles. Because all of the subjects had schizophrenic mothers, the major source of genetic variation is contributed by the diagnostic status of their fathers. In a stepwise multiple-regression analysis, it was determined that the multisite neural deficits factor was significantly related to genetic risk for schizophrenia (as measured by schizophrenia spectrum illness in the subjects' fathers) but was unrelated to pregnancy or delivery complications or to weight at birth. Periventricular damage was highly and significantly correlated with the number of complications suffered at delivery, but only among subjects with an elevated genetic risk. Although limited by a small sample size, these results suggest that the two types of CT abnormalities in schizophrenia may reflect partially independent processes based on different combinations of genetic and perinatal influences.",Archives of general psychiatry,1989 Oct,United States,1989,80
3701583,Counselor and client personality as determinants of counselor expectancy effects.,"Seventy-eight students enrolled in summer-session college courses were randomly assigned to serve either as counselors or as clients for a 20-min, role-played peer counseling session. All of the subjects completed a battery of standardized personality measures. Each counselor interacted with two clients. Prior to the sessions, the counselor was led to believe that one of the clients was especially introverted and that the other client was especially extraverted. Dependent measures were based on clients' change scores on a mood adjective rating scale administered before and after the peer counseling sessions. Analyses showed that counselors who were more successful at biasing their clients in the direction of their expectancies (a) scored higher on measures of Dogmatism, Nurturance, and Social Recognition, (b) scored lower on Impulsivity, and (c) were more likely to be women. Clients who were more susceptible to counselor bias scored higher on the Self-Monitoring Scale, the Self-Monitoring Other-Directedness subscale, and Social Recognition.

6365517,[Medicine and society. Schools of thought in the health field].,"The article considers the answers given by different schools of thought to the fundamental questions about the degree of autonomy of medicine and the kind of articulation between medicine and society as a whole and in its ""parts."" The answers vary with the thinking in the different social sciences and the philosophic schools associated with them. The author divides his presentation in two broad chapters: The first covers schools of thought in the health field, and attempts to delineate the philosophical foundations underlying the principal current schools of thought in this field, without attempting a history of the philosophical schools or analyzing each of them in detail. Thus, two idealist currents are studied which have exerted great influence in the health field--neopositivism and neo-Kantianism--and marxism as the materialist school, which recognizes the primary of matter, nature, and objective reality, and views consciousness as a property of matter. The second chapter considers the theoretical contest now going on among the schools of thought discussed in the first chapter, which try to explain the relationship between medicine and the social structure; the effectiveness of medical action, and the social determinants of disease. Prior to the seventies, the author says, the dominant view of the autonomy of medicine, its effectiveness, the potential for social change of the medical institutions, and the benefits to health of economic development, was endorsed by the predominance of positivism among these schools of medical thought. The view that medicine was broadly autonomous and at the same level with other subsystems such as the economic, the political and the educational subsystems, assumed the possibility of changing society by an effort begun through any of these ""sectors."" The enormous growth of productive forces that took place in the developed capitalist countries during the fifties, and even more during the sixties, collided at the end of the latter decade with the existing social production relations, which checked the progress of the production forces and generated a series of challenges in civil society to the aims of economic development and the achievements of science in relation to the inequality of the distribution of wealth. In the health sector, this was a time of criticism of the positivist view and of pointing out the negative effects of medicalization, highlighting the ideological and self-perpetuating character of medical institutions, and proposals for the demedicalization of society.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Educacion medica y salud,1983,United States,1983,80

Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1986 Feb,United States,1986,80

10287174,Health policy and mental health.,"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Health promotion (Oxford, England)",1987,England,1987,80
7143281,Adjustment to life after stroke with special reference to sexual intercourse and leisure.,"Changes in frequency of sexual intercourse and of leisure activities were related to degree of physical impairment and levels of dependence in primary and secondary ADL in 110 subjects with one stroke. About 75% of the subjects reduced their frequency or ceased having intercourse and active leisure. While changes in frequency of intercourse were temporally independent, changes in leisure activities were less pronounced for subjects examined later than 12 months after the stroke than for those investigated earlier. For intercourse, primarily ADL-dependence and impaired cutaneous sensibility were major negative determinants. Moreover, subjects with previously known arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus had changed relatively less than those without these ailments, probably due to pre-stroke reductions. It is suggested that the marked changes in sexual and leisure activities are accomplished by unsuccessful coping with the vascular catastrophe and its sequelae.

7031748,The development of sexuality and eroticism in humankind.,"Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expression. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppression of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotosexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiencies, or hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes.",The Quarterly review of biology,1981 Dec,United States,1981,80

Summary.,"Correlates of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were studied in 4756 white males and females ages 20-59 years examined during a population survey conducted by 10 North American Lipid Research Clinics. Multivariable analysis was used to assess the relation of social, demographic, physical and behavioral characteristics for HDL cholesterol in each of the study populations and in subgroups defined by sex, age and gonadal hormone use. Characteristics associated with higher HDL cholesterol concentrations were a lean body habitus, not smoking, consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol, physical activity or exercise, membership in a high educational stratum, increased age and low dietary consumption of sucrose and starch. Each of these characteristics was examined in detail in its relation to HDL cholesterol concentrations in the respective chapters in this monograph; the purpose of the study reported here was to summarize the findings. When all variables were considered simultaneously in the analysis, body mass, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were the attributes most strongly and consistently associated with HDL cholesterol concentrations in the populations examined. These empirical findings from a cross-sectional study replicated across diverse populations were used to derive speculative estimates of the potential for modification of population levels of HDL cholesterol, consistent with hygienic intervention and lifestyle changes. The results of the study were considered in the context of the literature on determinants of HDL cholesterol.",Circulation,1980 Nov,United States,1980,80

In the group having ""good"" practical knowledge, the blood glucose tests were done 6 times per week, in connection with the number of hypoglycemia at home (p less than 0.01), the number of daily insulin injections (p less than 0.01) and the number of insulin supplements (p less than 0.05); there was a partial substitution between blood and urine tests. In the group having ""less good"" practical knowledge, the number of blood tests was 4 per week; it was not statistically different, but it was performed in the absence of detectable reasons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Archives francaises de pediatrie,1987 May,France,1987,80
12265102,Intermetropolitan migration and quality of life.,"The aim of this paper is to assess the relative importance of economic and quality of life (QOL) factors as determinants of inter-metropolitan migration in the United States. The study is based on the generalized systemic gravity model of Alonso and on data from a sample of 25 SMSAs over the period 1965-1970. ""The most striking feature of the empirical results is the apparent lack of importance of origin economic and QOL factors as determinants of outmigration.... On the other hand, the empirical results suggest both economic and QOL factors to be significant determinants of inmigration.""",Journal of regional science,1982 May,United States,1982,80
3992291,Socialization and interpersonal environment in nurses' affective reactions to work.,"The dominant explanation of nurses' affective experience in work is the conflict between the beliefs and expectations developed during the formal training process (education) and the role definitions in the hospital work setting. Specifically, it is generally proposed that baccalaureate trained nurses experience this person-role conflict more than the associate or diploma trained nurse because baccalaureate training instills more beliefs/expectations that conflict with the hospital nursing role. However, research has not sufficiently compared the effect of 'socialization' variables like education with other variables found to affect the work experience. This study uses path analysis to explore the relative effects of education, length of experience and the measured interpersonal work environment across types of person-role conflicts, on overall job satisfaction and on propensity to leave. The results show that the interpersonal factors are the paramount determinants of the measured person-role conflicts and, as well, have a greater effect than education and experience on job satisfaction. Also, education and length of experience have greater direct than indirect effects on propensity to leave, indicating that their effects are not via causality of job-related stress. Implications for programs designed to improve the nurse's work experience and affects are discussed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1985,England,1985,80
6701728,Health care coverage of survivor families with children: determinants and consequences.,"This article, which is based on data from the Social Security Administration's 1978 Survey of Survivor Families With Children, examines the continuity of health care coverage held by families headed by widows from the time of the husband's death to the interview. The data are presented by duration of widowhood and kind of coverage the family had before the husband died. Over this period, it was found that new kinds of coverage, such as the widow's job-related health insurance or directly purchased protection, often replaced the former coverage. At the time of the interview, about three-fourths of the families had coverage, including government assistance such as Medicaid. Whether or not the young survivor families had coverage was affected by the widow's current employment status and by family income. Premiums varied by type of policy: those with individual policies paid more (and received less extensive coverage) than did those with group policies. Compared with the general population, the widows and their children were in poorer health, generally used physician services less, and had somewhat higher expenditures for health care.",Social security bulletin,1984 Feb,United States,1984,80
7155014,Nocturnalism: an ethological theory of schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a human behavioral variant with a 1% phenotypic population frequency. As the major ""mental illness"" affecting human beings, it has defied all previous attempts to explain, predict or prevent its devastating clinical manifestations. In addition to unidentified nongenetic determinants, schizophrenia has genetic determinants in the absence of known specific neuropathological or biochemical correlates found in other entities conceptualized as genetic diseases. The fitness of schizophrenics is 0.7 of nonschizophrenics, and a 1% phenotypic population frequency is difficult to explain by mutation rate alone. An ethological theory of schizophrenia has been developed in which the genetic determinant is the nocturnal character of a postulated polymorphic trait termed when active. The nongenetic determinant is simply a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light. According to the author's theory, a schizophrenic individual could be processing information while awake and exposed to light with a brain that is processing information as though he were asleep. The empirical data from which the theory is constructed are presented. THe theory is capable of explaining clinical schizophrenia within an ethological paradigm and makes several predictions, the most significant of which is that the absence of a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light should ameliorate the major symptoms of clinical schizophrenia in individuals who possess its genetic determinant.",Medical hypotheses,1982 Nov,United States,1982,80
2508814,Early influences on blood pressure: a study of children aged 5-7 years.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine factors that influence blood pressure in children. DESIGN: Cross sectional study of children aged 5.0-7.0 years who had blood pressure measurements and for whom parental questionnaires were completed. SETTING: School based survey. SUBJECTS: 3591 Children aged 5.0-7.5 years selected by stratified random sampling of primary schools in nine British towns (response rate 72%); 3591 were examined and their parental questionnaires were completed. Data were complete for birth rank in 3559, maternal age in 3542, maternal history of hypertension in 3524, and paternal history in 2633. RESULTS: Birth weight was inversely related to mean systolic blood pressure but only when standardised for current weight (weight standardised regression coefficient -1.83 mm Hg/kg (95% confidence interval -1.31 to -2.35). Mean diastolic pressure was similarly related to birth weight. Maternal age, birth rank, and a parental history of hypertension were all related to blood pressure. After standardisation for current weight a 10 year increase in maternal age was associated with a 1.0 mm Hg (0.4 to 1.6) rise in systolic pressure; first born children had systolic blood pressure on average 2.53 mm Hg (0.81 to 4.25) higher than those whose birth rank was greater than or equal to 4; and a maternal history of hypertension was associated with a systolic pressure on average 0.96 mm Hg (0.41 to 1.51) higher than in those with no such history. The effects described were largely independent of one another and of age and social class. The relation for birth rank was, however, closely related to that for family size. CONCLUSIONS: Influences acting in early life may be important determinants of blood pressure in the first decade. The relation between birth weight and blood pressure may reflect the rate of weight gain in infancy. The reasons for the relation with birth rank and maternal age are unknown; if confirmed they imply that delayed motherhood and smaller family size may be associated with higher blood pressure in offspring.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1989 Sep 2,England,1989,80
4034814,Interpersonal behavior and therapeutic progress: therapists and clients rate themselves and each other.,"To measure the extent to which progress in psychotherapy can be predicted from the interpersonal styles of therapists and clients, 42 outpatients and their 11 therapists rated themselves and each other on Benjamin's Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) scales. In addition, therapists rated amount of client change and therapy success-failure, based on the outcome section of the Rogers and Dymond (1954) scale, and clients used the Strupp, Fox, and Lessler (1969) questionnaire to evaluate progress-to-date. Clients also completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) at the start of therapy and after they had completed at least 6 treatment sessions. Canonical analyses indicated that when optimally weighted, SASB scores can predict at least 65% of the reported progress variance, lending credence to claims that ""reflexive social behavior"" and ""the relationship"" are important determinants of certain aspects of therapeutic outcome. Consistent with previous literature, clients reported more satisfaction with therapy when they perceived their therapists as ""warm and freeing,"" but such perceptions were not systematically related to reported symptom reduction. Unfavorable self-concept ratings by therapists and therapist ratings of clients as ""helping or protecting,"" which suggest role reversal, were negatively associated with symptom amelioration.",Psychiatry,1985 Aug,United States,1985,80
3453175,Psychosocial determinants of breast self-examination.,"To explore the psychosocial determinants of breast self-examination (BSE) among women, we studied a stratified random sample of 264 women students, faculty, and staff in a university community. The dependent variable of the study was self-reported frequency of BSE, and predictors included measures of general health predispositions, variables of the Health Belief Model, the impact of a woman's social network, a set of secondary non-health-related barriers and benefits, and the woman's evaluation of her personal health care system. Analysis of the data showed strong relationships between most of the predictor variables and BSE. Regression analysis showed that variables measuring a woman's recent experience in the health care system were stronger predictors of BSE practice than intrapersonal ""health belief"" variables. However, the independent variables included in the regression accounted for almost 35 percent of the total variance in BSE practice.",American journal of preventive medicine,1986 May-Jun,Netherlands,1986,80
6393872,Research in mental retardation in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).,"Research in mental retardation in the GDR has been influenced primarily by the brain damage--development theory, which assumes biological as well as social determinants in human development. The theory was based on the results of brain damage (encephalopathy) research, which distinguishes between primary and secondary symptoms of mental retardation. The importance of social factors such as family conditions for development was demonstrated in a variety of studies, including research with adopted children. Positive results have been achieved with early education programming for developmentally disabled children, as well as with medical treatment for some genetically induced metabolic disorders. Results from longitudinal studies suggest that intelligence continues to develop in educable mentally retarded adolescents. New diagnostic methods have been developed; test of motor skills, visuomotor coordination, and a developmental test for young infants. Further developments of traditional school entrance diagnosis for special education classes is reported. Several studies show that there has been some success in the vocational and social integration of mentally retarded persons in the GDR.",Applied research in mental retardation,1984,United States,1984,80
6656327,The determinants of dropping out of care among hypertensive patients receiving a behavioral intervention.,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension.",Medical care,1983 Oct,United States,1983,80

6984992,An approach to the detection of malnutrition in rural children using socio-economic indices and level of education of mother as proxy.,"The hypothesis that social indices and educational level of mother are potential sources of childhood malnutrition was tested in Kampumbu, Zambia. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, protein and albumin levels in children were studied in relation to malnutrition. Six hundred and fifty rural children (306 males and 344 females) aged one and fourteen years exposed to various types of diet and environmental factors were selected randomly. Data on economic status, diet environment and educational attainment as well as other demographic information were collected. The major epidemiological findings were that the difference in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by income) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis was significant (X2 = 4.1, P less than 0.025), and the relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level. Similarly, there was a very significant difference (X2 = 7.4, P less than 0.005) in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by house grades) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis. The estimated relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level. Other variables, including age, history of hookworm, were not found to be determinants of risk for malnutrition.",Medical journal of Zambia,1982 Feb-Apr,Zambia,1982,80
3788206,A prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in preschool children belonging to a prepaid group practice: background and methods.,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,1986 Nov-Dec,United States,1986,80

Then a multivariate (proportional hazard) analysis showed that socioeconomic factors including residence, caste status and education influence the breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea periods. There was no effect of maternal age on the length of breast-feeding, but mean length of post-partum amenorrhoea varied with age.

Over 200 adults completed a questionnaire on their beliefs concerning, for instance, how much and how often children should be given pocket money, as well as such things as whether they should be encouraged to work for it, save it, etc. The independent variables included the subjects' age, sex, education, voting pattern, religion, occupation and whether or not they were parents. The results showed that whereas there were few age or sex differences, the socio-economic class of the adults, and the fact that they did or did not have children did discriminate between the responses of the subjects. Findings were discussed in terms of the literature of economic socialization.",Journal of adolescence,1984 Sep,England,1984,80
6706793,Ecological factors predicting adolescent contraceptive use: implications for intervention.,"Questionnaires addressing areas expected to relate to contraceptive use were completed by 230 female adolescents. Contraceptive use among the 130 sexually active subjects were predicted by a model composed of 12 scales assessing social permissiveness, costs and benefits of contraception, parent communication, boyfriend support, sex education and knowledge, attitudes about pregnancy and contraception, and access to contraception services. Scales from the predictive model which raise ideas for potential intervention strategies assessed parent communication, boyfriend support, and perceived costs and benefits related to contraception. Since there has been public concern that intervention programs for enhancing adolescent contraceptive use might also stimulate sexual activity, correlations were computed between the predictive scales and the measure of sexual experience among all 230 subjects. These data indicated that positive parent communication about sexuality and a perception of high benefits and low costs associated with contraceptive use were not positively correlated with sexual experience. Implications for the prevention of adolescent pregnancy are discussed with an emphasis on designing innovative sex education, improving parent-child communication, resolving conflicts in contraceptive decisionmaking, and supporting the role of boyfriends in contraceptive use.",Journal of adolescent health care : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1984 Apr,United States,1984,80
3060449,Determinants of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays: a pilot study.,"Estimates of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays have always been varied, and given Medicare's new Prospective Payment System (PPS) based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), they are likely to have changed again. Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement.",Health services research,1988 Dec,United States,1988,80
2773911,Wartime determinants of arteriographically confirmed coronary artery disease in Beirut.,"This study investigates the association of wartime stress variables and coronary artery disease as determined by coronary angiography in Lebanon in 1986, a country with an ongoing civil war for over a decade. A total of 127 patients who underwent coronary angiography at the American University of Beirut Medical Center were individually matched on age and sex with visitor controls free from any evidence of clinical coronary artery disease. Arteriographic cases (greater than or equal to 70% maximal stenosis) were compared with two control groups: arteriographic controls (entirely normal coronaries) and visitor controls. Findings suggest that there is a relation between exposure to both acute and chronic war events and coronary artery disease in this patient population. The reporting of exposure to acute war events was significantly higher in cases compared with both visitor controls (odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.17-4.90) and arteriographic controls (OR = 2.8, 95% Cl 0.93-8.47). Crossing the ""green-lines"" that separate two belligerent sides, considered as an attribute of war-related chronic stress, was more frequent in cases compared with visitor controls (OR = 3.25, 95% Cl 1.54-6.89) and arteriographic controls (OR = 5.38, 95% Cl 1.65-17.6). The relation observed between wartime stress and coronary artery disease could not be explained by possible overreporting of stressful events in patients with suspected coronary artery disease or by an increase in clinical awareness for the disease for those under continuous stress. Adjusting for the effect of the well-established coronary artery disease risk factors did not alter the above findings.",American journal of epidemiology,1989 Oct,United States,1989,80
3933036,Some determinants of the motivational properties of ethanol in the rat: concurrent administration of food or social stimuli.,"The hypothesis was examined that the interaction of ethanol with the conditions under which it is administered may determine whether either preference or aversion for the drug develops. In Experiment 1, eight groups of food-deprived rats received injections of ethanol (175-1,400 mg/kg) in one environment and were later offered a choice between that environment and a different one previously associated with saline injections. Another eight groups were treated identically, except that food was available in both the saline and ethanol-paired environments. The groups given the drug without food showed no preference or aversion at low doses (175-700 mg/kg), but showed aversion at higher doses (1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg). When food was available, there was an increased preference for the environment paired with the 500 mg/kg dose and reduced aversion at the 1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg doses. In Experiment 2, placing two rats together increased each rat's preference for the environment associated with the other animal. However, rats pretreated with 500 mg/kg ethanol before being placed together showed a reduced preference for the environment associated with the drug and the other animal. Controls never paired with another rat showed no preference or aversion at the same ethanol dose. Thus, ethanol may interact with conditions such as the presence of food or another animal to determine final effects that are unique to those conditions.",Psychopharmacology,1985,Germany,1985,80

3058621,Behavioural factors involved in the control of food intake in man.,"This paper reviews several psychological models to explain disturbed food intake: the ""psychosomatic theory"", the ""stimulus-binding theory"", the ""concept of restraint eating"", closely related to the ""concept of latent obesity"", the ""set-point-theory"" and the ""boundary model"". All are based on the assumption that there are biological regulating processes of body weight (and with this also of feelings of hunger, appetite and satiation as the determinants of food intake), nevertheless the resulting body weight can be inconsistent with social standards and individual self-concepts. In this case a cognitive control of food intake (dieting behaviour) is activated for weight regulation, which in turn interacts with biological regulatory mechanisms, and as a result leads to specific behavioural dispositions which can be supported by experiments.",International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

3628634,Vulnerability to life events exposure.,A theoretical model designed to assess the contribution of systematic factors contributing to vulnerability to life-events exposure is described. This model is applied to six-year longitudinal data on life events exposure for a sample of New Zealand women with school-aged children. The fitted model suggests that in the region of 30% of the variance in life-event reports over the six-year period was attributable to a common vulnerability factor. Modelling of this vulnerability factor suggested that two major determinants of vulnerability to life events were the level of social disadvantage of the woman and her level of neuroticism: women of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and women with high neuroticism scores showed a consistent tendency to report high life-event exposure during the six-year period. The implications of these findings are discussed.,Psychological medicine,1987 Aug,England,1987,80

For high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) six variables were significantly associated with plasma concentrations, and these variables explained 12.6% of the variance. For low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (T-C), and triglyceride 8.4%, 7.5%, and 18.5% of the variance was explained by significantly associated variables. Fibrinogen concentrations determined chemically were significantly associated with age, smoking habit, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and intake of cereal fibre (24.2% variance). These data provide some encouragement for the possibility of dietary intervention to influence plasma concentrations of major risk factors for ischaemic heart disease in men.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1983 Jun,England,1983,80

Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines.

6285155,"Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus in pregnant women: social factors, and immune competence as determinants of lymphoproliferative diseases-a hypothesis.","In normal pregnant women, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) frequently occurs. Cellular immune responses are apparently suppressed, but high titer EBV-specific antibodies of IgG class may compensate. The antibodies cross the placenta and protect the infant against primary infection for many months. Reactivation of EBV in pregnancy and oral excretion of virus by normal pregnant women could be one explanation why young children in large sibships (among families of low social classes) become infected early in life. Infants are likely infected by EBV from their pregnant mothers who shed virus in saliva. Moreover, the natural protection for several months in the perinatal period against Burkitt lymphoma and fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases in congenitally immune deficient children is explained. The maturity and immunocompetence of the immune system at the time of primary infection by EBV and the size of the sibship seem to determine whether infectious mononucleosis occurs. Gammaglobulin derived from human cord blood may be a valuable source of viral-specific antibodies for serotherapy in immune deficient patients.",Medical hypotheses,1982 Apr,United States,1982,80
7390022,The first foray: maternal influences in nest egression in the weanling rat.,"A series of experiments was performed to examine the determinants of the rat pups' 1st excursions from the maternal nest into the novel environment outside the burrow. A standardized, nidic environment consisting of a maternal nest and adjoining open field was studied under a variety of structured test conditions. When the mother was outside the nest, pups readily ventured into the field. The early excursions were not stimulated by the mother's absence from the nest because when the mother was removed from the nest but not placed in the field the pups remained nestbound. Anesthetized dams elicited few excursions, suggesting that olfactory cues are less potent in this situation than behaviorally transmitted signals. Nonlactating adults were not attractive to pups but after induction of ""maternal responsiveness"" concaveated males facilitated egression. The data from a final experiment suggest that when in the nest, the dam stimulates egression by providing additional ""permissive"" stimuli that render the weanling more responsive to approach cues outside the nest.",Developmental psychobiology,1980 Jul,United States,1980,80

Study population was a two-stage cluster sample of 5312 men and women, aged 25-64 (response 79.4%). Measurement instruments were interviews and a self-administered questionnaire. Type A was measured by the Framingham Type A behavior scale. In multiple logistic regression analyses. Type A behavior among men was studied as a function of various occupational positions [blue-collar, white-collar, civil (public) servants, self-employed], controlling for age, educational level, marital status, and interaction effects. In those analyses it was found that the occupational position 'self-employed' was the best predictor of Type A behavior (odds ratio 3.0 compared to blue-collar employees). Since most of the employed women were white-collar employees (a very homogeneous group) Type A behavior among women was studied as a function of full-time and part-time employment, with the same control variables as were included in the analyses for men. Taking into account the statistical significant interaction effect age by employment, it could be shown that the odds of being Type A for a 50 yr old woman was 3.5 compared to a housewife at the same age. In summary the findings show strong relationships between work situation and Type A behavior for both men and women. Especially the self-employed men have more Type A behavior patterns, so may have higher CHD risk.",Social science & medicine (1982),1989,England,1989,80

In the evolution of infant health in Costa Rica two paradigms were identified. One developed in the decades before 1970 and the other during the 1970s. The necessity of conceptualizing a third new paradigm compatible with health needs of the present and the immediate future is recognized. The first or ""malnutrition paradigm"" was orthodox in its derivation; it identified the lack of food as the underlying base for the major health problems and placed its emphasis on institutional medicine. The paradigm was influenced by foreign schools of nutrition and pediatrics and led to the development of an infrastructure for the delivery of medical services and the programs for food distribution. The ""infectious disease paradigm"" recognized infectious diseases as the main determinants of morbidity, mortality and malnutrition in childhood. The strategies derived from such a revolutionary paradigm aimed at the control and eradication of infectious diseases, and they resulted in a rapid improvement of child nutrition and health. However, the infectious disease paradigm does not seem to reduce infant mortality below the present level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Pediatric infectious disease,1985 Sep-Oct,United States,1985,80
2738317,Personal and environmental determinants of activity involvement among elderly residents of congregate facilities.,"This study examined the personal and environmental factors related to the activity involvement of older people living in congregate residential settings. A sample of 1,428 residents in 42 such settings provided information about their activities, functioning, and background. Measures of facility features were also available. These data show that individuals are more likely to participate in facility-organized activities in settings where overall resident participation is greater, the average functioning of residents is lower, staffing is higher, and the program more structured. Participation in facility activities is not related to personal characteristics. In contrast, involvement in resident-initiated activities, both in the facility and in the community, is related to personal characteristics (being functionally intact, female, and better educated) and to facility features (larger size, lower staffing, greater autonomy and cohesiveness). The impact of some features varies depending on the functional capacity of the individual resident.",Journal of gerontology,1989 Jul,United States,1989,80

For high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) six variables were significantly associated with plasma concentrations, and these variables explained 12.6% of the variance. For low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (T-C), and triglyceride 8.4%, 7.5%, and 18.5% of the variance was explained by significantly associated variables. Fibrinogen concentrations determined chemically were significantly associated with age, smoking habit, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and intake of cereal fibre (24.2% variance).

They have been studied in relation to their obstetric, social and environmental background. The preventable nature of the lesion was explored particularly with respect to age, parity and obstructed labour, and to traditional practices including 'gishiri cutting', which alone accounts for 13% of all the fistulas.

The questionnaire items are tested against the statement: ""Patients should not take drugs, they can only be helped by good advice"". The prejudice of relatives of schizophrenics against drug therapy may have an effect on the patients' compliance to maintenance therapy and, subsequently, on their relapse rate. A number of factors, social and psychological, were examined as possible determinants of the negative attitudes of relatives. These factors include age, sex, profession, education, positive family history, and use of drugs among the relatives; mental state, residence, duration of illness, relapse rate and clinical features in the patients. Poor education of relatives correlated to negative attitudes towards drug therapy.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,1985 Feb,United States,1985,80
3276981,The structure and function of dental-care markets. A review and agenda for research.,"The growth of dental health services over the past 15 years has produced several issues in dentistry. Because economic markets are the cornerstone of dental delivery in the US, informed responses to these issues require a thorough understanding of dental-care markets. The empirical literature is reviewed to examine the structure of dental markets, to assess the major determinants of market equilibrium, and to examine the social and health consequences of dental-care markets. Results reveal that while dental markets are imperfectly competitive, it is unclear whether prices exceed competitive levels. Little is known about the effects of dental markets on public oral health and society. Future research is proposed in two broad areas: 1) updating early studies conducted when few Americans had dental insurance benefits; and 2) path-breaking research to advance our knowledge of dental-care markets in particular and medical-care markets in general.",Medical care,1988 Feb,United States,1988,80

Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines. Although many factors influenced tenure decisions, the achievement criteria were identified by members of all disciplines as the most important determinants during tenure review.",Nursing research,1989 Mar-Apr,United States,1989,80
6495362,Ethnic differences in contraceptive use in Sri Lanka.,"In Sri Lanka in 1975, the majority Sinhalese had a much higher use of contraception than either the Sri Lanka Tamils or the Moors. This study uses a national sample of women of childbearing age gathered by the Sri Lanka World Fertility Survey in 1975 to assess four possible reasons for differential contraceptive use: (1) differences in socioeconomic position; (2) cultural differences; (3) minority status; and (4) differential access to family planning services. The first three explanations focus on differences in the demand for contraception while the fourth explanation focuses on differences in the availability of contraceptives. The socioeconomic, cultural, and minority status hypotheses fail to explain the higher contraceptive use among the Sinhalese. The evidence is consistent with the idea that ethnic differences in contraceptive use were largely caused by differential access to family planning services.",Studies in family planning,1984 Sep-Oct,United States,1984,80
3071406,Psychosomatics of beauty and ugliness: theoretical implications of the systems approach.,"In this presentation, physical appearance has been considered an inseparable part of daily human existence. Relevant aspects of research in social psychology on interpersonal attraction and personality theory stressing narcissistic vulnerability were reviewed. General systems theory was proposed as a theoretical framework from which to view the multifactorial aspects of the psychosomatics of beauty and ugliness. In support of this proposition, the contemporary use of systems thinking in medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, family therapy, and the understanding of emotions was stressed. Emotional reactions to the evaluations of physical appearance by self and others were shown to be inevitable, involving appraisal and feedback processes affecting different systems in the person's life. The person's self-image and self-esteem were stressed as underlying determinants of outcome in health and in illness. Finally, we hope to have communicated our belief that in the present, as a way of integrating and summarizing the knowledge obtained in the specialized fields, systems thinking allows for more creative and successful treatment outcomes.",Clinics in dermatology,1988 Jul-Sep,United States,1988,80
2558204,Factors affecting the decision to consult with dyspepsia: comparison of consulters and non-consulters.,"To identify factors associated with the decision to consult with dyspepsia, patients with dyspepsia were identified from a postal survey in the community. A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour.",The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,1989 Dec,England,1989,80

The growth rates are examined on different levels of aggregation (individual counties, subregions and regions) and in relation to several possible determinants of growth. The main objective of the study is to examine whether the growth patterns in the eighties support the hypothesis of a turnaround in the population development of rural areas.... The results reveal a diversity of growth patterns and significant regional differences. Rural counties within the daily urban system of a metropolitan area have significantly higher growth rates than peripheral rural counties. The results do not support the notion of a turnaround of long established trends. The trends in the eighties bear more resemblance to traditional growth patterns of rural areas.""

3701583,Counselor and client personality as determinants of counselor expectancy effects.,"Seventy-eight students enrolled in summer-session college courses were randomly assigned to serve either as counselors or as clients for a 20-min, role-played peer counseling session. All of the subjects completed a battery of standardized personality measures. Each counselor interacted with two clients. Prior to the sessions, the counselor was led to believe that one of the clients was especially introverted and that the other client was especially extraverted. Dependent measures were based on clients' change scores on a mood adjective rating scale administered before and after the peer counseling sessions. Analyses showed that counselors who were more successful at biasing their clients in the direction of their expectancies (a) scored higher on measures of Dogmatism, Nurturance, and Social Recognition, (b) scored lower on Impulsivity, and (c) were more likely to be women. Clients who were more susceptible to counselor bias scored higher on the Self-Monitoring Scale, the Self-Monitoring Other-Directedness subscale, and Social Recognition. These results are discussed in light of previous research and their implications for research on interpersonal expectancy effects.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1986 Feb,United States,1986,80
2707518,The Swedish childhood diabetes study--social and perinatal determinants for diabetes in childhood.,"Using the Swedish childhood diabetes register, a nationwide, case-referent study was performed from September 1, 1985 to August 31, 1986. Based on the information from a mailed questionnaire sent to all incident diabetic children and for each diabetic child - two referent children matched according to age, sex, and county, we have analysed perinatal events and aspects of the social environment as possible risk factors for Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes in childhood. A significantly larger proportion of the mothers of the diabetic children were older than 40 years compared to those of the referent children (33% and 24%, p = 0.01 respectively). A smaller percentage of mothers of the diabetic children had a high educational level compared to mothers of referent children (10% and 15%, p = 0.03 respectively) and 39% of the fathers of the diabetic children were manual workers compared to 31% of the fathers of referent children (p = 0.03). Perinatal events did not differ between diabetic and referent children. In children 0-6 years, the duration of breast-feeding was significantly shorter in diabetic children than among referent children (median duration for diabetic children 5 months compared to 6 months for referent children p = 0.03). When considering the presence of Type 1 diabetes among relatives, maternal age over 40 years, low educational level of the mother, and the father being a manual worker as risk factors, the presence of 1 to 4 of any of these risk factors increased the relative risk for Type 1 diabetes cumulatively from 1.2-7.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Diabetologia,1989 Jan,Germany,1989,80

Factor analysis procedures suggested that college students' (N=198) social networks consisted of four groups: nuclear family, other family, friends, and others. Satisfaction with support was positively related to the proportion of the network occupied by nuclear family and negatively related to the proportion of friends in the network. Evidence was found for the presence of both support specialists and support generalists in the networks of the college students.

6539156,The families of children who fail to thrive: preliminary investigations of parental deprivation among organic and non-organic cases.,"A majority of cases of failure to thrive (FTT) do not have a known organic etiology. Social and psychological determinants are sought for these ""non-organic failure to thrive"" (N-O FTT) cases. Social and psychological differences between non-organic and organic cases are also explored here. With the introduction of the term, ""maternal deprivation,"" medical practitioners have implicated mothers' deficiencies as instrumental in the etiology of N-O FTT. However, these mothers are themselves usually deprived. Lack of cooperation in childcare by both parents is noted when classic clinical cases are reviewed. We suggest that the concept, ""parental deprivation,"" provides a more accurate model. Preliminary research findings support our hypothesis that mothers of FTT infants do not have good social support networks. Teen motherhood and socioeconomic status also appear to be important, but not necessary as determinants. An unexpected finding is that there are few differences in the social deficiencies of families of N-O FTT infants as compared to those failing for organic reasons. Two unanticipated findings appear noteworthy. First, infants failing for organic reasons are significantly smaller and thinner at birth, independent of pregnancy complications or prematurity. Second, infants failing for non-organic reasons are more likely to present during the period of infant-caretaker role development and less likely in the later toddler stage. Additional research into the feasibility of strengthening family supports as a basis of intervention is recommended.",Child abuse & neglect,1984,England,1984,80
6922461,Determinants of staff nurses' perceptions of autonomy within different clinical contexts.,"Studies of nurses and other health professionals indicate that autonomy is an important determinant of job satisfaction and turnover. This study analyzed selected characteristics of hospital nursing units to identify those features of the work setting that influence staff nurses' perceptions of autonomy: comparisons among nurses who work in different clinical areas were made. Data were collected by interviewing 789 nonsupervisory registered nurses who were employed full time at one large university-affiliated hospital. Personal and job-related information was obtained for each nurse. Structural features of units, such as workload, were gathered from head nurse reports and hospital records. Findings indicated that nurses' perceptions of autonomy are influenced by both personal characteristics of the nurse and structural features of the units. The nurse's sense of personal efficacy and the relationship she has with her head nurse are two important determinants of autonomy across all units. Workload, primary nursing, and staffing patterns are influential factors in predicting autonomy for nurses who work in critical care areas. Implications of these findings for nursing administrators are discussed.",Nursing research,1982 Jan-Feb,United States,1982,80

However, no association was found with employment rate or certain other determinants of independent living, such as going on a holiday.

Data were collected from 43 subjects, 6 to 35 months after they had elective hip or knee arthroplasties. The subjects responded to a mail survey that defined before surgery and after recovery functioning in relation to 22 activities of daily living representing personal care, housework-yard work, and recreation-social activities. Approximately 65% of the subjects reported no change in their ability to perform the 22 surveyed activities. Psychosocial variables appeared to be significant determinants of function. When the selected background data were compared with surgery results, women performed significantly better than men (p less than .05), but age and surgery location were not significant variables affecting outcome.",Physical therapy,1985 Oct,United States,1985,80

The prevalence of malnutrition (low weight for age, length for age, and weight for length) was smallest in those children breast-fed for 3 to 6 months, but after this age nutritional status appeared to be worse in those breast-fed for longer. Children still being breast-fed at the time of the survey presented with a significantly higher prevalence of low weight for length than those who had been totally weaned, and those receiving breast-plus bottle-feeding presented with intermediate levels. This association could not be explained by a number of possible confounding variables using a multiple logistic regression analysis.

Information was obtained from 26 patients, 13 to 19 years of age, through the use of a confidential self-administered questionnaire and a semistructured interview. In general, subjects demonstrated a high level of factual knowledge regarding the cause, natural history, transmission, and prevention of AIDS. Despite this, participants frequently behaved in ways that were potentially harmful to themselves and others. Specifically, although aware of the importance of using condoms, sexually active adolescents with hemophilia were not practicing safe sex. Restriction in the use of heat-treated clotting factor because of concerns about AIDS was also frequently reported. Professionals providing AIDS education and counseling for these individuals need to be cognizant of the concerns and social skills of this population; they should focus not only on factual information but also on the social and situational pressures confronting these teenagers, which may be more immediate determinants of their behavior and well-being. As AIDS continues to spread into the general population, these findings have relevance to AIDS education and health policy efforts aimed at all adolescents.",Pediatrics,1989 Feb,United States,1989,80

2801628,Ethical dilemmas in community intervention.,"Ethics code books provide only general guidelines and are inadequate in resolving explicit ethical dilemmas that frequently occur in community intervention. Ethical choices often reflect personal values as well as professional role proscriptions and are difficult to resolve for a number of reasons. It often is not clear to whom the interventionist should be accountable, or what the long-range impact may be of specific programs that seem to have short-term benefit. Value clashes can occur between consultants and consultees, even when both groups believe that they represent the best interests of vulnerable client groups. Since personal values are important determinants of ethical choices, whenever possible, they should be communicated openly so community groups can understand the interventionist's values before community projects begin. It also is important to share ethical dilemmas with professional colleagues in order to provide community psychologists with constructive feedback from their professional peers, and to help others anticipate similar value conflicts in their own work. These points are illustrated by discussion of the vignettes presented by O'Neill (1989) and by additional examples drawn from my own experience.",American journal of community psychology,1989 Jun,England,1989,80
2649990,Family-oriented prevention of cardiovascular disease: a social epidemiological approach.,"A social epidemiological approach has been used to study social factors associated with chronic disease, as well as to promote community-oriented intervention programs to modify risk for cardiovascular disease. The present review suggests using a social epidemiological approach in a third way; to promote efforts directed toward family-oriented primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is presented which shows an association between three family social factors (marital status, family socioeconomic status, family size) and risk for cardiovascular disease. The real determinants of risk, however, may be the underlying health-related behaviors indicated by each of these factors. Evidence is also presented which shows the importance of a fourth family social factor (family age) in promoting effective health education efforts to modify risk. Thus, a social epidemiological approach is more valuable than a single discipline-based approach in identifying, understanding, and modifying family social influences on cardiovascular risk.",Social science & medicine (1982),1989,England,1989,80
3392764,Determinants of growth in the first 6 months of life among the urban poor in Sudan.,"This paper presents part of a longitudinal study carried out in the three towns of Khartoum Province in the period December 1983 to April 1985. It was attempting to determine the duration of satisfactory breast-feeding in healthy breast-fed infants of mothers attending maternal and child health centres in the three towns; Khartoum, Khartoum-North and Omdurman. The main objective of the present paper is to compare samples from the three towns in terms of the factors affecting weight gain. Four hundred and thirty-nine infants were recruited at birth and home visited every 2 weeks. At each visit weight was measured and it was recorded whether any supplements had been given and whether the child had been ill. Length was measured every 4 weeks. There were significant differences between the samples from the three towns in attained weights and weight increments. Weight gains were lowest in the Khartoum North sample in the first 3 months, but from 3 to 6 months were highest, almost equalling the NCHS reference. In the Khartoum and Omdurman samples growth from 0 to 3 months exceeded the reference but from 3 to 6 months was less than the reference. Fifty per cent of infants were supplemented by 13 weeks in the Omdurman sample; the median time of supplementation in the other two samples was 17 weeks. Only in Khartoum did delaying supplementation seem to benefit growth. Infections were most common among the Omdurman sample.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",The Journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,1988 Jun,England,1988,80
2707901,A case-comparison analysis of elder abuse and neglect.,"This study examines factors which contribute to elderly abuse and neglect by caregivers in a domestic setting. Methodological and conceptual variations and problems in previous studies have led to considerable confusion as to the determinants of this important social problem. A more rigorous research design was used in this study than has been previously employed. Fifty-nine abused elders from a model project site for the study of elderly abuse were compared with forty-nine non-abused clients from a home care program in the same agency. Using a research instrument designed by the authors, data related to the following aspects of the lives of the elders and their caregivers were collected: psychological status, stressful life events, social networks, mutual dependency, and the nature of their relationships. The study indicates that members of abusive families are more likely to have emotional problems which contribute to interpersonal difficulties. Abused elders are not more dependent on caregivers for many of their daily needs. However, the abused elderly and their caregivers have become increasingly interdependent prior to the onset of abuse because of the loss of other family members, increased social isolation, and the increased financial dependency of the perpetrator on the elderly person.",International journal of aging & human development,1989,United States,1989,80

In contrast, very little is known about the drinking habits and attitudes toward alcohol of teenagers in the world's developing countries. In this paper we propose that adolescents learn about alcohol as part of the socialization process, just as they learn other social behaviors. Central to this learning is the development of a set of expectancies within one's culture about the effects of alcohol upon the user. These expectancies are important determinants of subsequent drinking behavior. An understanding of the sociocultural environment in which these expectancies develop, and in which teenage drinking occurs, is essential for developing intervention strategies aimed at promoting responsible alcohol use and avoiding alcohol-related problems among young people.",Pediatrician,1987,Switzerland,1987,80

25196925,Old age security and the family life course: A case study of nineteenth-century mennonite immigrants to Kansas.,"According to life course analysis, age systems create socially recognized turning points, which outline life paths, channel people into positions and roles, and determine the distribution of rights and obligations. Yet few studies have examined these social parameters. Another problem with life course research is its ahistoricity. Even specifically historical studies have often been unable to measure the dynamics of change because of their use of cross-sectional household data, which only measures a small portion of kinship relations. This case study of the Mennonite family of Cornelius and Helena Richert Voth, who migrated from Russia to the Kansas Plains in 1874, analyzes the role that religious and ethnic traditions and inheritance rules play in preserving family stability, providing security in old age, and shaping the family life course. It contributes to our understanding of the social determinants of life course change by illustrating how traditional Mennonite patterns of family organization and property transmission, formed during centuries of community life in Prussia and Russia, shaped the timing of life course transitions and how the differing social, political, and economic conditions the immigrants encountered on the American frontier altered those traditional patterns.",Journal of aging studies,1987 Spring,England,1987,80
7112177,"Social, spatial and political determinants of U.S. abortion rates.","Abortion rates in the United States have risen annually since the 1973 Supreme Court decision. The regions with the greatest rate increases are the Southern and Plains states; the lowest rate increases were in regions which had high abortion rates soon after abortion was legalized. While spatial contiguity appears to influence abortion rates, that is, states with high rates of abortion are clustered spatially, social and political influence are also evident. Ratification of the equal rights amendment, the seeking of abortion outside the state of residence, and the degree of urbanization within a state are variables which influenced U.S. abortion rates between 1973 and 1977.",Social science & medicine (1982),1982,England,1982,80
12281047,Immigration and the earnings of youth in the U.S..,"""This article reports findings that have emerged from an effort made at statistically measuring the effects of immigration on the earnings of U.S.-born youth. The presence of immigrants arriving before 1965 has a positive impact on youth earnings. Recently arrived immigrants impact negatively, however. These results are consistent with recent findings that the skill level of immigrants arriving within the last two decades is lower relative to that of immigrants arriving earlier. The results also show that the negative effects diminish as the youth ages, reflecting skill acquisition and job mobility of the young worker into jobs less vulnerable to competition from immigrant workers.""",The International migration review,1988 Spring,United States,1988,80
10304496,Fostering primary and secondary prevention in public policy for pregnant adolescents.,The diverse factors associated with sexuality among adolescents and the specific issues related to contraception in this developmentally diverse group result in complexity in policy formation. The future of an adolescent may be determined solely on the basis of access to supportive physical and emotional services funded by public and private sector monies. The purpose of this paper is to briefly present contemporary and social policies regarding pregnant adolescent health care. Suggestions as to how these policies can be translated into public adolescent health models are provided. The strategies will be related to primary and secondary public policy interventions.,Journal of health & social policy,1989,United States,1989,80
2814648,[Socio-hygienic aspects of performance of mini-abortion in women's consultation clinics].,"The paper provides the results of sample socio-hygienic survey of 418 women after operation of mini-abortion. The women are classified according to age and family status. The contraceptive behaviour of women is analysed, methods and types of contraception are examined. With respect to this new type of activity, main causes of visits to the women's consultation clinic and certain medical and organisational aspects of its work are analysed.",Sovetskoe zdravookhranenie,1989,Russia (Federation),1989,80
7214067,Some characteristics of the hearing-impaired elderly who do not present themselves for rehabilitation.,Social and audiometric characteristics of the hearing-impaired elderly without aids have been analysed and some understanding developed of the factors which lead people to seek rehabilitation. The two major single determinants of seeking help were found to be severity of impairment and onset of deafness before reaching retirement age. There were strong indications that negative attitudes of both the elderly themselves and their general practitioners towards deafness and ageing played a crucial part in perpetuating the neglect of the disorder.,British journal of audiology,1981 Feb,England,1981,80
3503938,Lifestyles and social class: implications for primary care.,"Data from the Oxford healthy life survey were used to explore social class variations in beliefs about the determinants of health, willingness to contemplate behaviour change and experience of lifestyle advice in primary care.While the association between lifestyle factors and health was well-recognized by all social groups, those in social classes 1 and 2 were more likely than others to stress the importance of smoking, diet and exercise, while those in social classes 4 and 5 were more likely than middle class people to emphasize the effect of socioeconomic influences on health such as unemployment, income, pollution and housing. Members of all social classes attributed considerable importance to psychosocial influences on health. In all social classes a substantial proportion of overweight people expressed a desire to reduce their weight, smokers to modify their smoking habits and sedentary people to increase the amount of exercise they took. However, there was less interest in dietary change or reduction of alcohol consumption. One third of the smokers and of those who were overweight had received advice from health professionals about behaviour modification, but less than 10% of those in the other risk groups reported receiving advice. There was a high demand for advice on health; 44% of all respondents said they would be interested in receiving advice on a healthier lifestyle.",The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,1987 Dec,England,1987,80
2551196,"Determinants of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), and dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) levels in the sera of young children.","Serum samples from 285 4-year-old Michigan children were evaluated for levels of 11 environmental contaminants. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were found in half the samples tested; polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) in 13-21 percent; dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), in more than 70 percent. Nursing (Mothers' milk) was the principal source of these exposures. Congener-specific analysis documented the presence of at least one highly toxic PCB congener, 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl. The data demonstrate the multigenerational impact of female exposure to persistent organic environmental contaminants.",American journal of public health,1989 Oct,United States,1989,80
3182366,"Smoking among kibbutz youth. Patterns, perceptions, and determinants.","A population of 54 high-school-aged kibbutz youth in Israel were studied to assess their smoking habits. Twenty (37%) were smokers. Among the smokers, 15 (75%) smoked daily, with four smoking as many as 10-20 cigarettes per day. Nearly half of the group believed smoking affected their health and were interested in stopping their use of cigarettes. Smokers when compared to nonsmokers had more positive peer relations (chi 2 = 9.308; p less than 0.01), less positive relations with parents (chi 2 = 8.293; p less than 0.01), more boredom with kibbutz life (chi 2 = 3.468; p less than 0.10), and less involvement with a hobby, sport, or reading (chi 2 = 3.133, p less than 0.10). Parents' smoking habits, marital status of the parents, students' self-evaluation of their academic performance, and youths' age and sex did not differentiate smokers from nonsmokers.",Journal of adolescent health care : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1988 Nov,United States,1988,80
2489983,Sociodemographic determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka: 1975-82.,"The determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka are examined during a period in which contraceptive prevalence increased by over 60% and involved substantial use of sterilization and traditional methods. Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods.",Journal of biosocial science. Supplement,1989,England,1989,80
7405948,"What makes persons ""patients"" and patients ""well?","The transitions from person to patient and back represent social decision points rather than boundaries determined by shifting biological equilibria, as doctors so often suppose. Moreover, host resistance to pathogenic agents is weakened by social stress and strengthened by social support. Thus, the efficiency and effectivenss of medical care will be improved if the clinician, in assessing patient problems, systematically inquires into the social determinants of the decision to seek help. The probability of resolving the patient's difficulties will be enhanced by targeting treatment measures at the social components of the illness experience as well as at the pathophysiology of the disease process.",The American journal of medicine,1980 Aug,United States,1980,80
2785722,Reproductive tract infections in a family planning population in rural Bangladesh.,"In contrast to social, religious, and economic determinants of acceptance and sustained use of family planning in developing countries, perceived side effects resulting from reproductive tract infections can usually be ameliorated easily and expeditiously. This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact.",Studies in family planning,1989 Mar-Apr,United States,1989,80
7264477,The holistic health movement: a survey and critique.,"This article discusses the nature and significance of the holistic health movement in four ways. First, a general characterization of the movement is proposed, based on shared commitment to five assumptions: (1) a positive view of health as well-being, (2) individual responsibility for health, (3) the importance of health education, (4) control of social and environmental determinants of health, and (5) low technology of ""natural"" therapeutic techniques. Second, a basic difference among advocates of holistic health/medicine is proposed in terms of the presence or absence of commitment to scientific method. Third, holistic health/medicine is briefly compared with concepts of holism in biology and in the social sciences. Finally, criticisms of each of the basic tenets of the holistic health movement are offered.",The Journal of medicine and philosophy,1981 May,United States,1981,80
