9272258,Characteristics of the new long-stay population in an inner Melbourne acute psychiatric hospital.,"OBJECTIVE: There has been an accumulation of so-called 'new long-stay' (NLS) patients in psychiatric hospitals. To date, no Australian studies have characterised this patient group. We aimed to study the demography, and clinical and social functioning of the NLS population at Royal Park Hospital (RPH) together with patients' attitudes to treatment and views on future placement. METHOD: All 30 NLS patients at RPH were identified. Twenty-seven consenting patients were assessed using the following standardised instruments: Manchester Scale for psychopathology, Life Skills Profile (LSP), Physical Health Index and Patient Attitude Questionnaire. Information on past psychiatric history, past treatment and current treatment was collected. Insight and compliance were assessed. RESULTS: The majority of patients were single men with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Forty-one percent were detained in hospital involuntarily and 56% were considered dangerous to themselves or others. The patients were characterised by high levels of positive and negative symptoms. They were most impaired with respect to 'social contact' relative to the other subscales of the LSP. While 10 (48%) patients expressed a desire to leave hospital, only one patient considered that anyone would cohabit with them. Over two-thirds considered they had been unwell and that medication had helped. Staff rated one-third as having major problems with compliance. About two-thirds of patients had disability secondary to comorbid physical illnesses. CONCLUSION: Like other NLS patients studied in the United Kingdom and Ireland, this group had significant handicaps secondary to psychiatric illness, concomitant physical illness and disability and behaviour unacceptable in community settings. They were also characterised by significant social isolation. These factors may be important determinants of rehabilitation failure and need to be addressed in the process of de-institutionalisation as well as in longitudinal studies examining these and other factors predicting NLS status.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,1997 Aug,England,1997,90
7996589,The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years.,"The term ""gender role"" appeared in print first in 1955. The term ""gender identity"" was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordancy between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.",Journal of sex & marital therapy,1994 Fall,England,1994,90
8146138,Human ecology and behavior and sexually transmitted bacterial infections.,"The three direct determinants of the rate of spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are sexual behaviors, the mean duration of infectiousness, and the mean efficiency of sexual transmission of each STD. Underlying ecological and behavioral factors that operate through one or more of these direct determinants lie on a continuum, ranging from those most proximate back to those more remote (in time or mechanism) from the direct determinants. Most remote and least modifiable are the historical stages of economic development that even today conspicuously influence patterns of sexual behavior. Next are the distribution and changing patterns of climate, hygiene, and population density; the global population explosion and stages of the demographic transition; and ongoing changes in human physiology (e.g., menarche at younger age) and culture (e.g., later marriage). More proximate on the continuum are war, migration, and travel; and current policies for economic development and social welfare. Most recent or modifiable are technologic and commercial product development (e.g., oral contraceptives); circumcision, condom, spermicide, and contraception practices; patterns of illicit drug use that influence sexual behaviors; and the accessibility, quality, and use of STD health care. These underlying factors help explain why the curable bacterial STDs are epidemic in developing countries and why the United States is the only industrialized country that has failed to control bacterial STDs during the AIDS era.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1994 Mar 29,United States,1994,90
8506166,Gender differences in exercise determinants.,"To determine whether gender differences existed in the relationships among potential predictors of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), a heuristic model of nine explanatory variables was tested with the responses of 146 men and 158 women randomly selected from middle- and upper-income census tracts of a midwestern city. The models for men and women did not differ significantly. The findings suggest interventions to increase LTPA participation that enhance health self-determinism and social influences on exercise and influence the negative attitudes toward exercise held by those who have poorer perceived health status, smoke, or are overweight.",Nursing research,1993 May-Jun,United States,1993,90
10400276,The role of social networks and media receptivity in predicting age of smoking initiation: a proportional hazards model of risk and protective factors.,"The increasing prevalence of adolescent smoking demonstrates the need to identify factors associated with early smoking initiation. Previous studies have shown that smoking by social network members and receptivity to pro-tobacco marketing are associated with smoking among adolescents. It is not clear, however, whether these variables also are associated with the age of smoking initiation. Using data from 10,030 California adolescents, this study identified significant correlates of age of smoking initiation using bivariate methods and a multivariate proportional hazards model. Age of smoking initiation was earlier among those adolescents whose friends, siblings, or parents were smokers, and among those adolescents who had a favorite tobacco advertisement, had received tobacco promotional items, or would be willing to use tobacco promotional items. Results suggest that the smoking behavior of social network members and pro-tobacco media influences are important determinants of age of smoking initiation. Because early smoking initiation is associated with higher levels of addiction in adulthood, tobacco control programs should attempt to counter these influences.",Addictive behaviors,1999 May-Jun,England,1999,90
1894842,Relationship of role conflict and role ambiguity to selected job dimensions among joint appointees.,"The purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of role conflict and role ambiguity experienced by nurse faculty in joint academic-clinical appointments and non-joint-appointed faculty (traditional faculty), and to examine the relationships of these two constructs with social support, job satisfaction, and propensity to leave the joint appointment. Scholarly productivity of the two groups was also examined. Five hypotheses were proposed. The sample (N = 113) was drawn from the five Canadian university nursing faculties with the largest proportion of joint academic-clinical appointees. Findings indicate that assuming a joint appointment does not necessarily lead to an increase in role conflict and role ambiguity, and that joint appointees do not differ from traditional faculty in levels of role conflict and role ambiguity, scholarly productivity levels, or job satisfaction. Within the joint-appointee group (N = 33), role conflict was significantly higher than role ambiguity, both role conflict and role ambiguity had an adverse effect on job satisfaction and are determinants of intent to leave the joint appointment. In addition, social support was found to have a buffering effect on role conflict.",Journal of professional nursing : official journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing,1991 Jul-Aug,United States,1991,90
8698957,Determinants of research follow-up participation in an alcohol treatment outcome trial.,"This study examined factors associated with research attrition in a long-term follow-up study (48 months). Researchers attempted to contact all randomized participants, not just those who completed treatment. The processes by which baseline characteristics, early treatment-research experiences, and short-term outcome affected subsequent participations were examined using logistic regression. The analyses deal primarily with refusal, the main reason for attrition. Baseline characteristics had small effects on likelihood of refusal; research engagement had some impact; but treatment participation had strong effect. Short-term outcome did not predict refusal. These findings, if generalizable, have implications for the conduct and reporting of outcome studies. By directly studying bias, rather than presuming its absence on skimpy evidence, researchers can achieve a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of outcome results.",Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,1996 Jun,United States,1996,90
2308764,Non-institutional treatment of chronic pain by field management: an outcome study with comparison group.,"Field management, through the use of specially trained field consultants, is a mechanism by which interdisciplinary interventions can be implemented in non-institutional settings. Management of the real environmental determinants (home, work, social) of pain and disability should improve the effectiveness of behaviorally based interventions and make these treatments more accessible. Over a 6 year period, 261 patients having various chronic somatic complaints (e.g., pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints) underwent interdisciplinary outpatient treatment based on medical and behavioral sciences. Comparison of patients having field management with patients receiving office-based treatment found a significantly greater reduction in disability with field management. 84% of field managed patients had a successful outcome as defined by: (a) return to regular work, or (b) reduced limitations on work, exercise, and daily living activities, depending on functional status at assessment. Only 61% of patients with office-based treatment were successful. Compliance, defined as the frequency with which treatment was mutually terminated, was significantly higher with field management. The availability of long-term disability benefits was highly predictive of a poorer outcome. However, field management remained effective for improving functional status regardless of the availability of benefits. Finally, determination of the cost of non-institutional treatment indicated that field management is a cost-effective modality. Implications of these findings for the treatment of disability in chronic pain and other chronic illness syndromes are discussed.",Pain,1990 Feb,United States,1990,90

10163567,Evidence for success in health promotion: suggestions for improvement.,This paper argues that health promotion needs to develop an approach to evaluation and effectiveness that values qualitative methodologies. It posits the idea that qualitative research could learn from the experience of quantitative researchers and promote more useful ways of measuring effectiveness by the use of intermediate and indirect indicators. It refers to a European-wide project designed to gather information on the effectiveness of health promotion interventions. This project discovered that there was a need for an instrument that allowed qualitative intervention methodologies to be assessed in the same way as quantitative methods.,Health education research,1996 Sep,England,1996,90
9245669,Participation in a breast cancer screening program: influence of past behavior and determinants on future screening participation.,"BACKGROUND: This study analyzed the relationship between past screening behavior, determinants, intention, and future screening participation in the Dutch national breast cancer screening program. METHODS: Participation at the first and second screening rounds was monitored. Furthermore, between the first and the second screening rounds, women received a questionnaire (response 58%, n = 395). The questionnaire was based on the ASE model, including attitude (consequences, anticipated regret, and moral obligation), social influence (support and modeling), and self-efficacy. Other distal variables assessed were previous screening behavior, evaluation of screening characteristics, and demographics. RESULTS: Participants at the second screening differed from nonparticipants on all ASE determinants. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that for previous participants and nonparticipants different ASE determinants and distal variables explained the variance in intention to participate in the next screening (30 to 45%). Logistic regression analyses showed that past behavior and intention (which mediated the effects of the ASE variables) were significant predictors of participation in the second screening. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between previous participants and nonparticipants in determinants of intention and future screening behavior can be used to improve participation and adherence to breast cancer screening.",Preventive medicine,1997 Jul-Aug,United States,1997,90
12345251,The elderly and international migration in Canada: 1971-1986.,"""This paper addresses issues of elderly immigrants in Canada within two areas: their characteristics as immigrants and their contribution to the social phenomenon of the aging of the Canadian population. The patterns of net immigration of persons aged 60 years and over are identified according to sex, age and place of origin of immigrants.... Emigration of this group is studied separately. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the elderly immigrant population displays migration patterns significantly different from that of the total immigrant population. Older immigrants participate even more extensively than their younger counterparts in the process of remigration or return migration. As a consequence, an increase of the proportion of older immigrants...does not necessarily accelerate the aging of the Canadian population."" (SUMMARY IN ITA)",Genus,1993 Jan-Jun,Germany,1993,90
12287569,The choice of migration destination: Dominican and Cuban immigrants to the mainland United States and Puerto Rico.,"""Puerto Rico provides an alternative destination for immigrants from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean because the culture is similar to that in the source country. In this study, we use the 1980 [U.S.] Census of Population to examine the importance of relative earnings and culture in the choice of destination. The main finding is the similar pattern of choice of location for immigrants from the Dominican Republic and Cuba. The more educated and more professional immigrants are found in either Puerto Rico or outside the enclave on the [U.S.] mainland. Within this group, those with less time remaining in the labor market and lower English ability are found in Puerto Rico. We find that not all differences in location decision are attributable to differences in reward structure by location.""",The International migration review,1993 Fall,United States,1993,90
8240431,A Canadian study of the total medical costs for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and the predictors of costs.,"OBJECTIVE: We conducted a cost identification analysis on 164 consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who entered the Montreal General Hospital Lupus Registry between January 1977 and January 1990, compared their costs to the population of Quebec, and determined the predictors of cost. METHODS: In January 1990 and 1991, participants completed questionnaires on health services utilization and on employment history over the preceding 6 months, as well as on functional, psychological, and social well-being. The societal burden of SLE was determined in terms of direct costs (all resources consumed in patient care) and indirect costs (wages lost due to lack of work force participation because of morbidity). RESULTS: The mean total annual cost for 1989, as assessed in January 1990 and expressed in 1990 Canadian dollars, was $13,094. Although only 44% of the patients were fully employed, indirect costs were responsible for 54% of this total ($7,071). Ambulatory costs, primarily diagnostic procedures, medications, and visits to health care professionals, comprised 55% of direct costs ($3,331). The results of the 1990 cost determination were similar. On average, hospitalizations among SLE patients were 4 times more frequent than among the general population of Quebec (matched for age and sex), and the number of ambulatory visits to physicians was double that for the average resident of Quebec. Higher 1989 values of creatinine and a poorer level of physical functioning were the best predictors of higher 1990 direct costs (R2 = 0.29). A poorer SLE well-being score, a combination of education and employment status, and a weaker level of social support were the best predictors of higher indirect costs (R2 = 0.29). CONCLUSION: The direct and indirect costs for patients with SLE are substantial, and their respective predictors are distinct. Direct costs arise from organic complications which induce functional disability. Predictors of indirect costs are potentially amenable to psychological or social interventions and may be more easily modified than the determinants of direct costs, thereby improving patient outcome while simultaneously reducing disease costs.",Arthritis and rheumatism,1993 Nov,United States,1993,90
10565506,Clinical determinants of suicidal ideation and behavior in geriatric depression.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to find clinical characteristics that can identify elderly patients with depression at risk for suicidal ideation and to determine their prognosis. METHOD: Suicidal ideation, past suicidal behavior, severity of depression, cognitive impairment, medical burden, disability, and social support were studied in 354 patients with depression aged 61 to 93 years. The patients had in-person evaluations every 6 months and telephone evaluations for a mean of 1.8 years (SD, 2.2). RESULTS: During the index episode, suicidal ideation was predicted by previous suicide attempts with serious intent (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-5.80), severity of depression (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16), and poor social support (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.18-2.65). Suicide attempts during the year prior to entry were reported by patients with a severe index episode (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00-1.11), impaired instrumental activities of daily living (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.93), and limited impairment in activities of daily living (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.10-2.14). At the initial evaluation, severity of depression, previous attempts, and seriousness of suicidal intent during previous attempts predicted the course of suicidal ideation (concordance correlation, 0.78). During follow-up, contemporaneous severity of depression was the most important determinant of suicidal ideation over time (concordance correlation, 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly individuals with severe depression, history of suicide attempts with serious intent, and poor social support are most likely to have suicidal ideation and should be targeted for appropriate interventions. Severity of depression is the strongest predictor of the course of suicidal ideation.",Archives of general psychiatry,1999 Nov,United States,1999,90
2299374,Adaptive behavioral responses to potential infertility among survivors of testis cancer.,"In a retrospective study of 153 testis cancer survivors, we examined the sociodemographic and clinical determinants of attitudes and behaviors toward illness-induced infertility. Five fertility adjustment responses were identified: sperm-banking awareness (SBA); adoption awareness (AA); fertility testing (FT); trying to father children (TFC); and fertility distress (FD). Although responses to infertility are multidetermined, these data demonstrate there is a distinct sociodemographic and clinical profile for the subgroups of men who engage in different fertility-related behaviors. Multivariate analysis results show that men most likely to be concerned with banking sperm are those who at diagnosis are younger (less than 35 years), childless, college educated, and whose relationships have become strained. Men who sought fertility tests were childless, college graduates, and able to ejaculate. The only factor predicting adoption was childlessness. Those married men attempting to father children were also less than 35 years of age at diagnosis and without ejaculatory dysfunction. The men at greatest risk for continued distress about infertility were those who remained childless and had posttreatment ejaculatory dysfunction. Residual infertility distress also was significantly associated with treatments that included extensive retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) surgery, indicating that the latter is a ""risk factor"" in survivors' long-term distress. These data, while not definitive, show that the prerogative to have children is very important to men and that losing it sets into motion a range of both adverse emotions and adaptive responses. Adjustment to infertility is a complex process that begins at diagnosis and extends long after treatment is completed.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,1990 Feb,United States,1990,90

9810070,"Is religiousness a correlate of absorption? Implications for psychophysiology, coping, and morbidity.","CONTEXT: Evidence synthesized from social epidemiology, psychophysiology, and behavioral medicine suggests that religiousness may represent a significant correlate of absorption, a construct for which few if any psychosocial determinants have been identified. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between absorption and intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness. PARTICIPANTS: 83 respondents of a self-administered survey of adult survivors of cancer or other life-threatening diseases, recruited from participants in a pilot study of psychosocial factors related to recovery from illness. MAIN MEASURES: Tellegen Absorption Scale and Religious Orientation Scale. RESULTS: Absorption, as assessed by the Tellegen Absorption Scale, was positively and significantly associated with intrinsic religiousness, as measured by the Religious Orientation Scale. Predominantly intrinsic subjects had absorption scores at least 20% higher than did predominantly extrinsic, proreligious, or nonreligious subjects. DISCUSSION: Prior research has found that absorption and hypnotizability have psychophysiological correlates, and that religiousness shows protective effects against morbidity and mortality. In light of this work, the present findings suggest that certain religious cognitions, emotions, or experiences may generate an internally focused state that enhances health and attenuates disease through self-soothing psychophysiological mechanisms.",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90

SUBJECTS: A subsample of men at work, aged 40-54 y extracted from the base-line data from four independent prospective studies, each representing a period (Physical Fitness Study (1977-1978), Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health (BIRNH) (1979-1984), Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases (MONICA) (1986-1991) and ORCA (1992-1993)). DESIGN: Linear regression of the average body mass index (kg/m2) and logistic regression of the prevalence of obesity (BMI > or = 30kg/m2). Independent variables taken into account in multivariate analysis were: age, educational level, marital status and region. RESULTS: In this subsample of Belgian men at work, aged 40-54 y, prevalence of obesity increased from 9.2% in 1977-1978 to 14.5% in 1992-1993. This rise was present in each five-year age group, in both regions and in all educational groups, but strongest in the lowest educated. After adjustment for sociodemographic covariables, it was estimated that with regard to 1977-1978, the proportion of men with a BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 doubled over the 15-year period (odds ratio OR (95% confidence intervals, 95% CI)): 1.98 (1.40; 2.80). CONCLUSION: Keeping in mind that the trends have been calculated from data from four different studies, presenting some shortcomings, prevalence of obesity has increased between 1977-1992 in men aged 40-54 y at work. This rise is particularly pronounced in the lower educated groups.",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,1998 Oct,England,1998,90
10633741,Causes of strain affecting relatives of Swedish oldest elderly. A population-based study.,"We examined determinants of carer strain in a random sample of 170 relative of dependent elderly persons in Sweden aged 80 years or more. These persons were interviewed at home by means of the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). Carer strain was assessed in interviews with carers who bore the main responsibility for care of an elderly relative. The response rate was 92%. Multiple logistic regression showed that cohabitation of carer and recipient was the sociodemographic variable most significantly associated with various stress factors and consequences or manifestations of stress; strain connected with ADL assistance given to the elderly person, strain arising from the elderly person's uncooperative or recalcitrant attitude or behaviour, worsening of the elderly-carer relationship, and encroachment on the carer's social life. Correlations between strain and various categories of physical and mental impairment were much lower, and in some respects were even negative. We conclude that support programs for relatives caring for dependent elderly persons should aim primarily at creating continuous relief for the carers and improving their opportunities for contact with other people generally.",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,1999,Sweden,1999,90

9063337,The failure of academic epidemiology: witness for the prosecution.,"Academic epidemiology has failed to develop the scientific methods and the knowledge base to support the fundamental public health mission of preventing disease and promoting health through organized community efforts. As a basic science of public health, epidemiology should attempt to understand health and disease from a community and ecologic perspective as a consequence of how society is organized and behaves, what impact social and economic forces have on disease incidence rates, and what community actions will be effective in altering incidence rates. However, as taught in most textbooks and as widely practiced by academicians, epidemiology has become a biomedical discipline focused on the distribution and determinants of disease in groups of individuals who happen to have some common characteristics, exposures, or diseases. The ecology of human health has not been addressed, and the societal context in which disease occurs has been either disregarded or deliberately abstracted from consideration. By essentially assuming that risk factors for disease in individuals can be summed to understand the causes of disease in populations, academic epidemiology has limited itself to a narrow biomedical perspective, thereby committing the bio-medical fallacy of inferring that disease in populations can be understood by studying risk factors for disease in individuals. Epidemiology should be redefined as a study of the distribution and societal determinants of the health status of populations. This definition provides a stronger link to be the primary mission of public health and places an appropriate emphasis on the social, economic, environmental, and cultural determinants of population health. Epidemiology must cross the boundaries of other population sciences and add to its scope a macro-epidemiology, a study of causes from a truly population perspective, considering health and disease within the context of the total human environment.",American journal of epidemiology,1997 Mar 15,United States,1997,90

9599943,Variability of birth-weight distributions by sex and ethnicity: analysis using mixture models.,"Birth weight is the most important proximate determinant of the level of infant mortality. However, the association between birth weight and infant mortality is not constant among populations. For example, the mortality of African American infants is lower at low birth weight but higher at high birth weight compared with European American infants. One possible explanation is that birth cohorts are heterogeneous even after controlling for birth weight, ethnicity, sex, and multiple births. The analyses presented here use Gaussian mixture models to explore the interpopulation variation in the shape of the birth-weight distribution for evidence of intrapopulation heterogeneity. The results suggest that a two-component mixture model provides an excellent description of human birth-weight distributions. Further statistical analyses of sex and ethnic differences indicate (1) that the birth-weight distributions and heterogeneity within the distribution vary between the sexes and among ethnic groups and (2) that one specific component is more closely associated with the overall level of infant mortality. The results support the hypothesis that birth cohorts can consist of two or more subpopulations at differential risk of mortality. Differences in the subpopulation composition of birth cohorts (i.e., differences in the level of heterogeneity among the various ethnic groups) might partially explain the interethnic variation in birth-weight-specific mortality. Further development of these mixture models should provide important additional information concerning the biological, environmental, and social determinants of birth weight and infant mortality.",Human biology,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90
8222993,Global epidemiology.,"Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in human populations. Epidemiology on a global scale is severely constrained by the lack of data. In many countries, there are no comprehensive data on mortality or basic demographic data. Where data are available, findings on the relationship of environment to health across countries need to be interpreted with caution. For example, there is well-known variation in standards of medical practice and diagnosis, and in certification and coding, but there are also large differences in diet, the social environment and lifestyle--all of which strongly predict disease incidence. Inappropriate inference concerning aetiology made from such broad-scale studies may result in what has been termed the 'ecological fallacy'. A complementary approach is to collect and analyse data in standardized fashion as part of international collaborative studies. These can offer some important advantages over the more conventional single-centre design. Recent advances have meant that studies of environment and health can now--in some countries--be carried out using routine data at the small area level. Although problems of interpretation remain, they are generally less severe than in broad-scale studies. Examples of this approach are given.",Ciba Foundation symposium,1993,Netherlands,1993,90

The authors surveyed the views of directors to ascertain influences on their allocation of resources. We find that organizational factors and the preferences of constituents are the strongest determinants of departmental priorities, with leader attributes playing a less influential role. An interesting discovery is that each factor's influence varies depending on the nature of the priority area.

The health achievements of this country are product of political and socioeconomic circumstances as well as of right public health policies. Until about 1970 the features of Costa Rica mortality, although somewhat better than the Latin American average, evolved in a similar way to the rest of the region. In particular, the decades of 1940s and 1950s saw dramatic improvements in life expectancy, thanks mainly to the import of low-cost, high-effectiveness health technologies. In the 1970s, however, Costa Rica departed from a regional pattern of stagnation and managed to close the gap with developed countries in terms of mortality levels. A dramatic decline in the infant mortality rate from 60 to 19 per 1,000 took place in this decade. The main determinants of this breakthrough were health interventions, notably a primary health care program, even though favorable socioeconomic conditions and a reduced fertility also played a role. Ecological data and other evidence suggest that up to three fourths of the mortality decline was accounted for contemporary improvements in public health services, with about 40 percent attributable to primary health care interventions. Furthermore, by targeting interventions on the less privileged population, these interventions had the merit of reducing geographic and socioeconomic differentials in child mortality.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine.

1632206,"Design of a socio-ecologic caries model and testing on 50-year-old citizens of Oslo, Norway.","The purpose of the present study was to design a socio-ecologic caries model based on a general health model and to test the fit of data collected from a random sample of 200 50-year-old Oslo citizens to this designed model. The intention was also to investigate the relative importance of the four items environmental, behavioral, human biology, and health care organization factors. The dependent variable, number of carious surfaces, was recorded clinically and radiologically. The mean number of carious surfaces was 3.0 (SD, 3.5), with a range from 0 to 17, and the four items explained 5%, 25%, 28%, and 13% of the variance in number of carious surfaces, respectively. The complete model explained 42%, whereas traditionally used variables on the basis of the Keyes triad explained only 22% of the variance. The findings from the present study indicate that dental caries is a multifactorial disease with both behavioral and biologic determinants, and the socio-ecologic caries model represents a relevant supplement to the Keyes triad.",Acta odontologica Scandinavica,1992 Jun,England,1992,90
10686752,Collective lifestyles as the target for health promotion.,"The last five years have witnessed intense debate among health researchers in Canada regarding the overlap of the health promotion and population health discourses. Meanwhile, strong currents within health promotion have attempted to move the field beyond a focus on individual behaviour towards the influence of social environments on health, although the tendency is often to fall back on individual behaviour modification as the primary lever for change. The Population Health research agenda bypasses behavioural determinants of health and explores instead social determinants. This body of knowledge provides useful insight for addressing some of the tensions in the health promotion discourse. This paper explores two of these tensions: whether individuals at risk or general populations should be targeted for change; and whether lifestyle is an individual or a collective attribute. We propose the notion of collective lifestyles as a heuristic for understanding the interaction between social conditions and behaviour in shaping health.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1999 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1999,90
9665571,"Gender, work roles and psychosocial work characteristics as determinants of health.","This paper aims to identify gender similarities and differences in psychosocial work characteristics for those in and out of paid employment, to inform research on possible health-related effects. Specifically five questions are addressed: do women report poorer work characteristics than men; are gender differences related to specific characteristics; do work characteristics differ between full- and part-time women workers and between those in paid and unpaid work; are socio-economic gradients in work characteristics similar for men and women; and, if there are gradients, do they differ between women in paid and unpaid work? Analyses are based on the 33 year follow-up of the 1958 British birth cohort. Four psychosocial work characteristics were examined: learning opportunities, monotony, pace of work, and flexibility of breaks. Women reported more negative work characteristics than men, primarily because of differences in learning opportunities (26% lacked opportunity compared with 13% of men) and monotonous work (47 and 31% respectively). Women in full-time employment reported fewer negative characteristics (27%) than part-time (39%) or home-workers (36%). Home-workers had fewer opportunities for learning (36%) and greater monotony (49%) than paid workers (21 and 22% respectively), however fewer home-workers reported inability to control the work pace (11% compared to 23%) and inflexibility of breaks (21% compared to 47%). Socio-economic gradients in work characteristics were similar among men and women, except for flexibility of break times. A socio-economic gradient in work characteristics was found for full- and part-time workers, but not among home-workers. Differences in self reported health were also examined: a social gradient was found for all employment status groups, being strongest for home-workers despite the absence of a gradient in negative work characteristics. In conclusion, these marked gender differences in psychosocial work characteristics need to be considered in future research on work and health.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Jun,England,1998,90

9785712,Understanding developmental psychopathology: how useful are evolutionary accounts?,"OBJECTIVE: To consider the power of principles derived from evolutionary biology to explain the causes and determinants of some forms of child and adolescent mental disorders. METHOD: The authors reviewed the scientific literature for evolutionary mechanisms proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of early-onset disorders. RESULTS: A diverse set of evolutionary mechanisms has been proposed. With the exception of certain genetically determined conditions, many of the proposed mechanisms have little empirical data to support them. One mechanism focuses on the vulnerabilities associated with conserved behavior patterns, such as separation anxiety and other alarm responses. These behavioral patterns are adaptive if they appear in some situations, but not in others. Other attractive theories include a co-optation of underlying neurobiology systems (substance abuse), environmental shifts (transformation of present day environments away from primeval environments), and evolutionary arms races as may occur in putative autoimmune disorders with neuropsychiatric sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Evolutionary biology provides a potentially powerful framework for understanding disease pathogenesis in child psychiatry and should permit the integration of new knowledge from a broad range of scientific disciplines. Evolutionary explanations are typically population-based and fail to account for why a particular individual is disciplines. Evolutionary explanations are typically population-based and fail to account for why a particular individual is affected. Consequently, any adequate account of disease pathogenesis requires that environmental events that impinge on CNS development be considered. Finally, the empirical testing of specific theories may prove to be difficult if not impossible.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1998 Oct,United States,1998,90

DESIGN: In a cohort of men and women, aged 30-60 years at first examination in 1982/1984, smoking behaviour was evaluated from questionnaires at baseline and at follow up 10 years later. SETTING: County of Copenhagen, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 2554 subjects from the original sample of 4581 were successfully followed. This study deals with the 1365 subjects who were smokers at the first examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Smoking status (abstinent for one year or more) at follow up. RESULTS: At follow up 15% of the baseline smokers had been abstinent for one year or more. In multivariate analysis, successful smoking cessation was associated with older age, high social status, low prior tobacco consumption, baseline motivation to stop smoking, and having a non-smoking spouse/cohabitant. The same result was obtained when the analyses were repeated separately for smokers with and without motivation to stop. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers motivated to stop are more likely to quit and remain abstinent than smokers with no such motivation. Age, social status, spouse/cohabitant's smoking behaviour, and the daily consumption of tobacco predict success in smoking cessation, irrespective of smokers' former motivation to stop.",Tobacco control,1998 Autumn,England,1998,90
9290864,The Inventory of Drinking Situations (IDS) in current drinkers with different degrees of alcohol problems.,"The Inventory of Drinking Situations (IDS) is a questionnaire developed to characterize the situations where alcoholics in treatment drank excessively. The purpose of the present study was to extend the understanding of this instrument as a research and diagnostic tool by applying it to drinking situations in individuals who have never been diagnosed as alcoholics, but who may have problems due to alcohol. Seventy-three current drinkers (32.1 +/- 9.98 years) were examined with a version of the IDS suitable for nonalcoholic individuals. Using the CAGE test we categorized the subjects in five groups according to their score. Correlational analysis revealed that the IDS subscale scores increased significantly with the severity of drinking problems. The CAGE score, the factor-derived scale Negative Situations, being male, and a preference for drinking alone were also correlated with the amount of alcohol consumed, while age was correlated with none of the variables of interest. To facilitate the analysis of the profiles of drinking situations, the IDS subscales underwent a factor analysis that rendered two factor-derived scales, suggesting that drinking occurs both in positive and in negative situations. In persons with more alcohol problems, according to their high CAGE scores, there was more drinking in negative situations that in positive ones. Accordingly, we confirmed that the profiles of drinking situations seen in problem drinkers indicated that situations related to negative emotions are more important determinants to drink. Implications of a shift from drinking in positive to drinking in negative emotional situations are discussed. We further substantiated the value of this test instrument for studies on drinking situations and for studies in nonalcoholic individuals.",Addictive behaviors,1997 Jul-Aug,England,1997,90

This article analyzes the incidence and determinants of functional disability in a cohort of 1,001 females and males hospitalized with angina or other acute coronary diseases in 1976-77 and followed through 1985. Proportional hazards and logistic models are utilized to examine sex interactions in long-term disability outcomes. Female survivors with angina are shown to be at significantly higher risk for diminished functional capacity when compared to men as well as to women with other heart disease. Thus, the extended survival and higher incidence of angina among elderly women will likely result in an increased societal burden of disablement in the aged population.",Journal of gerontology,1990 Mar,United States,1990,90

All burns other than those caused by electricity were commoner in females, more so between 15 and 19 years of age. Burns were more frequent in winter and 85 per cent of them were domestic. Nearly all burns took place during day time with a higher incidence between 06.00-09.00 h and 14.00-21.00 h. The patient fatality rate (41.1 per cent) was associated with total burn surface area. Referral time-lag was an important determinant of mortality especially in less severe burns.

The data for the analysis were obtained from the 1983 Census of Population conducted by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics. The analysis focuses on men who immigrated to Israel between 1979 to 1983.... The data reveal that the likelihood of finding employment, the mode of labor market incorporation, and the size of the occupational cost are significantly affected by geocultural origin, occupation in the country of origin, and individual-level demographic and human capital resources. The meaning of the differentiated effects are discussed in detail. The findings point toward two central aspects that should be examined in the study of labor market incorporation of new immigrants: employment status and occupational cost.""",The International migration review,1995 Summer,United States,1995,90

Results indicated that negative relationship qualities, such as rivalry, competition, and conflict, were more closely related to younger sisters engaging in problem delinquent-like behavior and sexual behavior than were positive relationship qualities, such as warmth and closeness. Additionally, a shared friendship network with the older sister was found to be associated with extensive younger sister problem behavior and sexual behavior.

In agreement with earlier reviews, individual differences show only some low and inconsistent concurrent covariation with shiftwork tolerance, and no predictive power for these measures has been found. It is thus not possible to predict future shiftwork tolerance from individual differences. Social conditions are also related to shiftwork tolerance, although again predictive power has not been demonstrated.

A discrete-time competing-risk event history method is employed to identify the determinants of IUD discontinuation by five kinds of reasons: contraceptive failure, expulsion, switching method, side-effects and other nonmethod-related reasons. The predictors of IUD discontinuation suggest that a number of mechanisms are in operation. Some of the determinants may reflect the effects of the family planning program; some may illustrate women's physiological and biological reactions to IUD's; some may be related to women's previous history of contraceptive use; and still others may indicate social characteristics of women that lead them to have their IUD's removed.",Social biology,1996 Fall-Winter,United States,1996,90
10080364,Hierarchies and cliques in the social networks of health care professionals: implications for the design of dissemination strategies.,"Interest in how best to influence the behaviour of clinicians in the interests of both clinical and cost effectiveness has rekindled concern with the social networks of health care professionals. Ever since the seminal work of Coleman et al. [Coleman, J.S., Katz, E., Menzel, H., 1966. Medical Innovation: A Diffusion Study. Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis.], networks have been seen as important in the process by which clinicians adopt (or fail to adopt) new innovations in clinical practice. Yet very little is actually known about the social networks of clinicians in modern health care settings. This paper describes the professional social networks of two groups of health care professionals, clinical directors of medicine and directors of nursing, in hospitals in England. We focus on network density, centrality and centralisation because these characteristics have been linked to access to information, social influence and social control processes. The results show that directors of nursing are more central to their networks than clinical directors of medicine and that their networks are more hierarchical. Clinical directors of medicine tend to be embedded in much more densely connected networks which we describe as cliques. The hypotheses that the networks of directors of nursing are better adapted to gathering and disseminating information than clinical directors of medicine, but that the latter could be more potent instruments for changing, or resisting changes, in clinical behaviour, follow from a number of sociological theories. We conclude that professional socialisation and structural location are important determinants of social networks and that these factors could usefully be considered in the design of strategies to inform and influence clinicians.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Mar,England,1999,90

New associations were found for men employed in shoemaking and shoe repair, porcelain and earthenware industries, education, and other white collar occupations. Several findings supported associations found in other countries, including excesses among woodworkers, furniture makers, electric power plant workers, farmers, dairy workers, lorry drivers, and other land transport workers. Risks were not increased among chemists, chemical or rubber manufacturing workers, or petrochemical refinery workers. Caution must be used in drawing causal inferences from these linked registry data because information on exposure and duration of employment is not available.

DESIGN: A survey design was used. SETTING: Emilia Romagna, Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four healthy community-dwelling subjects aged 90 to 106 years. MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic variables, health behavior, anthropometric indices, and serum DHEAS levels were recorded. Functional assessment was performed by instruments currently used in geriatric practice: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: GDS scores correlated directly with MMSE scores and inversely with ADL severity scores. Poor education, institutionalization, sensory impairment, muscular mass loss, and lower DHEAS levels were the variables with the highest correlation to functional impairment. Smoking, alcohol consumption, and marital status were relatively unimportant. An inverse association was found between DHEAS levels and dependency scores of single ADLs (continence, mobility). CONCLUSION: Impaired cognitive and physical ability with no increase in depression prevalence was found in a sample of subjects more than 90 years of age free of major age-related disease. Muscular mass and DHEAS levels seem to play a role in maintaining physical independence. In turn, physical independence, as well as social and cultural factors, strongly affect the compliance of long-lived subjects with psychocognitive tests currently used in the clinical evaluation of younger old people, suggesting that these instruments are not reliable for screening for cognitive impairment and depression in the oldest old subjects.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90

Individuals with developmental disabilities referred for assessment and/or treatment over an 11-year period were exposed to a series of conditions in which the effects of antecedent and consequent events on SIB were examined systematically by way of multielement, reversal, or combined designs. Data were collected during approximately 4,000 experimental sessions (1,000 hr), with the length of assessment for individuals ranging from 8 to 66 sessions (M = 26.2) conducted over 2 to 16.5 hr (M = 6.5). Differential or uniformly high responding was observed in 145 (95.4%) of the cases. Social-negative reinforcement (escape from task demands or other sources of aversive stimulation) accounted for 58 cases, which was the largest proportion of the sample (38.1%). Social-positive reinforcement (either attention or access to food or materials) accounted for 40 (26.3%) of the cases, automatic (sensory) reinforcement accounted for 39 (25.7%), and multiple controlling variables accounted for 8 (5.3%). Seven sets of data (4.6%) showed either cyclical or inconsistent patterns of responding that were uninterpretable. Overall results indicated that functional analysis methodologies are extremely effective in identifying the environmental determinants of SIB on an individual basis and, subsequently, in guiding the process of treatment selection. Furthermore, an accumulation of assessment data from such analyses across a large number of individuals provides perhaps the most rigorous approach to an epidemiological study of behavioral function.",Journal of applied behavior analysis,1994 Summer,United States,1994,90

DESIGN: Community coronary event register from 1985 to 1991. SETTING: City of Glasgow north of the River Clyde, population 196,000. SUBJECTS: 3991 men and 1551 women aged 25-64 years on the Glasgow MONICA coronary event register with definite or fatal possible or unclassifiable events according to the criteria of the World Health Organisation's MONICA project (monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of coronary events; proportion of subjects reaching hospital alive; case fatality in admitted patients and in community overall. RESULTS: Event rates increased with age for both sexes and were greater in men than women at all ages. The rate increased 1.7-fold in men and 2.4-fold in women from the least (Q1) to the most (Q4) deprived socioeconomic quarter. The socioeconomic gradient decreased with age and was steeper for women than men. The proportion treated in hospital (66%) decreased with age, was greater in women than men, and decreased in both sexes with increasing deprivation (age standardised odds ratio 0.82 for Q4 v Q1) Case fatality in hospital (20%) increased with age, was greater for women than men when age was standardised, and showed no strong socioeconomic pattern. Overall case fatality in the community (50%) increased with age, was similar between the sexes, and increased from Q1 to Q4 (age standardised odds ratio 1.12 in men, 1.18 in women). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic group affects not only death rates from myocardial infarction but also event rates and chance of admission. This should be taken into account when different groups of patients are compared. Because social deprivation is associated with so many more deaths outside hospital, primary and secondary prevention are more likely than acute hospital care to reduce the socioeconomic variation in mortality.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1997 Feb 22,England,1997,90

Aberdeen WHEASE Study Group.,"An increase in prevalence of wheezing illness in the UK has coincided with a reduction in the consumption of natural antioxidants, which may modulate the lung's response to oxidant stress, limiting the expression of airway inflammation and respiratory symptoms. The hypothesis that intakes and plasma levels of natural antioxidants would be determinants of adult-onset wheezing illness was tested. A nested case-control study was conducted in 94 cases with adult-onset wheeze and 203 controls aged 39-45 yrs identified in a 30-yr follow-up survey. Antioxidant intake was measured by a food frequency questionnaire, and plasma and red cell measurements of antioxidant status were obtained. Outcome measures were onset of wheeze since age 15 yrs (ever wheeze) and wheeze occurring in the past 12 months (current wheeze). After adjusting for the effects of smoking, socioeconomic status, atopy, family history of atopic disease and total energy intake, intakes of vitamin E (odds ratio (OR) = 4.02 for low compared to high tertile of intake) and plasma levels of ascorbate (OR = 0.98 per unit) and alpha-tocopherol:triglyceride ratio (OR = 0.34 per log(e) unit) were inversely related to adult-onset wheeze. In analyses stratified by social class and smoking, intakes of vitamin C and E and plasma levels of ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol:triglyceride ratio were inversely related to current wheeze in the manual social class and among current smokers. No independent associations of vitamin A, beta-carotene or total plasma antioxidant capacity were found. The results support the hypothesis that deficiencies of vitamins C and E are associated with wheezing symptoms. Smokers in the manual social class are particularly susceptible to these effects.",The European respiratory journal,1999 Jan,England,1999,90
2333797,Alcohol use as a situational influence on young women's pregnancy risk-taking behaviors.,"Recent studies have found that many young women just beginning their sexual lives use alcohol prior to intercourse. A large number appear to drink heavily enough prior to sex to compromise their ability to use contraceptives. The question emerges whether there is a relationship between drinking before intercourse, the nonuse of birth control methods, and unplanned pregnancies. The present research describes 43 instances of intercourse which resulted in unplanned pregnancies in 14- to 21-year-olds. Variables examined included alcohol use prior to sex, amount of alcohol consumed, the use of other drugs, the planning of intercourse, respondents' stated reasons for nonuse of contraceptives, and other general demographic data.",Adolescence,1990 Spring,United States,1990,90

2375937,Internal vs. external determinants of coping responses to stressful life-events in the elderly.,"Coping appears to function in the relationship between stressful life-events and health. Factors that may influence an individual's use of a particular coping strategy, however, are not well understood. Coping consistency within individuals and across situations was examined in a longitudinal study of 74 independently living elderly persons, as were the effects of the type of event experienced, appraisal of its degree of threat, and demographic variables on coping behaviour. Correlational analyses indicated that coping responses were more a function of event type than of an individual's consistent style. A number of distinct life-events were associated with particular types of coping responses. The degree of threat, one's expectation of the changeability of an event, and one's appraisal of possible courses of action were also correlated with specific coping behaviours. Age was negatively correlated with problem-focused coping and total number of coping responses. This study suggests that the type of stressful event an individual experiences may be a more important general determinant of one's coping response than is one's overriding propensity to cope in a particular way.",The British journal of medical psychology,1990 Jun,England,1990,90
2213488,On-line and memory-based modification of attitudes: determinants of message recall-attitude change correspondence.,"Experiments investigated the impact of message elaboration on attitude change-message recall correspondence when attitude change occurs in an on-line (as attitude-relevant information is received), or memory-based (on the basis of retrieved attitude-relevant information) fashion. In 2 experiments, Ss' processing goals were manipulated to increase or inhibit on-line change and message elaboration. As predicted, Ss reported postexposure attitudes more rapidly in on-line vs memory-based conditions. Decreased message elaboration increased attitude-recall correspondence, regardless of when attitude change occurred. Increased elaboration produced elaboration-attitude judgment correspondence. Results suggest that recall of message content will best predict persuasion when message content is encoded free of elaborations, regardless of when attitude change occurs.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1990 Jul,United States,1990,90
9130411,Determinants of happiness and life satisfaction in elderly Zimbabweans.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess determinants of happiness and life satisfaction in elderly Zimbabweans. DESIGN: Community based cross sectional survey. SETTING: Randomly selected villages and two urban areas in north eastern Zimbabwe. SUBJECTS: 278 subjects aged 60 to 92 years (124 male, 154 female). METHOD: One subject per randomly selected household was interviewed, at home, by a trained interviewer to complete a questionnaire. RESULTS: Independent determinants of happiness were: rural residence, whether children gave material support and satisfaction with financial circumstances. [Adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals 0.25 (0.13 to 0.49), 0.45 (0.22 to 0.94) and 0.11 (0.01 to 0.87) respectively]. Independent determinants of life satisfaction were: feeling better off than their neighbours, receiving adequate respect from their children and satisfaction with financial circumstances. [Adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals 0.73 (0.59 to 0.91), 0.13 (0.03 to 0.59) and 0.24 (0.1 to 0.61) respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that, despite physical hardship, the majority of Zimbabwean elders are happy and 50% are satisfied with their lives and we have identified independent determinants of happiness and life satisfaction in this group. Characterization of these determinants allows us to predict that social changes such as rural/urban migration, declining family support and diminishing respect from children will have a negative effect on happiness and life satisfaction in our elders. It is important that, when planning intervention programmes for the elderly, these facets of wellbeing are not neglected.",The Central African journal of medicine,1996 Nov,Zimbabwe,1996,90
8480234,Societal and ecological determinants of urban health: a case study of pre-reproductive mortality in 19th century Gibraltar.,"A historical based enquiry of colonial Gibraltar at the turn of the 19th century was conducted in order to assess what factors gave rise to residential variation of pre-reproductive mortality. Gibraltar's unusual configuration of a port city, garrison town, and commercial centre at the tip of the Iberian peninsula offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay of ecology, demographic and socio-economic factors on childhood mortality. Communal living under the patio system and the sharing of essential resources were characteristic features of life on the Rock. Using the residential district as the focus of enquiry, stepwise regression results for the period 1879-81, designated as a period of 'low ecological stress', indicated that the number of gallons of potable water per person captured a significant amount of variability in mortality. During the year 1878, a serious shortfall in rainfall was associated with lower life expectancy, a change in the seasonal pattern of mortality, and elevated rates of death attributable to the diarrhea complex. Under this period of 'high ecological stress', the percentage of servants in the household, a proxy for wealth/status, proved to be the single most important factor accounting for 46.6% of the variation in the death rate under 15. Analysis of mortality at the patio level revealed that residents of buildings of two household units had lower mortality than residents living in smaller or larger dwellings, particularly in the period of high ecological stress. The complex pattern of mortality at the district and patio level is explained in terms of the development of residential preferences and decentralized nature of vital resources, such as the water support system and food supply.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Apr,England,1993,90

Data employed in the period analysis were mainly from the years 1944 to 1985, while women born between the years 1935 and 1960 were the subjects of the cohort analysis. An examination of selected indices, namely, age-specific first-birth fertility rates, median ages of women at first-order birth and cumulative first-order birth rates shows that there is an overall trend for women to postpone the initiation of childbearing until late twenties or early thirties.... The results indicate that work experience, education, occupation and year of marriage are important variables influencing age at first birth and first-birth interval.""

9346048,"Annual incidence of unintentional injury among 54,000 children.","OBJECTIVE: To enhance the case definition of unintentional injuries in childhood by applying an objective severity measure to fatal and non-fatal cases. DESIGN: A descriptive prospective epidemiological study of a defined resident childhood population (< 16 years of age) for a one year period, 1990. SETTING: Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Child population estimate for 1990 was 54,400. SUBJECTS: Resident children who died, were admitted to local hospitals, or attended local accident and emergency departments. OUTCOME MEASURES: Using recognised severity scoring systems (for example the injury severity score, trauma score) injuries were classified as severe, moderate, or mild. RESULTS: There were six deaths, 904 admissions, and 11,682 accident and emergency department attendances. All deaths, 25% of admissions, and 1% of accident and emergency attenders were classified as severe. The underlying determinants of severe injuries are different than those for all other injuries (for example age, social class). A comparison with a local survey in 1986 showed a 26% rise in hospital admissions, but no significant rise in the frequency of severe or moderately injured children. Comparisons with other international data showed higher rates of injury admissions and attendances for England, but no significant differences in the frequency of severe injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Objective severity scoring enhances the case definition of unintentional injuries in childhood by allowing for the identification, and, therefore, the more reliable ascertainment of severely injured children. This more completely ascertained set of population cases increases the accuracy of comparisons of injury frequency over time and by place, and, in addition, enhances our basic understanding about the epidemiological characteristics of childhood unintentional injury.",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,1996 Mar,England,1996,90
2342362,Subgroup differences in drinking patterns among black and white men: results from a national survey.,"Despite major increases in alcohol-related health problems and indications of shifts in the cultural role of alcoholic beverages among U.S. blacks, few studies have examined drinking patterns in this population. To address gaps in the literature, data from a 1984 national survey were used to compare drinking patterns and their sociocultural correlates among male, black (n = 723) and male, white (n = 743) Americans. Findings from the survey indicate that, at the aggregate level, black and white men exhibit very similar drinking patterns. The proportion of abstainers, infrequent, frequent and heavier drinkers is very similar for the two groups of men. However, major black-white differences occur when the relationship between drinking rates and major social characteristics is considered. Bivariate tables suggest that frequent heavier drinking among whites is associated with youthfulness, high-income status and residing in ""wetter"" areas, whereas among blacks these patterns are reversed or absent. Log-linear analysis confirmed some of these findings. When drinking behavior was modeled with respect to race, age, income and region, race emerged as an independent predictor and the effects of age and income varied by race. When the two groups of men were analyzed separately, age and region were the only significant determinants of heavier drinking among whites. Among blacks, income and age emerged as significant variables and the influence of age differed from the findings for whites. The results suggest that there may be important differences in the cultural environments of drinking in black and white men.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1990 May,United States,1990,90
9649962,Predictors of cessation of marijuana use: an event history analysis.,"Event history analysis was applied to monthly life and drug histories of a representative community sample of 706 marijuana users, followed from ages 15-16 to 34-35, to investigate factors associated with cessation of marijuana use from adolescence to adulthood. In addition to age and gender, the most important determinants of cessation are the phenomenology of marijuana use, social role participation, depressive symptoms and deviance. Frequent users, those who started using early and those who use illicit drugs other than marijuana are more likely to continue their marijuana use. Using marijuana for social reasons accelerates cessation, using to change one's mood reduces cessation. Becoming pregnant and a parent is the most important social role leading to marijuana cessation for women. There is also a very important experimental effect of the interview itself on the reported timing of a cessation. The effect of a social context favorable to marijuana use appears to reflect selection rather than social influence.",Drug and alcohol dependence,1998 Apr 1,Ireland,1998,90
12348140,"Demographic change and income inequality in the United States, 1976-1989.","""The U.S. economy experienced significant increases in the degree of income inequality over the past two decades.... In this paper we consider the effects of race, age, female headship, and college education on the distribution of family income by developing a multivariate methodology that allows us to gauge the influence of one factor while holding other determinants of family incomes constant. Over the period studied we find that race had only a minor effect on the overall size distribution of income. Age had a somewhat greater effect than race. In contrast, the impact of female heads and college education were quite substantial. The multivariate estimates reveal that the effects of female heads and college education both increase the Gini to a much greater extent than the progressivity of federal income taxes decreases it. The effects of college education and female headed families on inequality have grown larger across time, while the influence of age has declined. We find that the effects of race on inequality have changed little over the 1976 to 1989 period.""",Southern economic journal,1997 Jul,United States,1997,90
24227287,Optimism and coping as determinants of psychosocial adjustment to rheumatoid arthritis.,"Psychosocial adjustment in 66 patients with chronic rheumatoid arthritis, with a mean duration of 12 years with the disease, were evaluated in a prospective design, with 62% of the sample followed up 16 months later. It was predicted that dispositional optimism would predict adjustment over time and that perceived support and perceived control would be related to psychosocial adjustment at the time of concurrent measurement. At Time 1, psychosocial adjustment was associated with greater optimism and perceived support and less disability. Optimism at Time 1 was the only significant predictor of changes in adjustment at Time 2 controlling for Time 1 adjustment and Time 2 disability. It was found that optimism temporally precedes increases in psychosocial adjustment. In terms of coping strategies, wishful thinking was related to poorer social adjustment, whereas problem-focused coping was marginally related to positive adjustment. Neither coping strategy predicted adjustment across time. Optimism at Time 1 did predict problem-focused coping at Time 2. Perceived social support regarding a specific circumstance at a given point in time enables one to persist in solving a task. Interventions to enhance the quality of life of individuals coping with progressive deteriorative disease must look at the influence of their behavior and attitude on those who provide care for them.",Journal of clinical psychology in medical settings,1994 Jun,United States,1994,90
8259803,Custody of cocaine-exposed newborns: determinants of discharge decisions.,"OBJECTIVES: Maternal cocaine use is a leading grounds for newborn foster placement. This study was initiated to investigate the factors that predict custody status of infants born to substance-abusing women. METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was used to study the correlates of discharge custody decisions for 99 consecutive infants testing positive for cocaine in a public hospital. RESULTS: The population was 49% Black, 40% Hispanic, and 11% other or unknown. Custody at discharge was to mothers (38%), other family members (25%), or agency foster care (36%). Placement outside the family was greater when mothers had prior child welfare records, in Blacks vs others, with no prenatal care, and when mothers were younger at their first delivery or older at the index birth. Denial of custody to the mother was higher with prior child welfare involvement, in Blacks, and when the mother did not live in her own home. Both models also controlled for parity, child sex, and birthweight. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier involvement with child welfare authorities, race, and other factors predict continued separation of mothers and children at newborn discharge, suggesting the need to reexamine current policies and practices.",American journal of public health,1993 Dec,United States,1993,90
8616465,Determinants of HIV infection and recent risk behaviour among injecting drug users in Berlin by site of recruitment.,"This study investigated differences in prevalence and determinants of HIV infection, and in recent risk behaviour (previous 6 months) among injecting drug users (IDUs) who are in contact with different types of services for IDUs in Berlin. Participants (n = 557) were recruited from drug-free long-term treatment centres, a storefront agency and a syringe exchange bus. HIV seroprevalence was lowest (3.9%) at the treatment centres, and highest among IDUs at the storefront agency (20.7%). In logistic regression, independent risk factors for HIV infection were duration of injecting drug use, borrowing syringes in prison, sex with HIV-positive partners, and prostitution. Syringe sharing in prison was the most important independent determinant of HIV infection among all three subpopulations of IDUs. Participants entering long-term treatment were most likely, and IDUs at the syringe exchange bus were least likely to have borrowed and passed on syringes in the previous 6 months. In logistic regression, site of recruitment was independently associated with recent borrowing of syringes, but not with condom use. Injection of drugs other than heroin only, and injecting in prisons, were also independent predictors of recent borrowing. The results indicate that IDUs entering treatment form an important target group for health education. There is a need for AIDS prevention measures in prisons. The comparatively low levels of recent injection risk behaviour among IDUs at the syringe exchange bus suggest that this type of intervention may be effective in harm reduction.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1995 Oct,England,1995,90
7811684,Determinants of condom use by Australian secondary school students.,"PURPOSE: To identify factors that are associated with condom use to aid in the understanding of how to change the behavior of those young people who have sex without using condoms. METHODS: The article reports data from 932 sexually active grade 10-12 students from a sample of 72 public secondary schools in seven Australian states and territories. The data were collected using a cross-sectional, self-report questionnaire. RESULTS: Boys were more likely than girls to report that a condom was used the last time they had sex. For boys and girls, communication with a partner about avoiding infection with HIV/STDs, the belief that more peers use condoms, and a higher perceived risk of becoming infected with HIV/STDs were associated with using a condom, as was lower knowledge of STDs. The use of oral contraception and the unavailability of condoms were reported by the students as prominent reasons for non-use of condoms. Number of sexual partners in the past year and type of relationship with partner on the most recent occasion were not associated with condom use. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents are more concerned with unwanted pregnancy than with disease prevention. School students more at risk are not more likely to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from HIV/STDs.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1994 Sep,United States,1994,90
8930590,Determinants of oral health in a group of Danish alcoholics.,"The purposes of this survey were to describe dental health in a group of alcoholics and to analyze the influence of social background, dental health behavior and alcohol-related variables on dental health among alcoholics. The dental health in a group of consecutively admitted alcoholics (n = 195) was described with respect to number of teeth present, DMFS, DS and the prevalence of dental erosion, removable dentures, edentulousness, and untreated dental decay. No major differences were found with respect to number of teeth and dental caries (DMFS), when compared to reference figures of the general population. As to untreated decay, however, 3-5 x more actual decayed surfaces were found among the alcoholics. In the multivariate analyses, neither DMFS, nor untreated decay were found to be associated with alcohol-related indicators. These variables were, however, related to variables of social background and dental health behavior. As to number of teeth present, an association was found with duration of alcoholism, but this relationship was eliminated, when the analysis was controlled with respect to social situation. In contrast, dental erosion was related to duration of alcoholism irrespective of confounding control of dental health behavior and social situation. Hence, the study indicates that oral health in alcoholics can be explained mainly by social situation and dental health behavior and not by variables associated directly with alcohol consumption. An exception was the presence of dental erosion, which was associated with the exposure to alcohol.",European journal of oral sciences,1996 Aug,England,1996,90
9009810,Social determinants of cardiovascular reactivity: effects of incentive to exert influence and evaluative threat.,The effects on cardiovascular reactivity of incentive to influence the judgements of the experimenter and the threat of social evaluation were examined in a sample of 60 male and 60 female undergraduates. Participants either were guaranteed $5.00 to prepare and deliver a brief speech or were told that the money was contingent on an evaluation by the experimenter. Participants believed that their speech would be rated for either simple clarity or verbal intelligence. The contingent incentive increased systolic blood pressure reactivity by 6.5 mmHg (32%). Evaluative threat increased systolic reactivity by 7.1 mmHg (36%). These interpersonal processes could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and are likely to affect the degree of cardiovascular reactivity in laboratory studies.,Psychophysiology,1997 Jan,United States,1997,90

9743893,Prevalence and determinants of current contraceptive method use in a palm oil company in Cameroon.,"The principal reasons given by African women for not using contraception include their lack of economic power and control over their choice of partner. An epidemiologic descriptive survey of a cross-section of the female personnel of a Cameroonian palm oil company (SOCAPALM) was carried out in August 1995, to evaluate the various determinants and level of use of various family planning methods in a well defined population of women in employment. An exhaustive list of all the households in the five villages of SOCAPALM was compiled and all women between 15 and 49 years of age who had lived on the palm oil plantation for at least a year were interviewed. The adjusted odds ratios showed that use of modern contraceptive methods was significantly associated with the woman having received secondary education, having more than three children, being the head of the household and, in cases where there was a man regularly present in the household, his approval of family planning. Recently receiving information (during the last month) about family planning was not identified by multivariate analysis as a significant factor affecting the decision to use modern or traditional contraception. The same factors were found to be associated with the use of traditional methods of contraception, but having had an illegal abortion was also associated with the use of such methods. Thus, the level of knowledge about family planning and the prevalence of contraceptive use was significantly higher for women living in industrial environments (such as SOCAPALM), than in the overall population of women in Cameroon. The economic power of the woman, the presence of a strong social reproductive health network, and the positive attitude of men and community leaders were the most important factors affecting the family planning decision of the women.",Contraception,1998 Jul,United States,1998,90
10352846,Personal reflections on occupational health in the twentieth century: spiraling to the future.,"The history of occupational health in the United States during the twentieth century demonstrates pendular swings, with periods of rapid progress followed by periods of reversal. Happily, the last three decades have witnessed the most impressive gains, with establishment of a near-universal system for regulating conditions in the workplace, legitimization and growth of the occupational health professions, a marked increase in scientific research, most notably epidemiology, and the transfer of knowledge about occupational health to affected workers and the larger US population. Not surprisingly, rates of injury and illness have fallen. However, analysis of these cyclical historic changes suggests that extrinsic factors--broad social currents, changes in health care financing, and societal perceptions of health and disease--have dominated over enhanced scientific knowledge, technologic changes or professional achievements, usually the determinants of medical or public health advances. Practitioners of occupational health are not, and have never been, in a particularly advantageous position to fashion future events in their own field, and the current situation, however encouraging, is likely no exception.",Annual review of public health,1999,United States,1999,90

One consequence is that children become rivals for household resources. In economies with pro-male bias, such rivalries can yield gains to having relatively more sisters than brothers. Using a rich household survey from Ghana [the 1988-1989 Ghana Living Standards Survey], we find that on average if children had all sisters (and no brothers) they would do roughly 25-40% better on measured health indicators than if they had all brothers (and no sisters).""",Journal of population economics,1998,Germany,1998,90
9990494,Determinants of medico-social functioning after total gastrectomy.,"AIM: To describe medico-social functioning after total gastrectomy and the factors determining it. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In three medical rehabilitation centres, 173 consecutive patients (female/male = 62/111) after potentially curative total gastrectomy for gastric malignancy 206 days earlier (median, interquartile range = IQR 56-644) were evaluated for different pre- and post-operative parameters with potential influence on post-operative medico-social functioning as measured with the Edinburgh Rehabilitation Status Scale (ERSS). Parameters evaluated were: gender, age, time since operation, tumour stage, type of operation, clinical centre of admittance, haemoglobin, ferritin, albumin, presence of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, rapid oro-coecal transit, dyspepsia, early satiety, reflux, dysphagia, vomiting, a symptom based score, body mass index in health, at operation and on admission, weight loss since operation, calorie intake, bowel habits, and fat malassimilation. Independent influential factors for the ERSS were identified in a linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The median ERSS-score was 4 (IQR 2-6) on a scale from 0 (best) to 28 (worst). There was a significant difference in the ERSS-scores between the three different clinics. The ERSS-scores improved significantly with time since operation (ca. 22% per year). ERSS-scores were higher in patients with intestino-oesophageal reflux (+71%), with dyspepsia (+65%), or with dysphagia (+62%). CONCLUSION: Medico-social functioning was acceptable in this patient population.

The report also considers whether women are consciously replacing breastfeeding with modern contraceptive methods. Data from the 1976 Malaysian Family Life Survey are analyzed, and the author concludes that Malaysian women do perceive that breastfeeding has a contraceptive effect, but that this perception is not universal. Ethnicity and desire for a particular family size are the most significant determinants of this perception. Finally, Malaysian women's recognition of the contraceptive effect of nursing does not influence either the duration of their breastfeeding or their adoption of contraception. Malaysian women may not be abandoning breastfeeding to adopt contraception. More probably, breastfeeding declines and contraceptive prevalence increases with modernization.",Studies in family planning,1992 Nov-Dec,United States,1992,90

The problem of drug addiction, which encompasses all aspects of the individual's life, is accompanied by the additional negative reinforcement of the permanent danger of a sudden fatal outcome. The causes for an accidental fatal intoxication originate from the different qualities of heroin, the reduced tolerance of the body and carelessness in consuming drugs. These determinants are influenced by several indirect phenomena, as for example psycho-social, therapeutic, legal and economic problems. Furthermore, we have often observed critical life events shortly before death and/or a latent inclination to suicide.",Forensic science international,1993 Nov,Ireland,1993,90

For gastric cancer, the standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for the 234 traditional communities in 1969-73 and for the 56 districts in 1979-83 were calculated. For colorectal cancer, only the data for the latter period were available, and SMRs for that period were calculated similarly. Possible determinants on the resulting pattern of high and low SMRs were investigated. Gastric cancer was generally associated with industrial and urban environments, particularly in west central Scotland, although mortality in Dundee was high in both periods; this cancer also showed significant negative correlations with social class II. By contrast, colorectal cancer showed no strong geographical pattern, no urban-rural gradient, and no social class associations. The cancers showed a weak association with each other.",Scottish medical journal,1990 Oct,Scotland,1990,90
8959415,Determinants of early implant discontinuation among low-income women.,"The determinants of contraceptive implant discontinuation within six months of insertion were examined among 786 low-income women attending family planning clinics in three U.S. cities. The six-month cumulative life-table discontinuation rate was 7.6%. Menstrual side effects were the most common reasons given for early implant removal, although women who discontinued use were no more likely than those who continued with the method to report menstrual irregularities. Women who opted for early removal were more likely than those who continued with the method to experience headaches, hair loss, weight gain and arm infection. Logistic regression analysis indicates that dissatisfaction with prior contraceptive methods, a partner who wants a child within the next two years, perceived pressure from health care providers to choose the implant, exposure to negative media coverage and the number of implant side effects significantly predict early implant discontinuation. Women's social and demographic characteristics, Medicaid status and motivation to avoid an unplanned pregnancy were not significantly related to early removal.",Family planning perspectives,1996 Nov-Dec,United States,1996,90

All RFs were negatively correlated with education attainment. RF changes from 1985 to 1995 were related to education level. Among survey participants, mean body mass index increased from 26.7 kg/m2 to 27.6 kg/m2 (P + 0.005) for men, and from 25.5 kg/m2 to 27.3 kg/m2 (P < 0.00001) for women. Average smoking rate increased from 32.0% to 34.6% (not significant) in men and from 27.7% to 29.1% (not significant) in women. Age-specific smoking rate increased by 13% (P = 0.14) in younger women and decreased by 10% in older women. (P = 0.00). Mean levels of blood cholesterol decreased by 0.2 mmol/L (P = 0.002) in men and 0.1 mmol/L (P = 0.20) in women. Systolic blood pressure increased by 6.3 mmHg (P < 0.0001) in men and by 7.9 mmHg (P < 0.0001) in women, being steepest in the lower education group. Mortality predicted from RFs declined between the survey years, but less than the observed mortality. This discrepancy may result from the effect of medical care or the delayed effect of RF changes. CONCLUSIONS: Some risk factors show a disturbing trend, indicating that an increased effort or a change in strategy is needed to combat the risk of ischemic heart disease.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,1998 Aug,England,1998,90
10186847,Bearing the costs of our eldercare policies: work constraints among employed caregivers.,"For many caregivers, rendering aid to frail parents, grandparents, siblings, and spouses comes at a high price: compromised physical and mental health, disturbed relationships with spouse and children, truncated opportunities for social life, and, for caregivers who are employed, declining job performance. Using the 1982 National Long Term Care Survey's ""Survey of Informal Care-givers,"" this study investigates how the sociodemographic characteristics of caregivers, care requirements, the availability of backup caregivers, and conditions of employment affect the likelihood that caregivers will suffer work constraints. Estimations of both the probability of work constraints and hours of work reveal that proxies for work conditions figure prominently, as do care requirements. In the model of constrained work, ill health, financial burdens, and primary responsibility for care are significant determinants; the estimation of hours of work revealed that low income and competing care demands wielded major influence. Women and white caregivers are employed fewer hours, while spouses are more likely than other informal caregivers to face constrained work. Occupation, as an indicator of work conditions, is shown to be an important addition to the factors considered in investigations of circumstances that affect caregivers' experiencing work constraints.",Journal of aging & social policy,1993,England,1993,90
8531650,Determination and control of schistosomiasis.,"The subject of this conference reflects the scientific community's interest in seeking to understand the complex causal web whose various social, economic, and biological components interact in the production and reproduction of schistosomiasis and its control in relation to community participation. From the onset, the author stresses the impossibility of dealing separately with community participation, as if social components were just one more ""weapon"" in the arsenal for schistosomiasis control. This study begins with a brief historical review of the 71 years of control activities with this endemic disease, stressing the enormous efforts and huge expenditures in this field vis-a-vis the limited results, despite the extraordinary technological development of specific, classical control inputs such as new treatment drugs and molluscicides. The article then discusses the various strategies used in control programs, emphasizing ideological consistencies and contradictions. Interactions at the macro and micro levels are discussed, as are the determinants and risk factors involved in producing the disease's endemicity. Unequal occupation of space leaves the segregated portion of the population exposed to extremely favorable conditions for transmission of the disease. This raises the issue of how to control an endemic disease which is so closely linked to the way of life imposed on the population. The study challenges the classical control model and suggests an alternative model now undergoing medium-term investigation in the States of Espirito Santo, and Pernambuco, Brazil. The author concludes that we do not need new strategies, but a new control model, contrary to the prevailing classical model in both concept and practice. From the conceptual point of view, the new model mentioned above is different from others in that schistosomiasis control is seen from a social perspective stressing the population's accumulated knowledge in addition to the building of shared knowledge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,1995 Mar-Apr,Brazil,1995,90
9740341,Classical risk factors and their impact on incident non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality in southern Germany. Results from the MONICA Augsburg cohort study 1984-1992. Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases.,"BACKGROUND: The MONICA (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases) project in Augsburg provides the first population-based cohort study in Germany to quantify the associations of the risk factors hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking with incident non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality, and to assess their impact at the population level. METHODS: The cohort comprises 1074 men and 1013 women aged 45-64 years; they were followed over 8 years from 1984-1992. In the men, there were 61 non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarctions and 92 all-cause mortality events over this period; in the women the number of deaths from all causes was 45. Incidence rates, hazard rate ratios, population attributable fractions and rate advancement periods were calculated. RESULTS: Adjusting for confounders, the myocardial infarction hazard rate ratios for men with hypertension, or a total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio > or =5.5, or smoking > or =20 cigarettes/day, were 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-3.5), 2.9 (95%, CI 1.7-5.0), and 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1 4-5.0), respectively. The risk factor combination total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio > or = 5.5 and cigarette smoking was particularly hazardous. The three risk factors contributed 65% of the burden of myocardial infarction in the population. The rate advancement period for myocardial infarction associated with hypertension, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio > or =5.5 or smoking > or =20 cigarettes/day was 8.3, 12.4 and 11.5 years, respectively. In women, these risk factors were similarly predictive of all-cause mortality. Comparing the cohort data from Augsburg with those of two occupational cohorts from Germany reveals higher absolute myocardial infarction risks in the Augsburg population; however, the relative risk estimates in the Augsburg and the two occupational cohorts were very similar. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the important contribution of the classical risk factors to the risk of myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality in Germany. The results pertaining to the concept of rate advancement periods particularly demonstrate the great potential for prevention.",European heart journal,1998 Aug,England,1998,90
7597457,Women's orientation toward help-seeking for mental disorders.,"Based on a sample survey of 1000 women in Accra Ghana, this study addresses a number of individual, social and cultural factors that have been found in previous research on diverse populations to be important determinants of treatment-seeking behavior. Bivariate analysis is used to identify those factors that are significantly related to orientation toward help-seeking for mental disorders (use of biomedical vs traditional services), and multivariate analysis is utilized to determine the importance of each, and the effect of causal beliefs independent of sociodemographic factors. The results show that perceived cause of mental disorders, area of residence, age, ethnicity, membership in voluntary associations and prior contact with medical facilities or personnel are the most important determinants of the orientation toward help-seeking for mental disorders. The implications for an effective mental health care delivery system in Ghana are discussed. Also, suggestions for further research are made.",Social science & medicine (1982),1995 Apr,England,1995,90

An understanding of physician behaviour in this domain is therefore important. This cross-sectional survey examined physician beliefs, attitudes, intentions and behaviour with respect to contraceptive prescription. Physician gender was associated with attitudes to diaphragm prescription, while year of medical graduation was associated with attitude to IUCD prescription. Age and gender in turn were related to differing perceptions of methods pertaining to efficacy, adverse effects, women for whom the methods were suitable and possible impacts on the physician. Regional differences in prescribing of these methods may be due to variations in physician age and gender.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1991 Jul-Aug,Switzerland,1991,90

The article presents the spatial distribution of these deaths for the year 1991 and the differences regarding sex, age, and place of occurrence. It also analyzes the potential role of a series of socioeconomic factors, used as indicators of the population's living conditions. An exploratory ecological study was conducted to compare various groups. In 1991 there were a total of 1181 violent deaths in Recife. The study points to an overall mortality rate from external causes of 90.9/ 100,000 inhabitants. The two age groups 10-39 years and 60 years and over were those at highest risk of death. Males showed excess mortality in all age groups. The most important specific causes of death were homicides and traffic accidents, with 51.3% and 23.4%, respectively, of all violent deaths. The authors discuss the differences in the mortality rate from external causes in different social areas, defined according to living conditions and their relationship to the history of the development of Recife.",Cadernos de saude publica,1998 Oct-Dec,Brazil,1998,90
9353673,"Infection with Helicobacter pylori and parasites, social class and cancer.","Three genera of parasites are known or suspected risk factors for cancer in humans: Schistosoma, Opisthorchis and Clonorchis. No adequate information is available on the determinants of infections related to social class. Infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is an important cause of stomach cancer. Studies, in particular from the United Kingdom and the United States of America, strongly suggest that social class factors, especially those acting during childhood, are determinants of the infection, with odds ratios of seroprevalence of the order of 1.5-5 for lower social class as compared with higher social class. A conservative estimate of the contribution of social class, acting through an increased prevalence of H. pylori infection, to the burden of stomach cancer gives a figure of over 50,000 stomach cancers per year worldwide, or 8% of all stomach cancers. In countries with both high and low prevalence of infection with H. pylori, it is likely that a sizeable proportion of this difference is due to social-class-related risk factors of infection.",IARC scientific publications,1997,France,1997,90
10641810,Primordial prevention: the path from Victoria to Catalonia.,"Primordial prevention seeks to prevent future disease by influencing its social determinants. Henry Blackburn's writings are prime portrayals of social factors causing premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). His classic paper, Diet and Mass Hyperlipidemia, identified changes needed in professional attitudes, medical economics, food production, food labeling, and food advertising. The 1982 WHO report, Coronary Heart Disease (Blackburn, rapporteur), introduced the term ""primordial prevention,"" starting a cycle of initiatives, all with considerable influence worldwide. He participated in the now widely disseminated Victoria Declaration on Heart Health (1992), which contained 64 policy recommendations, many focussing on broad social forces that influence modern CVD epidemics. The path he initiated led to the Catalonia Declaration: Investing in Heart Health (1996), which echoed many of his pleas for resources necessary to influence CVD rates. Some roots of CVD's recent decline in many countries are thus clearly attributable to Blackburn's prescient wisdom and visionary scholarship.",Preventive medicine,1999 Dec,United States,1999,90
9141643,Predictors of misclassification of Hispanic ethnicity in a population-based cancer registry.,"PURPOSE: Hispanic ethnicity is often used as a category for calculating population-based rates or assessing risk of epidemiologic studies. However, ethnic misclassification can lead to false conclusions unless the extent of misclassification and the characteristics of those misclassified are understood. METHODS: This study explored determinants of ethnic misclassification in a sample of 1154 cancer cases in the San Francisco-Oakland cancer registry, where ethnic classification is based on surname or medical record report. We compared the following: correctly classified Hispanics, persons classified as Hispanic who self-identified as non-Hispanic, and persons classified as non-Hispanic who self-identified as Hispanic. RESULTS: Among men classified as Hispanic, those most likely to self-identify as non-Hispanic did not speak Spanish, had non-Spanish surnames, and were recent immigrants. Women misclassified as Hispanic did not speak Spanish or have Spanish maiden names, nor did they have mothers with Spanish maiden names. Persons who called themselves Hispanic, but were misclassified by the registry, were likely to be non-Spanish speaking college-education males. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers using ethnicity should be aware of how ethnicity was determined and how this classification may bias or confound their results.",Annals of epidemiology,1997 Apr,United States,1997,90
9458570,Health promotion practice and public health: challenge for the 1990s. Heart Health Think Tank Group.,"The issue of practice skills arose in the course of a process evaluation of the Heart Smart North Shore (HSNS) project in British Columbia. We created a Think Tank of researchers and community practitioners to make recommendations for improvement of our skills. These recommendations differed according to different values for health and opinions on how to create health in the community. Because the site reviewers of the HSNS project were clear this was a disease prevention project and not a community development initiative, HSNS's orientation to skill development after the Think Tank moved toward the Precede/Proceed model, the Transtheoretical model and social marketing approaches. The Health Unit has now been restructured into multidisciplinary service teams which must focus on population health, evidence-based practice and the social determinants of health, and thus need to consider health promotion from a community development perspective and empowerment model. We suggest that learning and the development of staff and community volunteers should be seen as a continuous and reflective process that takes place at the individual, community and organizational level.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1997 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1997,90
10565967,[Satisfaction with primary medical care: population determinants].,"OBJECTIVES: To study the level of satisfaction with the family physician in the general population, and to evaluate the influence of characteristics of the individual and the available health care services. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey with a representative sample of 1,505 beneficiaries of the Social Security, older than one year, from the city of Matar inverted question marko (Barcelona). A questionnaire, administered by home interview, examined the socio-demographic situation, health status, health care organizations and services used and the preferences and knowledge in relation to them. Satisfaction was measured on the scale of Hulka BS et al. developed at Andalusian primary care centres. RESULTS: Satisfaction with the family physician had, on a scale from 0 to 100, a mean score of 61.3 (standard deviation, 13.5) points. The main determinant of satisfaction was the model of primary care, users of non-reformed centres being less satisfied. It was followed by better knowledge of ambulatory services, age and better attitudes towards primary care, which were positively related to satisfaction. Indicators of health care accessibility and continuity, as well as the number of medical visits fulfilled, the subject's main activity and their level of health were also independent determinants of satisfaction. The explained satisfaction's variation was 38.98%. CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with family physician is a complex and multifactorial behaviour which is under constant change due to the interrelation of the individual with his social and health care environment.",Gaceta sanitaria,1999 Sep-Oct,Spain,1999,90

7550767,Infant mortality time series are random walks with drift: are they cointegrated with socioeconomic variables?,"Previous time series analyses of infant mortality have failed to provide evidence to support their implicit assumption that infant mortality data used behaved as a stationary time series. The present study applies the augmented Dickey Fuller Test to infant mortality time series for Sweden (1800-1989), United Kingdom (1839-1989) and United States (1915-1989). The null hypothesis that each of these series is non-stationary is accepted at standard levels of significance. A conceptual framework of infant mortality which uses a combination of physical and social overhead capital as factors in a production function is developed to explain the finding of non-stationarity as derivative from the non-stationarity of a stock of health-enhancing capital. Estimation of econometric models of the socioeconomic determinants of infant mortality using differenced data with ARIMA estimation is inconclusive. Estimation of a bivariate cointegration model supports the hypothesis that infant survival and GNP/Capita are cointegrated for 19th century Sweden but not for 19th century UK. Bivariate analysis of 20th century Sweden, UK, and US data demonstrated no cointegration. This may be due to the onset of disequilibrium in the economic determination of infant mortality in the present era as technological advances and demographic shifts began to play a larger role. Supplementing the bivariate analysis with measures of unemployment, and crude birth rate in the 20th century permitted the detection of cointegration in US and UK. The multivariate results may suggest that improvements in 20th century UK GNP/capita have had greater impact on infant survival relative to US GNP/capita.",Health economics,1995 May-Jun,England,1995,90

8208900,Sex differences in lifetime depression rates: fact or artefact?,"To isolate determinants of any female preponderance in depressive disorder, we earlier selected a sample of young adults, then similar in terms of several potential social determinants of depression and with equivalent rates of lifetime depression. We now report a 10-year review, which initially suggested a female preponderance in DIS-generated RDC and DSM-III lifetime depressive categories. The presence of sex differences in rates of lifetime depression was influenced by the definition of caseness used and the vantage point from which rates were determined. The longitudinal design and earlier corroborative witness reports established, however, clear evidence of instability in prevalence estimates, together with a sex effect on stability. Men were more likely to 'forget' episodes, while women were more likely to 'remember' episodes that had generally not previously reached 'case' criteria. When correction was made for such artefactual influences, a sex difference in lifetime depression rates was no longer evident. Such findings require review in general community samples, and suggest modifications to 'case' definition in epidemiological enquiries.",Psychological medicine,1994 Feb,England,1994,90
10178583,Willingness to pay for rural health insurance through community participation in India.,"The main objective of this article is to examine the willingness to pay for a viable rural health insurance scheme through community participation in India, and the policy concerns it engenders. The willingness to pay for a rural health insurance scheme through community participation is estimated through a contingent valuation approach (logit model), by using the rural household survey on health from Karnataka State in India. The results show that insurance/saving schemes are popular in rural areas. In fact, people have relatively good knowledge of insurance schemes (especially life insurance) rather than saving schemes. Most of the people stated they are willing to join and pay for the proposed rural health insurance scheme. However, the probability of willingness to join was found to be greater than the probability of willingness to pay. Indeed, socio-economic factors and physical accessibility to quality health services appeared to be significant determinants of willingness to join and pay for such a scheme. The main justification for the willingness to pay for a proposed rural health insurance scheme are attributed from household survey results: (a) the existing government health care provider's services is not quality oriented; (b) is not easily accessible; and, (c) is not cost effective. The discussion suggests that policy makers in India should take serious note of the growing influence of the private sector and people's willingness to pay for organizing a rural health insurance scheme to provide quality and efficient health care in India. Policy interventions in health should not ignore private sector existence and people's willingness to pay for such a scheme and these two factors should be explicitly involved in the health management process. It is also argued that regulatory and supportive policy interventions are inevitable to promote this sector's viable and appropriate development in organizing a health insurance scheme.",The International journal of health planning and management,1998 Jan-Mar,England,1998,90
10390046,The social ecology of syphilis.,"Factors affecting the transmission of syphilis can be categorized into those acting at the level of individuals (e.g., number of sex partners) and others at the level of the sociophysical environment (e.g., availability of treatment services for curable infections). In a prior study, we identified several sociophysical factors correlated with the ten-year mean syphilis rate in a regression analysis of United States counties. In the present study we used qualitative methods to investigate additional aspects of some factors in the regression, as well as to identify entirely new factors. Twelve counties with populations less than 100,000 and ten-year mean syphilis rates that were greater or less than expected by the regression model were selected for a three to five day visit. The case study protocol included observations, unstructured interviews with care providers and county residents, and a standardized questionnaire completed by state and local sexually transmitted disease control personnel pertaining to characteristics and practices of the local health department. Comparisons of the field notes and questionnaires revealed patterns of factors of the sociophysical environment that potentially affect county syphilis rates. These included access to the health department STD clinic, race relations, employment opportunities for minorities, interagency coordination, STD outreach activities, the social acceptability of discussing STDs, and intercommunity dynamics. In addition we noted the disproportionate influence of particular individuals on these factors. Some of the factors identified are readily quantifiable and could enhance the predictive power of multivariable models of county syphilis rates. The hypotheses generated by this study may also lead to a better measurement and understanding of potentially important environmental determinants of community syphilis rates, and the development of new or enhanced prevention strategies.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Apr,England,1999,90

The purpose of this framework is twofold. First, it is designed to emphasize that the professional requirements for future psychiatrists will demand a greater knowledge of the structure and functioning of the brain than is currently available in most training programs. Second, it is designed to illustrate that the unique domain which psychiatry occupies within academic medicine, the analysis of the interaction between social and biological determinants of behavior, can best be studied by also having a full understanding of the biological components of behavior.",The American journal of psychiatry,1998 Apr,United States,1998,90
9031392,Malaria: cost to India and future trends.,"A study of the economic loss due to malaria and its future trends revealed that malaria in India was responsible for economic loss between US$ 0.5 to 1.0 billion annually. The study also brought out that malariogenic potential of the country is increasing, and new malaria paradigms have been established requiring new approaches for its control. Unless this trend is checked losses due to malaria will increase in the coming decades. Effective malaria control requires immediate remedial measures to prevent environmental degradation conductive to vector proliferation; and renewed attack on malaria based on local epidemiological, entomological and social determinants. The first requirement for such an action is a reliable data base, both on the malariometric indices and the causative factors. Research therefore should be intensified to fill the gaps, generate new knowledge, disseminate malaria information as widely as possible and provide training for success in malaria control by the implementation of the global malaria control strategy.",The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,1996 Mar,Thailand,1996,90
10342546,"Social determinants of birthweight, ponderal index and gestational age in Sweden in the 1920s and the 1980s.","This study compared the effect of social class and marital status on birth outcomes in Sweden, using (i) data on all births at the Akademiska Hospital in Uppsala from 1920 to 1924 with socioeconomic information from records at birth; and (ii) a linkage of the Medical Births Registry for all births in Sweden in November/December 1985 to the 1985 Census. Preterm births (<37 weeks) have become less common during the 20th century. Between 1920-24 and 1985, mean and median birthweight increased, as did mean ponderal index, indicating a shift to the right of the birthweight and ponderal index distributions. In 1920-24, birthweight and ponderal index were associated with the social class of the household and with the marital status of the mother. Babies of single mothers were lighter and thinner, and had a much greater probability of being born preterm. In contrast, in 1985, maternal marital status (and cohabitation status) had a weaker effect on birthweight and ponderal index. The importance of household social class for ponderal index and preterm birth changed similarly, but its importance for birthweight remained. The mediating mechanism may have changed. Mothers from farming households now gave birth to the heaviest babies (nearly 200 g heavier than those of unskilled workers). Adjustment for a number of factors, including smoking, had a limited effect on these social class differences. In conclusion, biological processes during the foetal period are systematically linked to the social circumstances of the mother, but in a different way in the 1920s and in 1985.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1999 Apr,Norway,1999,90
9720645,"Socioeconomic factors, perceived control and self-reported health in Russia. A cross-sectional survey.","Russia has the lowest life expectancy among industrialised countries, but little is known about other health outcomes and determinants of health in the Russian population. Here we report a cross-sectional study in a national sample of the Russian population of social and psychosocial determinants of two self-reported health indicators: self-rated health (shown to predict mortality in prospective studies) and physical functioning (validated against more objective health measures). A multi-stage sample of the Russian population aged 18 years and more was interviewed (n=1599, response rate 66%). The questionnaire included political attitudes, social and economic circumstances, psychosocial factors, smoking, alcohol consumption, self-rated health and physical functioning (from the SF36 instrument). Scores of perceived control over life and over one's health were calculated from 6 and 3 questions, respectively. Data were analysed in logistic regression for two dichotomised outcomes: poor self-rated health (worse than average) and low physical functioning (less than 60% of maximum). Overall, 25% of subjects rated their health as worse than average; this is substantially more than in western countries. Perceived control over life was strongly related to both outcomes; age- and sex-adjusted OR for 1 standard deviation increase in control were 0.60 (95% CI 0.52-0.69) for poor self-rated health and 0.67 (0.57-0.81) for low physical functioning. Adjustment for a battery of other factors reduced these estimates only slightly. Associations between control over one's health and both outcomes were also significant, but weaker and attenuated in multivariate models. Material deprivation was also strongly related to both outcomes. Education was inversely related to self-rated health, and unmarried men reported poor physical functioning substantially more often. Subjects not approving the economic changes reported poorer health but this association was removed by adjustment for socioeconomic factors and control. Subjects who could not rely on informal social structures when in problems reported worse health; this effect largely persisted in multivariate analyses. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that poor health status in Russia is related to dysfunction of social structures, socioeconomic deprivation, and lack of perceived control. The absence of informal social networks, vital for maintaining general welfare, seems to affect adversely self-rated health. Deprivation and low perceived control may be important mediators between the broad social environment and health in populations undergoing transition and can provide a useful framework for many biological and behavioural factors. Prospective studies are needed to address the issue of temporality and reporting bias, the major problems in interpreting these findings.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Jul,England,1998,90
9801018,"Prevalence of hearing loss in older adults in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. The Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study.","There are no recent population-based data on the prevalence of hearing loss in older adults using standard audiometric testing. The population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study was designed to measure the prevalence of hearing loss in adults aged 48-92 years, residing in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. Hearing thresholds were measured with standardized protocols using pure-tone air- and bone-conduction audiometry in sound-treated booths. The examination also included an otoscopic evaluation, screening tympanogram, and a questionnaire on hearing-related medical history, noise exposure, other potential risk factors, and self-perceived hearing handicap. Of the 4,541 eligible people, 3,753 (82.6%) participated in the hearing study (1993-1995). The average age of participants was 65.8 years, and 57.7% were women. The prevalence of hearing loss was 45.9%. The odds of hearing loss increased with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.88 for 5 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80-1.97) and were greater for men than women (OR = 4.42, 95% CI 3.73-5.24). The male excess of hearing loss remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, education, noise exposure, and occupation (OR = 3.65). These results demonstrate that hearing loss is a very common problem affecting older adults. Epidemiologic studies are needed to understand the genetic, environmental, and sex-related determinants of age-related hearing loss and to identify potential intervention strategies.",American journal of epidemiology,1998 Nov 1,United States,1998,90
12320574,International migration and the politics of admission and exclusion in postwar Europe.,"""Although nation-states assume territorial, political and cultural boundedness, their boundaries are not uniform barriers, but rather are characterized by varying degrees of openness and closure to international migrants. The manipulation of the permeability of these boundaries constitutes the politics of admission and exclusion.... This paper provides a discussion of the complex economic, political and social forces impinging on the politics of admission and exclusion and an analysis of how these forces have been operating in a particular historical and geographical context to determine the admission of international migrants into national territory and community.... There are signs that the integration of nation-states into regional blocs such as the EC is shifting the politics of admission and exclusion practised by the dominant member countries to the supra-national scale.""",Political geography,1995 Apr,England,1995,90
9465373,[The roles of various media in the decision making processes for recycling behavior: a path analysis model].,"This study researched the effects of cognitive variables on recycling behavior, as well as effects of various media of influence on the cognition and behavior. According to Hirose (1994), the decision making process for recycling consists of two steps. The first leads to goal intention of an ecological lifestyle. The second is related to behavior intention of recycling in line with the goal intention. Mass media, such as newspaper and TV, are thought to influence beliefs about environmental problems, including three determinants of goal intention: perception of seriousness, responsibility, and effectiveness. Personal media, such as personal contacts with pro-environmental activists, are thought to influence evaluation of behavior, including three determinants of behavior intention: evaluation of feasibility, cost and benefits, and social norms. Local media, such as municipal announcement and circular, are hypothesized to have a mixed effect of the two. Path analysis indicated that goal intention affected recycling behavior through behavior intention. Effects of the three media of influence on the cognitive variables were also consistent with the hypothesis.",Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology,1997 Oct,Japan,1997,90
7670898,"Participation in an employee fitness program: determinants of high adherence, low adherence, and dropout.","This article presents the results of a study of the determinants of adherence level in an employee fitness program. Of all 236 employees who started participating in the program the determinants of level of participation (high adherence, low adherence, and dropouts) during the program were studied by means of a pretest and posttest design. The questionnaire was based on different theoretical concepts. The determinants measured included the attitude toward an employee fitness program, self-efficacy expectation, and social support. The results show that there were no differences in determinants between the groups at the start of the program. During the second measurement the high- and low-adherence groups were most convinced of the benefits of participation in the program. The low-adherence group and the dropouts were least convinced of their ability to participate in a fitness program. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,1995 Apr,United States,1995,90
9125369,Integration of coping and social support perspectives: implications for the study of adaptation to chronic diseases.,"In this article, empirical studies dealing with the relationship between coping and social support are discussed in order to identify promising themes for research on adaptation to chronic diseases. Although only few studies deal with this issue explicitly, the review reveals that four ways to study the relationship between coping and social support can be distinguished: (a) seeking social support as a coping strategy; (b) social support as a coping resource; (c) social support as dependent on the way individual patients cope; and (d) coping by a social system. It is argued that all four ways of integrating coping and social support contribute to a better understanding of adaptation to chronic diseases. However, exploring the interrelatedness of both concepts by studying social support as a coping resource and social support as dependent on the patient's own coping behavior appear to be especially fruitful in the short term, as they: (a) provide a better insight in the social determinants of coping, and (b) may help to clarify the way social support affects health and well-being.",Clinical psychology review,1997,United States,1997,90
10357306,"Determinants of counseling in primary care pediatric practice: physician attitudes about time, money, and health issues.","OBJECTIVES: To assess pediatrician goals and practice in preventive counseling, and to use social learning theory to examine physician attitudes about preventive health issues, time, and reimbursement to explain physician counseling behavior. DESIGN: Random sample survey of American Academy of Pediatrics fellows. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1620 pediatricians were surveyed with a return rate of 72%. The 556 pediatricians who had finished training and who currently performed child health supervision were included. METHODS: Pediatricians were asked about their goals in 6 areas of health supervision: biomedical issues, development, behavior, family functioning, safety education, and supportive interpersonal interaction. They were also asked about the prevalence of counseling, importance of specific topics, their self-efficacy, outcome expectation in these areas, and their concerns about time and reimbursement for preventive counseling. RESULTS: Assurance of physical health and normal development were the most important goals of child health supervision among the pediatricians surveyed. Goals involving behavioral, family, and safety issues were less important and less likely to be addressed in practice. Most did not regularly discuss family stress, substance abuse, gun safety, and television. In these areas, physicians had less confidence they could provide guidance and lower expectation that they could prevent problems. Only 17% felt that they receive adequate reimbursement for preventive counseling. Most have adequate time (53%) and receive adequate respect (57%) for their preventive efforts. Physicians who were more concerned about time for preventive counseling reported less overall counseling (r = -0.28, P<.001). Concern about reimbursement was not associated with reported counseling. Multiple regression analysis found that the primary predictors of physician counseling were an issue's importance, a physician's perceived self-efficacy, and perceived effectiveness of counseling, while concerns about time and reimbursement were secondary. CONCLUSIONS: Physician goals in child health supervision were primarily biomedical, with psychosocial and safety issues of lesser importance. Concern about time for preventive counseling was associated with less reported counseling. Physician attitudes regarding the importance of a health issue and their confidence and effectiveness in counseling were more predictive of physician practice than their attitudes about time and reimbursement for preventive care.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,1999 Jun,United States,1999,90
10972304,Determinants of the annual pattern of reproduction in mature male merino and Suffolk sheep: modification of endogenous rhythms by photoperiod.,"In mediterranean environments, pastures are very poor during the autumn and consequently small ruminants, such as sheep, would have been losing body mass for many months so, during mating, gamete production would be depressed in both sexes. Effectively, the nutritive requirements for a photoperiod-driven, annual reproductive cycle are out of phase with seasonal changes in food availability. The problem could be overcome through more flexible timing of reproduction, perhaps explaining variations in seasonality between breeds that originate from differing latitudes. To study these concepts and the mechanisms involved, the endogenous rhythms and responses to photoperiod were compared in rams of 'mediterranean origin' (Merino) and 'temperate origin' (Suffolk). Groups of 16 rams of each breed were given a constant food supply and subjected to 16 months of constant equinoctial photoperiod (12L : 12D) or simulated 'mediterranean' changes in daylength (from 14L : 10D to 14D : 10L). With nutritional and photoperiodic inputs held constant, Merino and Suffolk rams showed similar endogenous rhythms in reproductive activity. Under constant nutritional inputs and a mediterranean photoperiodic cycle, the endogenous rhythms were modified differently in the two breeds, with the Merinos starting and finishing their seasons about 2 months earlier than the Suffolks. These observations partially explain the patterns observed in rams kept under field conditions. It is now necessary to test whether the rhythms of reproduction in these breeds are also modified by changes in nutrition and social cues.","Reproduction, fertility, and development",1999,Australia,1999,90
9894168,Swimming and self-grooming development of pups nursed by neonatally underfed rats.,"Swimming and self-grooming development were analyzed in experimental animals nursed by neonatally underfed dams by a method including the deprivation of both food and sensory cues which provoke long-term altered maternal behavior. Experimental animals obtained from these dams manifested a significant retardation in physical growth, as evidenced by a decrease in body weight and a 1-day delay in ear and eye-opening, as well as a significant delay in swimming ability, escaping from the water and an increase in self-grooming behavior. These alterations of experimental animals may be presumably related with the carelessness in maternal care and altered so-matosensory stimulation given by the neonatally underfed dams to her experimental pups. Data suggest that the poor somatosensory stimulation given by the mother to her pups, the reduced early social interaction or the motivational stage of pups may be important determinants for the development of brain mechanisms underlying reflex activity of the progeny.","Growth, development, and aging : GDA",1998 Autumn,United States,1998,90
9755368,Competence in discourse as a measure of social integration and quality of life in persons with traumatic brain injury.,"Persisting difficulties in communication are a serious handicap faced by many after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a major barrier to community reintegration. Conventional approaches to the study of communication problems after TBI have focused on the form of language production and expression, usually in terms of phonological, semantic, and syntactical features. Most TBI patients, however, perform overall within normal ranges on these conventional indicators. More recently, attention has focused on language in its naturally-occurring form, that is, discourse, which is heavily influenced by linguistic, cognitive and social skills. Because most TBI patients are left with residual deficits in these areas, study of discourse abilities seem to be particularly suited to understanding their problems in communication and facilitating eventual reintegration into the community. This study was designed to determine if and how the conversational discourse of TBI patients differs from a matched non-TBI group and whether any identified variables are related to measures of outcome as measured by community integration and quality of life. Additionally, the study was designed to explore the relationship between TBI and features of discourse across conversational, narrative, procedural genres. TBI patients (n = 30) from an out-patient brain injury programme were compared to matched controls (n = 10) in the three discourse genres. Bivariate and multivariate analyses evaluated 23 measures of discourse efficiency, complexity, topic management, information and pragmatic behaviours in each genre as well as measures of psychosocial adjustment, particularly social integration and quality of life. Results indicated that TBIs were significantly different from controls on several measures of discourse and psychosocial adjustment. A number of other features of discourse were found to correlate significantly with social integration and quality of life. Interestingly, discourse variables appeared to correlate with social integration more strongly than age, gender, education, and other conventional psychosocial factors. Contrary to prediction, features of conversational discourse did not correlate more strongly than other types of discourse with social integration and quality of life. Discussion centred on the apparent comorbidity of features in everyday discourse and psychosocial determinants that were associated with quality of life and social integration.",Brain injury,1998 Sep,England,1998,90
12317659,Motivation and fertility control behaviour in Pakistan.,"Using data from the Population, Labor Force, and Migration (PLM) Survey of 1979-80, this paper examines the component of potential motivation for fertility limitation among Pakistani married women and then determines what factor are important in explaining the contraceptive use differentials among the potentially motivated subgroup of women. The analysis is conducted using logit regression models. The findings show that, among women wanting no additional children, a substantial proportion is reluctant to adopt fertility control behavior, confirming the existence of latent demand for contraception in all strata. A majority of those women report no exposure to the program or no contact with a family planning worker, and a large majority of those who have had exposure or have been contacted do not report contraceptive use, indicating a considerable shortfall of the program. Among the urban women wanting no more children, the important factors affecting contracepting use positively are education (both primary and secondary), household income, living in a nuclear family, exposure to the program, and contact with a family planning worker, for rural women, only nuclear family living and the program factors are significant in promoting contraceptive use. The suggestions likely to increase contraceptive prevalence are, first, to reach those women who have the potential motivation for contraception, and, second, to increase the quality and sources of the motivation efforts of the program to crystallize the latent demand among those who need it.",Pakistan development review,1992 Summer,Pakistan,1992,90

Differences between these two cultures are explored, based on the author's experiences and work in both environments. This comparison includes a number of points of departure. The American culture encourages autonomous and independent behaviors from infants, whereas in the Korean culture, mothers tend to view infants as passive and dependent. American mothering is individually fashioned and relies on the expertise of health care providers. Conversely, the Korean culture is highly ritualistic, so mothering is molded more by societal rules than by individual design, and professional advice is less sought for guidance than is folklore information. American mothers tend to rear their infants in a nuclear family setting, whereas Korean mothers rear their infants in an extended family or at least in a highly social environment.

24264173,Moderating effects of self-esteem on the use of ethnicity and academic standing as determinants of interpersonal acceptance.,"The influence of self-esteem on the use of status considerations as determinants of interpersonal acceptance was studied in a sample of 722 Israeli students from integrated junior high schools. The students completed a self-esteem questionnaire as well as the Interpersonal Relation Assessment Technique, a measure assessing willingness to engage in activities of increasing intimacy with classmates. Data analysis indicated a general preference for targets of higher educational level and high-status ethnic origin. These categorical preferences were more pronounced among high rather than low self-esteem students, irregardless of their own educational standing or ethnic origin. The findings were consistent with the thrust of cost-benefit analyses suggested by social exchange theories, in which self-esteem is viewed as one's globalized perception of social worth. The results suggest that individuals with high self-esteem may be more likely to see themselves as equals to higher status others and seek out their company than would their low self-esteem counterparts. Alternately, those with high self-esteem may be more motivated by social ambition and less by fear of rejection.",Journal of youth and adolescence,1992 Dec,United States,1992,90

8976599,Social determinants of loneliness among older Americans.,"To further understand loneliness among older persons, a conceptual model, predicated on a social-support perspective, was examined. Results were based on 1,071 participants in the congregate and home-delivered meal programs of the Senior Citizens Nutrition and Activities Program in Hillsborough County, Florida. A series of stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that loneliness was greater among men, those with no children, those with no friends, those more physically disabled, those who subjectively felt that their health was poorer, and those who subjectively felt that their economic condition was inadequate. Not related directly to loneliness but with indirect influence were age, race, education, marital status, and poverty status. Those variables with no direct or indirect effect included rural or urban location, identification of emotional closeness with existing children or friends, and living alone. Theoretically, the results do not fully support the social-support perspective but point to the impact of a broad spectrum of demographic, health, economic, and social factors.","Genetic, social, and general psychology monographs",1996 Nov,United States,1996,90
2354684,The determinants of sexuality among adolescent school girls in Kenya.,"One thousand seven hundred and fifty one Secondary school girls aged 12 to 19 years were interviewed by means of a self-administered questionnaire. 416 (23.8%), of them reported to have been sexually experienced at the time of the study. 4.1% of the sexually experienced girls had started sex below the age of 10 years, some of whom had been raped. The low and middle class private schools in the city centre had higher incidence of sexually experienced girls. The same was observed in those girls staying away from their parents. Majority of the sexually experienced girls had started coitus within one to two years of attaining menarche or having a boyfriend. Some of these girls may have been forced to indulge in sex by the men/boys or circumstances. Lack of factual knowledge, parental guidance and lust for material gains are some of the factors the girls felt may be responsible for the upsurge in adolescent sexual behaviour. The role played by these factors in adolescent sexuality is discussed, and possible remedial measures are suggested.",East African medical journal,1990 Mar,Kenya,1990,90
10163955,Is long-term maintenance of health-related physical activity possible? An analysis of concepts and evidence.,"The phenomenon of maintenance of health-related physical activity is explored through an analysis of the underlying concepts and of the existing empirical evidence. The following targets were used for the analysis: (1) the concept of health-related physical activity, (2) the concept of maintenance, (3) common manifestations of maintenance in everyday living, (4) the promotional and behavioral characteristics of health-related physical activity, (5) the known determinants of free-living physical activity, and (6) intervention trials on physical activity in free-living groups. The analyses revealed the inherent resistance to adoption and maintenance of physical activity, particularly that of high-intensity and program-centered activities, the persistence, however, of many simple everyday routines and habits, the multiple determinants discovered for free-living physical activity and a few empirical demonstrations of the successful promotion of the maintenance of physical activity over a year or two. The promotion of the maintenance of health-related physical activity seems thus a distinct possibility provided that (1) the promotional situation is analyzed thoroughly, (2) the activity is chosen carefully with an emphasis on moderation in intensity and integration into the participant's life-style, (3) multiple promotional contacts are used, and (4) support from the participant's social and physical environment is provided. There is a need for more research on the maintenance of health-related physical activity using the stages of change models, behavior modification principles, self-control concepts, the concept of intrinsic motivation and the Relapse model. The method of analysis used here could apply to other health-related behaviors as well.",Health education research,1996 Dec,England,1996,90
1827639,Transmission of symptoms of anxiety and depression in nuclear families.,"Anxiety and depression symptom scores from the SCL-90 questionnaire were observed in a large sample of nuclear families, and the effects of genes or family environment were estimated. Assuming no environmental transmission from parents to offspring, heritability was estimated at 0.43 for both anxiety and depression scores, and common sibling environment or reciprocal sibling influence explained 19% of the variances for both scores. Most of the (genetic or environmental) family effect seemed to be common for the two scores. There was no evidence of common determinants in the family for the symptom scores and alcohol consumption, not even of any substantial relationship within persons between symptoms and consumption. The spouse correlations were 0.25 for anxiety and 0.38 for depression. Similar values for the correlations between anxiety in one person and depression in his/her spouse implies a mate selection based on a single latent variable to which the two observed traits contribute.",Journal of affective disorders,1991 Feb,Netherlands,1991,90

Mortality rates by race and birthplace were compared for all causes of death and for specific causes. Although overall death rates for blacks generally exceeded those for whites (1224.8 per 100,000 inhabitants vs. 721.4 for males and 593.7 vs. 393.1 for females), foreign-born blacks had death rates (664.6 for males and 350.2 for females) slightly lower than those for whites. The most striking variation among blacks was among those aged 25 to 64 years. US-born black males were three times as likely (1588.9 vs. 525.2) and US-born black females were more than 2.5 times as likely (673.5 vs. 263.4) to die as were foreign-born blacks. Among US-born blacks AIDS, homicide, and cancer for males and AIDS, heart disease, and cancer for females were the most important determinants of excess deaths, defined as the difference between observed deaths and expected deaths; these causes of death account for about half of the excess deaths for each sex. Among whites natives generally had higher death rates than migrants, but less prominently and consistently so than for blacks. Excess mortality of blacks is largely explained by higher death rates of US-born compared with foreign-born Americans.",Human biology,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90
9785693,Trust me: technical and institutional determinants of health maintenance organizations shifting risk to physicians.,"This paper examines the factors that influence a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) to shift risk to doctors through an incentive arrangement called capitation, where physicians are paid a fixed amount per patient for a period of time for any and all medical services required by the patient. Multispecialty-medical-group (Group) HMOs are more likely to shift risk than Independent Physician Associations (IPA) HMOs. Within IPA HMOs, larger enrollment per physician is positively associated with more risk shifting. We find that institutional factors signaling legitimacy play an important role in determining risk shifting. For-profit HMOs are less likely to shift risk, which we interpret as reflecting consumer distrust of for-profit HMOs. However, for-profit HMOs that are federally qualified, which we interpret as a signal of legitimacy, are more likely to shift risk.",Journal of health and social behavior,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90

The peak season, November-February, coincided with the period of cool temperatures and the Bedouin Arab cultural seasons of winter and spring. This pattern is different from those of Jewish and Christian groups in the same region, a difference not attributable to religion alone. Sociodemographic factors associated with the peak season of birth include traditional occupations of fathers, multiparae 2+, and traditional place of residence.

DESIGN: Community coronary event register from 1985 to 1991. SETTING: City of Glasgow north of the River Clyde, population 196,000. SUBJECTS: 3991 men and 1551 women aged 25-64 years on the Glasgow MONICA coronary event register with definite or fatal possible or unclassifiable events according to the criteria of the World Health Organisation's MONICA project (monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of coronary events; proportion of subjects reaching hospital alive; case fatality in admitted patients and in community overall. RESULTS: Event rates increased with age for both sexes and were greater in men than women at all ages. The rate increased 1.7-fold in men and 2.4-fold in women from the least (Q1) to the most (Q4) deprived socioeconomic quarter. The socioeconomic gradient decreased with age and was steeper for women than men. The proportion treated in hospital (66%) decreased with age, was greater in women than men, and decreased in both sexes with increasing deprivation (age standardised odds ratio 0.82 for Q4 v Q1) Case fatality in hospital (20%) increased with age, was greater for women than men when age was standardised, and showed no strong socioeconomic pattern. Overall case fatality in the community (50%) increased with age, was similar between the sexes, and increased from Q1 to Q4 (age standardised odds ratio 1.12 in men, 1.18 in women). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic group affects not only death rates from myocardial infarction but also event rates and chance of admission. This should be taken into account when different groups of patients are compared. Because social deprivation is associated with so many more deaths outside hospital, primary and secondary prevention are more likely than acute hospital care to reduce the socioeconomic variation in mortality.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1997 Feb 22,England,1997,90

The main determinants of DDT metabolites were maternal age, lifetime lactation, history of living in an agricultural area, and consumption of salted meat and fish. We estimated that 6.0% of the breast-fed babies had daily intakes of DDT above the level of 0.005 mg/kg d recommended by the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (WHO/FAO).

8463634,Determinants of social support among gay men: the context of AIDS.,"In this study, the determinants of social support are examined among a probability sample of gay men residing in San Francisco. Using two waves of data (collected in 1985 and 1987), cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses focused on the effects of five sets of factors (demographic, community integration/network, AIDS-related loss, individual, and health) on satisfaction with three types of support (emotional, informational, and practical). Personal acceptance of one's gay identity and talking to family members about AIDS showed the strongest positive associations with concurrent measures of support and changes in support satisfaction over the two-year period. Conversely, depression and number of HIV symptoms were negatively associated with cross-sectional support and support changes. Family knowledge of respondents' homosexuality interacted with HIV symptoms, such that knowledge was negatively associated with support among those experiencing greater numbers of HIV symptoms. Findings suggest that those most in need of support may be the least satisfied with the support they receive. Family appear to have the potential to be particularly helpful or especially harmful to gay men trying to cope with the AIDS crisis.",Journal of health and social behavior,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90

METHODS: A total of 1795 mother-child dyads from the 1992 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were selected for analyses. Measures of adolescents cigarette smoking and family, individual, peer, and sociodemographic risk factors were analyzed. RESULTS: White youths reported the highest rates of lifetime, current, and persistent smoking, and initiated smoking at a significantly earlier age than African-Americans and Hispanics. Except for maternal cigarette smoking and substance use, African-Americans and Hispanics experienced a disproportionately larger number of purported risk factors than whites. Multivariate analyses revealed common and ethnic-specific correlates of adolescent lifetime and current smoking, with many more significant associations among whites than minorities. Common correlates included youth's age across all three ethnic groups, problem behaviors and delinquency among whites and African-Americans, and perceived peer pressure to smoke among whites and Hispanics. Ethnic-specific correlates included maternal smoking, maternal cocaine use, low maternal religiosity, and negative scholastic attitudes, which increased smoking for whites; and positive parenting, which reduced smoking for African-Americans. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of effects of maternal smoking and perceived peer pressure to smoke on African-American adolescents compared with whites suggests that role modeling and interpersonal influence may be more important determinants of smoking for white than African-American adolescents. The differential impact of family and peer factors on the smoking of adolescents of different ethnicity warrants further investigation.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90

The differential impact of family and peer factors on the smoking of adolescents of different ethnicity warrants further investigation.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90
9530898,Gender-related correlates and predictors of consistent condom use among young adult African-American women: a prospective analysis.,"The present study examined the correlates of consistent condom use among African-American women and prospectively evaluated the stability of these significant variables to predict consistent condom use at 3-month follow-up. A sample of 128 African-American women, 18-29 years of age completed a baseline interview and 3 months later completed a similar follow-up interview (n = 100). Compared to women who were inconsistent condom users, women who were consistent condom users were more likely to: have high assertive communication skills (OR=13), desire not becoming pregnant (OR=8.6), have high sexual self-control over condom use (OR=7.6), perceive having control over their partners' use of condoms (OR=6.6), be younger (OR=5.8), and report having a partner that was not committed to the relationship (OR=3.3). Prospective analyses identified baseline level of condom use as the best predictor of condom use at 3-month follow-up. Women who were consistent condom users at baseline were 6.3 times as likely to be consistent condom users at 3-month follow-up. In conclusion, HIV prevention programmes for women need to be gender specific and need to be implemented before high-risk behaviours are established and may be more difficult to modify.",International journal of STD & AIDS,1998 Mar,England,1998,90
1289087,Height: a risk marker for ischaemic heart disease: prospective results from the Caerphilly and Speedwell Heart Disease Studies.,"The predictive power of height for future ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was examined in 4860 men from two communities in South Wales and the West of England. At follow-up, men in the shortest fifth of the height distribution had experienced twice as many incident IHD events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction) as was the case for men from the tallest fifth. Adjustment for age, social class and smoking habit failed to alter these relationships significantly. In the data from South Wales, determinants of height were examined; birth rank and number of siblings showed a trend with height. This trend was found only in men whose fathers were manual workers and may be related to inadequate nutrition in the higher birth ranks and larger families. These results support the suggestion that early childhood factors may be relevant to IHD in middle age and possible mechanisms are discussed.",European heart journal,1992 Dec,England,1992,90
7728557,Mass childhood immunization: some ethical doubts for primary health care workers.,"The mass childhood immunization programme has traditionally been viewed as a safe and effective preventative measure by health promoters, primary health care professionals and governments. This consensus has meant that immunization has rarely been viewed as ethically problematic. A number of recent changes in the context of the delivery of health care, particularly the emphasis on consumerism and the effect of the marketization of services, makes timely an examination of ethical, social and political issues. This article examines four main grounds for problematizing the mass childhood immunization programme. These are: clinical research evidence about the safety and efficacy of vaccines; the masking of wider social and political determinants of ill health; the contradictory strictures about collective and individual rights in relation to immunization; and the uniqueness of childhood immunization as a physical intrusion into a healthy body. The implications of these ethical issues are discussed in relation to informed consent and the need for a 'greenfield' review that includes the views of dissenting parents, lawyers and moral philosophers, as well as health professionals.",Nursing ethics,1995 Mar,England,1995,90

As an assessment of progress in current public health efforts, we address the five major issues in public health for the 1990s raised by Breslow (8): reconstruction of public health; setting objectives for public health; from disease control to health promotion; determinants of health and health policy; continuing social inequities and their impacts on health; and the health implications of accelerating developments in technology. Finally, we look to the twenty-first century and provide five clear paths necessary to strengthen the capacity of public health agencies to protect and improve the health status of the population.",Annual review of public health,1997,United States,1997,90
9176658,Determinants of self-assessed gingival health among adolescents.,"The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to assess the extent of agreement between clinical and self-assessed gingival health and to investigate possible factors associated with the amount of self-assessed gingival bleeding. A study group comprising students enrolled in grade 7 or 8 in Helsinki, Finland (n = 172), performed a self-assessment based on two tests: the amount of bleeding after toothbrushing and after interproximal tooth cleaning with toothpicks. Clinical examinations based on bleeding on probing (BOP%) were carried out by four local community dentists. The highest observed kappa value was 0.43 for the agreement between BOP% and self-assessment when tested with different cut-off points of diagnosis. Multivariate analysis showed that clinical status and toothbrushing frequency were statistically significantly associated with self-assessed gingival bleeding in both tests. Socioeconomic status and locus of control orientation were also statistically significant factors in the toothpick test. In conclusion, the validity of self-assessment of bleeding was sufficient for monitoring adolescents' gingival health in groups. Self-assessed bleeding was explained by the same factors that were associated with clinical gingival health status.",Acta odontologica Scandinavica,1997 Apr,England,1997,90
10933632,Variables independently associated with self-reported obesity in the European Union.,"OBJECTIVE: The rapid increase in obesity rates over recent years suggest that cultural and societal influences are affecting the adjustment in the energy balance equation in addition to other physiopathological or genetic determinants. Therefore, a pan-EU study was carried out to explore the influence of sociodemographic factors as well as some attitudes (smoking and exercise) on the prevalence of obesity in the adult population of all 15 member states of the EU. DESIGN: Overall, a sample of 15,239 individuals aged 15 years and upwards in the EU completed the questionnaire. Subject selection was quota-controlled to make the sample nationally representative following a multistage stratified cluster sampling. Self-reported height and weight were used to calculate body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: From the EU average results, it can be seen that only about half of the EU population (48%) is within the normal weight range, while the obesity (BMI > or = 30 kg m(-2)) prevalence was about 10% in the EU and the overweight prevalence was 36.6% and 25.6% among men and women, respectively. UK subjects had the highest prevalence of obesity (12%), while Italians, French and Swedes had the lowest levels of obesity (about 7%). Concerning age and social class interactions, logistic regression analysis showed that high social class and younger individuals in all groups had a lower odds ratio for obesity prevalence. People with a higher level of education are less likely to be obese, while the interaction between educational levels and obesity was different for men and women. A low participation in various leisure-time physical activities, the lack of interest (precontemplation) in being involved in exercise/physical activity and the increasing number of hours sitting down at work appear to be predictors of obesity. Single individuals were less prone to become obese than couples or widowed/divorced people. Finally, smoking status was statistically linked to the prevalence of obesity, since non-smokers or ex-smokers for more than 1 year presented a higher tendency for a BMI > 30. CONCLUSIONS: This survey confirms that a priority area for health intervention aimed at preventing the development of obesity should be to increase levels of physical activity, although the approach will depend on the population, especially with respect to educational and socioeconomic aspects.",Public health nutrition,1999 Mar,England,1999,90
9176910,Physicians' view of their work environment and organisation.,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess physicians' perception of their work, organisation and professional development. METHODS: All major disciplines at a major regional hospital were studied. Participants responded to a structured questionnaire concerning broad aspects of physicians' work. The response rate was approximately 78%, with 356 respondents. RESULTS: The results show that even though physicians are overall very satisfied with their work, they list high workload, lack of influence on daily work and work processes as dissatisfactory. Skills utilisation and development are some major areas for improvement. Physicians that were aware of the overall mission statement for their hospital were more satisfied with and informed about departmental goals. Perceived organisational efficiency and leadership qualities were important determinants of perceived workload and work climate. CONCLUSIONS: Stress among physicians is a growing occupational health concern, impacting negatively on patient care. In this article important individual and organisational factors related to physician stress are identified and suggestions to assess stress and intervene are provided.",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,1997,Switzerland,1997,90

1861614,Determinants of spatial priming in environmental memory.,"Spatial priming in recognizing objects in experimentally learned environments has been proposed as strong evidence for spatial organization of environmental memory. However, in all studies showing recognition priming effects, encoding and rehearsal contiguity may have coincided with spatial proximity, and thus priming may have been due to temporal associations formed during rehearsal, not encoded spatial relations per se. We investigated this question in four experiments, using a trip trial learning method in which temporal contiguity and spatial relations were independent. In Experiment 1, no spatial priming in recognition was found, even though indirect evidence suggested that subjects had encoded spatial relations. In Experiment 2, the trip trial method was compared with the free study procedure commonly used in previous priming studies. Spatial priming occurred only for free study subjects, even though the two groups were equivalent on direct measures of encoding accuracy. In Experiment 3, spatial priming in recognition was obtained with a modification of the trip trial method in which temporal and spatial contiguity were deliberately confounded. In Experiment 4, the unmodified trip trial method produced spatial priming in a location-decision task. Taken together, our results suggest that environmental memory may be spatially organized, but retrieval of object identities does not necessarily activate encoded spatial relations.",Memory & cognition,1991 May,United States,1991,90
10428192,Social and psychological characteristics of elderly visually handicapped patients with the Charles Bonnet Syndrome.,"The Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is characterized by the presence of complex visual hallucinations in psychologically normal people. The syndrome occurs predominantly in the visually handicapped elderly. Little is known about its etiology and pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to examine the associations of CBS with psychological and social determinants. All subjects were patients older than 64 years from a low-vision unit. Using a case-control approach, 50 patients with CBS and 80 patients without visual hallucinations were interviewed about their educational level, social circumstances, number of social contacts, and ability to cope with visual handicap. Loneliness was measured with the De Jong-Gierveld-Kamphuis loneliness scale, and personality traits were examined with the Dutch-language short version of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ([MMPI] Nederlandse Verkorte MMPI [NVM]). Compared with the control group, significantly more CBS patients were lonely. Mean scores on the NVM shyness scale and extraversion scale were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in CBS patients. In multiple logistic regression analysis for the three determinants simultaneously, loneliness and low extraversion were significant predictors for CBS, but shyness was not. It is concluded that loneliness, low extraversion, and shyness are risk indicators for CBS in elderly visually handicapped people. The findings suggest that CBS is associated with a low quality of social contacts.",Comprehensive psychiatry,1999 Jul-Aug,United States,1999,90
8222993,Global epidemiology.,"Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in human populations. Epidemiology on a global scale is severely constrained by the lack of data. In many countries, there are no comprehensive data on mortality or basic demographic data. Where data are available, findings on the relationship of environment to health across countries need to be interpreted with caution. For example, there is well-known variation in standards of medical practice and diagnosis, and in certification and coding, but there are also large differences in diet, the social environment and lifestyle--all of which strongly predict disease incidence. Inappropriate inference concerning aetiology made from such broad-scale studies may result in what has been termed the 'ecological fallacy'. A complementary approach is to collect and analyse data in standardized fashion as part of international collaborative studies. These can offer some important advantages over the more conventional single-centre design. Recent advances have meant that studies of environment and health can now--in some countries--be carried out using routine data at the small area level. Although problems of interpretation remain, they are generally less severe than in broad-scale studies. Examples of this approach are given.",Ciba Foundation symposium,1993,Netherlands,1993,90

7643728,[Clinical course and social outcome in schizophrenia. Results from a retrospective study].,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to investigate the possible clinical and symptomatological determinants of social outcome in schizophrenic patients. METHOD: 40 schizophrenic patients (DSMIII-R), 21 males and 19 females, mean age 4 +/- 5 years, have been evaluated in the present retrospective study. All of them had first undergone psychiatric hospitalization between 1978 and 1981. The following data have been collected: socio-anagraphic features and course of the illness (AMDP), contacts with community health centre and pharmacological compliance. Social disability has been investigated by means of a semi-structured interview developed from the ""Disability Assessment Schedule"" named ""Accertamento Disabilita e Carico Familiare"" (ADC), which has been administered to the main carer, usually a cohabitant relative. Presence and level of social support have also been evaluated. One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), ""t"" test with Bonferroni correction and Pearson Correlation test have been used for data analysis. RESULTS: Patients with less severe social disability (lower scores at ADC) were mainly those with recurrent course of illness without residual symptoms or remitted ones (p = 0.0001), better pharmacological compliance (p = 0.004), more frequent and regular contacts with community health centres (p = 0.0001) and better social support (p = 0.01). On the contrary, score at ADC resulted positively correlated with number of hospitalizations (r = 0.57, p = 0.01), number of compulsory admission (r = 0.32, p = 0.01) and length of illness (r = 0.40, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Although in our study the influence of severity of illness on social disability has been confirmed, suggestive evidence about importance of other factors, such as compliance or social support, may be drawn.",Minerva psichiatrica,1995 Mar,Italy,1995,90

10220021,Gender differences in structural and behavioral determinants of health: an analysis of the social production of health.,"This paper explores aspects of the social production of health by focussing on the ways in which levels of health are shaped by structures of social inequality and behaviors or 'lifestyles'. We address two questions: What is the relative importance of the social, structural and behavioral determinants of health? And, are there gender differences in the determinants of health? These questions are explored using multiple regression analyses of data from the 1994 Canadian National Population Health Survey. Two measures of health are used: subjective health status and the Health Utilities Index (a measure of functional health status). By structural determinants we refer to age, family structure, main activity, education, occupation, income and social support. Behavioral determinants include lifestyle factors related to smoking, drinking, weight and physical activity. Findings indicate that the structures of social inequality are the most important determinants of health acting both independently and through their influence on the behavioral determinants of health. There are very real differences in the factors that predict women's and men's health. For women, social structural factors appear to play a more important role in determining health. Being in the highest income category, working full-time and caring for a family and having social support are more important predictors of good health for women than men. Smoking and alcohol consumption are more important determinants of health status for men than women, while body weight and being physically inactive are more important for women than men. Our findings suggest the value of models which include a wide range of structural and behavioral variables and affirm the importance of looking more closely at gender differences in the determinants of health.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 May,England,1999,90
10924027,Does social medicine still matter in an era of molecular medicine?,"To ask whether social medicine still matters may seem to be in poor taste at a symposium to honor Martin Cherkasky, but social medicine has always had the courage to take on difficult questions. There is all the more reason to do so when its legitimacy is challenged. The extraordinary findings emerging from the human genome project will revolutionize diagnostic and therapeutic methods in medicine. The power of medical interventions, for good and for harm, will increase enormously. However, in the next millennium, as in this one, social factors will continue to be decisive for health status. The distribution of health and disease in human populations reflects where people live, what they eat, the work they do, the air and the water they consume, their activity, their interconnectedness with others, and the status they occupy in the social order. Virchow's aphorism is as true today as it was in 1848: ""If disease is an expression of individual life under unfavorable conditions, then epidemics must be indicative of mass disturbances of mass life."" Increasing longevity resulting from major economic transformations has made ours the age of chronic disease. Changes in diet and behavior transform genes that once conferred selective biologic advantage into health hazards. Although disease risk varies with social status, medical care makes an important difference for health outcomes. Access to care and the quality of care received are functions of social organization, the way care is financed, and political beliefs about the ""deserving"" and the ""underserving"" poor. It is a moral indictment of the US that ours is the only industrialized society without universal health care coverage. In educating the American public about the social determinants of health, a goal Martin Cherkasky championed, the very power of the new molecular biology will help make our case. Social medicine is alive and well.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,1999 Jun,United States,1999,90
7481601,Behavioral determinants of mothers' safety measures to prevent injuries of pre-school children.,"Home-related injuries are a major threat to pre-school children in the western world. In this study the behavioral determinants of 18 parental safety measures were assessed. To select behavioral determinants, the Attitude-Social influence-Self-efficacy/barriers model was used with the inclusion of variables from the Health Belief Model and the Protection Motivation Theory. A written questionnaire was completed by 1129 Dutch mothers of pre-school children. Most safety measures were explained (rather) well by the same set of determinants. Main determinants for adopting or not adopting a safety measure were the mother's belief in the necessity of the safety measure according to the child's age, her belief about her partner's opinion on the necessity and her belief about the success of taking the measure. Subsequent important determinants were the mother's belief about the inconvenience and instrumentality of the safety measure; the perceived susceptibility had a minor or moderate influence on most measures. This study did not indicate that more highly educated mothers were more knowledgeable about safety-related subjects. The theoretical implications of this study are discussed.",Scandinavian journal of psychology,1995 Sep,England,1995,90
8510469,An introduction to herbal pharmacoepidemiology.,"Herbal pharmacoepidemiology concerns itself with herbal drug uses and effects in large numbers of people. This new methodology can make substantial contributions to our understanding of herbal drug markets. Not only can it improve the timely detection and the quantitation of adverse reactions to botanical medicines, it can also help us to recognize beneficial effects of herbal preparations. Moreover, it can increase our social and economic knowledge about herbal drugs by correlating the utilization patterns of these preparations to socially relevant determinants and prices. Since such studies may require an internationally accepted herbal drug classification, a special set of herbal classification codes is proposed, which is fully compatible with the so-called ATC-classification. This latter system is endorsed by the Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organization as the drug classification to be used in international pharmacoepidemiological studies.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,1993 Mar,Ireland,1993,90
9629105,"Mercury levels in the Cree population of James Bay, Quebec, from 1988 to 1993/94.","BACKGROUND: High levels of mercury in the Cree population of James Bay, Que., have been a cause of concern for several years. This study examines changes in mercury levels within the Cree population between 1988 and 1993/94 and identifies potential determinants of high mercury levels. METHODS: Data on mercury levels among the Cree were obtained through a surveillance program undertaken by the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay. In 1988 and again in 1993/94 surveys were carried out in all 9 Cree communities of northern Quebec. Hair samples were obtained and analysed for mercury content. Analyses were carried out to determine the proportion of people who had mercury levels in excess of established norms. Changes in mercury levels between 1988 and 1993/94 and determinants of high levels were estimated by means of regression methods. RESULTS: The proportion of the Cree population with mercury levels in excess of 15.0 mg/kg declined from 14.2% in 1988 to 2.7% in 1993/94. Wide variations in mercury levels were observed between communities: 0.6% and 8.3% of the Eastmain and Whapmagoostui communities respectively had mercury levels of 15.0 mg/kg or greater in 1993/94. Logistic regression analyses showed that significantly higher levels of mercury were independently associated with male sex, increasing age and trapper status. There was a correlation between the mercury level of the head of the household and that of the spouse. INTERPRETATION: Mercury levels in the Cree of James Bay have decreased in the recent past. Nevertheless, this decrease in mercury levels may not be permanent and does not necessarily imply that the issue is definitively resolved.",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,1998 Jun 2,Canada,1998,90
10459890,The effect on morbidity of variability in deprivation and population stability in England and Wales: an investigation at small-area level.,"We seek to determine whether variability in deprivation at small area level, and population stability, influence standardised morbidity ratios in England and Wales. A regression analysis was conducted with data from the 1991 British Census, in order to explain variation in morbidity. Both an area deprivation score (for electoral wards) and the within-area variability of deprivation scores were examined as possible determinants of morbidity (self-reported, limiting, long-term illness). Particular attention was focused on a spatially-sensitive measure of the variability of deprivation scores within a wider 'locality'. There was a significant, positive relationship between age-standardised limiting, long-term illness and deprivation. The variation in area deprivation scores within the small areas themselves was also significant and positive. However, the variation in deprivation scores calculated for both an electoral ward and its contiguous neighbours (the locality) was slightly more significant. Areas with higher relative levels of in-migration also had significantly lower standardised morbidity ratios. Multivariate models showed that the deprivation score, the variation in deprivation scores for the broader locality, and the measure of migration, were all significant in combination. Residual analysis showed that many areas in London had lower levels of morbidity than expected, while electoral wards in the coal mining valleys of South Wales had higher levels than expected. We conclude that, for small areas (wards) in England and Wales, morbidity is related to deprivation, variation in deprivation within and surrounding each area, and the proportion of the population that are migrants. Variations in deprivation influence standardised morbidity rates, and policies which widen inequalities will influence health outcomes. Resource allocation based simply on measures of deprivation, which ignore population change within the area and variations in deprivation in the locality, may be inefficient.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Sep,England,1999,90
21544449,Predictors of the interval between onset of symptoms and first medical visit in patients with digestive tract cancer.,"Lack of effective population screening programmes for digestive tract cancer makes a prompt diagnosis of symptomatic patients the primary option for early detection. The objective of the study was to analyze the characteristics and determinants of the interval between the first medical symptom and the first medical visit (ISV) in a sample of symptomatic patients of mid-low socioeconomic level admitted to hospital for a digestive tract cancer. During two years, 183 patients were personally interviewed with a structured questionnaire designed to elicit initial symptoms of digestive cancer. Fifty-seven percent consulted a physician during the first month after onset of symptoms, and over two-thirds did so within the first 2 months, but it took more than 3 months for 22.4% of the patients. In univariate analyses, the ISV was longer among patients illiterate, unemployed and in the lower social classes. The interval was also significantly longer when the physician-interviewer judged that the patient did not correctly identify the first symptom (p<0.05). In multivariate analyses, the chance of a longer ISV was 2.8 times higher in men; 16 times higher in unemployed patients; 9 times higher in patients with a first symptom of the lower digestive tract; and it increased 8-fold in subjects who attributed no importance to the first manifestation (all p<0.05). In spite of virtually universal health coverage, social factors seemed to act as barriers to seeking medical help in a subgroup of patients. Their procrastination was also related to the nature of the initial symptoms. Achieving an early clinical detection of digestive cancers may be difficult in some segments of the population, and may require substantial improvements in access to and the efficiency of the health system.",International journal of oncology,1996 May,Greece,1996,90

The paper uses data from a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in June 1993. Respondents were asked whether they would like to see the level of immigration to the United States increased, decreased or kept the same. We test several hypotheses about factors influencing respondents' attitudes, including the importance of previously unexamined predictors. These new hypotheses relate to views about the health of the U.S. economy, feelings of social and political alienation, and isolationist sentiments concerning international economic issues and foreign relations. One important discovery is the close connection between possessing restrictionist immigration attitudes and having an isolationist perspective along a broader array of international issues.""",The International migration review,1996 Summer,United States,1996,90
9224450,Transitions in chronic low back pain in Japanese older adults: a sociomedical perspective.,"This study examines the patterns and determinants of chronic low back pain over a three-year period among older adults in Japan. We tested our model based on a sociomedical perspective, using a two-wave national probability sample survey of persons aged 60 and older (N = 2,200) conducted in 1987 and 1990 in Japan. At baseline, the prevalence of chronic low back pain was 18 percent. Among those who were free of back pain at baseline, the probabilities of onset, death, and nonresponse were 13 percent, 7 percent, and 10 percent. Among those who had back pain at baseline, the probabilities of recovery, death, and nonresponse were 43 percent, 8 percent, and 9 percent, respectively. Our multinomial logistic regression analysis supports our thesis that societal factors (age, gender, education, and social relationships) affect transitions in chronic back pain not only directly, but also indirectly through mediating health and health behavior factors. The results suggest that social relationships have both favorable and unfavorable effects on chronic low back pain.","The journals of gerontology.

7551771,Determinants of perceived consistency: the relationship between group entitativity and the meaningfulness of categories.,"The concept of entitativity was developed by Campbell (1958) to refer to the extent to which a group is perceived as a coherent whole or entity. This concept is relevant to research in both social perception (e.g. the categorization effects approach to the study of social stereotyping) and social influence (e.g. the consistency attributed to minority groups in theories of minority influence). On the basis of previous research, four variables were expected to play a role in group entitativity judgements. These were intra-group variability, group size, diversity (or variety) and extremity. In two empirical studies it was found that entitativity decreased as variability and diversity increased and that it increased with group size. These effects and interactions between group size and extremity, size and diversity, and variability and extremity are consistent with the idea that entitativity is a function of how meaningful a stimulus pattern is. This is in turn (in part) a function of how unlikely the pattern is.",The British journal of social psychology,1995 Sep,England,1995,90

Using both demographic and anthropological methods, the research was conducted to specifically examine the process and mechanisms whereby a link is established between child mortality and its covariates. Controlling for the socioeconomic status as a determinant of child mortality, the study population was limited to a lower income stratum living in a homogeneous environment where all households had equal access to health-related and other facilities. Results of the proportional hazards model analysis on 1301 index children suggest that non-economic factors like maternal health-seeking behavior were related to high child mortality. The cultural norm of bearing a large number of children was the most significant correlate. In order of significance, this was followed by contraceptive use, current age of the mother, age at marriage, and the hygienic conditions of the household. The study provides strong evidence of familial clustering of mortality by order of the household.",Pakistan development review,1999 Spring,Pakistan,1999,90
2342984,"Attitudes, subjective norms, and behavioral intentions of nurses toward dying patients and their families.","This investigation aimed to develop and validate an instrument, ""Attitudes, Subjective Norms, and Behavioral Intentions of Nurses Toward the Care of Dying Patients and Their Families"" (ASBID), and to examine the relationship among selected demographic variables, death anxiety, and social desirability response tendency on the behavioral intentions of nurses toward the dying. The Ajzen-Fishbein theory of reasoned action was used as the conceptual framework. Nursing behaviors toward the dying included in the ASBID were developed from interviews with bereaved family members. Three hundred seventy-two registered nurses caring for dying patients were used as the sample population for testing the ASBID. Internal consistency reliability coefficients for the ASBID achieved satisfactory standards. Factor analysis suggested three factors were being measured: general acute care measures for the dying, open communication with the dying, and continuing care for bereaved family members. Results supported the Ajzen-Fishbein theory that attitudes and subjective norms were major determinants of intentions. Findings indicate that educational programs planned to influence nursing care of the dying should focus on the consequences of specific behaviors of nurses rather than on death anxiety in nurses, and they should include nursing supervisors as well as nurses providing direct care for the dying.",Oncology nursing forum,1990 May-Jun,United States,1990,90
9160150,Health information-seeking behavior and older African American women.,"This study explored the ways in which urban, older, African American women obtain health information and some of the factors that influence such activity. Among the possible determinants examined were self-perceived literacy, access to health information, and mobility. The findings suggest that respondents receive health information from their physicians, the mass media, and members of their social networks. The results of this research also indicated that members of this population have a highly positive perception of the public library, although only a small segment use the library regularly, and that it may be in the interest of the library to investigate the role it could play in providing health information to older adults.",Bulletin of the Medical Library Association,1997 Apr,United States,1997,90
9881127,Interacting factors affecting illegitimacy in preindustrial northern England.,"Illegitimacy in a historic, single community at Penrith, Cumbria (1557-1812), has been studied using aggregative analysis, family reconstitution and time series analysis. This population was living under extreme conditions of hardship. Long, medium and short wavelength cycles in the rate of illegitimacy have been identified by time series analysis; each represents a different response to social and economic pressures. In a complex interaction of events, the peaks of the cycles in wheat prices were associated with rises in adult mortality which promoted an influx of migrants and a concomitant rise in illegitimacy. The association between immigration and illegitimacy was particularly noticeable after the mortality crises of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Children of immigrant families also tended to produce illegitimate offspring. Native and immigrant families responded differently to extrinsic fluctuations, and variations in their reproductive behaviour were probably related to access to resources.",Journal of biosocial science,1997 Apr,England,1997,90

Asymmetric procreation behaviour of this kind is modelled by assuming that a female's procreation ceases only after at least one son or n daughters are born. It is shown that such asymmetric procreation behaviour has no effect on the sex ratio of the society, but influences rather the growth rate of the population. Finally, problems concerning the interrelationship between the sex ratio, the pattern of procreation, and the marriage regime in stationary populations are investigated.""",Journal of population economics,1995 May,Germany,1995,90
2295384,Psychosocial factors are associated with health care seeking rather than diagnosis in irritable bowel syndrome.,"The objective of this prospective study was to test the hypothesis that 6 reportedly important psychosocial factors were useful criteria for diagnosing the irritable bowel syndrome. Ninety-seven new patients with entry complaints of abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, or both underwent full evaluation by board-certified or -eligible gastroenterologists in an outpatient setting. The independent measures were 6 questionnaires concerning anxiety, depression, stress, lack of social support, somatization, and abnormal illness behavior. The dependent measure, irritable bowel syndrome, was defined as the absence of an organic disease explanation for patients' entry complaints. Two other board-certified gastroenterologists, independent of the study, made this determination. Their rating was based on full review of transcripts of patients' clinic visits, laboratory data, and the results of a 9-mo telephone follow-up to patients and their physicians. Sixty-five percent of the sample had no organic disease explanation for the entry symptoms, thereby representing irritable bowel syndrome. The psychosocial predictors did not show a significant association with irritable bowel syndrome; the power of the study was 0.86. Post hoc analysis revealed that patients with organic disease, as well as patients with irritable bowel syndrome, had significantly more (p less than 0.01) psychosocial abnormality than normal subjects, which likely contributed to the inability of the psychosocial predictors to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease. It was concluded that psychosocial criteria were of limited value in differentiating irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease but that they were determinants of health care seeking for the entire study group.",Gastroenterology,1990 Feb,United States,1990,90

Bimanual feeding was defined as the active use of one hand for feeding with the opposite hand holding other food items. In terms of strength of hand preference, adults were more lateralized than sub-adults. Additionally, mother-reared chimpanzees were more lateralized than nursery-reared chimpanzees. The number of subjects with no hand preference was more prevalent in sub-adults compared with young and older adults. Of those subjects with a significant hand preference, a larger proportion exhibited a right-hand preference. These results are discussed in relation to previous reports of handedness and bimanual feeding in gorillas and bonobos.",Developmental psychobiology,1994 Sep,United States,1994,90
1633376,"Pain-specific beliefs, perceived symptom severity, and adjustment to chronic pain.","Cognitive theories of appraisal argue for the importance of beliefs as determinants of adjustment to stress. The current investigation sought to examine the relation between beliefs about chronic pain and adjustment in a group of chronic pain patients. Patients' belief in themselves as disabled was found to be inversely related to activity level for patients reporting low and medium levels of pain severity. This same belief correlated with professional services utilization and was negatively related to psychological functioning. Believing in a medical cure for pain was also positively related to professional services utilization. Finally, an expressed belief in the appropriateness of solicitous responses from family members was negatively related to psychological functioning for patients reporting relatively low levels of pain. Although these findings support the broad-based hypothesis that the illness-relevant beliefs of chronic pain patients are associated with their multidimensional pain adjustment, they emphasize the importance of beliefs concerning whether or not one is disabled by pain. The findings also highlight the fact that the belief/functioning relation is not always direct and can be moderated by perceived pain severity.",The Clinical journal of pain,1992 Jun,United States,1992,90

However, economic factors are not the only determinants of a safe work environment. Worker's perception of health and safety also influence compliance with safety guidelines. This study was conducted to determine the attitude and practice of laboratory workers with regard to safety. A structured questionnaire was administered to laboratory workers in 10 clinical laboratories. The questionnaire inquired about the use of protective equipment, safe work practices and immunization status of workers. Another questionnaire sought information on safety codes, accident records and first aid facilities in each laboratory. Questionnaires were coded and analysed. Ninety out of 106 laboratory workers (85%) responded to the inquiry. Unsafe work practices such as eating or drinking in laboratories and mouth pipetting of biological samples were practised by 41% and 10% of workers, respectively. Ninety percent of workers used white coats while 64% used gloves when handling biological samples. None of these workers used goggles or face shields in the course of their work. Fifty-one percent had received immunisation against tuberculosis, 73% against tetanus and 16% against hepatitis B. Thirty-seven percent of senior staff and 72% of junior staff did not receive any formal safety training. Accident records and first aid facilities were absent in most laboratories. The commonest health problem reported by workers was low back pain. The poor coverage of hepatitis B immunization among health care workers in an endemic area is currently a cause for concern among medical and paramedical staff. There is a need for education programmes to increase awareness on safety. Occupational health workers in this setting face the challenge of promoting safe work practices among workers in the face of the lack of funding and apathy among poorly paid junior workers.",African journal of medicine and medical sciences,1998 Sep-Dec,Nigeria,1998,90

A study carried out in Siaya, Kisumu and Busia Districts showed that mothers perceived nutrition problems differently, emphasizing their embeddedness in gender and family relations. In situations of marital conflict, male labour migration, and impoverishment, women must rely on support from others; thus health education should be addressed to husbands, grandmothers and mothers-in-law as well as mothers.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1991 Oct,Australia,1991,90
8201439,Prenatal predictors of performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale.,"The present study presents a prospective analysis of the interrelationships among prenatal medical, nutritional (dietary and biochemical) and behavioral determinants of Brazelton performance. Previous researchers (Scanlon 1984, Lester and Brazelton 1984) have raised questions regarding the relative roles of medical factors, nutrition, ponderal index and other behavioral factors in neonatal performance on the BNBAS. Four hundred sixty-seven predominantly Black nulliparous women and their neonates in Washington, D.C. who were enrolled in the study by the 20th week of gestation were subjects. Results of univariate tests of significant (P < 0.01) association between independent variables and Brazelton clusters from scores measured on day 2 are presented. The 26 behavioral items were summarized into 6 clusters as done in similar studies by linearizing measures made on a curvilinear scale and taking the mean. The 6 behavioral clusters are habituation, motor, orientation, range of states, regulation of states, and autonomic. Results of 16 reflex tests are used to define a seventh reflex cluster. Independent variables included demographic, lifestyle, nutritional, medical, ponderal index, and psychosocial measures. Several psychosocial variables, including stress, anxiety and partner interaction were associated with the behavioral clusters. Nutritional variables were associated with BNBAS habituation, motor, orientation, reflex score and autonomic responses. An analysis of co-variance was performed to determine the joint effect of the above variables on the variation in the Brazelton performance on the seven cluster scores. Five of the seven models (orientation, motor, range of states, autonomic, and reflex scores) were significant predictors of the outcome variables.",The Journal of nutrition,1994 Jun,United States,1994,90
9881146,Determinants of contraceptive use among women of reproductive age in Great Britain and Germany. II: Psychological factors.,"Psychological determinants of contraceptive use were investigated in Great Britain and Germany, using national data obtained in 1992. It was hypothesised that current contraceptive use among sexually active, fertile women aged 15-45 was related to their attitude towards the various contraceptive methods, social influences, perceptions of being able to use a method correctly and consistently, a correct estimation of fertility, and communication with their partner. Effects of age and country were also taken into account. The attitude of respondents towards the various contraceptive methods was ambivalent and no method was seen as ideal. On medical methods (OCs, IUDs and sterilisation) many respondents expressed doubts as to their safety for health. Social influences most frequently concerned the use of OCs. Respondents considered themselves able to use oral contraceptives correctly, but expressed general fear about intrauterine devices and sterilisation, and many women believed they were not able to use condoms and periodic abstinence consistently. Multifactorial analyses revealed that current contraceptive use was principally determined by social influences, attitude and self-efficacy with respect to medical methods. Age and country, and, for use of unreliable methods, fertility awareness also played a role. Communication with the partner was less relevant. Contraceptive choice (and the use of non-medical methods) depended greatly on encouragement to use and being in favour of medical methods. A lack of social support for use of medical methods and a negative attitude towards them was related to higher use rates of condoms, periodic abstinence, withdrawal and reliance on 'luck'. In the case of withdrawal and/or no method, underestimation of fertility played an additional role. Contraceptive choice appears to be determined more by a general like or dislike of medical methods rather than on a weighing of the merits of individual available methods.",Journal of biosocial science,1997 Oct,England,1997,90

The differential impact of environmental influences on the health of women in India is examined. The influences can be conceptualized as endemic stress that arises from social and physical environmental determinants of deprivation, inadequate resources, limited role opportunities, and oppressive cultural forces. It is suggested that there is a link between these factors and women's health status. The combined effort of Indian women and international support agencies is suggested as an approach to examining, evaluating, and remediating the problem.",Health care for women international,1994 Mar-Apr,England,1994,90

2375937,Internal vs. external determinants of coping responses to stressful life-events in the elderly.,"Coping appears to function in the relationship between stressful life-events and health. Factors that may influence an individual's use of a particular coping strategy, however, are not well understood. Coping consistency within individuals and across situations was examined in a longitudinal study of 74 independently living elderly persons, as were the effects of the type of event experienced, appraisal of its degree of threat, and demographic variables on coping behaviour. Correlational analyses indicated that coping responses were more a function of event type than of an individual's consistent style. A number of distinct life-events were associated with particular types of coping responses. The degree of threat, one's expectation of the changeability of an event, and one's appraisal of possible courses of action were also correlated with specific coping behaviours. Age was negatively correlated with problem-focused coping and total number of coping responses. This study suggests that the type of stressful event an individual experiences may be a more important general determinant of one's coping response than is one's overriding propensity to cope in a particular way.",The British journal of medical psychology,1990 Jun,England,1990,90
8041010,[The quality of life in aged people].,"The quality of life (QOL) in aged people is an important issue that has been discussed for a long time and led to a number of studies. In this review article, the relationship between subjective QOL of the aged and various factors is summarized by referring to articles published in the United States of America. In the first chapter, representative methods for the quantitative analysis of subjective QOL are described. Among a variety of methods for measuring subjective QOL, the LSI-A and the PGC Morale Scales are commonly used. In the next chapter, based on the studies using these methods, various factors that determined subjective QOL are analyzed. These studies indicate that physical well-being and socio-economic status are significant determinants of the QOL for the aged people. In addition, employment and social activity are shown to be associated with subjective QOL. On the other hand, age, gender, race and marital status do not have an influence on subjective QOL for the aged as individual factors. QOL can not be measured with a unidimensional scale. Therefore, it is necessary for the investigator to carefully choose an appropriate analytical method by understanding the characteristics of the research subject and the purpose of the study. It is also essential to keep it in mind that any method has its own limitations in analyzing QOL.",Nihon eiseigaku zasshi. Japanese journal of hygiene,1994 Jun,Japan,1994,90

7475433,"Oral health, health, and health-related quality of life.","Health-related quality of life is a multidimensional concept with five broad domains: opportunity/resilience, health perception, functional states, impairments/diseases, and duration of life. It addresses the tradeoff between how long and how well people live. The health-related quality of life approach has provided greater opportunity for investigation of the interrelations among oral health, health, and related outcomes. The inclusion of patient-driven measures, such as perceptions and functional status, is critical. Oral health-related quality of life measures are being developed and used in research on aging populations. Clinical measures of oral health, perceptions of general and oral well-being, and reported physical, social, and psychological functioning are independent, but correlated, components of overall oral health-related quality of life. An oral health-related quality of life approach benefits 1) clinical practitioners in selecting treatments and monitoring patient outcomes; 2) researchers in identifying determinants of health, tracking levels of health risk factors, and determining use of services in populations; and 3) policy-makers establishing program and institutional priorities, policies, and funding decisions. This overview indicates substantial value in pursuing several recommendations. A theoretical framework from which concepts, measures, and models can be derived must be developed to address oral health, oral health-related quality of life, health, and health-related quality of life. Oral health outcomes or states must be identified and classified along some continuum of impairment, function, disability, and opportunity. Indicators of appropriate concepts and domains must be adapted or established. Extended analyses on the relations among oral health, oral health-related quality of life, health, and health-related quality of life should be conducted with use of the Boston VA Normative Aging Study and other appropriate data sets.",Medical care,1995 Nov,United States,1995,90

Through a microstudy of 50 such migrants in Kaiping County in the Pearl River Delta region, this article illustrates the interplay between macro, meso, and micro factors in the causes and processes of circulatory mobility in post-Mao China. It is found that Hong Kong's search for cheap labor, the PRC's household registration system, and Kaiping's strong localism provide the context in which migrants and their households have to adjust. The particular behavior pattern of these migrants also bears the stamp of their rational household decision-making processes as well as their feelings of moral obligation toward their kin in their community of origin.""",The International migration review,1993 Fall,United States,1993,90

Data for this research came from a two-wave national probability sample survey of persons aged 60 and over conducted between 1987 and 1990 in Japan. The study focuses on the transitions from two states of origin, ""not disable"" and ""disabled,"" to three states of destination, ""not disabled,"" ""disabled,"" and ""dead."" Through multinomial logit analyses, the effects of sociodemographic factors, social relationships, health, and health behavior on transitions in functional status were examined. To assess the impact of panel attrition, the risk of nonresponse was analyzed in conjunction with health transition within the same framework. Finally, an increment-decrement active life table for Japanese elderly people was derived on the basis of the multivariate analyses. According to the life table, a Japanese older person at age 60 is expected to spend about 18.7 years (81%) in functional independence and about 4.4 years (19%) in disability throughout his or her remaining lifetime.","The journals of gerontology.

8968626,Women's self-esteem: a community study of women who report and do not report childhood sexual abuse.,"BACKGROUND: The determinants of self-esteem have been little studied in non-clinic samples. It has been suggested recently that child sexual abuse (CSA) may be a major determinant of low self-esteem in adulthood. METHOD: The psychosocial circumstances associated with low self-esteem in two random samples of women, one reporting CSA, the other not, were compared, with particular emphasis on characteristics of family of origin. A two-phase (postal-then-interview) random community study assessed self-esteem and related variables. RESULTS: Psychosocial variables predicting low self-esteem were the same in the two groups. They included being a follower or a loner, having an overcontrolling mother, being poorly qualified, giving a history of depressive disorder and displaying current psychiatric disorder. In addition, the subject's CSA status led to low self-esteem but only when it was of the most intrusive type. The CSA women had substantially lower mean total self-esteem score. However, not all aspects of self-esteem were diminished equally; 12/30 items differed between the two groups, and two of the five generated self-esteem factors, which we named Pessimism and Fatalism, which differed between the control group and the whole CSA group. There were no differences for Likeability and Determination. CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of low self-esteem for women include childhood temperament, a poor relationship with the mother, low qualification attainment, psychiatric morbidity, both previous and current, and, only when it is the most intrusive, CSA.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1996 Dec,England,1996,90
7789476,Prospective study of risk factors for early and persistent wheezing in childhood.,"The object of this study was to determine the relative importance of low birth weight, preterm birth, low maternal age, household size, exposure to maternal smoking, personal smoking at 16 yrs of age, early termination of breastfeeding and socioeconomic status in the aetiology of wheezing illness in the first 5 yrs of life, and on the persistence of this illness at 16 yrs of age. In 15,712 children born in Britain during one week of April 1970, the occurrence of wheezing by 5 yrs of age, and of wheezing in the past year at 16 yrs of age within this group were analysed in multivariate logistic regression against each potential risk factor. The independent determinants of wheezing by 5 yrs of age were male sex, maternal smoking during pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) for 15+ cigarettes.day-1 = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.22-1.58) and low birthweight (OR for birthweight < 2.5 kg = 1.26; 95% Cl 1.07-1.50). Of children who had wheezed by 5 yrs of age, 15% reported wheezing in the past 12 months at 16 yrs of age. The persistence of symptoms at 16 yrs of age was independently related to low maternal age (OR for 20 vs 40 yrs of age = 1.96; 95% CI 1.08-3.45) and to high social status (OR for most vs least advantaged = 1.95; 95% CI 1.13-3.38). We conclude that low birth weight and maternal smoking in pregnancy are independent risk factors for early childhood wheezing, but in 85% of children with early wheezing it resolves by 16 yrs of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",The European respiratory journal,1995 Mar,England,1995,90
7761046,Why do adolescents eat low nutrient snacks between meals? An analysis of behavioral determinants with the Fishbein and Ajzen model.,"This article presents determinants of eating sweet and fat snacks between meals by adolescents (12-15 years). A preliminary qualitative study focused on eliciting students' interpretation of the self-rated terminology 'low nutrient sweet and fat snacks' and the development of a written questionnaire following the principles of the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1980). In a quantitative study a questionnaire was administered to 560 students in the first and second grade of Dutch secondary education. In the data-analysis frequent and moderate users were compared. Frequent users had a more positive attitude towards the intake of sweet and fat snacks than moderate users. The intention to consume sweet snacks was more positive for frequent users. As opposed to frequent users, moderate users had a negative intention towards consuming fat snacks between meals. Moreover, moderate users experienced more social influence against the intake of both snacks than the frequent users. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the theory of reasoned action in relation to the self-rated consumption of sweet and fat snacks eaten between meals. In predicting intention to consume such snacks, attitude turned out to be more important than subjective norm. Finally, the correlation between actual eating behavior as reported by the students, and the behavioral intentions was relatively moderate which was probably caused by inconsistency between intention and behavior.",Nutrition and health,1994,England,1994,90
9209584,Determinants of female dispersal in Thomas langurs.,"Female dispersal occurs in a number of primate species. It may be related to: avoidance of inbreeding, reduction in food competition, reduction of predation risk, or avoidance of infanticide in combination with mate choice. Female dispersal was studied for a 5-year period in a wild population of Thomas langurs (Presbytis thomasi) that lived in one-male multi-female groups. Juvenile and adult individuals of both sexes were seen to disperse. Females appeared to transfer unhindered between groups, mostly from a larger group to a recently formed smaller one. They transferred without their infants and when not pregnant, and seemed to transfer preferentially during periods when extra-group males were harassing their group. During these inter-group encounters extra-group males seemed to try to commit infanticide. Thus, the timing of female transfer was probably closely linked to infanticide avoidance. Moreover, females seemed to transfer when the resident male of their group was no longer a good protector. The observations in the present study suggest that females transferred to reduce the risk of infanticide. Female dispersal may have another ultimate advantage as well, namely inbreeding avoidance. Due to the dispersal of both females and males the social organization of Thomas langurs was rather fluid. New groups were formed when females joined a male; male takeovers were not observed. Bisexual groups had only a limited life span, because all adult females of a bisexual group could emigrate. This pattern of unhindered female dispersal affects male reproductive strategies, and in particular it might lead to infanticidal behavior during inter-group encounters.",American journal of primatology,1997,United States,1997,90
10453246,Area variations in use of modern contraception in rural Bangladesh: a multilevel analysis.,"This study in Bangladesh found that inter-cluster variation in the use of modern reversible methods of contraception was significantly attributable to the educational levels of the female family planning workers working in the clusters. Women belonging to clusters served by educated workers had a higher probability of being contraceptive users than those whose workers had only completed primary education. At the household level, important determinants of use were socioeconomic status and religion. At the individual level, the woman being the wife of the household head and having some education were positively related to her being a user. The model also found that inter-household variation was significantly greater than inter-cluster variation. Finally, the study concludes that after controlling for various covariates at all three levels, the clusters do not have significantly different levels of use of modern reversible methods of contraception. There are, however, some special areas where contraceptive use is dramatically low, and these contribute significantly to the observed inter-cluster variation.",Journal of biosocial science,1999 Jul,England,1999,90

DESIGN: Eligible women were enrolled into this cross sectional study by a network of 51 paediatric practices when bringing their babies for a U3 infant screening examination (4th to 6th week after delivery). Lifestyle and exposure factors were obtained by questionnaire. All milk samples were analysed for hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachlorbenzole, DDT, dieldrin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and heptachlor; half the samples were also analysed for dioxin. Analytic statistics were computed using polychotomous logistic regression (PLR). SETTING: The study was conducted in Lower Saxony, Germany, from summer 1992 to summer 1993. PARTICIPANTS: Altogether 156 primiparous, breast feeding German women, aged 25-35 years, who had been born and had grown up in West Germany, were studied. MAIN RESULTS: Compared with the regular programme, participants in this study had their milk analysed sooner after delivery and were more likely to have grown up in rural areas, less likely to have been exposed to hazardous substances, less likely to have a diet of health food, and slightly less likely to be a smoker at the time of the study. Breast milk contamination levels were comparable in both studies, and in all but two cases well below the tolerable concentrations established by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Fellowship). After adjustment for potential confounders using polychotomous logistic regression, there were statistically significant positive associations between breast milk contamination and age (PCB, test for trend: p = 0.006), average dietary fat intake per week (dioxin, p = 0.01), and proximity of residence to hazardous sites (dioxin, p < 0.05), and negative associations between residue levels and relative body weight at the time of the study (PCB; p < 0.0001) and difference in body weight (weight minus weight before the pregnancy; PCB, p = 0.0002), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel practice networks are a feasible and low-biased approach to population based breast milk studies. The contamination levels and associations found are biologically plausible and comparable with the results of other studies. To reduce organochlorine residue levels in human milk in the short term, breast-feeding women should be advised not to try to reduce their weight until after lactation. Public promotion of a lower dietary fat intake may reduce the lifetime accumulation of organochlorine compounds in the human body fat tissue in the long term, resulting in lower concentrations in breast milk as well.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1995 Aug,England,1995,90
1585681,[Selected results of attitudes regarding nutrition behavior in the former East Germany].,"In studying the causes of individual nutritional behaviour not only the economic, social, demographic, cultural and other determinants are of importance but also psychological processes of decision and evaluation. For recording the attitudes, value-orientations and action goals a questionnaire was developed (72 items, 13 social and nutrition-related features). It was completed by 867 subjects aged between 18 and 65 years. The statistical analysis shows that the action-determining goals investigated can be classified in 5 empirically developed, factorially validated scales (expenditure, health, enjoyment, matter of minor importance, stimulus). Besides, significant relationships were revealed between the scales and the social characteristics as e.g. sex, age, education, occupation, household size, cooking, mass catering, and self-assessment of body weight.",Zeitschrift fur Ernahrungswissenschaft,1992 Mar,Germany,1992,90
12291055,Immigration to the Federal Republic of Germany as a demographic and social problem.,"""Addressing the question of immigration to Western Europe and especially to Germany from east and southeast Europe and from developing countries of the South, this article considers whether such immigration can compensate for reductions in population in developed countries. It is argued that the demographic deficits of an aging population can only be corrected to a limited extent through immigration. Any solution, in order to be effective, must include a simultaneous increase in the birthrates of Germany and other European Community countries. With particular regard to future social development in Germany and the EC, it would be advisable for governments to effect measures that will provide both for controlled admissions of immigrants from outside the EC and an increase in local reproductive capabilities.""",The International migration review,1995 Fall,United States,1995,90
1530097,Form and structure and their function in psychotherapy.,"Psychotherapy is a creative process with the same types of effects and determinants as other creative activities in fields such as literature, visual arts, and science. In all of these activities, a focus on form and structure serves to generate new and valuable resultants or creations. As shown in the example of the poet Richard Wilbur's creation of a poem, his focus on rhyme and other formal features generated a new and valuable emotional tension in the poem. In psychotherapy, the creation consists of new and valuable aspects or structural features of personality. This creative result in therapy is produced in part by therapists' focus on form in terms of sequences, style of verbal and non-verbal presentation, and the phases of encounter, growth, and separation. As shown in the psychotherapy session excerpted, the therapist's lack of attention to the critical theme initiated by the patient at the beginning of the session (encounter) as well as to the meanings of connections between sequences in the following interactions (growth) led to a non-creative or destructive suicidal threat at the end (separation). The overall creative result arises also from therapists' attention to patients' approaches to the overall structure of psychotherapy as a regularly occurring timed experience in which the therapist does not directly intervene in the patient's life. This structural organization provides a trial domain for the patient in which creative growth and personal welfare can be facilitated. Both patient and therapist need to focus on any attempts to undermine the structural organization and its meaning. Similarly, in creative activities in other fields, writers, artists, and scientists characteristically focus on form, in a detailed as well as general way, in order to facilitate both aesthetic and social growth and welfare.",American journal of psychotherapy,1992 Jul,United States,1992,90
11868558,Developing effective HIV prevention programs for inmates: results from an Ontario-wide survey.,"Many studies of the characteristics, behaviours, and prevalence of HIV among those admitted to Canadian correctional facilities indicate that inmates are at increased risk for HIV infection and that they be targeted for HIV interventions. Yet the development and implementation of these programs has been much too slow and, at times, inappropriate to the prison environment. Further, the effectiveness of current and proposed policies and programs must be evaluated to ensure that the goal of reducing HIV transmission is achieved. To address these issues, a team of University of Toronto researchers undertook a study entitled ""The Social and Structural Determinants of HIV-Related Risk Behaviours among Prisoners: Implications for Prevention."" This study surveyed adult males and females incarcerated in six provincial correctional centres in Ontario.

8151324,"Evaluation of the neurobehavioral functioning of patients before, during, and after bone marrow transplantation.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the cognitive and emotional functioning of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in the protected environment (PE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were given tests of cognition and mood before their hospitalization in the PE, after 2 weeks, at discharge, and at 8 months post-BMT. Locus of control, degree of social support, previous biotherapy, and on-treatment psychiatric consultation were also analyzed. RESULTS: Before BMT, 20% of patients had mild cognitive dysfunction, and nearly 40% had significant anxiety. Although few patients developed problems with cognition or mood during the study, short-term memory deficits nearly doubled at follow-up compared with baseline. Anxiety decreased significantly during hospitalization and remained low at follow-up. In contrast, depression increased throughout hospitalization, but decreased at follow-up. Pre-BMT emotional status and cognitive functioning were highly related to long-term outcome. Type of BMT, locus of control, and degree of social support were related to psychologic distress and cognitive functioning, both during and after BMT. Patient age was not a predictor of neurobehavioral symptoms during or after BMT. CONCLUSION: Pretransplant emotional and cognitive functioning are important determinants of long-term outcome and quality of life (QOL) in BMT patients. In addition, a few patients undergoing BMT develop short-term memory difficulties and mood disturbance that may persist. Pretransplant identification of patients at risk for neurobehavioral difficulties may guide early interventions during hospitalization. Posttransplant assessment may then be used to develop rehabilitation programs and other interventions for individuals with persisting complaints.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,1994 Apr,United States,1994,90

1423121,Learning to 'walk our talk': the implications of sociological theory for research methodologies in health promotion.,"In recent formulations of the concept of health promotion, such as Achieving Health for All and the Ottawa Charter, emphasis is clearly placed on comprehensivity and the integration of individual and social determinants of health, broadly defined. This paper is premised on the observation that despite evidence of a paradigm shift in the way we talk about health promotion at a conceptual level, we have yet to properly articulate a 'new' research methodology to accompany the 'new' health promotion. The paper has three main sections. First, some of the limitations and contradictions that separate the rhetoric of health promotion from its current operationalization in research practice are discussed. In asserting the inherent links between theory, methodology and method, the need for a new research paradigm is demonstrated. In the second section, seven key issues derived from the literature on sociological theory are identified and discussed in terms of their implications for choosing a new research methodology for health promotion. In the third section it is suggested that using these issue areas as a 'decision map' leads to the selection of a preferred strategy which brings together both interpretive and critical perspectives to bear on our understanding of social reality as it affects health. Elements of both of these approaches and the nature of their potential complimentarity are considered. Throughout these deliberations the reader is encouraged to consider the potentially conservative or activist orientations that alternate methodologies imply, and to critically evaluate how these mesh with the emerging rhetoric of fostering empowerment that is the cornerstone of the 'new' health promotion.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1992 Mar-Apr,Switzerland,1992,90
8454215,[Detection of psychosocial dysfunction in ob-gyn patients].,"The human behavior and its social determinants are critical variables for understanding the etiology, treatment, and prevention of many disorders previously attributed to biological substrates. Among the many categories of human behavior to receive special attention from health researchers and practitioners are life events, coping responses and emotional state. The relation between these categories constituted a particular field of investigation. This relationship rather than forcing to focus on disease, distress, disability, and other failures in human functioning, permits to address health, abilities, resources, and other positive aspects of human functioning. On the other hand, the re-organization of health services considers interdisciplinary work as an objective, as it is necessary to care for the patient in an integral manner, with the consequent benefit of a more efficient service. In addition it is known that patients with psychosocial dysfunctions who use general practice care facilities overutilize these services in an unnecessary manner. With this in mind it is clear that is necessary to balance the service's cost-benefit for a more efficient clinical attention. In this paper we present the results of the categories mentioned above: life events, coping responses and its relationship with emotional state in a representative sample of 399 female patients who in 1986 received services at the National Institute of Perinatology-INPer-. Of these patients, 297 were obstetrical patients -OBS- and 102 gynaecological ones -GINE-. All patients answered these instruments: General Health Questionnaire -GHQ-7 of 30 items, a subscale of Health and Daily Living for Coping Responses and Life Events Scale.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Ginecologia y obstetricia de Mexico,1993 Jan,Mexico,1993,90
9198314,Determinants of breast-feeding patterns in an urban society of India.,"Breast feeding is the focus of rapidly growing interest in many areas of demographic research. However, relatively few rigorous studies on breast-feeding patterns and correlates in contemporary India have been published. This study uses data from a retrospective survey conducted in 1991-1992 to investigate current breast-feeding patterns and to identify the key factors that influence the duration of exclusive breast feeding and infant's age at the time of weaning in an urban Hindu society of the northeast Indian state of Assam. Applying life table procedures and a hazards regression model, we found evidence that the median duration of exclusive breast feeding and infant's age at the time of weaning were negatively associated with mother's education, per capita income, and social status of the household. Those infants who were breast-fed longer at night than in the daytime were also at greater risk of earlier introduction of non-breast-milk foods and of earlier termination of breast feeding than infants who were breast-fed longer during the day. Gender bias toward males in rearing infants prevails in this urban society, and male infants were found to have a significantly lower risk of early weaning than female infants.",Human biology,1997 Aug,United States,1997,90

10187592,Private health care provision in developing countries: a preliminary analysis of levels and composition.,"While the importance of the private sector in providing health services in developing countries is now widely acknowledged, the paucity of data on numbers and types of providers has prevented systematic cross-country comparisons. Using available published and unpublished sources, we have assembled data on the number of public and private health care providers for approximately 40 countries. This paper presents some results of the analysis of this database, looking particularly at the determinants of the size and structure of the private health sector. We consider two different types of dependent variable: the absolute number of private providers (measured here as physicians and hospital beds), and the public-private composition of provision. We examine the relationship between these variables and income and other socioeconomic characteristics, at the national level. We find that while income level is related to the absolute size of the private sector, the public-private mix does not seem to be related to income. After controlling for income, certain socioeconomic characteristics, such as education, population density, and health status are associated with the size of the private sector, though no causal relationship is posited. Further analysis will require more complete data about the size of the private sector, including the extent of dual practice by government-employed physicians. A richer story of the determinants of private sector growth would incorporate more information about the institutional structure of health systems, including provider payment mechanisms, the level and quality of public services, the regulatory structure, and labour and capital market characteristics. Finally, a normative analysis of the size and growth of the private sector will require a better understanding of its impact on key social welfare outcomes.",Health policy and planning,1998 Sep,England,1998,90
9029985,Early onset depression: the relevance of anxiety.,"The aim of this study was to determine risk factors that may differentiate early onset from late onset depression. A non-clinical cohort that had been assessed from 1978 to 1993 at 5 yearly intervals and that had a high prevalence rate of lifetime depression took part in the study. We established an appropriate age cut-off to distinguish early onset (i.e. before 26 years) of major and of minor depression, and examined the relevance of a number of possible determinants of early onset depression assessed over the life of the study. Despite several dimensional measures of depression, self-esteem and personality being considered, they generally failed (when assessed early in the study) to discriminate subsequent early onset depression, with the exception of low masculinity scores being a weak predictor of major and/or minor depression. Early onset depression was strongly predicted, however, by a lifetime episode of a major anxiety disorder, with generalised anxiety being a somewhat stronger and more consistent predictor than panic disorder, agoraphobia and minor anxiety disorders (ie social phobia, simple phobia). The possibility that anxiety may act as a key predispositional factor to early onset depression and to a greater number of depressive episodes is important in that clinical assessment and treatment of any existing anxiety disorder may be a more efficient and useful strategy than focussing primarily on the depressive disorder.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1997 Jan,Germany,1997,90

8999476,[Smoking in students in secondary schools in Burkina Faso].,"A multi-centre enquiry in 12 of 30 provinces of Burkina Faso was carried out to study smoking in pupils at secondary schools. The prevalence of smoking was 13.6 per cent. Amongst the smokers, occasional smoking was the most common, involving 62 per cent. Boys smoked more than girls. The average age of starting smoking was early, at 13.4 years. The majority of smokers consumed less than five cigarettes a day and the favourite place for consumption was the home of their parents or guardian and at school. The determinants of school smokers were above all environmental: the influence of friends and advertising. The students showed a good knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking. This knowledge was linked to their educational level and to their status as a smoker or non-smoker. The proportion of pupils who had obtained good results in the term which preceded the enquiry was more significant amongst the non-smokers than amongst the smokers. An awareness of the significance of smoking amongst pupils by their parents, guardians and teachers involves health education and rigorous legislative measures on advertising and these would contribute to some reduction in the extent of the phenomenon in educational establishments.",Revue des maladies respiratoires,1996 Oct,France,1996,90

House-staff attitudes and behaviors during a hospital work action.,"Work actions by house staff are an infrequent response to sometimes difficult working conditions, but they can have a notable effect on institutional cohesiveness and represent a challenge to traditional notions of medical ethics. To determine the extent of participation in a hospital-wide doctors' strike and factors associated with participation, we surveyed 432 house officers at a university-affiliated public hospital where a contract dispute had recently led to a 4-day work action. Of 257 respondents, 69% approved of the strike and 50% participated in it. Both strikers and nonstrikers agreed that quality of care and specific contract issues were important precipitants of the event. By logistic regression, factors independently associated with strike participation (P less than .05) included being unmarried, training in internal medicine or psychiatry, being in earlier stages of training, being assigned to an outpatient service at the time of the strike, holding a favorable view of physician activism, and perceiving nurses, faculty, peers, and the public to have favored the strike. These associations may provide a basis for understanding the individual and social determinants of house-staff strike activity.",The Western journal of medicine,1990 Nov,United States,1990,90

Results based on home interviews (n = 605) of a 40% systematic sample of 70 year olds in the electoral register showed that around 46.3% of females and 21.3% of males reported being lonely. Persons of European/North American origin felt less lonely than those of Asian or African origin, probably due to the former's wider social support network, perceiving friends, neighbors or other relatives as being available to back up children in an emergency. The major factors associated with loneliness were: being depressed, having a poor self-assessed health status, not attending synagogue, and being widowed but not remarried. Factors that did not reduce loneliness included having paid employment, watching TV or listening to the radio. No association was found between cognitive status and loneliness. Our systems model suggests a strong reciprocal relationship between loneliness and depression.",Israel journal of medical sciences,1996 Aug,Israel,1996,90

8172115,Vegetarian diets and colon cancer: the German experience.,"The study assessed mortality and morbidity risks as related to nutritional status of moderate and strict vegetarians in Germany. The total cohort of 1904 self-identified persons was followed up for 11 y. Compared with national mortality rates for Federal Republic of Germany, the observed deaths for all causes were below expectation by a factor of 0.44 for men and 0.53 for women. The mortality for colon cancer was reduced [standardized mortality ration (SMR 44.1 for men and 77.9 for women]. No deaths were observed from rectal cancer. A vegetarian lifestyle of long duration (> or = 20 y) was associated with decreased overall and cancer mortality. Other determinants of decreased cause-specific mortality were physical activity, body weight, and strictness of adherence to the life-style. The relationship between a vegetarian and fiber-rich diet and a decreased risk for colon cancer has been reported in many studies. In this study, the influence of other factors such as health-conscious behavior and a healthy lifestyle seem to indicate partly stronger effects than nutrition itself. This may explain the generally better health of moderate vegetarians.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1994 May,United States,1994,90

The content and extension of each hope, as well as the levels of internality, optimism and realization, were estimated from the answers. The results showed that a high level of family discussion increased interest in a future family. The influences of parental control and family discussion, however, change as adolescents grow older: the more 11-year-olds reported parental control, the less optimistic they were about the future but the more steps they had taken to realize their hopes. On the other hand, the higher the level of family discussion adolescents reported at the age of 15, the more optimistic they were and the more they had realized their hopes. Adolescents with high self-esteem were more internal in their thinking about the future than those with low self-esteem.",Journal of adolescence,1991 Mar,England,1991,90
8922237,The epidemiology of Hodgkin's disease.,"Much of the epidemiological heterogeneity of HD incidence reflects the behaviour of the NS subtype, at least in the USA. Incidence variation across races (except Asians) and time periods is most marked in this subtype. In young adults with HD, there is compelling evidence for social class modification of risk consistent with an infectious aetiology; limited data suggest that this effect occurs within the NS subtype, but considerable evidence indicates that it does not primarily involve EBV infection. Findings from familial aggregation studies and HLA associations point to inherited susceptibility to this subtype. Despite little sex difference for NS in young adulthood in the latest incidence data, parity nevertheless appears to be protective against this subtype for women. Therefore, the greater increase for females than males in the incidence of young-adult NS in recent years may reflect the impact of population trends towards later childbearing and lower parity. This change, as well as the concomitant smaller family sizes and growing affluence, could explain part of the burgeoning incidence of NS in young adults in the USA. These observations suggest that NS in young adults constitutes a separate disease, probably of infectious origin. The incongruous occurrence of this subtype in older adults, and the presence of EBV in some NS cases, could reflect heterogeneity within NS, for example, representing features of the cellular phase of NS (Cozen et al, 1992; Medeiros and Greiner, 1995). For the non-NS subtypes, many of the factors that predict risk of NS may also be relevant. Patterns of social class determinants in children and older adults, the age groups at risk for MC, support involvement of an infectious precursor given intense exposure, and EBV is a likely candidate, based on its high prevalence in these groups. However, little aetiological research has been directed explicitly at the non-NS subtypes. Considerable effort has gone into exploring an infectious aetiology of HD. Recently, this line of investigation has moved beyond social class determinants to molecular epidemiological studies of EBV and, to a lesser degree, other potentially involved viruses. The roles of genetic susceptibility and sex hormones also represent promising areas for exploration, particularly in their possible interaction with infectious agents and other environmental factors. Ultimately, clearer epidemiological understanding of HD will be aided by more precise classification of this disease at the molecular level.",Bailliere's clinical haematology,1996 Sep,England,1996,90
10342798,Neighborhood social environment and risk of death: multilevel evidence from the Alameda County Study.,"Recent reports suggest the importance of associations between residential area characteristics and health status, but most research uses only census data to measure these characteristics. The current research examined the effect of overall neighborhood social environment on 11-year risk of death. On the basis of data, the authors developed a three-component neighborhood social environment scale: 1) commercial stores; 2) population socioeconomic status; and 3) environment/housing. Data from the 1983 wave of the Alameda County Study (n = 1,129) and deaths over 11 years were analyzed with two-level logistic regression models. Age- and sex-adjusted risk of death was higher for residents in low social environment neighborhoods (odds ratio = 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.15-2.18). Mortality risks were significantly higher in neighborhoods with a low social environment, even after account was taken of individual income level, education, race/ethnicity, perceived health status, smoking status, body mass index, and alcohol consumption. When each component of the neighborhood social environment characteristics score was examined separately, each was found to be associated with higher risk for mortality, independent of individual risk factors. These findings demonstrate the role of area characteristics as a health risk factor and point to the need for more focused attention to the meaning and measurement of neighborhood quality.",American journal of epidemiology,1999 May 15,United States,1999,90
8211276,Determinants of regional differences in lung cancer mortality in The Netherlands.,"Although regional differences in lung cancer mortality are likely to be attributable to regional differences in tobacco smoking, studies in various countries found only weak relationships. This paper aimed at explaining regional differences in lung cancer mortality in the Netherlands. In a first step, clues for the role of smoking were obtained from a detailed description of regional mortality differences. These differences were found to be strongly determined by cohort effects: they vary between birth cohorts, and have been stable for over 30 years. Regional mortality differences reflect a diffusion of the lung cancer epidemic from high-income regions to low-income regions. These findings are suggestive of a relationship with regional differences in trends in cigarette smoking. In a second step, by means of multiple regression analysis, mortality differences in 1980-84 were related to available data on cigarette smoking and two other possible risk factors: work in transport and manufacturing industry, and air contamination. The independent variables referred to the 1970s. Positive associations with various smoking measures were found for women, but for men the associations were weak or non-existent. Mortality differences among men 45-64 years were associated with work in transport and manufacturing industry. Strong associations with air contamination were found for men and women 65 years and older. Additional analysis showed that regional differences in lung cancer among old men were strongly associated with smoking in 1930, i.e. half a century before. Changes in the regional pattern of tobacco consumption between 1930 and 1970 explain why smoking in 1970 is not associated with mortality differences in the 1980s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Sep,England,1993,90
9511134,What makes women tired? A community sample.,"We aimed to determine the major health concerns or problems of women and their personal attributions for the causes of their primary health concerns. We used a survey of women from the Toronto area attending a women's health symposium. Completed questionnaires were returned by 153 (85%) of 180 women attendees. Persistent fatigue was the primary and most commonly cited health concern. Fatigue was ranked first by 42 (27.5%) women and among the top 10 concerns by 123 (80.4%) women. Women attributed their fatigue to a combination of home and outside work (63.4%), poor sleep (38.2%), lack of time for self (34.1%), lack of exercise (32.5%), financial worries (28.5%), relationship problems (22.0%), emotional causes (17.9%), care of ill family members (13.8%), lack of social or individual support (9.8%), poor physical health (8.9%), work in home or child care (3.3%), or gender bias/harassment (2.4%). Our subjects, women from the community, overwhelmingly endorsed social determinants as the cause of their persistent fatigue. Although depression and anxiety form the most robust associations with persistent fatigue in primary care and community studies, women in this sample ranked these factors in seventh place in their attributions. Similarly, although physicians often assume physical causes for fatigue, women rank physical health low in their own attributions. Given the high prevalence of fatigue in women and its impact on quality of life, more attention needs to be given to the social, systemic, and personal factors that women feel contribute to their fatigue to develop more effective interventions.",Journal of women's health,1998 Feb,United States,1998,90

METHODS: A sample of 129 SLE patients (mean age 42.01 years; SD 11.09) was recruited from 9 immunology/rheumatology clinics across Canada. Patients completed questionnaires assessing psychological distress, social support, coping, stress, and health-related quality of life. Physicians rated disease activity (using the revised Systemic Lupus Activity Measure; SLAM-R) and damage (using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index). Mental and physical health composite scores were derived from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36. Patients were subdivided into more active (SLAM-R > or = 10; n = 38) or less active disease states (n = 91). RESULTS: Better mental health was predicted by more education and less emotion-oriented coping in the patients in a more active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.46). Better mental health was predicted by less stress, less emotion-oriented coping and more task-oriented coping in patients during a less active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.45). Better physical health was predicted by more emotion-oriented coping in patients in a more active disease state (P = 0.04; R2 = 0.11). Better physical health was predicted by less stress and younger age in patients during a less active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.20). CONCLUSION: The positive association between emotion-oriented coping and better physical health in patients during a more active disease state suggests that this style of coping may be more adaptive in situations that are considered uncontrollable (e.g., SLE flare). Predictors of mental health were similar to those found in the literature, especially for SLE patients in a less active disease state.",Arthritis care and research : the official journal of the Arthritis Health Professions Association,1999 Dec,United States,1999,90
9745425,Are autoimmune thyroid dysfunction and depression related?,"The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease and depression in perimenopausal women. Thyroid function [TSH, free T4, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab)] and depression (using the Edinburgh Depression Scale) were assessed cross-sectionally together with other determinants of depression. The subjects were 583 randomly selected perimenopausal women (aged 47-54 yr) from a community cohort of 6846 women. The main outcome measures were the occurrence of thyroid dysfunction (abnormal free T4 and/or TSH or elevated levels of TPO-Ab) and the concomitant presence of depression according to the Edinburgh Depression Scale. Neither biochemical thyroid dysfunction nor menopausal status was related to depression. Apart from several psycho-social determinants (the occurrence of a major life event, a previous episode of depression, or financial problems), an elevated level of TPO-Ab (> or = 100 U/mL) was significantly associated with depression (odds ratio, 3.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.8). We conclude that women with elevated TPO-Ab levels are especially vulnerable to depression, whereas postmenopausal status does not increase the risk of depression.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90
1782520,The politics of welfare policy in Sweden: structural determinants and attitudinal cleavages.,"The article analyzes attitudes to Swedish welfare policies, using data from a survey conducted in 1986. In the first section, a number of indices tapping various aspects of attitudes to welfare policy are constructed. In the second section these indices are used to give an empirical assessment of competing theories about the impact of different structural determinants on attitudes. It is concluded (a) that there is general support for Swedish welfare policies, which, however, is mixed with criticisms of bureaucracy and suspicion about abuse of welfare programs, and (b) that class position and 'class-related' determinants such as income are more important than factors such as gender, private or public sector location or consumption groups in structuring attitudes. In the concluding section, these findings are discussed in relation to recent theorizing about newly emerging lines of division in the population. It is argued that either Sweden must be seen as a deviant case, which for specific historical and institutional reasons is characterized by class conflicts rather than other sectional splits, or the theories about new lines of division are simply mistaken.",The British journal of sociology,1991 Dec,England,1991,90
10148660,Malnutrition and gender relations in Western Kenya.,"Child malnutrition, which is an increasing problem in Western Kenya, is addressed primarily through efforts to reach the individual mother with information about proper feeding of her children. A study carried out in Siaya, Kisumu and Busia Districts showed that mothers perceived nutrition problems differently, emphasizing their embeddedness in gender and family relations. In situations of marital conflict, male labour migration, and impoverishment, women must rely on support from others; thus health education should be addressed to husbands, grandmothers and mothers-in-law as well as mothers.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1991 Oct,Australia,1991,90
10048834,"Gender differences in illhealth in Finland: patterns, magnitude and change.","The common wisdom about gender differences in illhealth has been encapsulated in the phrase ""women are sicker, but men die quicker"". Recently this wisdom has been increasingly questioned. The purpose of this study is first to analyse the patterns and magnitude of gender differences across various indicators of illhealth; second to examine changes over time in these differences and third to assess whether sociodemographic and socioeconomic, family status and social network determinants have any bearing on the differences. The data derive from nationally representative 1986 and 1994 Surveys on Living Conditions in Finland. Women showed poorer health for five out of eight indicators analysed; that is somatic symptoms, mental symptoms, disability among those 50 years or older, long-standing illness and limiting long-standing illness were more prevalent among women than men. Male excess was found for perceived health below good and extremely limiting long-standing illness among those 50 years or older. However, the male excess was statistically significant only for poor perceived health among those 50 years or older. Adjusting for a number of suggested determinants of health had a negligible effect on gender differences. Further analyses showed that gender differences in illhealth remained largely stable over the eight year study period which saw a steep increase of unemployment for both genders. Only in the case of mental and somatic symptoms have gender differences declined, with a simultaneous increase in the prevalence of such symptoms. Otherwise gender differences in illhealth turned out to be resistant to the deep labour market crisis over this relatively short period of time. Although women had poorer health than men for a number of health indicators, we also find gender equality and even male excess for some indicators. Furthermore, the results suggest that a male excess in illhealth is likely to be found with more severe domains of illhealth among elderly people.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Jan,England,1999,90

7644605,Determinants of negative priming.,"The negative priming task is widely used to investigate attentional inhibition. A critical review of the negative priming literature considers various parameters of the task (e.g., time course, relation to interference, level of occurence, and susceptibility to changes in task context). It takes into account life span data and the performance of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. On these bases, the review suggests that negative priming can be produced by 2 mechanisms: memorial and inhibitory. With respect to inhibition, the review suggests that (a) there are 2 systems, one responsible for identity and the other for location information; and (b) inhibition is a flexible, postselection process operating to prevent recently rejected information from quickly regaining access to effectors, thus helping to establish coherence among selected thought and action streams.",Psychological bulletin,1995 Jul,United States,1995,90

Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the data for 207 female sexual partners who had never injected drugs. The findings show that crack cocaine use is the strongest contributor to the model, which explains fourteen percent of the variance of sexual risk behavior. The findings suggest that the risks associated with sexual practices are much greater for crack cocaine users than among non users of crack.",Women & health,1993,United States,1993,90

METHODS: A prospective study design was used to identify the predictors of vigorous physical activity (VPA) (> or = 6 METs) and moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (> or = 3 METs) among 202 rural, predominantly African-American children. Selected social-cognitive determinants of physical activity were assessed via questionnaire in the fifth grade. Participation in VPA and MVPA was assessed via the previous day physical activity recall 1 year later in the sixth grade. RESULTS: For girls, participation in community sports, self-efficacy in overcoming barriers, enjoyment of school physical education, race (white > black), and perception of mother's activity level (active vs inactive) were significant predictors of VPA. For MVPA, participation in community sports and self-efficacy in overcoming barriers were significant predictors. For boys, self-efficacy in overcoming barriers was the only significant predictor of VPA, while beliefs regarding activity outcomes and participation in community sports were significant predictors of MVPA. CONCLUSION: Social-cognitive constructs such as physical activity self-efficacy, access to community physical activity outlets, and positive beliefs regarding physical activity outcomes are important predictors of future physical activity behavior among rural, predominantly African-American children.",Preventive medicine,1997 Mar-Apr,United States,1997,90

The importance of comprehensive rehabilitation during convalescence is emphasised. Education, motivation and support of the patients are essential for the adoption of healthier lifestyles. Despite comprehensive rehabilitation, however, recidivism to former habits is common, particularly with smoking and physical inactivity. This is partly determined by premorbid social and personality characteristics of patients. Social and behavioural support at the workplace and within the community may well be of significant benefit in supporting patients to maintain their necessary health behaviour changes. Some of the evidence related to these issues is discussed and recommendations are made regarding future directions for patient support.","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",1992 Jan,Singapore,1992,90
24441555,Violence in the Swedish school environment: extent of the problem and its manifestations.,"The current importance of school violence due to its recent increase, and also its association with school-specific psychosocial and physical environmental problems were considered as part of a recent survey of Swedish public-sector schools. The responses of the principals of a representative sample of schools (68.4% response rate) revealed that, for the school year 1995-1996, violence was a problem regarded as 'moderate' or 'large' in 15% of schools, 'small' in 62%, and as 'non-significant' in 20%. There has been a non-uniform trend in perceptions of violence across types of schools and municipalities since 1990. Schools where violence has been a problem for some time were more likely to express dissatisfaction with the psychosocial and physical environment of the school, and to emphasize individual and adult-supervision factors as injury determinants. Prevention of intentional injuries requires a variety of interventions, adapted according to factors associated with the problem at local level.","Work (Reading, Mass.)",1998,Netherlands,1998,90

7660042,[Reliability of the declaration of underlying cause of infant deaths in the metropolitan region of southeastern Brazil].,"The quality of official information on underlying causes of infant deaths was studied on the basis of data collected for a population-based study of the surveillance of infant mortality in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, Brazil in 1989. The survey included the analysis of a sample of infant deaths carried out by comparing the underlying causes of death as coded on death certificates to those recorded by a group of doctors who abstracted information from hospital records. We verified that 11.7% of neonatal deaths did not have the underlying cause of death confirmed by the investigation (kappa = 0.61), and neither did 44.0% of post-neonatal deaths (kappa = 0.47). It is believed that this major disagreement among post-neonatal deaths is due to the close correlation observed among the major causes of death within this group (pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition). For example, associated malnutrition was observed in 76.9% of those cases in which diarrhoea was coded as the underlying cause of death. It was concluded that the quality of the death certificates is not satisfactory. However, the composition of the main groups of causes presented no significant alteration after investigation and may be used in public health surveillance, especially if we regard pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition as a group with the same determinants. Unfortunately, this group still accounts for a great number of otherwise avoidable deaths in Brazil.",Revista de saude publica,1994 Oct,Brazil,1994,90
12319621,Economic integration and labor flows: stage migration in farm labor markets in Mexico and the United States.,"""This article examines the probable effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on migration from Mexico to the United States, disputing the view that expansion of jobs in Mexico could rapidly reduce undocumented migration. To the extent that NAFTA causes Mexican export agriculture to expand, migration to the United States will increase rather than decrease in the short run. Data collected in both California and the Mexican State of Baja California show that indigenous migrants from southern Mexico typically first undertake internal migration, which lowers the costs and risks of U.S. migration. Two features of employment in export agriculture were found to be specially significant in lowering the costs of U.S. migration: first, working in export agriculture exposes migrants to more diverse social networks and information about U.S. migration; second, agro-export employment in northern Mexico provides stable employment, albeit low-wage employment, for some members of the family close to the border (especially women and children) while allowing other members of the family to assume the risks of U.S. migration.""",The International migration review,1995 Summer,United States,1995,90
8399248,Weight gain attitudes among pregnant adolescents.,"Maternal weight gain is the most important, manageable determinant of infant birth weight among adolescents. Negative attitudes toward weight gain may adversely affect maternal weight gain. We hypothesized that (a) negative attitudes toward pregnancy weight gain are more common among younger pregnant adolescents, and (b) negative attitudes toward pregnancy weight gain adversely affect adolescent maternal weight gain. The study subjects, 99, radially diverse, pregnant 13 through 18 year olds, completed the 18-item, Likert-format, Pregnancy and Weight Gain Attitude Scale. Responses to the questionnaire indicated that most (83.8%) of the adolescents we interviewed had a positive attitude toward pregnancy weight gain when they entered prenatal care. Univariate analyses revealed that attitudes toward weight gain were unrelated to the respondents' ages but inversely related to their prepregnant weights (-0.16; p = 0.06) and the severity of their symptoms of depression (r = -0.26; p = 0.004). Attitudes toward weight gain were also directly related to their family support (r = 0.17; p = 0.06). Weight gain was significantly related to 4 of the 18 scale items but not to the total attitude scale score. We conclude that (a) the developmental task of formulating a positive body image does not foster more negative attitudes toward pregnancy weight gain among younger adolescents; (b) negative weight gain attitudes are most common among heavier adolescents, depressed adolescents, and adolescents who do not perceive their families as supportive; and (c) negative weight gain attitudes could adversely affect pregnancy weight gain.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1993 Jul,United States,1993,90

It demonstrates that stricter enforcement of immigration laws, by reducing the demand for or supply of illegal aliens, benefits all legal workers in the economy. The model is used to evaluate the impact of these policy changes on national income. Results indicate that national income does not necessarily fall when immigration controls are tightened. The existence of a union mitigates the negative welfare impact of a reduction in the number of illegal immigrants.""",International economic journal,1994 Summer,Korea (South),1994,90

Mortality rates by race and birthplace were compared for all causes of death and for specific causes. Although overall death rates for blacks generally exceeded those for whites (1224.8 per 100,000 inhabitants vs. 721.4 for males and 593.7 vs. 393.1 for females), foreign-born blacks had death rates (664.6 for males and 350.2 for females) slightly lower than those for whites. The most striking variation among blacks was among those aged 25 to 64 years. US-born black males were three times as likely (1588.9 vs. 525.2) and US-born black females were more than 2.5 times as likely (673.5 vs. 263.4) to die as were foreign-born blacks. Among US-born blacks AIDS, homicide, and cancer for males and AIDS, heart disease, and cancer for females were the most important determinants of excess deaths, defined as the difference between observed deaths and expected deaths; these causes of death account for about half of the excess deaths for each sex. Among whites natives generally had higher death rates than migrants, but less prominently and consistently so than for blacks. Excess mortality of blacks is largely explained by higher death rates of US-born compared with foreign-born Americans.",Human biology,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90

This article attempts to provide a better understanding of the relative contributions of parents and adult children who live together through detailed analysis of data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). We find unmarried children tend to benefit more from and contribute less to extended households than married children. Similarly, unmarried parents benefit more from living with children than married parents. Results of logistic regression show that financial need and need for assistance with activities of daily living wre important determinants of coresidence for both unmarried children and unmarried parents.

9823996,The impact of comorbidity on mortality following in-hospital diagnosis of tuberculosis.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Despite the availability of curative chemotherapy, mortality remains high among patients hospitalized for tuberculosis. Although the elevated mortality rate is often attributed to the presence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) or concomitant infection with the HIV, other factors must be contributory, especially among the HIV-negative population. Therefore, we performed a study to define the factors associated with mortality following the in-hospital diagnosis of tuberculosis in a region with low levels of MDRTB and coinfection with HIV. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The eight hospitals in the Barnes-Jewish-Christian (BJC) Health System, which is a network of community and tertiary-care level facilities serving the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area. PATIENTS: All 203 patients hospitalized with culture-positive tuberculosis at one of the BJC system hospitals between 1988 and 1996. INTERVENTIONS: Follow-up information was obtained by telephone interview and review of medical and public health records. Death was verified through a search of the death certificate registry of Missouri and the records of the Social Security Administration. Mortality was defined as death from any cause during the 14 months following the initial date of hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The cumulative all-cause mortality rate for this cohort was 28.1%. The incidence of HIV positivity was 7.9% and of MDRTB was 1.5%. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.0 to 7.0; p < 0.001) and the presence of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (AOR = 7.0; 95% CI = 3.7 to 13.3; p = 0.002) were the largest contributors to mortality. Other variables independently associated with mortality included the presence of malnutrition (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI = 2.1 to 4.9; p = 0.007), age > 60 years (AOR = 3.5; 95% CI = 2.4 to 5.2; p < 0.001), drug-induced immunosuppression (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.6 to 5.2; p = 0.018), and dyspnea at the time of hospital presentation (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.4 to 3.1; p = 0.048). Overall, 45.3% of the patients had a > 7-day delay in the suspicion of the diagnosis of tuberculosis and the institution of antituberculosis therapy following hospital admission. There was no association between the presence of these delays and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the 14-month mortality rate is high among patients diagnosed as having tuberculosis during hospitalization, despite low incidences of HIV infection and multidrug resistant disease. The factors that appear to contribute to this elevated mortality rate are markers of disease chronicity and severity of not only the tuberculosis, but also of the patient's underlying health status. Thus, while HIV positivity and multidrug resistance can be important determinants of mortality in some populations, other demographic factors and comorbid conditions may play a role as well. These data also suggest that tuberculosis is often superimposed on chronic illnesses that are important determinants of patient outcomes.",Chest,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90

The six-month cumulative life-table discontinuation rate was 7.6%. Menstrual side effects were the most common reasons given for early implant removal, although women who discontinued use were no more likely than those who continued with the method to report menstrual irregularities. Women who opted for early removal were more likely than those who continued with the method to experience headaches, hair loss, weight gain and arm infection. Logistic regression analysis indicates that dissatisfaction with prior contraceptive methods, a partner who wants a child within the next two years, perceived pressure from health care providers to choose the implant, exposure to negative media coverage and the number of implant side effects significantly predict early implant discontinuation. Women's social and demographic characteristics, Medicaid status and motivation to avoid an unplanned pregnancy were not significantly related to early removal.",Family planning perspectives,1996 Nov-Dec,United States,1996,90

Cohabitation started as an alternative way of living, developed into a temporary phase before marriage, and finally became a strategy for moving into a union gradually.... This article addresses the question whether or not individual past and current life-course experiences become increasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into marriage across female birth cohorts, and yet become decreasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into cohabitation across female birth cohorts. This question is examined using a non-proportional hazard model. Empirical evidence supports this hypothesis strongly, in that both past determinants such as family size or religion and current life-course determinants such as work or education change in their impact on cohabitation and marriage across birth cohorts.""",European sociological review,1996 May,England,1996,90

The findings, which were cross-validated in two samples, suggest that agreement is a function of four factors: which Big Five content domain the trait represents, how observable relevant behaviors are, how evaluative the trait is, and whether the self is one of the judges. Agreement was highest for traits related to Extraversion and lowest for traits related to Agreeableness. More observable and less evaluative traits elicited higher interjudge agreement. On average, self-peer agreement was lower than peer-peer agreement. However, this effect was limited to evaluative traits; for neutral traits, self-peer agreement was as high as peer-peer agreement. These findings suggest that self- and peer perception proceed through similar processes for neutral traits but not for highly evaluative traits, raising the possibility that self-perceptions become distorted when the trait is affectively charged.",Journal of personality,1993 Dec,United States,1993,90

By application of the model, the decrease of TFR of 2.78 between 1971 and 1981 was estimated to be contributed by widespread of contraception (68%), later marriage (49%), and increase of induced abortion (28%), through shortening of the length of postpartum breastfeeding showed negative effects (-32%), on the assumption that local data could be substituted for some national data. Compared with other countries, China was characterized by coexistence of strong fertility-inhibiting effects of nonmarriage, contraception, induced abortion, and relatively strong fertility-inhibiting effects of breastfeeding.

2295384,Psychosocial factors are associated with health care seeking rather than diagnosis in irritable bowel syndrome.,"The objective of this prospective study was to test the hypothesis that 6 reportedly important psychosocial factors were useful criteria for diagnosing the irritable bowel syndrome. Ninety-seven new patients with entry complaints of abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, or both underwent full evaluation by board-certified or -eligible gastroenterologists in an outpatient setting. The independent measures were 6 questionnaires concerning anxiety, depression, stress, lack of social support, somatization, and abnormal illness behavior. The dependent measure, irritable bowel syndrome, was defined as the absence of an organic disease explanation for patients' entry complaints. Two other board-certified gastroenterologists, independent of the study, made this determination. Their rating was based on full review of transcripts of patients' clinic visits, laboratory data, and the results of a 9-mo telephone follow-up to patients and their physicians. Sixty-five percent of the sample had no organic disease explanation for the entry symptoms, thereby representing irritable bowel syndrome. The psychosocial predictors did not show a significant association with irritable bowel syndrome; the power of the study was 0.86. Post hoc analysis revealed that patients with organic disease, as well as patients with irritable bowel syndrome, had significantly more (p less than 0.01) psychosocial abnormality than normal subjects, which likely contributed to the inability of the psychosocial predictors to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease. It was concluded that psychosocial criteria were of limited value in differentiating irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease but that they were determinants of health care seeking for the entire study group.",Gastroenterology,1990 Feb,United States,1990,90

Little is known about patterns of condom use among women in the United States. We provide a conceptualization of patterns of condom use and factors associated with these patterns. GOAL OF THIS STUDY: To examine patterns of condom use and associated characteristics among sexually active, never-married women in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of data from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth, which is a nationally representative sample of women in their childbearing years. RESULTS: Only a minority of sexually active, never-married women report using condoms, and even fewer report using them consistently. Women with characteristics traditionally associated with increased risk of infection with STD and HIV appear to be less likely to report using condoms and to report using them consistently. Women who report use of condoms to prevent STDs are more likely to report consistent condom use; less likely to cease using condoms; and more likely to initiate consistent condom use. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the need for innovative programming targeted for specific sexually active populations to promote both initiation and maintenance of use of condoms.",Sexually transmitted diseases,1993 Jul-Aug,United States,1993,90

Despite an increase in the movement of food around the world, there is still a wide spectrum of dietary patterns and the aim of the present study was to examine the association between a Mediterranean dietary pattern and mortality in a cohort of elderly people living in a North European Community. METHODS: Diet and nutritional status was studied among 202 men and women born 1914-1918 and living in a Danish Municipality (Roskilde) in 1988. They were followed for 6 years. RESULTS: A diet score, with seven dietary characteristics of the Mediterranean diet, was associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality. A one unit increase in the diet score predicted a 21% (95% confidence interval 2-36%) reduction in mortality. Subjects with high diet scores (> or = 4) had significantly higher plasma carotene levels than those with a low score and plasma carotene was negatively associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: A Mediterranean diet score predicts survival in a North European population. Plasma carotene may serve as an intermediate factor in this association.",International journal of epidemiology,1997 Feb,England,1997,90
1442721,Maternal nutrition and spontaneous preterm birth.,"Previous studies suggesting that maternal undernutrition increases the risk of preterm birth have suffered from several methodological shortcomings, including use of total gestational weight gain rather than net rate of gain in maternal tissue, inclusion of induced preterm deliveries, and error-prone gestational age measurements based solely on menstrual dates. The authors have attempted to overcome these shortcomings by investigating the potential etiologic roles of prepregnancy body mass index, net rate of maternal weight gain, height, and a number of other potential biological and sociodemographic determinants of spontaneous (i.e., noninduced) preterm birth in a cohort of 13,102 women with early ultrasound-confirmed gestational age who delivered at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, between January 1, 1980 and March 31, 1989. Total weight gain, but not body mass index, was highly significantly associated with spontaneous preterm birth, averaging 14.6, 12.5, 9.9, and 9.1 kg, in women delivering at 37 or more, less than 37, less than 34, and less than 32 completed weeks, respectively. Although the relation persisted when weight gain was expressed as an overall rate, it disappeared when the analysis was based on net rate; mean net rates of gain were 0.28, 0.29, 0.27, and 0.27 kg/week, respectively. On the basis of multiple logistic regression analyses, significant determinants of birth at less than 37 weeks included maternal short stature; noncompletion of high school; unmarried status; smoking; diabetes; urinary tract infection within 2 weeks of delivery; prepregnancy hypertension; severe pregnancy-induced hypertension; and previous history of preterm delivery, low birth weight, or neonatal death. Most of these factors retained their significance for birth at less than 34 and less than 32 weeks. In fact, the effect of low maternal education was even stronger at these more severe ""levels"" of preterm birth. The authors conclude that prepregnancy weight-for-height and gestational weight gain are not important determinants of spontaneous preterm birth and that some previous studies have mistaken an effect of shortened gestation for its cause. Other biologic and social determinants, however, indicate priorities for future research and intervention.",American journal of epidemiology,1992 Sep 1,United States,1992,90
9090699,The Pharmacists' Implementation of Pharmaceutical Care (PIPC) model.,"PURPOSE: Study purpose was to develop a theoretical framework that will explain pharmacists' behavior relative to the provision of pharmaceutical care. The model was developed from four attitude models by testing their predictive validity relative to pharmaceutical care implementation. Four hypotheses and one research question were investigated to identify determinants of behavioral intention and behavior. METHODS: 617 community pharmacists in the state of Florida, U.S.A., were surveyed twice using mail survey methodology to collect data. The first survey assessed community pharmacists' attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, past behavior recency, self-efficacies, instrumental beliefs and affect. The second survey assessed pharmacists' behavior relative to the implementation of pharmaceutical care. After establishing reliability and validity of measures, regression analysis was used to test hypotheses and research question investigated. RESULTS: The Pharmacists' Implementation of Pharmaceutical Care (PIPC) model developed postulates that (i) behavior is directly determined by past behavior recency, behavioral intention and perceived behavioral control; (ii) psychological appraisal processes-instrumental beliefs, self-efficacies, and affect toward means-influence behavior through past behavior recency; and (iii) behavioral intention is determined by attitude, social norm and perceived behavioral control. CONCLUSIONS: The PIPC model provides a formal scientifically validated theoretical framework which can be used to design successful intervention for pharmaceutical care implementation.",Pharmaceutical research,1997 Feb,United States,1997,90
9871112,Identification of the high-virulence clone of group B streptococci in Mexican isolates by growth characteristics at 40 degrees C.,Group B streptococci (GBS) colonizing the vagina and rectum of pregnant women cause invasive disease of the offspring in a small number of cases. The immune status of the host and differences in virulence among strains appear to be the main determinants for neonatal infection. A high-virulence clone (HVC) was proposed to cause much of the morbidity and mortality when a collection of GBS isolates was examined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. HVC isolates could be further distinguished by their inability to grow at 40 degrees C. This characteristic was used in the present study to examine a collection of 57 GBS isolates from Mexico City for the HVC. Three serotype III invasive strains were classified in the HVC. The other eleven invasive strains and all carrier isolates had growth curves unaffected at 40 degrees C. These results demonstrate the presence of the HVC in Mexico. Such a low prevalence could explain in part the low rate of GBS invasive neonatal disease in Mexico.,Current microbiology,1999 Feb,United States,1999,90
10095220,Determinants of dentists' decisions to initiate dental implant treatment: a judgment analysis.,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Do psychosocial patient characteristics influence the decision of a dentist in recommending implant treatment? PURPOSE: This study assessed the importance that dental general practitioners attach to psychosocial patient characteristics when judging the suitability of these patients for dental implant treatment. METHOD AND MATERIAL: The judgment strategy of 30 Dutch dental practitioners was studied by using 2 tasks. Dentists first judged a series of written scenarios representing fictitious patients, each patient being characterized by 4 psychosocial aspects to determine the patients' suitability for implant treatment. The second task involved rank ordering 14 patient characteristics according to their importance in implant treatment decisions. RESULTS: Dentists judged the personal appearance of the patient and, to a lesser degree, the patient's socioeconomic status to influence decisions to treat. However, these characteristics are ranked as quite unimportant in decision making, whereas motivation, oral hygiene, and level of neuroticism were the most important patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The results on the 2 tasks were clearly not in agreement. There was a substantial disagreement between what dentists say to be important characteristics (rank order task) and the characteristics they actually use to judge the suitability for implant treatment (scenario task). Moreover, it appeared that agreement among the dentists is quite low, especially for the scenario task.",The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,1999 Apr,United States,1999,90
2366055,Supportive housing for the chronically mentally ill. Matching clients with community environments.,"The need for permanent housing for the chronically mentally ill has received a great deal of attention over the last several years. One response to the problem has been the development of supportive housing, that is, non-facility-based permanent homes with placement based on clients' functional capabilities and preferences. However, little research has focused on assessing the match between clients and environmental requirements. This study begins to identify the social and clinical characteristics of clients that contribute to selection into different types of housing environments. Ninety-one clients were sampled from the supportive housing services of a major provider in two New England states. Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability that clients will be placed into apartments vs. other, more restricted settings, based on their clinical and social characteristics. Findings show that the primary determinants of placement were clinical severity, early family history, and adequacy of family support. The less severely ill and better functioning the client, the more likely that he or she was placed in an apartment. This was mitigated, however, by the availability and adequacy of family support. In addition, clients with early family disruptions were also less likely to be placed in apartments. Findings are discussed in light of their implications for providing permanent housing placements for chronically mentally ill persons and for factors in future research to evaluate the success of placement.",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,1990 Jul,United States,1990,90
8409134,Food preferences and food habits of patients with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine and compare the food preferences of patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with those of age- and sex-matched controls. DESIGN: We administered two questionnaires, one assessing preferences for 88 food items (according to a nine-point hedonic scale) and the other assessing factors influencing dietary habits. SUBJECTS: Thirty-three patients on HD, 17 patients on CAPD, and 30 control subjects with normal renal function. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 88 foods were grouped into 14 classes to compare preferences. Taste aversions, food preparation details, and psychological and social determinants of food intake were also compared. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The preference ratings of the HD, CAPD, and control groups were compared using analysis of variance. The dietary habits results were examined using a chi 2 analysis. RESULTS: Sweet foods (P = .002), vegetables (P = .003), red meats (P = .010), and fish and poultry (P = .015) were less pleasant for patients on HD than for control subjects. Red meats (P = .019), fish and poultry (P = .032), and eggs (P = .005) were less pleasant for patients on HD than for patients on CAPD. Red meat was the most unpopular food group for all dialysis patients. The most common factor affecting dietary intake was a loss of interest in food and/or cooking. CONCLUSION: We conclude that chronic renal failure influences patients' food preferences and food habits. Knowledge of these preferences will help dietitians plan more adequate and enjoyable diets for such patients.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1993 Oct,United States,1993,90
8062177,Early detection of cancer. Psychologic and social dimensions.,"Major strides in early detection research can be attributed to social and behavioral research. Social scientists have been involved in research determining the epidemiologic basis of and the cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic disease. The availability of well accepted screening tests has been a barrier to early detection research, especially in the area of men's health. Early detection research has focused on the individual and system levels. Theoretical models are being adapted for early detection from smoking research and are a strength of current work. These models explain why people participate in early detection and how behavior change can occur. In studying system barriers to early detection, intervention efforts have been focused in the community and in the medical care delivery system. Methodologic issues are beginning to emerge, including measuring of program outcomes, and the appropriate research designs for community studies. Except for immigrant populations, initial screening rates are high, and the periodicity of screening becomes the outcome of choice. Some of these problems are the direct result of the success of research and public education efforts to increase cancer screening. The following are priorities for the next decade: theory driven research on behavior change and on interventions; the social determinants of physicians' participation in screening; process evaluation to relate community efforts to outcomes; and reductions in the stage at which cancer is diagnosed as an outcome measure.",Cancer,1994 Aug 15,United States,1994,90
8465065,Determinants of estrogen replacement therapy use in northern Italy.,"Socio-demographic characteristics, general lifestyle habits and menstrual and reproductive history were compared in 83 women aged 45 years or more who had at some time used estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and 1759 never users interviewed as control subjects in the framework of a large case-control survey on risk factors for gynecological neoplasms conducted in Northern Italy. ERT use was strongly related to social class and level of education. The odds ratio of ""ever"" use was 3.0 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.8-5.1) for women with 12 or more years of education, compared with those with less than 7 years. No relationship emerged between marital status and ERT use, but parous women tended to be less frequently ever users than nulliparous, and ERT use decreased with increasing number of births (chi 2 1 trend = 10.51, p. = 0.001). Post-menopausal women reported more frequent ERT use than peri-menopausal ones, and among post-menopausal subjects the use was more frequent in those reporting earlier age at menopausal (chi 2 1 trend = 5.33, p = 0.02). There was no association between smoking habits and ERT use, but Quetelet's index was inversely related to the use of ERT.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1993,France,1993,90

First cousin marriages were encountered in 32.03%, second cousin in 6.8%, distant relation in 10.5%, and no relation in 50% of all marriages, respectively. Inbreeding coefficients were compared with those of other countries. The most important variables affecting inbreeding were social tradition, religion, education, and place of residence--urban vs. rural. Secular trends appear rather stable since the early decades of the twentieth century, especially for first cousin marriages. Jordan society showed a deeply rooted traditional behavioral pattern when inbreeding is considered.",American journal of medical genetics,1992 Jul 15,United States,1992,90
8858547,Determinants of life-course variation in the frequency of alcohol consumption: meta-analysis of studies from the collaborative alcohol-related longitudinal project.,"OBJECTIVE: This report evaluates the relative contribution of predictors of change in the frequency of alcohol consumption among drinkers, based on the quantitative synthesis of data from 27 longitudinal studies of the general population. The analysis has two objectives: (1) to evaluate the impact of selected demographic characteristics on the magnitude and trajectory of change in drinking across multiple samples, and (2) to assess the influence of methodological characteristics on the consistency of results across studies. METHOD: Raw data from studies including two serial measures of the frequency of alcohol consumption are analyzed. Fixed, random and mixed effects models for meta-analysis are used to pool measures across observations and model the influence of predictors on variability between results. RESULTS: Gender-based variation in the patterning of change is present across all observations, but concentrated in early periods of the life course. Age displays significant predictive effects across all observations, but statistically uniform results are obtained for subjects aged 30 and over. The national origin of study predicts larger amounts of variation than do other demographic predictors in the models. Significant effects are observed for several methodological characteristics of studies. Variation among effect estimates is associated with differences between samples in the interval between first and final measurements, the date of first measurement (a proxy for the historical context of the sample), the percentage retention of subjects between measurements and the time frame of the original alcohol measure. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the synthesis of data from multiple longitudinal samples, this study (1) characterizes normative developmental patterning in the frequency of alcohol consumption and demonstrates the varying effects of demographic factors across the life-course: (2) indicates the key influence of cultural and historical context on the establishment of drinking patterns; and (3) confirms the impact of methodological differences on variation in the results of studies.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1996 Sep,United States,1996,90
9353673,"Infection with Helicobacter pylori and parasites, social class and cancer.","Three genera of parasites are known or suspected risk factors for cancer in humans: Schistosoma, Opisthorchis and Clonorchis. No adequate information is available on the determinants of infections related to social class. Infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is an important cause of stomach cancer. Studies, in particular from the United Kingdom and the United States of America, strongly suggest that social class factors, especially those acting during childhood, are determinants of the infection, with odds ratios of seroprevalence of the order of 1.5-5 for lower social class as compared with higher social class. A conservative estimate of the contribution of social class, acting through an increased prevalence of H. pylori infection, to the burden of stomach cancer gives a figure of over 50,000 stomach cancers per year worldwide, or 8% of all stomach cancers. In countries with both high and low prevalence of infection with H. pylori, it is likely that a sizeable proportion of this difference is due to social-class-related risk factors of infection.",IARC scientific publications,1997,France,1997,90
9698018,Secular trends in social patterning of cardiovascular risk factor levels in Sweden. The Northern Sweden MONICA Study 1986-1994. Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease.,"OBJECTIVES: In the Northern Sweden MONICA Study, levels of cardiovascular risk factors were determined in 1986, 1990 and 1994. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in cardiovascular risk factors, and to analyse the relationship between levels of risk factors and level of education. DESIGN: Cardiovascular risk factors were determined in cross-sectional population studies of randomly selected 25-64 year old men and women in 1986, 1990 and 1994 (a total of 4742 individuals). RESULTS: Throughout the years 1986 to 1994, cardiovascular risk factor levels showed a marked social pattern, generally being more favourable among people with a university education. Serum cholesterol levels declined in all educational groups, but blood pressure declined significantly only in women with a university education. Body mass index increased, most markedly in men with university and in women with a secondary school education. Prevalence of cigarette smoking decreased significantly in young men. It increased markedly in low-educated women so that the social gaps in smoking widened substantially over time. The improved level of education in the population at large was calculated to explain only a little of the risk factor changes between 1986 and 1994. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in risk factor levels in different educational groups have been more diverging for women than for men. The most marked change in risk factor levels has been the decline in total serum cholesterol for both men and women in all educational groups.",Journal of internal medicine,1998 Jul,England,1998,90
10168755,Household income and health care expenditures in Mexico.,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of household health expenditures in Mexico. Our analysis involves the estimation of household monetary health care expenditures, using the economic and demographic characteristics of the household as covariates. We pay particular attention to the impact of household income on health expenditures, estimating the elasticity of health care expenditures with respect to income for different income groups and according to health insurance status. For the empirical analysis, we use the Mexican National Survey of Income and Expenditures of 1989. Our principle findings show that monetary health expenditures by Mexican households are sensitive to changes in household income levels and that the group which is most responsive to changes in income levels in the lower-income uninsured group. This suggests that in times of economic crisis, these households reduce cash expenditures on health care by proportionately more than higher-income and insured households.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",1997 Jun,Ireland,1997,90

Politics vs. economics in China's brain drain.,"""This study, based on 273 face-to-face interviews with students, scholars, and former residents of China in the United States in 1993, uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to explain people's views about returning to China. Although less than 9 percent of interviewees had concrete plans to return, over 32 percent were positively disposed to returning in the future. Key background variables that affect that decision are people's age, sex, social background in China, and their views about returning when they first left China. Concern about children's future was not significant, but having a wife abroad greatly increased the desire to stay abroad. Why people chose not to return varied significantly between people [who had] children and those who didn't.""",Studies in comparative international development,1997 Spring,United States,1997,90

The depth of depression and the presence of other psychiatric problems are the most significant determinants of the duration of a depressive episode. The number of previous depressive episodes and age at first depression are the most significant determinants of the risk of future depression. However, the presence of interpersonal and social problems, other psychiatric or physical disorders, and the type of depression (e.g. depression as one ""pole' in a bipolar disorder, dysthymia) are also factors of importance. The aim of maintenance treatment (i.e., continued treatment after the patient's recovery) is to prevent recurrence of the depressive episode, whereas the purpose of preventive treatment is to impede the occurrence of new depressive episodes.",Nordisk medicin,1996 Oct,Sweden,1996,90

Of those registered, 117 had died by the end 1997, 69 at home, 40 at a hospice, seven at emergency facilities, and one abroad. Comparison of those who died at a hospice and those who died at home showed no significant differences to exist between the two subgroups in age, gender, diagnosis, stage of disease, degree of symptom control, or treatment given. Psychosocial factors were the most important determinants of whether the patients died at home. The availability of psychological support for family members, and access to a hospital bed when they needed to relax, were also important factors, as were patient and family consent to home care.",Lakartidningen,1999 Feb 3,Sweden,1999,90
1428217,Time trends of smoking cessation: a micro-population computer simulation model.,"The Micro-population model of Risk-group Dynamics (MRD) approaches smoking behavior at the level of the individual and integrates physiological and social factors to describe the evolution of behavior change in the population. MRD is innovative in several ways: (1) the model describes mathematically the interactions among these behavioral factors; (2) the model accounts for both the variability of these factors among different persons and the universality of basic rules describing these factors in all individuals; and (3) the model can be applied to various types of populations and a wide range of intervention strategies. MRD combines the physiological, psychological and social determinants into a hazard function for relapse to smoking. This hazard function is then organized into a three term expression incorporating: a baseline hazard characteristic to each individual, a decreasing term for the diminishing aspect of the initial hazard and an effect of external interventions. The model gives promising results when applied to the Multiple Risk Factors Intervention Trial (MRFIT) data using the assumptions of a Weibull distribution for the baseline hazard, a negative exponential for the decrease in the initial hazard and a constant intensity for the external intervention.",International journal of bio-medical computing,1992 Oct,Ireland,1992,90

A prospective study.,"This prospective study focused on childhood and adult psychosocial determinants of blood pressure (BP) measured at working age, including work factors, individual characteristics and socioeconomic factors. Data had been collected over 20 years ago from a sample representative of Finnish children. For this follow-up, 150 subjects responded to a questionnaire and attended a personal examination at the mean age of 37 yr. Hierarchical regression analyses were made for women and men. A split half procedure was applied for the control of possible chance associations. Work conditions and perceived health were not associated with BP. Social conditions in youth were powerful predictors of high adult BP for men. Poor living conditions in youth explained 16% of their diastolic BP and 9% of their systolic BP. The result may be regarded as strong evidence for early determinants of hypertension.",Journal of psychosomatic research,1993 Sep,England,1993,90
12320037,An economic analysis of pregnancy resolution in Virginia: specific as to race and residence.,"This study analyses an economic model of pregnancy resolution; that is, a model of the choice by a pregnant woman to abort her fetus or carry it to term. This analysis, using an analytical model derived from the household utility framework, adds to previous research by presenting race- and residence-specific estimates of how individual characteristics, history of abortion, and the community-based factors determine women's choices of giving birth vs. aborting. The main data for estimating the model were drawn from the 1984 vital statistics of all induced abortions and live births in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The major findings indicate that low parental education, high maternal age, previous early abortions, and the availability of abortion providers all significantly reduce the probability of choosing the live birth option. Married status and the availability of family planning clinics significantly increase the probability of the live birth option. The findings also suggest that women's choices between abortion and live birth vary substantially with race (White vs. Black) and residential (urban vs. rural) location.",Journal of population economics,1995,Germany,1995,90

Using a subsample of currently married women from the 1986 Liberian Demographic and Health Survey, the study examines the fertility of five religious groups: Catholic, Protestant, Moslem, traditional, and other women. Overall, the findings are more consistent with the characteristic hypothesis, because the small fertility differentials by religious affiliation are largely accounted for by differences in the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of these women.",Journal of biosocial science,1994 Oct,England,1994,90

Only 37 per cent of parents were satisfied with disclosure. Parents were more likely to be satisfied if they felt that the professional carrying out the disclosure had a sympathetic, understanding and approachable manner, and was direct and communicated well; if they had been given sufficient information and opportunities to ask questions; and if they were from a manual social-class background. Factors in the procedure of the disclosure, such as the timing, were not significantly related to satisfaction.

10320501,A socio-ecological approach to understanding barriers to prenatal care for women of low income.,"This paper critically examines the notion of barriers as conceptualized in the literature and suggests an expanded orientation to more fully appreciate its complexity. This alternative approach not only takes into account factors and processes relevant to the individual that create constraints to utilization, but also acknowledges influences on the design and delivery of health care. These latter considerations determine the availability and characteristics of programmes and services that may or may not encourage or enable participation by persons of low income. A socio-ecological model is proposed that compels health care practitioners and researchers to acknowledge the many influences on utilization behaviour. The literature on barriers to prenatal care is subsequently reviewed and evaluated, with consideration given to the range of behavioural determinants suggested by the model. Finally, a case is made for qualitative methods for inquiry to further enhance knowledge about factors and processes influencing use of the health care system, including prenatal care. It is argued that these approaches lead to enhanced appreciation of behaviour as a social product and are consistent with the ideology of health promotion.",Journal of advanced nursing,1999 May,England,1999,90

8398220,Predicting physical activity change in men and women in two New England communities.,"We describe the predictors of change in physical activity in a population-derived sample of residents of two New England communities. In 1986-1987 and again in 1990-1991, we assessed the self-reported physical activity of 1,081 survey respondents using a single question concerning the frequency of exercise-induced sweating. We measured and analyzed sociodemographic variables, cardiovascular disease risk factors, health knowledge and beliefs, social support variables, and exercise performance variables at baseline as potential predictors of physical activity change. We defined physical activity change in subjects as follows: maintainers (12.2%) persisted with > or = 3 times per week of activity, adopters (16.0%) increased activity to > or = 3 times per week, quitters (11.9%) decreased activity to < 3 times per week, and sedentary (59.9%) individuals persisted with < 3 times per week of activity. Using polychotomous multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that short-term success with exercise and weight loss, school children's recommendation of exercise, and work outside the home predicted adoption or maintenance of increased physical activity in women. For men, short-term success with exercise and weight loss and health beliefs regarding the role of exercise in preventing heart attacks and stroke were the major determinants of maintaining or adopting increased physical activity. This identification of the predictors of physical activity change provides the rationale for future sex-specific strategies aimed at increasing regular physical activity and long-term adherence to an active lifestyle.",American journal of preventive medicine,1993 Jul-Aug,Netherlands,1993,90
7957819,Determinants of couple agreement in U.S. fertility decisions.,"An analysis of data from 8,450 women interviewed in 1988 for the National Survey of Family Growth finds that teenagers, never-married women, black women and those with less than a high school education are less likely than other women to have a birth that is jointly desired by both partners; 29%, 35%, 45% and 51% of births, respectively, are wanted by both partners, compared with an overall average of 69%. Third and higher order births are also less likely than earlier births to be jointly planned--58%, compared with 69% of first births and 76% of second births. In situations in which the birth is not jointly planned, black women, unmarried women, teenagers and women having third or higher order births are all significantly more likely than other women in their race, marital status, age and birth-order categories to have a birth when the man's preference is unknown. Never-married women are significantly more likely than married women to have a birth when the woman desires one but the man does not, while black women are significantly more likely than white women to have a birth that the man wanted but that the woman did not.",Family planning perspectives,1994 Jul-Aug,United States,1994,90

Drawing on an attributional model of expressed emotion it was predicted that high EE relatives would have less knowledge of the illness and would attribute negative symptoms to the personality, rather than the illness, of the sufferer. Thirty-one caregivers of schizophrenic patients were interviewed. Results indicated that EE status was related to knowledge, coping and causal attributions of negative symptoms. Low EEs, as compared with High EEs, tended to have more knowledge of the illness and to cope better with the patient, and were less likely to attribute the cause of negative symptoms to the sufferer's personality. Support was therefore obtained for the utility of an attributional model in attempting to understand the determinants of levels of EE.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,1992 Sep,England,1992,90

Calculations of the number of Navajo women at risk of unintended pregnancy suggest that several hundred such pregnancies would have occurred as a result of the withdrawal of intrauterine devices from the United States' market. Analysis of birthrate data confirms this estimate: approximately four to five percent of Navajo births in 1988 may have been due to this market withdrawal.

2236224,Motivational considerations in physical activity involvement.,"The purpose of this article is to examine movement science research on personal and social-environmental motivational influences in physical activity contexts. Motivation is defined as a process in which internal and external factors direct and energize thoughts, feelings, and actions. Motivation is described as a consequence of meaning, which is derived from a combination of personal and social factors, including personal goals or incentives, expectations of personal efficacy, movement-related perceptual and affective experiences, and social and physical features of the environment. Recent literature from sport and exercise psychology is presented on these variables, their determinants, and their consequences for choice, effort, persistence, and performance behavior in exercise and sport contexts.",Physical therapy,1990 Dec,United States,1990,90
1283031,[Are sex differences in schizophrenia stable on a transnational basis?].,"The ABC-Schizophrenia-Study (Hafner et al. 1991), investigating a large, representative sample of 267 first admissions, did not find any gender differences in the lifetime morbidity risk for this disorder or in the frequency of nuclear symptoms in male and female schizophrenic patients. Marked gender differences, however, could be detected regarding the age at onset and its distribution and regarding illness behavior and certain secondary symptoms. The transnational stability of these findings was tested with data from the WHO studies ""On Assessment and Reduction of Psychiatric Disability"" (including 510 patients from 7 centres) and on ""Determinants of Outcome of Severe Mental Disorders"" (with 1,292 patients from 11 centres). Studying pooled data sets from the studies minimized centre-specific selection effects on sampling. Major results of the ABC-Schizophrenia-Study were validated: the lack of a gender difference in the morbidity risk (cumulative lifetime incidence rates) for schizophrenia; lower mean age at first admission in males; an early, marked peak in the distribution of the age at onset in males; a later and broader peak in this distribution in females with a second peak after age 40-45; equal frequency of nuclear symptoms in both sexes; gender differences in some specific contents of delusions, secondary affective symptoms, social adjustment and illness behavior.","Schweizer Archiv fur Neurologie und Psychiatrie (Zurich, Switzerland : 1985)",1992,Switzerland,1992,90
10723646,The correspondence between intention to avoid childbearing and subsequent fertility: a prospective analysis.,"CONTEXT: Retrospective studies of pregnancy intendedness have revealed some characteristics that can help identify which women are more likely than others to experience an unintended birth. A comparison of these findings with those from a prospective analysis may shed greater light on the characteristics associated with unintended pregnancy. METHODS: Data were taken from the 1988 National Survey of Fertility Growth and a telephone reinterview of respondents conducted in 1990. Separate analyses were conducted of women intending to postpone childbearing for at least three years and of women intending to forgo all future childbearing. Logistic regression models were used to identify the effects of social and demographic characteristics, as well as change in marital status and certainty of intentions, on the odds of experiencing a birth in the interval between interviews. RESULTS: Only 10% of women intending to postpone pregnancy for more than three years and 8% of respondents seeking to forgo future childbearing had a birth in the interval between interviews. (These births, referred to as unpredicted births in this article, are roughly analogous to those labeled unintended in retrospective analyses.) Women with incomes below the poverty level were 2-3 times as likely as women with incomes between 100% and 199% of poverty to experience an unpredicted birth. Race was not a significant factor among women intending to avoid future childbearing, and became nonsignificant among those intending to postpone when change in marital status and contraceptive status were taken into account. Women aged 35 and older who wanted no more children were significantly less likely than women aged 20-29 to have an unpredicted birth. Women aged 30-34 who wanted to postpone childbearing were roughly 70% less likely than women aged 20-29 to experience an unpredicted birth. Overall, women who were at risk for a pregnancy but not practicing contraception were 2-3 times more likely than women using an effective method to have an unpredicted birth. CONCLUSIONS: There are at least two potential explanations for instances where the correlates of unintended births in the prospective analysis differ from those identified in retrospective studies. Certain subgroups of women may be more likely to classify births as wanted when they are asked retrospectively; alternatively, they may be more likely to experience changes in their living conditions that alter their fertility intentions.",Family planning perspectives,1999 Sep-Oct,United States,1999,90
10609591,The social determinants of emergency department and hospital use by injection drug users in Canada.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and human immunodeficiency (HIV) status of a cohort of injection drug users (IDUs) on their self-reported health service utilization. DESIGN: Interviewer-administered questionnaire. METHODS: IDUs who had injected illicit drugs within the previous month were recruited through street outreach. They underwent serology for HIV-1 and questionnaires on demographics, drug using behaviors, housing status, and health service utilization (hospitalization overnight and emergency department visits) in the previous 6 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent associations with the use of health services. RESULTS: Of 1,103 cohort participants, 65% were male, 63% were white, and 23% were HIV positive. Cocaine was the most frequently injected drug used. Almost half (47%) had used health services in the previous 6 months. The following variables were associated independently with health service utilization (adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval): unstable housing, defined as living primarily in a hotel, boarding room, or transition house or on the street in the past 6 months (1.44; 1.11-1.86); female gender (1.45; 1.11-1.89); HIV-positive status (1.43; 1.06-1.92); injection of cocaine (1.50; 1.12-2.02); and primary care I physician visit in past 6 months (1.91; 1.39-2.64). CONCLUSION: IDUs with unstable housing were more likely to report emergency department and hospital use, which may be a reflection of their disorganized lifestyle or poorer health status. Further studies are required to assess the effect on the health status and health care use of IDUs of interventions that increase the availability of safe, affordable housing.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,1999 Dec,United States,1999,90
1949098,The contribution of the World Fertility Surveys to an understanding of the relationship between women's work and fertility.,"A consistent negative association between women's paid work and fertility in developed countries has emerged from many years of research. Results from research in developing countries are more ambiguous, with as many examples of a positive association as of a negative one. Lack of data comparability has often hampered interpretation of results. The World Fertility Surveys (WFS)--undertaken in 40 developing countries between 1974-81, using a common core questionnaire that included numerous questions on women's work--have created a unique opportunity to evaluate this association in a comparative framework. This article reviews and interprets the major findings on the work-fertility relationship from this and other published research on women's work and fertility, and assesses the data limitations. The article concludes with recommendations for the treatment of women's work in the design of future fertility and family planning surveys.",Studies in family planning,1991 May-Jun,United States,1991,90
8784533,"[From disease to health: the individual, society, environment and culture].","With the onset of science-based medicine in the mid-19th century, environmental factors were almost totally discarded as health determinants. This was a complete rupture with the medical thinking which had prevailed since the time of Hippocrates. Yet, for the vast majority of mankind, harmony with environmental reality remains the most important determinant of good or ill health. This scission explains to a great extent the differences between traditional and Western medicine, which are based on entirely different concepts and on distinct paradigms. Environment as a health determinant--in its broadest definition to include both physical and social environments--is again being considered of importance as a result of better understanding of causality factors, and because of the influence of disciplines such as ecology and epidemiology. Here we show that human societies can develop different methods of adjusting to their environments, some of which would increase the risks of disease and others which can be considered as resistance factors of a social nature. Societies and individuals alike are not equal in relation to health risks.","Sante (Montrouge, France)",1995 Nov-Dec,France,1995,90

9711481,AIDS control and the workplace: the role of occupational health services in South Africa.,"AIDS interventions typically fail to address the disjuncture between private behaviors and the social determinants of HIV infection. Data from a telephone survey of manufacturing companies and a postal survey of occupational health nurses in the Western Cape, South Africa, were used to explore the possible role of occupational health services in prevention and control of AIDS. The author found limited evidence of worker involvement in AIDS programs, particularly in companies with occupational health professionals. The management of sexually transmitted diseases was incomplete. Mandatory pre-employment testing of workers for HIV was not widespread. Respondents' opinions on priorities for AIDS prevention and control reflected a preoccupation with knowledge transfer. To ensure their effectiveness, workplace AIDS programs must improve worker participation and integrate AIDS prevention in general workplace health and safety programs. In addition, education programs must develop objectives within a critical theoretical understanding of the behavioral issues relevant to AIDS prevention, and must emphasize the empowerment of women in the workplace. In the context of the present restructuring of health services in South Africa, occupational health services, using the strategies outlined, can make a major contribution to national AIDS prevention and control.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1998,United States,1998,90

The experience of Italian women.,"""The purpose of this paper has been to assess empirically the question of whether women's growing economic independence, resulting from better education, is one of the major factors in determining the timing of marriage and motherhood in Italy.... We have analysed the life histories of a sample of Italian women from different cohorts, collected on the occasion of the National Survey on Family Structures and Behaviours carried on by the National Institute of Statistics.... The effect of level of education is negative. That is, it increases the age of entry into marriage. However, the size of the effect is small and seems limited to the passage from youth to adulthood, because the longer time the woman spends in the educational system increases the age at which she feels herself ready to marry. As far as the timing of the first child, it is almost independent of educational attainment, once marital status is taken into account."" (SUMMARY IN FRE AND ITA)",Genus,1992 Jul-Dec,Germany,1992,90

Multivariate analysis is used to explore whether reported ethnic differentials in contraceptive use can be attributed to ethnicity or to other characteristics that distinguish the ethnic groups. Overall, the findings are generally more consistent with the 'characteristics' hypothesis, because contraceptive use differentials by ethnic group is accounted for by differences in socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of these women. However, for the Fante/other Akans, even after the necessary controls, ethnicity continued to emerge as a significant determinant of contraceptive use.

8171295,Quality of Life--rationale and methods for developing a disease-specific instrument for inflammatory bowel disease.,"Quality of Life (QOL) is a composite descriptor applied to an unlimited spectrum of tangible and intangible parameters of life satisfaction and capacity. Because of the breadth of determinants of QOL, most researchers prefer to focus on a specific segment of it, such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Generally, HRQOL indices incorporate physical, emotional and social aspects of both health perception and function. Most instruments are also subjective and quantitative. As in clinical trials, several elements are critical to the development of a HRQOL measure. Most importantly, the putative application of the instrument should be determined beforehand. The clinical setting and disease-specific population of interest must be identified. The questionnaire must be as simple as possible and easy to administer. The final instrument must be shown to be a valid measure of HRQOL, which is reproducible, with limited variability and observer bias on repeated administrations, when no clinical change has occurred. If applicable, the instrument should demonstrate responsiveness to important changes in clinical status. Finally, the value of the instrument in relevant clinical studies should be demonstrated. The critical phases of development of the McMaster IBDQ are outlined. The IBDQ is a quantitative index of HRQOL intended as a measure of therapeutic outcome for clinical trials in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology.

9353673,"Infection with Helicobacter pylori and parasites, social class and cancer.","Three genera of parasites are known or suspected risk factors for cancer in humans: Schistosoma, Opisthorchis and Clonorchis. No adequate information is available on the determinants of infections related to social class. Infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is an important cause of stomach cancer. Studies, in particular from the United Kingdom and the United States of America, strongly suggest that social class factors, especially those acting during childhood, are determinants of the infection, with odds ratios of seroprevalence of the order of 1.5-5 for lower social class as compared with higher social class. A conservative estimate of the contribution of social class, acting through an increased prevalence of H. pylori infection, to the burden of stomach cancer gives a figure of over 50,000 stomach cancers per year worldwide, or 8% of all stomach cancers. In countries with both high and low prevalence of infection with H. pylori, it is likely that a sizeable proportion of this difference is due to social-class-related risk factors of infection.",IARC scientific publications,1997,France,1997,90

Current controversies in the British debate about health.,"This article uses the current controversies in the British debate about health to illustrate the need to theorize, and therefore critically evaluate, the links between medicine and health policies, including health care policies. The medical model of health is deeply embedded in institutional practices in many countries, and while this model has attracted deserved criticism in recent years, an alternative social model, or one that incorporates indispensable aspects of the medical model, has attracted much less attention and requires sustained development. Comparative study of patterns of inequality in health, and especially of the correlation between material deprivation and premature mortality, necessarily reveals causal determinants of both health and ill-health in populations and invites ambitious programs to develop a social model.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1990,United States,1990,90

The data for the analysis were obtained from the 1983 Census of Population conducted by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics. The analysis focuses on men who immigrated to Israel between 1979 to 1983.... The data reveal that the likelihood of finding employment, the mode of labor market incorporation, and the size of the occupational cost are significantly affected by geocultural origin, occupation in the country of origin, and individual-level demographic and human capital resources. The meaning of the differentiated effects are discussed in detail.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction across various social groups and examine the determinants and health consequences of these disorders. DESIGN: Analysis of data from the National Health and Social Life Survey, a probability sample study of sexual behavior in a demographically representative, 1992 cohort of US adults. PARTICIPANTS: A national probability sample of 1749 women and 1410 men aged 18 to 59 years at the time of the survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction as well as negative concomitant outcomes. RESULTS: Sexual dysfunction is more prevalent for women (43%) than men (31%) and is associated with various demographic characteristics, including age and educational attainment. Women of different racial groups demonstrate different patterns of sexual dysfunction. Differences among men are not as marked but generally consistent with women. Experience of sexual dysfunction is more likely among women and men with poor physical and emotional health. Moreover, sexual dysfunction is highly associated with negative experiences in sexual relationships and overall well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that sexual dysfunction is an important public health concern, and emotional problems likely contribute to the experience of these problems.",JAMA,1999 Feb 10,United States,1999,90

In the case of [Soviet] Central Asia, neither the various steps to bring down labour intensity in the farm sector, nor the falling standard of living in rural areas, could bring about migration from rural to urban areas. This was because in traditional societies economic mechanisms are not effective unless they are complemented by appropriate social and cultural policies.

9788211,Pupil-class determinants of aggressive and victim behaviour in pupils.,"BACKGROUND: Aggressive behaviour in pupils is expressed in, e.g., bullying, sexual harassment, and violence. Different kinds of variables could be relevant in explaining a pupil's aggressive or victim behaviour. AIMS: To develop a multilevel theoretical and empirical explanation for different kinds of aggressive and victim behaviour displayed by pupils in a classroom and school environment. SAMPLES: A national survey was carried out to identify different kinds of aggressive and victim behaviour displayed by pupils and to assess other variables related to pupils, classes, and schools. A total of 1998 pupils from 100 third and fourth year classes attending 71 different secondary schools took part in the research. METHODS: Data were analysed by a series of secondary multilevel analyses using the MLA-program. RESULTS: Being a boy, being more extravert, being more disagreeable, coming across fewer teachers with positive teaching behaviour, and attending a lower type of secondary school, help explain why someone is a perpetrator as such. Being a boy, being more disagreeable, being more emotionally unstable, being open to new ideas, and seeing more teachers as being strict, function as explanatory pupil variables for victim behaviour. Other pupil level variables determine more specific aggressive and victim behaviour aspects. Various other class level and school level variables are relevant, too. CONCLUSIONS: Personal and environmental pupil variables are more important than class variables but class variables are in turn more important than school variables in explaining a pupil's aggressive and victim behaviour.",The British journal of educational psychology,1998 Sep,England,1998,90
9989914,Food-based classification of eating episodes (FBCE).,"The concept for categorization of eating episodes in dietary surveys was originally developed in studies of shift workers to compare ""meal patterns"" between night and day work shifts. The concept has been further improved through experience from applications in dietary surveys in other populations. In this paper, results from categorization of eating episodes in shift workers, elderly women and men during life transition periods, elderly female leg ulcer patients and obese men and their lean controls are shown and discussed. The categorization concept is based on seven food categories with food items of similar nutrient characteristics within each category. Each eating event is categorized as any of four types of ""meals"" or four types of ""snacks"" due to its combination of food categories. Thus, categorization is based on visible properties (food types) but at the same time reflecting invisible properties (nutrients). Criteria is also established to sub-categorize the ""meal"" types as being either ""prepared"" or ""quick-prepared"" from a behavioural perspective. Use of a defined and reliable concept for categorization is necessary to study eating episodes in dietary surveys, their determinants and also consequences on health and performance. Nocturnal eating during the circadian nadir might affect nutritional status. Since increasingly western populations appear to be moving from regular and planned meals to more episodic eating ""around the clock"", such analyses are of increasing interest in a bio-social perspective.",Appetite,1999 Feb,England,1999,90
8979038,Refinement and psychometric evaluation of the Attitudes Toward Loss of Hearing Questionnaire.,"OBJECTIVE: To refine and statistically validate the Attitudes Toward Loss of Hearing Questionnaire (ALHQ) so that it will be appropriate for clinical application and to understand some of the personality attributes underlying attitudes toward hearing loss. DESIGN: An American-English version of an ALHQ, originally designed by Brooks (1989), was completed by 226 men; a subset of 80 also completed personality questionnaires. All subjects underwent pure-tone testing and speech audiometry. Factor analysis was used to extract scales from the ALHQ. Reliability analyses using Cronbach's alpha were carried out on each scale. Test-retest reliability was evaluated from questionnaires completed 6 to 18 mo after initial administration. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the audiometric and personality determinants of attitudes. RESULTS: Five reliable scales were extracted from a 24-question version of the ALHQ: 1) Social and Emotional Impact of Hearing Loss, 2) Acceptance/ Adjustment to Hearing Loss, 3) Perceived Support from Significant Others, 4) Hearing Aid Stigma, and 5) Awareness of Hearing Loss. Audiometric data explained little of the variance in attitude scores; age and other demographic factors did not correlate with attitudes either. The personality traits of extroversion, self-esteem, and anxiety/neuroticism played a larger role in determining attitude. CONCLUSIONS: The ALHQ is psychometrically acceptable and is a potentially useful clinical tool. It is quick and easy to complete and to score and could be used as a basis for counseling and for following attitude change in patients over time.",Ear and hearing,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90

8265756,Advertising health: the case for counter-ads.,"Public service advertisements have been used by many in hopes of ""selling"" good health behaviors. But selling good behavior--even if it could be done more effectively--is not the best goal for using mass media to prevent health problems. Personal behavior is only part of what determines health status. Social conditions and the physical environment are important determinants of health that are usually ignored by health promotion advertising. Public service advertising may be doing more harm than good if it is diverting attention from more effective socially based health promotion strategies. Counter-ads are one communications strategy that could be used to promote a broader responsibility for rectifying health problems. In the tradition of advocacy advertising directly promoting policy rather than products, counter-ads promote views consistent with a public health perspective. Counter-ads set the agenda for health issues, conferring status on policy-oriented strategies for addressing health problems. The primary purpose of counter-ads is to challenge the dominant view that public health problems reflect personal health habits. They are controversial because they place health issues in a social and political context. Advertising strategies for health promotion range over a spectrum from individually oriented public service advertising to socially oriented counter-advertising. The recent anti-tobacco campaign from the California Department of Health Services represents advertisements across the spectrum. Counter-ads that focus on a politically controversial definition for health problems are an appropriate and necessary alternative to public service advertising.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",1993 Nov-Dec,United States,1993,90
12319653,"Internal migration, earnings, and the importance of self-selection.","This paper analyzes the impact of internal migration on earnings within the human capital model framework. Since migrants constitute a non-random sample of population, the endogenous nature of migration decision warrants necessary correction for the selectivity bias in their earnings function. The Mincer-type earnings model is thus augmented to determine the extent of this bias. Besides estimating the standard Mincerian earnings model, the paper also attempts to verify the learn-as-you-go proposition by introducing migration duration variables in the earnings model. Based on the household level Population, Labor Force, and Migration (1979-80) survey data, the analysis yields the following important conclusions: (i) the data allowed a meaningful estimation of Mincerian earnings function for migrants and non-migrants; (ii) the level of schooling was one of the important determinants of the distribution of income both for migrants and nonmigrants--the four categorical variables of education were in general statistically significant with expected signs, implying that the hypothesis of a positive relationship between income and education was accepted; (iii) the rates of return to education improved systematically with higher levels of education, thus confirming the notion that education serves as a signalling device; (iv) the age-income profile was almost linear for migrants but showed concavity for nonmigrants; (v) the presence of sample-selection was observed for migrants; and (vi) even after controlling for the influence of personal characteristics, i.e., education and experience, the long-standing migrants earned relatively more at the destination than the more recent migrants.",Pakistan development review,1994 Autumn,Pakistan,1994,90
1442721,Maternal nutrition and spontaneous preterm birth.,"Previous studies suggesting that maternal undernutrition increases the risk of preterm birth have suffered from several methodological shortcomings, including use of total gestational weight gain rather than net rate of gain in maternal tissue, inclusion of induced preterm deliveries, and error-prone gestational age measurements based solely on menstrual dates. The authors have attempted to overcome these shortcomings by investigating the potential etiologic roles of prepregnancy body mass index, net rate of maternal weight gain, height, and a number of other potential biological and sociodemographic determinants of spontaneous (i.e., noninduced) preterm birth in a cohort of 13,102 women with early ultrasound-confirmed gestational age who delivered at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, between January 1, 1980 and March 31, 1989. Total weight gain, but not body mass index, was highly significantly associated with spontaneous preterm birth, averaging 14.6, 12.5, 9.9, and 9.1 kg, in women delivering at 37 or more, less than 37, less than 34, and less than 32 completed weeks, respectively. Although the relation persisted when weight gain was expressed as an overall rate, it disappeared when the analysis was based on net rate; mean net rates of gain were 0.28, 0.29, 0.27, and 0.27 kg/week, respectively. On the basis of multiple logistic regression analyses, significant determinants of birth at less than 37 weeks included maternal short stature; noncompletion of high school; unmarried status; smoking; diabetes; urinary tract infection within 2 weeks of delivery; prepregnancy hypertension; severe pregnancy-induced hypertension; and previous history of preterm delivery, low birth weight, or neonatal death. Most of these factors retained their significance for birth at less than 34 and less than 32 weeks. In fact, the effect of low maternal education was even stronger at these more severe ""levels"" of preterm birth. The authors conclude that prepregnancy weight-for-height and gestational weight gain are not important determinants of spontaneous preterm birth and that some previous studies have mistaken an effect of shortened gestation for its cause. Other biologic and social determinants, however, indicate priorities for future research and intervention.",American journal of epidemiology,1992 Sep 1,United States,1992,90
10234422,Perceptions of spouse dominance predict blood pressure reactivity during marital interactions.,"Cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) has been identified as a potential mechanism linking a variety of psychosocial processes to the development of cardiovascular disease. Although the effects of hostile and supportive social stimuli on CVR have been studied extensively, less is known about the effects of a second major dimension of social relations--dominance versus submissiveness. In the present study, 45 married couples participated in an interaction task involving the assertion of differing opinions. Subjects also provided ratings of their typical level of dominance versus submissiveness in relation to their spouse. Consistent with predictions derived from related conceptual models of psychological determinants of CVR, blood pressure reactivity was positively associated with perceptions of the spouse as dominant. At the highest level of perceived spouse dominance, CVR was attenuated, again consistent with prediction. Results are discussed in terms of the usefulness of conceptual models of interpersonal relations and motivation as guides in studying the social determinants of CVR, as well as the value of marital interactions as a context for understanding CVR.",Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,1998 Fall,England,1998,90

SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lund University, University Hospital Malmo, Sweden. SUBJECTS: A series of 854 participants at 12-month postabortion follow-up, representing 66.5% of the 1285 women undergoing induced abortion at Malmo, 1989. METHODS: Analysis of data elicited at a semistructured interview 1 year after induced abortion, risk factors for emotional distress being determined in a ""case"" subgroup (n = 139) of women satisfying all the inclusion criteria (i.e., postabortion emotional distress, doubts about abortion decision, would not consider abortion again), as compared with a control group (n = 114) satisfying none of the inclusion criteria. The study design is a retrospective study. RESULTS: In the subgroup with emotional distress (duration ranging from 1 month to still present at 12-month follow-up), the following risk factors were identified: living alone, poor emotional support from family and friends, adverse postabortion change in relations with partner, underlying ambivalence or adverse attitude to abortion, and being actively religious. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, 50-60% of women undergoing induced abortion experienced some measure of emotional distress, classified as severe in 30% of cases. The risk factors identified suggest that it may be possible to ameliorate or even prevent such distress.","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",1998 Aug,Ireland,1998,90
9247752,"Stress, coping, lifestyle and hypertension: a paradigm for research, prevention and non-pharmacological management of hypertension.","Lifestyle related factors such as obesity, drinking habits, sodium and potassium intake and physical inactivity are well established determinants of high blood pressure. The role of psycho-social stressors, and in particular environmental work or home stress is far less clear. Some but not all studies using the Karasek 'job-strain' model have found a relationship with ambulatory blood pressure levels. Other studies using more 'subjective' measures of occupational stress have found no relationship or even inverse associations with blood pressure. The possibility that relationships between external stressors, personality factors and blood pressure levels might be mediated or confounded by coping mechanisms influencing lifestyle factors known to directly affect blood pressure has not been adequately studied. This paper briefly explores the paradigm relating environmental psychosocial stress, individual coping mechanisms, lifestyle behaviours and blood pressure levels. The issues are critical for research methodology in this area and for the development of better behavioural strategies for the prevention and nonpharmacological management of hypertension.","Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)",1997 Jul-Aug,England,1997,90

10146560,The determinants of four cancer-related risk behaviours.,"This paper reports research into the determinants of four cancer-related risk behaviours: smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, high fat consumption and exposure to artificial sunlight. The results indicate that the four types of risk behaviour are determined by several factors: the perceived behaviour of the social environment, individual's attitudes towards the risk behaviour and self-efficacy perceptions on changing the risk behaviour. High fat consumption differs from the other risk behaviours in that people tend not to be aware of their high fat consumption. No significant relationships were found among the risk behaviours apart from small correlations between smoking and heavy alcohol consumption, and between high fat consumption and heavy alcohol consumption. The implications of these results for the development of behaviour change programs are discussed.",Health education research,1993 Dec,England,1993,90
2286858,Determinants of grief resolution in cancer death.,"The death of a loved one can be very difficult, and yet there is little information about how nurses can help someone through it. The purpose of this exploratory ex post facto study was to determine whether the circumstances of a cancer death influence the grief resolution of the survivor at one month after the death. The circumstances that were studied include: (1) the place of death, (2) the length of the cancer illness, (3) the perceived social support from family/friends, (4) the perceived social support from nurses, (5) satisfaction with the care received by the loved one, and (6) the quality of death of the loved one. Data were gathered from 43 survivors (spouses, children, and parents) through questionnaires and an open-ended interview. The study findings provide a better understanding and knowledge of nursing interventions for the family/friend of the imminently terminal cancer patient.",Journal of palliative care,1990 Winter,United States,1990,90
10354230,"Specific determinants of intrinsic work motivation, burnout and turnover intentions: a study among nurses.","This study of 156 Dutch general hospital nurses tested a theoretically derived model of specific relationships between work stressors and stress reactions. The model proposes four central domains of the work situation, namely work content, working conditions, social and labour relations, and conditions of employment. In addition, the model proposes three important stress reactions, namely a diminished intrinsic work motivation, occupational burnout and an inclination to leave the job. More specifically, it was hypothesized that (i) intrinsic work motivation is primarily determined by work content variables, (ii) burnout is primarily determined by both work load and limited social support, and (iii) propensity to leave is primarily determined by conditions of employment. All these relationships were simultaneously tested using a structural equations modelling technique. The results of a series of LISREL analyses indicate that the postulated model fits well to the data. The present study used conceptually integrated measures that cover the area of work stress and stress reactions, and provides directions for interventions aimed at preventing or reducing specific negative outcomes of work-related stress in general hospitals.",Journal of advanced nursing,1999 Jun,England,1999,90

Symptom frequency and symptom distress, and self-care agency were measured by the Transplant Symptom Frequency and Symptom Distress Scale, and the Appraisal for Self-Care Agency Scale, respectively. The Long-Term Medication Behavior Self-Efficacy Scale and a renal transplant knowledge questionnaire were developed as part of this study to measure perceived self-efficacy and knowledge of the therapeutic regimen. Demographic variables were also measured. The incidence of subclinical noncompliance with immunosuppressive therapy as assessed by interview was 22.3%. Compliers and noncompliers differed significantly on the variables of marital status (P = 0.03), situational-operational knowledge (P = 0.02), self-care agency (P = 0.03), and perceived self-efficacy related to long-term medication intake (P = 0.048). A logistic regression model using gender, marital status, perceived self-efficacy, self-care agency, knowledge about medication administration and signs of infection, and situational operational knowledge as predictor variables, revealed a 78.6% correct classification of compliers versus noncompliers and a sensitivity ratio of 95.9%. There were significantly more acute late rejection episodes (P = 0.003) in the noncompliant group. Graft survival at 5 years in this group was also significantly lower (P = 0.03) than the compliant patients. No significant difference was found in terms of the occurrence of chronic rejection episodes or in terms of patient survival at 5 years. Because noncompliance is a risk factor for negative clinical outcome in renal transplant recipients, it is of utmost importance to develop intervention strategies to enhance compliance in this population by using determinants identified in exploratory studies.",Transplantation,1995 Feb 15,United States,1995,90
9850877,Social determinants of psychiatric morbidity and well-being in immigrant elders and whites in east London.,"OBJECTIVES: The social conditions under which migrants to the UK live may be more significant than the experience of migration itself in leading to increased risk of mental illness. We aimed to compare the prevalence of mental, physical and social health problems in elderly Somalis, Bengalis and whites living in a deprived inner London area and examine associations between environmental circumstances, social support, physical health status, mood and life satisfaction in these groups. In addition, we wanted to test the hypothesis that differences in mental health between immigrants and whites are explained by social disadvantages rather than ethnicity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey with participants drawn from age-sex registers of general practices, augmented by other sources. SETTING: East London--'first-generation' Somali and Bengali immigrants and white British. SUBJECTS: A total of 274 people aged 60+ years: 72 Somalis, 75 Bengalis and 127 whites. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Scale (SAD), Life Satisfaction Index (LSI). High SAD scores indicate more anxiety and depression symptoms; high LSI scores indicate greater life satisfaction. MAIN RESULTS: Highest SAD scores were found among Bengalis; lowest LSI scores were found among Bengalis and Somalis. The prevalences of depression (SAD score 6+) were 25% in Somalis, 77% in Bengalis and 25% in east London whites. Physical health status and SAD scores were associated in Somalis (r = +0.31, p < or = 0.01). Bengalis (r = +0.47, p < or = 0.001) and east London whites (r = +0.27, p < or = 0.01). Physical health problems also related to lower LSI scores in Somalis (r = -0.24, p < or = 0.05) and east London whites (r = -0.24, p < or = 0.01). Social factors (i.e. poor housing conditions, low family support and reported need of community services) were strongly associated with SAD scores among Somalis (r = +0.5, p < or = 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, among Bengalis (r = +0.33, p < or = 0.01). Ethnicity (i.e. being an immigrant as opposed to a non-immigrant) became a statistically non-significant risk factor for high SAD scores after adjusting for the effects of age, weekly income, physical health and social problems (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.5-1.1, p = 0.09). A residual, but much attenuated effect for ethnicity on LSI scores persisted in the estimated model after controlling for the same set of independent risk factors (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.4-1, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The marked variation in mental health between ethnic groups in east London might be a reflection of socioeconomic and health differentials acting concomitantly and adversely. Inequalities in housing, social support, income and physical health status accounted for variation in mood observed between immigrants and whites, and may partly explain differences in life satisfaction. These results seem to support a 'multiple jeopardy' theory of ageing in ethnic minorities in east London. Greater efforts are needed to recognize anxiety and depression in immigrant elders. Better social support and housing among 'minority ethnic' elders who live alone might be expected to alleviate social stress and improve mental health and psychological well-being.",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,1998 Nov,England,1998,90

The method's side effects were defined by 200 first-time users in Matlab district during lengthy, open-ended interviews. Women with many children used the method longer than did women of low parity. Those who experienced side effects had shorter use durations than those who did not, and those who cited heavy bleeding as their main problem discontinued use soonest. Women whose husbands approved of family planning had significantly longer use durations than those whose husbands disapproved. Respondents who adopted DMPA because of perceived positive aspects of the drug used it longer than those who chose it for other reasons. Results of the study underscore the importance of viewing side effects in a specific social and cultural context.

Substantial increases in condom use were observed, and these changes were unrelated to attrition and cohort bias. In terms of predictors of condom use, men who always used condoms had higher levels of social support from informal sources of help, had more positive expectations that condoms would have positive interpersonal and personal consequences, and were more likely to be HIV positive than men who used condoms occasionally or never. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for HIV-prevention research.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1991,United States,1991,90
8921465,An investigation of the role of fathers in immunization uptake.,"BACKGROUND: Mothers, but not fathers, are the usual focus of strategies to maximize immunization coverage in low income countries. METHODS: A study of the immunization determinants of children aged 12-18 months was conducted in 1991 in the Eastern Region of Ghana using structured interviews of a population sample of 294 mothers and 170 (67%) of the children's fathers. RESULTS: Fathers were more likely than mothers to perceive that the fathers had participated in the decision to send children for immunizations. Where both parents reported that the father had participated in the decision, and he could speak English, the child was more likely to have completed the immunization schedule by 12 months (OR = 5.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-21.7), independently of other factors. Neither the father's participation, nor his ability to speak English, was independently associated with the child's immunization status. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study suggest that, where fathers have a higher level of education, programmes which are designed to involve them in decisions about their children's use of preventive health services have the potential to increase timely immunization coverage levels.",International journal of epidemiology,1996 Aug,England,1996,90
10359227,Gambling and risk-taking behavior among university students.,"The present study examines the relationships between risk taking, sensation seeking, and level of gambling involvement. The intent of this research was to investigate whether risk taking and/or sensation seeking are determinants in distinguishing pathological gamblers from problem gamblers and whether risk taking and gambling behavior for a university population are positively correlated for both males and females. Results indicated that the Risk-Taking Questionnaire (RTQ), the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking (AISS), and the Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS) distinguished between probable/pathological gamblers and nonproblem gamblers with probable/pathological gamblers scoring the highest on each measure. However, the RTQ was the only measure able to distinguish probable/pathological gamblers from gamblers experiencing some problems relating to their gambling behavior. Females encountering some problems resulting from their gambling behavior consistently reported higher risk-taking and sensation seeking scores than males with no gambling problems. Results indicate that excessive gamblers are significantly greater risk takers than social gamblers, a finding which could prove useful in advising treatment regimens.",Substance use & misuse,1999 Jun,England,1999,90
2014409,The Tromso Study: predictors of self-evaluated health--has society adopted the expanded health concept?,"The determinants of self-evaluated general health status were examined in a comprehensive population study of 9408 men aged 20-61 and 9152 women aged 20-56. Reduced self-evaluated health was in both sexes closely related to symptoms and diseases connected to the musculo-skeletal system and psycho-social problems and less to age and some of the major chronic diseases. Physical activity at leisure time and workload were positively associated with self-evaluated health. Our findings indicate that an important dimension reflected by self-evaluation of health is the individual's perception of own physical performance and suffice in general. There is a striking gap between the conditions which reduce the population's subjective perceived health and our ability to offer these conditions effective treatment through the health care system. This suggests differences in health concept between the medical society and the population. The association between our applied measure and coronary risk profile, based on serum cholesterol, blood pressure and cigarette smoking, was found to be almost non-existent. This supports previous findings of self-evaluation of health as an independent predictor of survival.",Social science & medicine (1982),1991,England,1991,90
1757767,Cultural and economic determinants of geographical mortality patterns in The Netherlands.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The geographical pattern of mortality in The Netherlands is dominated by an area of relatively high mortality in the southern part of the country. The aim was to analyse the background of this geographical mortality pattern in the early 1980s, and its evolution over time since the early 1950s. DESIGN: Mortality data by district (n = 39), cause of death (13 large causes, ""symptoms and ill defined conditions"", all other causes), and time period (1950-54, 1960-64, 1970-74, 1980-84) were available from the Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics. Standardised mortality ratios were calculated, and the logarithms of these were related to three sociodemographic characteristics using multiple, ordinary least squares regression analysis. SETTING: This study used data for the whole Dutch population. MAIN RESULTS: Although the geographical mortality pattern has been rather stable over the last decades, a clear tendency towards convergence is also apparent. Approximately 90% of the current excess mortality in the southern part of the country is due to cardiovascular diseases. The results of regression analysis show that the excess mortality is primarily related to the high percentage of Roman Catholics in this part of the country, and additionally to a slightly lower average income. In The Netherlands, a higher percentage of Roman Catholics in the population is linked with higher all cause mortality rates, as well as with higher mortality rates for lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, arterial disease, and chronic non-specific lung disease. Survey data show that these associations are partly due to a higher prevalence of smoking among Roman Catholics. As in many other countries, a lower average income is linked with high all cause mortality rates in The Netherlands. Cause specific data show negative associations for stomach cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic non-specific lung disease, and traffic accidents. Since the early 1950s the association between geographical mortality patterns and the percentage of Roman Catholics in the population has gradually become less strongly positive. This suggests that the convergence of the mortality rates in the South towards the national average may be related to a gradual lessening of differences in lifestyle between population groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both cultural and economic factors are important in the explanation of geographical mortality patterns in The Netherlands.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1991 Sep,England,1991,90
15073816,Usage and users of natural remedies in a middle-aged population: demographic and psychosocial characteristics. Results from the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study.,"BACKGROUND: In Sweden, large amounts of money are spent annually on natural remedies (NRs), in spite of the fact that most products in this category lack scientific documentation of their efficacy and side-effects. The usage and users of natural remedies are not well defined. This paper describes NR use and NR users in a city in southern Sweden, and tests the hypothesis that the use of natural remedies is a strategy for coping with psychosocial stressors. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 6545 men and women, aged 45-65 years, who during 1991 and 1992 participated in the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study, a large-scale prospective cohort study. Data on consumption of natural remedies were recorded during seven consecutive days, as part of a dietary assessment. Each participant also completed a questionnaire, covering education, work history, alcohol and smoking habits, perceived health, and psychosocial factors such as social network, social support, job strain and global control. Body composition was also measured. RESULTS: The prevalence of NR consumption was 26% among women and 17% among men. NR use was most common during winter and spring. The most popular products were ginseng, garlic, and various herb and plant extracts. Important determinants of NR usage were higher education, Swedish origin, and lifestyle factors like low body weight fat percentage and high alcohol consumption among women. Other determinants were higher age and non-smoking among men. None of the psychosocial factors appeared to influence the prevalence of NR consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of NR consumption is influenced by sex, demographic factors, season of the year, and lifestyle. Use of NRs does not appear to be a common strategy for coping with psychosocial stress.",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,1996 Sep,England,1996,90

The sample was divided into two groups according to the gravidity of the mothers (3368 primigravidae and 7286 multigravidae). Data examined included regional characteristics, marital status, age at and duration of marriage, parental ages at delivery, crowding in the home, insurance status, parental occupational classification and parental education levels. Logistic regression was used to define the socio-economic and demographic characteristics independently associated with the delivery of an LBW singleton baby. Significantly different LBW rates were found among the two groups: 4.3% in the primigravidae and 5.2% for multigravidae. For primigravidae significant associations were found with marital status, maternal occupation and father's education, while for multigravidae significant features were mother's education and place (region) of residence.

In this paper we consider the effects of race, age, female headship, and college education on the distribution of family income by developing a multivariate methodology that allows us to gauge the influence of one factor while holding other determinants of family incomes constant. Over the period studied we find that race had only a minor effect on the overall size distribution of income. Age had a somewhat greater effect than race. In contrast, the impact of female heads and college education were quite substantial. The multivariate estimates reveal that the effects of female heads and college education both increase the Gini to a much greater extent than the progressivity of federal income taxes decreases it. The effects of college education and female headed families on inequality have grown larger across time, while the influence of age has declined. We find that the effects of race on inequality have changed little over the 1976 to 1989 period.""",Southern economic journal,1997 Jul,United States,1997,90

We have investigated the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and diseases in elderly Chinese in Hong Kong and compared these data with those in elderly Caucasian populations. Two thousand and thirty two (999 male and 1,033 female) subjects, selected by age-stratified random sampling from a register of Hong Kong residents aged 70 yrs and over were interviewed to complete a respiratory questionnaire. Total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) was measured in 195 subjects. At least one respiratory symptom was reported by 56% of subjects. The most frequently reported symptoms were morning phlegm (26%), chronic cough with phlegm (10%) and wheeze in the past 12 months (8%). Of the self-reported diseases, the commonest was chronic bronchitis (7%), followed by asthma (5%), pulmonary tuberculosis (3%) and emphysema (2%). Of the 218 subjects with obstructive airway diseases, 128 (59%) had sought medical advice in the past 12 months. The most important determinants for respiratory symptoms and diseases were smoking and social class. Total serum IgE was significantly higher in current smokers than nonsmokers and also in those with chronic cough and phlegm than those without these complaints.

Results were generated from paid, in-depth, face-to-face interviews about sexual behavior carried out first with 4 pilot respondents, then with 21 gay respondents aged 18-39, half of whom were HIV seropositive. Findings suggest that there is not a close match between what is epidemiologically accepted as risk behavior and what respondents regarded as risk behavior. The heuristic on which the men based their perceptions of sexual risk comprised a pattern of activities in which there are few absolutes, contrary to the distinctions of ""safe"", ""safer"", and ""unsafe"" categories used by health educators. The men used several categories as signifiers of risk: factors such as age, appearance, diction, and HIV knowledge together with variables reflecting epidemiological data, such as few partners, being the insertive partner in anal intercourse, and past history of infrequent unprotected anal intercourse, and situational determinants such as emotional needs, sexual arousal, and relationship status were constructed into a hierarchy of risk.

9866093,Access to medical care under strain: new pressures in Canada and Australia.,"Health policy changes intended to achieve cost control in OECD countries run the risk of reintroducing financial barriers to health care. However, although the problems faced are similar, different countries are dealing with the situation in different ways. For example, Canada and Australia, which share many similarities, have taken quite different policy paths in the last decade: Canada has preserved universal access, whereas Australian policy is promoting a two-tier system through the provision of public subsidies for private insurance. The evidence is that country-specific factors such as institutional arrangements, attitudes, and values intersect with economic and financial factors to shape policy outcomes. Moreover, the Canadian and Australian experiences suggest that in relation to access issues, attitudes and values are the key policy determinants.","Journal of health politics, policy and law",1998 Dec,United States,1998,90
8318806,Early determinants of cardiovascular risk factors in adults. B. Blood pressure.,"The aim of this follow-up study was to investigate the effect of birth weight, infant nutrition, past and contemporary social status and anthropometry on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adult subjects. There were 465 boys and girls, originating from three different regions of Croatia, examined in the first three years of life, and again approximately 18 years later. The analyses showed that birth weight was inversely related to systolic blood pressure in adult subjects. The highest systolic pressure was found in subjects with the lowest birth weight and the greatest current body mass index. Relative weight in the first three years of life was also inversely related to systolic blood pressure, but only in adult males. Neither the type of milk given, nor the duration of breast feeding and the time of weaning had any significant influence on blood pressure in adult subjects. According to multivariate regression analyses, the significant predictors of higher systolic and diastolic pressure in adult males were: lower father's height, greater current body mass index, lower birth weight and low original social status. In female subjects, the significant predictors were: lower birth weight, greater current body mass index and lower social class of origin. In conclusion, influences of poor environment acting in early childhood may be important determinants of blood pressure in adulthood.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1993 Apr,Norway,1993,90
8351534,Determinants of pregnancy outcomes and targeting of maternal health services in Jamaica.,"Detailed nationally representative population level data were used to investigate the pre-natal care and delivery experiences of pregnant women in Jamaica. The results of this study show that: (a) demographic criteria (particularly first births) and self-reported clinical pregnancy complications are valid predictors of deleterious maternal health outcomes and can be used to stratify mothers into risk groups. (b) There appears to be a significant problem of under and inappropriate utilization of pre-natal care services by all women and in particular by demographically 'high risk' women, i.e. young, first time mothers. Significant proportions of the latter group report either no pre-natal care visits at all or visits which are later than the first trimester. The problems of delayed initiation of pre-natal care are specially exacerbated for poor, teenage mothers who happen to be living in the Kingston Metropolitan Area. (c) In terms of the content and quality of pre-natal care services the message is somewhat mixed. On the positive side the pre-natal care system is doing a moderately satisfactory job with regard to diagnostic tests and educational advice. On the negative side however, the fact that once women enter the health care system they all receive the same moderately adequate care (in terms of diagnostic evaluations and educational advice) with no attempt to focus particular attention on high risk mothers is troublesome. (d) With regard to appropriate delivery venues for pregnant women, pre-natal care visits do not appear to significantly influence the choice of delivery venues. Moreover, rich urban women are much more likely to deliver in a hospital than their rural peers.

2322698,Social influences and cardiovascular risk factors as determinants of plasma fibrinogen concentration in a general population sample of middle aged men.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the relation between fibrinogen concentration and social class and other social factors found to be related to mortality. The results regarding cardiovascular disease are unpublished, as yet. DESIGN: Cross sectional population study. SETTING: City of Gothenburg, Sweden. SUBJECTS: 639 Men from a population sample of 1016 men aged 50 in 1983. They were all employed and had no history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Fibrinogen values were available for all of them. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Fibrinogen concentration in relation to socioeconomic state according to occupation, and other social influences determined as number of people in the household and scores of social activities and activities in and outside the house. RESULTS: Men with low scores for activities at home had a mean plasma fibrinogen concentration of 3.34 g/l (95% confidence interval 3.21 to 3.47), whereas those with an intermediate score had a mean concentration of 3.16 (3.00 to 3.32) g/l and those with a high score 3.02 (2.95 to 3.10) g/l. Similar inverse relations were noted for the two other activity scores and for occupational class (class 1 being unskilled and semiskilled workers and class 5 professionals and executives) and the number of people in the household. Smoking exerted a strong influence on fibrinogen concentration, the relations between fibrinogen concentration and social factors being evident only in non-smokers. The mean difference in fibrinogen value between the non-smokers with the lowest activity scores at home and those with the highest scores was 0.36 (0.19 to 0.54) g/l, and similar differences were seen for the two other activity scores. Multiple regression analyses showed smoking, body mass index, the sum of all activities (inverse relation), and diabetes to be independently associated with fibrinogen value, whereas occupational class (p = 0.81) and the number of people in the household (p = 0.09) were not. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial influences seem to influence the coagulation system in the body in a way that is associated with cardiovascular disease and premature death.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1990 Mar 10,England,1990,90

The authors studied 832 patients investigated with Bruce's exercise testing and with diagnostic coronary arteriography, all of whom were shown to have significant coronary artery disease (diameter stenosis > or = 50%). Twenty-five demographic, clinical, electrocardiographic, exercise, and anatomic/hemodynamic parameters were analyzed. The stepwise forward logistic regression analysis retained seven among them as significant independent predictors: four as positive contributors: (1) three-vessel and/or left main disease (P = 0.0000), (2) Gensini's angio-graphic score for disease extent (P = 0.0025), (3) anginal pain during the test (P = 0.0000), and (4) age (P = 0.0031) and three as negative contributors: (1) resting heart rate (P = 0.0004), (2) history of old myocardial infarction (P = 0.0019), and (3) pathological Q waves at the resting ECG (P = 0.0018). These findings establish standards that permit the prediction of the positive electrocardiographic exercise outcome in patients with significant coronary disease.",Angiology,1997 Feb,United States,1997,90

7825630,Androgens and sexuality.,"A review of the literature reveals that the endocrine determinants of female sexuality are complex and difficult to characterize. In adolescent males, free testosterone directly affects sexual motivation, with social factors exerting little or no effect. In adolescent girls, by contrast, societal and peer pressure play a pivotal role in the appearance of certain sexual behaviors. Throughout a woman's life, hormonal and psychosocial factors are critical influences. It is possible that cyclic patterns of testosterone are less important for female sexual behavior than the ""tonic"" effect of overall testosterone levels. Although the estrogen dependence of the vaginal epithelium--important for postmenopausal women--has been clearly established, the role of other hormonal factors and treatments, particularly those involving androgens, in human female sexual behavior remains enigmatic. The search for an understanding of these relationships is not merely an interesting academic exercise but is necessary to determine what role, if any, androgens may play in the treatment of sexual dysfunction during the female reproductive years.",The American journal of medicine,1995 Jan 16,United States,1995,90
10037554,"Cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity in relation to serum leptin levels in a multiethnic population: The Miami Community Health Study.","PURPOSE: To examine the correlates of plasma leptin, including fasting insulin, adiposity, and several health habits and behaviors among a nondiabetic multiethnic population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 25-44 year old African-Americans (n = 126), Cuban-Americans (n = 107), and non-Hispanic whites (n = 189) randomly selected from Dade County Florida. Fasting leptin levels were correlated with fasting insulin, percent body fat, smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity within each sex. Multiple linear regression and analysis of covariance were used to estimate the independent determinants of plasma leptin concentration separately among men and women. RESULTS: Stepwise linear regression analyses revealed statistically significant associations of leptin with percent body fat, fasting insulin, cigarette smoking, and physical activity (both inversely) among men (p < 0.05 for each). Among women, percent body fat, fasting insulin (both positively), cigarette smoking, and alcohol use (inversely) were independent predictors of leptin levels explaining over 70% of the variance. Analyses of covariance revealed that women had higher adjusted mean leptin levels than men (13.1 ng/ml vs. 5.9 ng/ml; p < 0.001), whereas no separate effect of ethnicity was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Although adiposity was the strongest correlate of leptin levels, fasting insulin and several health habits and behaviors were independently associated with leptin. After adjustment for these factors, women had significantly higher mean leptin levels than men. The independent association among leptin and insulin levels is intriguing and suggests additional avenues for epidemiologic research.",Annals of epidemiology,1999 Feb,United States,1999,90
9246691,Ecological and individual predictors of birthweight in a northern Finland birth cohort 1986.,"This multilevel study of spatial variability in, and determinants of, birthweight was conducted using individual and ecological data in a geographically defined prospective birth cohort for 1986 in northern Finland. The study area comprises three large areas defined by latitude: Northern Lapland (NL), Southern Lapland (SL) and Oulu province (OP), comprising 74 localities with a total study population of 9216 singleton births. The mean birthweight was 3482 g for NL, 3537 g for SL and 3587 g for OP (NL vs. OP and SL vs. OP: P < 0.05). The crude rate for stillbirths was highest in NL. The women in the northernmost area were socially less privileged and the localities less prosperous compared with those in the southernmost area. Significant spatial clustering of mean birthweights was found (P = 0.0016), with highest birthweight in the south-western part of the study area. A variable expressing the wealth of each locality, the financial capacity category (FCC), had its lowest mean value in NL, with a range of one to six for the localities studied here. A multilevel multiple regression model showed that, after allowing for sex, gestational age, mother's age, height and hypertensive disorders, parity, body mass index, previous low birthweight child and smoking as individual determinants of birthweight, part of the residual variation could be explained by the locality wealth parameter. Using the multilevel model, the differences in mean birthweight across the three latitude areas persisted but were reduced (difference OP vs. NL reduced from 105 g to 86.5 g). The relationship between birthweight and FCC was inverse U-shaped with the highest mean birthweight estimated for localities occurring in the middle of the range (FCC = 3). The wealthiest urban localities (FCC = 6) and the most deprived localities (FCC = 1) both had a predicted birthweight about 60 g below the maximum at FCC = 3, if all other factors were held constant. This result, taken together with the spatial clustering of birthweights, suggests that there may be important social and environmental determinants of birthweight that have yet to be identified.",Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,1997 Jul,England,1997,90
9216030,Levels and determinants of gynecological morbidity in a district of south India.,"This article presents the results of an assessment of gynecological morbidity among 385 women with young children residing in a district of Karnataka State, South India. All three main modes of assessment (clinical examination, laboratory tests, and self-reports) reveal a high burden of reproductive tract infections. The two most common conditions, identified by laboratory tests, were bacterial vaginosis and mucopurulent cervicitis. Approximately one-fourth of the women had clinical evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical ectopy, and fistula. The contribution of sexually transmitted diseases to overall gynecological morbidity appears to be relatively modest; 10 percent were so diagnosed. Associated conditions of anemia and chronic energy deficiency were common. Severe anemia was found in 17 percent of cases and severe chronic energy deficiency in 12 percent. These results indicate that radical improvements in women's health in India will require far more than the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive tract infections.",Studies in family planning,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90

Theoretical definitions of health promotion and health education are presented. The author suggests that a variety of different approaches to health promotion can be adopted by nurses in practice, including education, persuasion, manipulation and attempts to promote an environment where healthy decisions about lifestyle can be made. Each strategy is examined and the advantages and the ethical limitations are explored. It is suggested that nurses may theoretically accept the notion of being a health promoter, but that in the reality of practice, their role may be primarily that of the health educator. The importance of recognizing that there are a variety of determinants of health, including social and environmental factors, as well as individual lifestyle, is emphasized throughout the paper.",Journal of advanced nursing,1998 Dec,England,1998,90

8616346,Socioeconomic determinants of rates of consultation in general practice based on fourth national morbidity survey of general practices.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the socioeconomic determinants of consultation rates in general practice. DESIGN: Analysis of data from the fourth national morbidity survey of general practices (MSGP4) including sociodemographic details of individual patients and small area statistics from the 1991 census. Multilevel modelling techniques were used to take account of both individual patient data and small area statistics to relate socioeconomic and health status factors directly to a measure of general practitioner workload. RESULTS: Higher rates of consultations were found in patients who were classified as permanently sick, unemployed (especially those who became unemployed during the study year), living in rented accommodation, from the Indian subcontinent, living with a spouse or partner (women only), children living with two parents (girls only), and living in urban areas, especially those living relatively near the practice. When characteristics of individual patients are known and controlled for the role of ""indices of deprivation"" is considerably reduced. The effect of individual sociodemographic characteristics were shown to vary between different areas. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic and socioeconomic factors can act as powerful predictors of consultation patterns. Though it will always be necessary to retain some local planning discretion, the sets of coefficients estimated for individual level factors, area level characteristics, and for practice groupings may be sufficient to provide an indicative level of demand for general medical services. Although the problems in using socioeconomic data from individual patients would be substantial, these results are relevant to the development of a resource allocation formula for general practice.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 Apr 20,England,1996,90

SUBJECTS: A subsample of men at work, aged 40-54 y extracted from the base-line data from four independent prospective studies, each representing a period (Physical Fitness Study (1977-1978), Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health (BIRNH) (1979-1984), Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases (MONICA) (1986-1991) and ORCA (1992-1993)). DESIGN: Linear regression of the average body mass index (kg/m2) and logistic regression of the prevalence of obesity (BMI > or = 30kg/m2). Independent variables taken into account in multivariate analysis were: age, educational level, marital status and region. RESULTS: In this subsample of Belgian men at work, aged 40-54 y, prevalence of obesity increased from 9.2% in 1977-1978 to 14.5% in 1992-1993. This rise was present in each five-year age group, in both regions and in all educational groups, but strongest in the lowest educated. After adjustment for sociodemographic covariables, it was estimated that with regard to 1977-1978, the proportion of men with a BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 doubled over the 15-year period (odds ratio OR (95% confidence intervals, 95% CI)): 1.98 (1.40; 2.80). CONCLUSION: Keeping in mind that the trends have been calculated from data from four different studies, presenting some shortcomings, prevalence of obesity has increased between 1977-1992 in men aged 40-54 y at work. This rise is particularly pronounced in the lower educated groups.",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,1998 Oct,England,1998,90
8827145,"Stage of behavior change for condom use: the influence of partner type, relationship and pregnancy factors.","A theoretical model was used to examine the influence of relationship factors, pregnancy intentions, contraceptive behavior and other psychosocial characteristics on stages of behavior change in condom use among heterosexual black women of reproductive age. Data from an inner-city street survey compared women who were not contemplating condom use, women who were attempting to use condoms or had used them consistently for short periods of time, and those who had achieved long-term consistent use. Women's relationship with their main partner appears to be an important factor in understanding their use of condoms both with main partners and with other partners. For condom use with the main partner, factors such as emotional closeness and partner support were significant predictors of the likelihood that women would be attempting to use condoms rather than not contemplating use. Cohabitation and the belief that condom use builds trust were significant predictors of long-term consistent condom use. Having a regular or main partner was strongly associated with intentions to use condoms with other partners. Women who wanted to become pregnant were much less likely to intend to use condoms with their main partner, and women using oral contraceptives were less likely to be long-term consistent condom users.",Family planning perspectives,1996 May-Jun,United States,1996,90
10186225,Diffusion of laparoscopic technologies in Denmark.,"It has been predicted that minimally invasive therapy will have dramatic consequences for the specialty of general surgery, as demonstrated by the diffusion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To investigate the determinants of the diffusion in Denmark of five laparoscopic technologies (cholecystectomy, appendicectomy, surgery for colon cancer, surgery for inguinal hernia and fundoplication), questionnaires on seventeen factors' influence on the adoption (stimulating or impeding) were sent to fifty-nine hospitals. Fifty hospitals (85%) responded. Overall, 98% adopted laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Denmark between 1991 and 1995, whereas the remainder of the technologies were adopted by 7-65% of hospitals performing these operations. Large and specialized hospitals were the earliest adopters. The factors, nature of technology (minimally invasive versus conventional), training (appropriate training courses), competition (between specialties and between hospitals) and media attention have stimulated the diffusion, whereas three budget factors (budget for investment, budget for operation and public regulation) usually had an impeding effect. Stimulating factors prevail for all laparoscopic technologies indicating that some guidance of the adoption and use of new health technologies might be necessary. In Denmark, one of the suggested health policies to secure timely guidance is the establishment of an early warning system.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",1998 Aug,Ireland,1998,90

Instead of conventional ethnic markers, such as ""Kazak"" or ""Russian,"" it focuses on more complex ethnocultural identities that combine ascribed ethnicity with language use. Because of the history of russification in Kazakstan, three ethnocultural groups are defined and compared--Kazak women who chose to be interviewed in Kazak, Kazak women who chose to be interviewed in Russian, and women of European background interviewed in Russian. Whereas women of European origin were the most likely to undergo induced abortion, the Russian-interviewed Kazaks had higher abortion ratios and were more likely to terminate their pregnancies than were the Kazak-interviewed Kazaks, net of other characteristics. The implications of the results for induced abortion trends and family planning policy in Kazakstan are discussed in addition to other findings.",Studies in family planning,1997 Dec,United States,1997,90

New immigrant waves are heavily focused on only a few 'port-of-entry' states. It is suggested that these immigrants have begun to impact upon internal migration into and out of these 'high immigration states', and have also altered the national system of internal migration patterns. This article addresses three questions: How do the magnitudes of poverty population out-migration from high immigration states compare with those of other states? Is this out-migration selective on particular social and demographic groups? Is immigration a significant determinant of internal migration of the poor population? The results of this analysis are consistent with the view that recent, focused immigration is associated with out-migration among a state's poor longer-term residents.""",International journal of population geography : IJPG,1995 Sep,England,1995,90

2028980,Health and social predictors of mortality in an elderly Chinese cohort.,"A total of 1,054 Hong Kong Chinese subjects aged 70 years or over were recruited into a cohort study to investigate the relation between social support and health outcomes. More than 30 social, health, and behavioral characteristics were recorded as baseline information when the study began in 1985. Mortality data were obtained during a 2-year follow-up. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the roles of these variables in predicting mortality. The mortality patterns of Hong Kong and of the studied cohort closely resemble that of Western developed countries with cancer, heart disease, and cerebrovascular diseases as the leading causes of death. Besides sex and place of residence (whether living in the community or in homes for the elderly), the independent predictors of mortality included five baseline variables: being single or widowed, limited ability in activities of daily living, smoking habit, low body mass index, and poor self-evaluated health status. Subjects with at least three of these predictors had a relative risk of 3.9 (95% confidence interval 2.4-6.2) compared with those with zero to two of these characteristics.",American journal of epidemiology,1991 May 1,United States,1991,90

8372248,[A new strategy for the classification of mental disorders: an example of a multi-dimensional model for psychopathology].,"Present diagnostic classification systems stand in the way of a concurrence between events in our social lives and the biological substrates of common mental disorders. A two dimensional model is presented for common mental disorders, defined by symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although anxiety symptoms are often related to threat and depressive symptoms to loss, the two types of symptoms are not independent and often co-exist. The data from two independent studies with general practice patients in which a common standardized research interview was used were analyzed using latent trait modeling. The results obtained for the symptoms of anxiety and depression, as for the diagnoses (ICD-9 or DSM-III) confirm the robustness of this model. The strength of this conceptual model is based on its potential simultaneously to illustrate the relationship between biological and social determinants of these common symptoms. These two types of symptoms are related to the physiological reactions in response to punishment and reward. They also illustrate how certain events in our social environment are specifically associated with the constitution of anxiety and depression. Conversely, genetic vulnerability appears to be non-specific and may determine an increased overall likelihood to develop symptoms under stress, but the nature of those symptoms (anxiety or depression) depend on other factors. Moreover, other variables (i.e. personality, social relations) modify the effect of these relationships. Our knowledge of inter-relationships between common psychiatric symptoms and events from the social environment thus appears sound, and is likely to withstand future developments in biological psychiatry.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1993,France,1993,90

1514117,"Reproductive and socioeconomic determinants of child survival: confounded, interactive, and age-dependent effects.","Studies of infant and child mortality have evolved to distinguish between two sets of explanatory variables-factors related to reproductive or maternal characteristics and socioeconomic factors, generally described as characteristics of the family or household. Almost all multivariate analyses include variables from each of these two sets, but there has been little consideration of the relationship between them. We examine how these two sets of variables jointly affect mortality. We test first for confounded effects by examining socioeconomic effects while excluding and then including reproductive variables in nested multivariate models. Next, we look for age-dependent effects among the explanatory variables and find that reproductive and socioeconomic factors affect mortality at differing ages of children. Finally, we examine interactive effects of the two sets of variables. We conclude that the higher mortality observed among the low status groups is not a result of greater concentration of poor reproductive patterns in those groups. Instead, higher status groups probably have more resources available for combating the negative effects of the same high-risk reproductive patterns.",Social biology,1992 Spring-Summer,United States,1992,90

METHODS: All women aged 48 years and residing in the catchment area of the Karolinska Hospital were recruited through the Swedish population register. They received a questionnaire covering sociodemographic background, reproductive health and gynaecological characteristics, social and work role related issues as well as a symptom rating scale. RESULTS: Seventy percent of the women returned the questionnaire. Of these, 73% were premenopausal, 21% were postmenopausal and 6% were perimenopausal. Hormone replacement therapy was used by 7.5% of the respondents and the rate of hysterectomy was 8.6%. Regular exercise was reported by 44.4%. Factor analysis of the symptom ratings yielded four independent dimensions: Negative Moods, Vasomotor symptoms, Decreased Sexual Desire and Well-being. Multiple regression analyses showed that only vasomotor symptoms were significantly related to menopausal status. Negative Mood and Reduced Sexual Interest were better explained by the presence of vasomotor symptoms and by reproductive health and lifestyle variables such as current or previous PMS, dysmenorrhea, smoking and lack of exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Only vasomotor symptoms were significantly related to menopausal status. Psychosocial and lifestyle variables as well as past or current reproductive health are more important determinants of women's psychological well-being during transition to menopause than menopausal status.",Maturitas,1994 Dec,Ireland,1994,90

Data were collected through: 1) mailed questionnaires to the participants every three months, 2) a mailed questionnaire to all general practitioners in the counties, and 3) the Health Insurance Register. Data were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Utilization of health services was found to be strongly associated with gender and health characteristics, especially with respect to functional status and chronic diseases. Health service characteristics, demographic and psycho-social factors had very little impact on utilization patterns.

7664962,Racial and ethnic differences in birthweight: the role of income and financial assistance.,"This paper attempts to explain the differences in birthweight observed between blacks, white Anglos, Chicanos, and other racial and ethnic groups. The analysis focuses on the role of income and financial assistance from relatives and public programs. Using data from the NLS Youth Panel, I construct a casual model of birthweight containing exogenous social and demographic risk factors and intervening proximate determinants of birthweight. A substantial part of the gap in birthweight between white Anglos and other ethnic groups (especially blacks) can be explained by the unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the latter. On the other hand, blacks and other minorities smoke less and have other favorable proximate characteristics that depress differences in birthweight. When these proximate determinants are controlled, large ethic differences in birthweight remain unexplained by income and other sociodemographic factors.",Demography,1995 May,United States,1995,90
1736023,Measuring physician mental workload: reliability and validity assessment of a brief instrument.,"This study examined the reliability and validity of a brief six-item instrument to measure the mental workload experienced by residents for specific patient visits to an ambulatory care clinic. Participating in the study were twenty-two residents in postgraduate years 1 through 3 who were working in the general outpatient clinic of an inner city, private, nonprofit community hospital. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the instrument was 0.80. Findings supported several theory-based hypotheses on determinants and performance consequences of mental workload. Mental workload was positively correlated with fatigue (r = 0.42, P = 0.03) and inversely correlated with residents' self-rated experience with patients' problems (r = -0.65, P less than 0.001). Residents' performance was measured through self-ratings and faculty physicians' ratings. Mental workload was inversely correlated with self-rated performance (r = -0.67, P less than 0.001). The correlation of mental workload with faculty physician ratings that reflected the technical dimension of patient care (physician examination, medications, and procedures) was r = -0.38 (P = 0.04). With mental workload squared, the correlation was r = -0.45 (P = 0.02) and the form of the relationship, consistent with the hypothesis, was a slightly downward sloping curve. Limitations of this research are discussed as well as suggestions for further research.",Medical care,1992 Feb,United States,1992,90
9730360,Ethnic differences in correlates of adolescent cigarette smoking.,"PURPOSE: To examine the correlates of cigarette smoking among African-American, Hispanic, and white adolescents in a cross-sectional national sample. METHODS: A total of 1795 mother-child dyads from the 1992 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were selected for analyses. Measures of adolescents cigarette smoking and family, individual, peer, and sociodemographic risk factors were analyzed. RESULTS: White youths reported the highest rates of lifetime, current, and persistent smoking, and initiated smoking at a significantly earlier age than African-Americans and Hispanics. Except for maternal cigarette smoking and substance use, African-Americans and Hispanics experienced a disproportionately larger number of purported risk factors than whites. Multivariate analyses revealed common and ethnic-specific correlates of adolescent lifetime and current smoking, with many more significant associations among whites than minorities. Common correlates included youth's age across all three ethnic groups, problem behaviors and delinquency among whites and African-Americans, and perceived peer pressure to smoke among whites and Hispanics. Ethnic-specific correlates included maternal smoking, maternal cocaine use, low maternal religiosity, and negative scholastic attitudes, which increased smoking for whites; and positive parenting, which reduced smoking for African-Americans. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of effects of maternal smoking and perceived peer pressure to smoke on African-American adolescents compared with whites suggests that role modeling and interpersonal influence may be more important determinants of smoking for white than African-American adolescents. The differential impact of family and peer factors on the smoking of adolescents of different ethnicity warrants further investigation.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90

Simply eating with one other person increases the average amount ingested in meals by 44% and with more people present the average meal size grows even larger. The impact of social facilitation of energy intake on the individual appears to result from genetic effects both on the individuals' sensitivity to the presence of other people and also on the number of other people an individual tends to eat with. Culture markedly affects the choice of foods in the diet and the pattern of meals over the day.

1753246,Medical educational and functional determinants of employment after stroke.,To evaluate the medical educational and functional determinants of employment after stroke a total of 204 Patients were assessed for functional changes during rehabilitation and after one year. Additionally the educational and social background of each patient was documented. One year after discharge from the rehabilitation unit 11.3% of the patients worked full-time and 2.7% part time. Another 14.7% had the decision pension versus employment still pending and 0.5% were classified as unemployed. 70.8% received regular retirement plan payments or disability pensions. Generally a similar level of functional capabilities can be observed after one year for working and non-working patients except for manual dexterity. Early admission to rehabilitation (within the first 12 weeks) favours return to work. A high school degree qualifying for university entrance and a well paid and better qualified profession as well are correlated with a higher percentage of patients regaining their employment. An other determining factor of employment after CVA is the physical requirement of the former work. Most of the working patients (92%) had been either transferred onto a job suited for an handicapped people or their work plan had been restructured accordingly.,Journal of neural transmission.

8803732,"Psychosocial conventionality, health orientation, and contraceptive use in adolescence.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to determine psychosocial and behavioral factors that are associated with variation in contraceptive use among adolescents. Because regular use of contraception may be seen both as a conventional behavior and as a health-protective behavior, analyses assess the association between psychosocial conventionality and health orientation, on the one hand, and variation in contraceptive use, on the other. METHODS: Analyses are based on an urban sample of 971 white, African-American, and Hispanic male and female sexually active high school students. Study participants filled out a 38-page questionnaire that included a wide range of measures derived from Problem-Behavior Theory. RESULTS: Correlational analysis and hierarchical regression analysis indicate that more regular contraceptive use is associated with greater psychosocial conventionality and also with greater orientation toward health for both male and female adolescents. These relationships hold when the sociodemographic characteristics of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, grade in school, family composition, and pregnancy experience are controlled. The linkages of psychosocial conventionality and health orientation to contraceptive behavior are stronger for African-American than for white and Hispanic adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings establish a more comprehensive and more distal set of influences on regularity of contraceptive use. In its negative relationship to problem behavior and its positive linkage with health behavior, contraceptive behavior may be seen as part of a larger, organized system of behavior in this stage of development (i.e., a more conventional adolescent lifestyle).",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1996 Jun,United States,1996,90
8203689,The size of mortality differences associated with educational level in nine industrialized countries.,"OBJECTIVES: This study addresses the question of whether inequalities in premature mortality related to educational level differ among countries. METHODS: Data on mortality by educational level were obtained from longitudinal studies from nine industrialized countries. The data referred to men between 35 and 64 years of age. The follow-up periods occurred between 1970 and 1982. The size of mortality differences associated with educational level was measured by means of two inequality indices, both based on Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: Inequalities in mortality are relatively small in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway and about two times as large in the United States, France, and Italy. Finland and England and Wales occupy intermediate positions. The large inequalities in mortality in the United States and France can be attributed in part to large inequalities in education in these countries. CONCLUSIONS: The international pattern found in this study was also observed in a comparison that used occupation as the socioeconomic indicator. Differences between countries in levels of inequality in mortality may be partially explained by the countries' different levels of egalitarian social and economic policies.",American journal of public health,1994 Jun,United States,1994,90
8465065,Determinants of estrogen replacement therapy use in northern Italy.,"Socio-demographic characteristics, general lifestyle habits and menstrual and reproductive history were compared in 83 women aged 45 years or more who had at some time used estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and 1759 never users interviewed as control subjects in the framework of a large case-control survey on risk factors for gynecological neoplasms conducted in Northern Italy. ERT use was strongly related to social class and level of education. The odds ratio of ""ever"" use was 3.0 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.8-5.1) for women with 12 or more years of education, compared with those with less than 7 years. No relationship emerged between marital status and ERT use, but parous women tended to be less frequently ever users than nulliparous, and ERT use decreased with increasing number of births (chi 2 1 trend = 10.51, p. = 0.001). Post-menopausal women reported more frequent ERT use than peri-menopausal ones, and among post-menopausal subjects the use was more frequent in those reporting earlier age at menopausal (chi 2 1 trend = 5.33, p = 0.02). There was no association between smoking habits and ERT use, but Quetelet's index was inversely related to the use of ERT.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1993,France,1993,90

Recent research on human skeletal samples and related archeological materials suggests that morbidity and mortality were increasing throughout much of the Western Hemisphere before 1492 in response to increased population density, increased sedentism, and changing subsistence. The evidence suggests that after 1492 population reduction was caused not by continental pandemics but by localized or regional epidemics augmented by social and economic disruption.

SUBJECTS: A subsample of men at work, aged 40-54 y extracted from the base-line data from four independent prospective studies, each representing a period (Physical Fitness Study (1977-1978), Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health (BIRNH) (1979-1984), Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases (MONICA) (1986-1991) and ORCA (1992-1993)). DESIGN: Linear regression of the average body mass index (kg/m2) and logistic regression of the prevalence of obesity (BMI > or = 30kg/m2). Independent variables taken into account in multivariate analysis were: age, educational level, marital status and region. RESULTS: In this subsample of Belgian men at work, aged 40-54 y, prevalence of obesity increased from 9.2% in 1977-1978 to 14.5% in 1992-1993. This rise was present in each five-year age group, in both regions and in all educational groups, but strongest in the lowest educated. After adjustment for sociodemographic covariables, it was estimated that with regard to 1977-1978, the proportion of men with a BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 doubled over the 15-year period (odds ratio OR (95% confidence intervals, 95% CI)): 1.98 (1.40; 2.80). CONCLUSION: Keeping in mind that the trends have been calculated from data from four different studies, presenting some shortcomings, prevalence of obesity has increased between 1977-1992 in men aged 40-54 y at work. This rise is particularly pronounced in the lower educated groups.",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,1998 Oct,England,1998,90
8211537,Patterns of condom use and sexual behavior among never-married women.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Use of condoms is one of the main methods sexually active persons may choose to prevent infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Little is known about patterns of condom use among women in the United States. We provide a conceptualization of patterns of condom use and factors associated with these patterns. GOAL OF THIS STUDY: To examine patterns of condom use and associated characteristics among sexually active, never-married women in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of data from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth, which is a nationally representative sample of women in their childbearing years. RESULTS: Only a minority of sexually active, never-married women report using condoms, and even fewer report using them consistently. Women with characteristics traditionally associated with increased risk of infection with STD and HIV appear to be less likely to report using condoms and to report using them consistently. Women who report use of condoms to prevent STDs are more likely to report consistent condom use; less likely to cease using condoms; and more likely to initiate consistent condom use. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the need for innovative programming targeted for specific sexually active populations to promote both initiation and maintenance of use of condoms.",Sexually transmitted diseases,1993 Jul-Aug,United States,1993,90

A high educational level is not found to reduce marriage intensities for women, although educational enrollment appears to be less compatible with marriage for women than men. The effect of employment varies according to prevailing sex-role expectations. The data support the assumption that modern cohabitation developed from two socially opposite origins, the educated elite and the working class. A social value dimension is assumed to have a major effect upon the present-day choice between marriage and cohabitation.""

9634135,Determinants of harsh parenting in Mexico.,"This paper presents a structural model of the determinants of harsh parenting among Mexican mothers. One hundred five mothers (46 from the community; 59 referred to agencies for child maltreatment) were recruited from Sonora (Northern) Mexico and interviewed. In this model the use of physical punishment was explained by (1) authoritarian parenting style (mothers' beliefs concerning the effective use of physical punishment and mothers' lack of disciplinary skills) and (2) family dysfunction (a latent variable constructed from reports of interspousal violence and the parents' use of alcohol and drugs). In addition, the indirect effects of demographic and historical variables on harsh parenting was included. The findings show that the most important factor influencing the use of physical punishment in these families was authoritarian parenting style, exerting a significant direct effect on the mothers' reports of their use of harsh punishment. Family dysfunction had an indirect effect through parenting style. Some sociodemographic variables also indirectly influenced the use of beliefs maternal punishment It is concluded that cultural beliefs play a major role in parenting within the framework of Mexican family relations.",Journal of abnormal child psychology,1998 Apr,United States,1998,90

11618375,Anchored narratives: the story and findings of half a century of research into the determinants of fertility.,"This paper reviews half a century of research into the determinants of fertility. It is argued that the quest for the determinants of fertility behaviour and change during that period can best be interpreted as the development of a series of sub-narratives from different disciplinary perspectives and orientations. These are normally based upon the initial narrative of the demographic transition and usually take the form of a verbal theory illustrated by a 'box and arrow' diagram. On occasions formalization has been attempted. Different parts of the initial narrative have been highlighted at different times depending on policy interest, improvements in technical skills, availability of data, changes in social setting, and the degree of satisfaction with the dominant sub-narrative of the day. There is every reason to believe that the research process identified will continue and will lead to a further accumulation of knowledge. In fact, all important variables have probably already been identified. That it will, ultimately, lead to a single, consolidated narrative fully satisfactory for all settings and for all time is, however, highly unlikely.",Population studies,1996 Nov,England,1996,90

8146138,Human ecology and behavior and sexually transmitted bacterial infections.,"The three direct determinants of the rate of spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are sexual behaviors, the mean duration of infectiousness, and the mean efficiency of sexual transmission of each STD. Underlying ecological and behavioral factors that operate through one or more of these direct determinants lie on a continuum, ranging from those most proximate back to those more remote (in time or mechanism) from the direct determinants. Most remote and least modifiable are the historical stages of economic development that even today conspicuously influence patterns of sexual behavior. Next are the distribution and changing patterns of climate, hygiene, and population density; the global population explosion and stages of the demographic transition; and ongoing changes in human physiology (e.g., menarche at younger age) and culture (e.g., later marriage). More proximate on the continuum are war, migration, and travel; and current policies for economic development and social welfare. Most recent or modifiable are technologic and commercial product development (e.g., oral contraceptives); circumcision, condom, spermicide, and contraception practices; patterns of illicit drug use that influence sexual behaviors; and the accessibility, quality, and use of STD health care. These underlying factors help explain why the curable bacterial STDs are epidemic in developing countries and why the United States is the only industrialized country that has failed to control bacterial STDs during the AIDS era.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1994 Mar 29,United States,1994,90
2401284,Dietary and other determinants of lipoprotein levels within a population of 315 Dutch males aged 28 and 29.,"The objective of this study was to estimate the strength of the association between diet and serum lipids and lipoproteins within a free-living population. Three hundred and fifteen Dutch males aged 28 and 29 were located via the Army registry. Their diets were assessed through a dietary history questionnaire plus oral cross-check, and blood was sampled twice at a 1-week interval. Height, weight, skinfolds, and waist and hip circumference were measured to estimate amount and location of body fat. Physical activity, social status and smoking were estimated through questionnaires. The range of cholesterol values predicted from differences in dietary fatty acid and cholesterol intake as summarized by the Keys equation score was 5.11 to 6.29 mmol/l, while the actual levels ranged from 3.30 to 9.28 mmol/l. Multiple regression analysis showed a weak but significant association of the Keys score with total cholesterol (slope 0.83, P less than 0.05), LDL cholesterol (slope 0.71, P less than 0.05), and the HDL/total cholesterol ratio (slope -0.04, P less than 0.01). The percentage of energy from alcohol was strongly and independently associated with both total and HDL cholesterol (slopes 0.04 and 0.02, P less than 0.001). Body fat parameters were strongly associated with all serum lipids and lipoproteins. We conclude that the contribution of dietary differences to differences in serum lipids and lipoproteins within this population is real but small.",European journal of clinical nutrition,1990 Jul,England,1990,90

Accompanying this growth, we can expect that challenges associated with a large bilingual and non-English speaking older population may become more pronounced. The purpose of this research was to examine the level and determinants of English proficiency among older Hispanics in the United States. Data from the 1990 Census indicate that a third of the older Hispanic population in the United States speaks English poorly or not at all. This group includes a sizable number who are ""linguistically isolated"" in that they either live alone or with other nonproficient speakers of English.

This struggle has been especially difficult with the seriously and persistently ill patient who requires more than a minimal hospital stay. Justification of the work with the longer-stay patient has now come under extreme pressure from utilization review, third-party payors and quality assurance, but hospital psychiatrists continue to have the same difficulties with documentation. Based on two years of chart review with clinical teams, principles of psychosocial rehabilitation and a dynamically oriented philosophy of inpatient treatment for the long-term patient, this presentation demonstrates one method for linking problems and goals with length of stay, quality assurance behaviors with quality of care, and integration of the multidisciplinary team into the entire process.",Journal of mental health administration,1990 Fall,United States,1990,90

In addition, early sexual debut is eight times as likely among black boys as among non-Hispanic white boys. Children who use controlled substances at an early age are more than twice as likely to have sex before age 14 as those who do not, although the type of substance having an effect is different for girls (cigarettes) and boys (alcohol).

Self-esteem was assessed with the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale. RESULTS: Using univariate twin analyses of self-esteem and a repeated measurement twin model, we found that self-esteem is a moderately heritable trait (heritability = 52% in the repeated measurement model); environmental influences are also very important, and are probably mostly not shared by members of a twin pair.

8154737,"Determinants of adolescent fertility and its consequences for maternal health, with special reference to rural Bangladesh.","The second section of this paper set forth a theoretical model relating adolescent growth and development to family formation patterns and their implications for maternal and child health. Subsequent sections of the paper examine the evidence to support specific relationships hypothesized in the model, focusing on longitudinal data from Matlab, Bangladesh. Despite the emphasis on developing country populations, literature from developed countries was also reviewed. The weight of the evidence suggests that in the developed countries, while there is a positive relationship between reproductive maturation and subsequent reproductive behavior, the negative effects of young maternal age on pregnancy outcome is confounded with socioeconomic factors. Teenage pregnancy, or at least teenage birth, occurs disproportionately among the socially and economically disadvantaged. Moreover, teenage childbearing in the U.S., especially when it occurs outside of marriage, violates social norms, at least in the white population. Poor diet may be a problem in the U.S. but it does not appear to result in notable delays in physical growth and development, delayed or compromised adolescent growth, or late age at menarche. Limited evidence suggests that early menarche may be associated with more rapid onset of mature menstrual cycle activity but these findings have not been replicated elsewhere. In developing countries the situation is quite different. First, early marriage and childbearing are desired and common across most segments of society. Second, malnutrition is widespread, and is sufficiently severe to delay the adolescent growth spurt and raise average age at menarche by two to three years compared with developed country populations. This is certainly the case in Bangladesh. In this setting, several observations regarding the relationship of nutritional status, adolescent development and reproduction have been made. First, undernutrition delays growth and reproductive maturation, and women who mature early (i.e., women with young age at menarche) marry at younger ages than later maturers. In addition, body weight appears to have an independent effect on age at marriage, net of age at menarche, such that relatively heavy women marry at younger ages than their lighter counterparts. Explanations for this finding include correlation between body weight and development of secondary sex characteristics, and perhaps a cultural perception that heavier (i.e., normal body weight) women are more attractive, or healthier, mates. The effect of menarche and nutritional status on marriage gives rise to concern that an improvement in nutritional status, and an increase in the age at menarche, would lead to younger marriage and first birth, and higher lifetime fertility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,1994 Feb 18,United States,1994,90
2246428,Attributions for social failure and aggression in incarcerated delinquent youth.,"While a variety of cognitive deficits and biases have been found to characterize aggressive and delinquent children and youth, very little attention has focused on determining whether aggressive youth also display deviant attributional beliefs in response to social failure. Research in the more impersonal cognitive domains such as achievement has shown attributions for failure to be potent determinants of both affective reactions and subsequent responding. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate whether specific attributional patterns following social failure may also relate to aggressive behavior. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between the level of self-reported physical aggression and specific attributional patterns following hypothetical social failure in a sample of incarcerated delinquent males. While the general hypotheses were that increased aggressiveness would be related to a greater tendency to endorse attributions for social failure that are external, stable, and controllable, only the hypothesis with regard to controllability was supported. The findings are discussed in terms of the relation between cognition and aggression in delinquent youth.",Journal of abnormal child psychology,1990 Aug,United States,1990,90

The subjects were interviewed before treatment, then 6 and 12 to 15 months after initiation of treatment. Simultaneously, they completed questionnaires on psychological symptoms and social support. It appeared that well-being at baseline and at the follow-ups were highly correlated. Furthermore, cervical cancer patients reported significantly more symptoms on all occasions. After discriminant function analysis, the following three variables remained in the analysis: (a) well-being before treatment, (b) diagnosis, and (c) children at home. This allowed 81% of the patients to be classified as having a favorable versus an unfavorable outcome. The results of this study highlight the importance of well-being before treatment as a predictor of well-being after treatment.

8041010,[The quality of life in aged people].,"The quality of life (QOL) in aged people is an important issue that has been discussed for a long time and led to a number of studies. In this review article, the relationship between subjective QOL of the aged and various factors is summarized by referring to articles published in the United States of America. In the first chapter, representative methods for the quantitative analysis of subjective QOL are described. Among a variety of methods for measuring subjective QOL, the LSI-A and the PGC Morale Scales are commonly used. In the next chapter, based on the studies using these methods, various factors that determined subjective QOL are analyzed. These studies indicate that physical well-being and socio-economic status are significant determinants of the QOL for the aged people. In addition, employment and social activity are shown to be associated with subjective QOL. On the other hand, age, gender, race and marital status do not have an influence on subjective QOL for the aged as individual factors. QOL can not be measured with a unidimensional scale. Therefore, it is necessary for the investigator to carefully choose an appropriate analytical method by understanding the characteristics of the research subject and the purpose of the study.

This population was living under extreme conditions of hardship. Long, medium and short wavelength cycles in the rate of illegitimacy have been identified by time series analysis; each represents a different response to social and economic pressures. In a complex interaction of events, the peaks of the cycles in wheat prices were associated with rises in adult mortality which promoted an influx of migrants and a concomitant rise in illegitimacy. The association between immigration and illegitimacy was particularly noticeable after the mortality crises of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Children of immigrant families also tended to produce illegitimate offspring. Native and immigrant families responded differently to extrinsic fluctuations, and variations in their reproductive behaviour were probably related to access to resources.",Journal of biosocial science,1997 Apr,England,1997,90
9731156,Towards a framework for women's health.,"The health of women involves their emotional, social, cultural, spiritual and physical well-being and is influenced by social, political and economic factors, as well as by a woman's biology. This definition of women's health provides the conceptual framework for a relevant and effective approach to patient education, health promotion and disease prevention activities in women. Such activities must focus not only on diseases that are more common, more prevalent or more serious in women, but also on priority health issues identified by women themselves, the diversity of women, the determinants of health and above all, the impact of gender on health. These programs must also be based on knowledge resulting from gender sensitive, bias-free health research. The traditional oppression and disempowerment of women must also be addressed at both personal and societal levels, thus broadening our approach so that we become social as well as health activists.",Patient education and counseling,1998 Mar,Ireland,1998,90

In order to effectively engage in physical activity counseling, the determinants of physical activity must be understood and integrated into effective interventions for youths. This review of research literature includes a critique of intervention studies aimed at helping children and adolescents adopt active lifestyles that will be sustained throughout life. Social cognitive theory provided the theoretical basis for most of the studies reviewed but specification of how theory concepts were operationalized in the interventions was often unclear. Suggestions for increasing the rigor of theoretically based intervention studies aimed at promoting physical activity are proposed. Models and variables are identified that need further testing to determine their relevance to the promotion of physical activity during childhood and adolescence.",Annual review of nursing research,1998,United States,1998,90
9561644,"Aging, food, culture and health.","International comparison of food intake and health studies amongst the aged is providing new insight into the importance of food culture in social context for healthy aging. At same time the possible variance in eating behavior compatible with good health requires consideration. The IUNS (International Union of Nutritional Sciences) FHILL (Food Habits in Later Life) Project, comprises (1) a morbidity study on about 2,000 elderly in 13 communities (now available on CD Rom) and (2) a mortality follow-up study. In the morbidity study, a total health assessment score or Later Life Status Score (LLSS) has been considered in relation to non-nutritional and nutritional factors. The elderly Greek cohorts aged 70+ in Melbourne. Australia (M = 94, F = 95) and Spata, Greece (M = 51, F = 53) have been used as a model for multivariate analyses to determine separately the importance of non-nutritional (well-being, memory, general health, medication-use, activities of daily living, exercise, social activity and social networks scores) and nutritional variables (intake of food groups g/day, food group variety scores, nutrients) in accounting for LLSS. A mortality follow-up study on the elderly cohort in Spata, Greece has also been completed and published. The findings from these preliminary analyses on the Greek cohorts will be reviewed as an example of how food culture may be influencing both quality of life and survival in Greek elderly. The most important non-nutritional determinants of LLSS in Greeks included: mobility and independence (exercise and activities of daily living), well-being and memory (collectively explained 80% of the variation of LLSS). For nutritional variables, a high intake and variety of plant foods (in particular vegetables, legumes and fruit); a high intake and variety of seafood and a low intake of meat emerged with statistical and biological significance. Results from the mortality study also agree with findings from the morbidity study--particularly the importance of the overall traditional greek food culture, with its emphasis on plant derived food of various kinds, as opposed to individual food categories, in protecting against premature death. Strategies are advanced which may optimise nutritionally related health problems amongst the aged around the globe.",The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,1997,Thailand,1997,90
16203507,The interplay of drinking patterns and other determinants of health.,"The health effects of alcohol are determined not only by level of intake but also by patterns of alcohol use and many other health determinants. This study seeks to identify groups of individuals who share various features in terms of drinking styles and other health indicators. Data used are a subset of the 1990 Ontario Health Survey, corresponding to men and women aged 20-64 with complete data in four substantive areas: alcohol use; demographic characteristics; current health status; and various behavioural risk factors for chronic disease. Cluster analysis was used to groups of male and female respondents who were similar in terms of their style of alcohol use, along with other constructs relevant to health risk and health status. For both sexes, clusters were identified which matched expectation in terms of drinking patterns and other relevant variables. For both sexes, clusters were found with generally higher social class indicators, generally positive health behaviours and health status and drinking patterns which did not include drinking to excess. Clusters were also found for which high-volume drinking occasions corresponded with poor health status and high levels of risk factors for chronic disease. Other unanticipated patterns were also identified. This information may assist in identifying confounding effects in epidemiological studies as well as identifying the characteristics of unique sub-populations which are likely to be the focus of primary prevention efforts.",Drug and alcohol review,1998 Dec,Australia,1998,90
24203500,Behavioral research on diabetes at the Oregon Research Institute.,"This article overviews the scope and progression of research on behavioral aspects of diabetes over the past decade at the Oregon Research Institute. Our research team has investigated several topics including: (a) conceptual models of self-management; (b) social learning factors associated with regimen adherence; (c) individual and group-based interventions to enhance diabetes self-management; (d) rates and determinants of participation in diabetes education; (e) determinants of glycemic control; and (f) patient models (beliefs) about diabetes and its treatment.We have employed a social learning theory approach to diabetes management, and over the past decade have come to adopt a broader public health perspective that addresses environmental influences on diabetes self-management at multiple levels (e.g. family, health care system, community). This approach has led us to conclude that increased attention should be devoted to the most prevalent types of diabetes, to the behavioral issues that create the most difficulty for the greatest number of patients, and to the social environment in which patients live and diabetes management education takes place. Our research focus has evolved over time and currently emphasizes: (a) assessment and tailoring of intervention based upon the patient's perspective; (b) patient-provider interactions; and (c) brief, low-cost, and system-wide interventions that can be implemented in medical office settings. Lessons learned from this research, the potential disseminability of our findings, and future directions are summarized.",Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,1995 Mar,England,1995,90
8816208,Perceived social norms as crucial determinants of mother's injury-preventive behaviour.,"In order to design injury-preventive programmes aimed at parents, an understanding of injury-preventive behaviour is essential. Questionnaires were obtained from 870 mothers of 3, 4 and 9-year-olds. The perceived social norm and other determinants for injury-preventive behaviour were analysed using three multivariate logistic regression models. The final logistic models classified 73.2-82.7% of respondents correctly. Perceived norms of relatives and friends were found to be the most important determinants of mothers' injury-preventive behaviour. Injury-preventive behaviour could neither be explained by mother's perception of injury risks, nor by the perceived norms of professionals within child health care and schools. This study indicates that in order to design injury-prevention programmes, an understanding of social norms is crucial.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1996 Jun,Norway,1996,90
8235739,Determinants of lactation performance across time in an urban population from Mexico.,"We identified determinants of breastfeeding and full breastfeeding among 165 healthy mothers from Hermosillo, Mexico who planned to breastfeed and delivered vaginally a healthy term infant. Deliveries took place in either a nursery (n = 58) or a rooming-in (n = 107) public hospital where formula supplementation was not allowed. Multivariate analyses indicated that at 1 week full breastfeeding was associated (P < or = 0.05) with early milk arrival, social support for full breastfeeding and planned breastfeeding duration. At 2 months, full breastfeeding was associated with social support for full breastfeeding and early milk arrival. Breastfeeding was positively associated with early milk arrival and inversely associated with early introduction of supplementary bottles, maternal employment, maternal body mass index and infant age. At 4 months, full breastfeeding was positively associated with social support for full breastfeeding and inversely associated with infant age. Breastfeeding was positively associated with planned breastfeeding duration and inversely associated with early introduction of a bottle and urban background. Rooming-in mothers reported that their milk came in earlier (P < or = 0.05) than did the nursery group. Milk arrival was later when a bottle was introduced in the first week; both of these variables might be important in explaining a positive effect of rooming-in on lactation performance.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Oct,England,1993,90
9179583,"The association between substance use, condom use and sexual risk among low-income women.","Substance use is frequently assumed to be associated with higher levels of sexual risk-taking and lower levels of condom use. An analysis of 668 black, Hispanic and white low-income women at public health and public assistance facilities in Miami show that 19% engaged in risky sexual behavior over the preceding six months, 24% in substance use and 31% in condom use. Overall, substance users are nearly four and one-half times more likely to take sexual risks than nonusers, but are about half as likely to have relied on condoms. When the probability of condom use is considered in the context of both substance use and sexual risk, substance users who take sexual risks appear just as likely to rely on condoms as are nonusers who take sexual risks and those who do not (odds of 0.43-0.49). However, substance users who do not take sexual risks are much less likely to use condoms (odds of 0.15). This pattern holds among black, Hispanic and white women, and suggests that perceptions of risk and the risks that partners bring to sexual encounters may be more important determinants of condom use than substance use per se.",Family planning perspectives,1997 May-Jun,United States,1997,90

Using data from the older men cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience, we examine the impact of employment, marriage, and being a supporter on health limitations and mortality. Employment has the most consistent health-protective effect, and the benefits of employment are more pronounced for Blacks than for Whites. Marriage affects health in conjunction with employment. These findings lend further support to the growing literature on the effects of roles on health. The results further illustrate the importance of ascribed statuses as structural determinants of the relationship between roles and health, highlighting the very real differences in the meanings and expectations of social roles for Blacks and Whites.",Journal of health and social behavior,1992 Jun,United States,1992,90
10548637,The effect of reproductive history on future pregnancy outcomes.,"The aim of this study was to examine the separate and joint effects of previous pregnancy history, year of pregnancy outcome, maternal age, height, smoking and fertility on risk of fetal death. Data were available from a study of female radiographers. Analyses were carried out on 3053 women with a total of 6993 pregnancies. Women reporting problems with conception or previous fetal losses had an increased risk of a pregnancy ending in a fetal death. In particular, women with primary or secondary infertility had an approximately fourfold increase in risk compared with women who reported no difficulties [odds ratio (OR): 3.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): (3.02, 5.07)]. This relationship was independent of pregnancy order and pregnancy history and was more marked in older maternal ages. The effect of pregnancy history was cumulative and possibly multiplicative in effect, with a threefold increase in the risk of losing a third pregnancy following two previous losses [OR: 3.19; 95% CI: (1.60, 6.35)]. There were no consistent patterns of risk associated with year of pregnancy outcome, maternal age, height or smoking status. These results suggest that previous pregnancy outcomes and problems with conception may be the strongest determinants of fetal loss in subsequent pregnancies.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",1999 Nov,England,1999,90
8616346,Socioeconomic determinants of rates of consultation in general practice based on fourth national morbidity survey of general practices.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the socioeconomic determinants of consultation rates in general practice. DESIGN: Analysis of data from the fourth national morbidity survey of general practices (MSGP4) including sociodemographic details of individual patients and small area statistics from the 1991 census. Multilevel modelling techniques were used to take account of both individual patient data and small area statistics to relate socioeconomic and health status factors directly to a measure of general practitioner workload. RESULTS: Higher rates of consultations were found in patients who were classified as permanently sick, unemployed (especially those who became unemployed during the study year), living in rented accommodation, from the Indian subcontinent, living with a spouse or partner (women only), children living with two parents (girls only), and living in urban areas, especially those living relatively near the practice. When characteristics of individual patients are known and controlled for the role of ""indices of deprivation"" is considerably reduced. The effect of individual sociodemographic characteristics were shown to vary between different areas. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic and socioeconomic factors can act as powerful predictors of consultation patterns. Though it will always be necessary to retain some local planning discretion, the sets of coefficients estimated for individual level factors, area level characteristics, and for practice groupings may be sufficient to provide an indicative level of demand for general medical services. Although the problems in using socioeconomic data from individual patients would be substantial, these results are relevant to the development of a resource allocation formula for general practice.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 Apr 20,England,1996,90

Studies on prevalence, mortality and socio-environmental factors.","This population-based study was conducted to determine the prevalence, mortality, and socio-environmental determinants of diarrhoeal diseases in children less than 5-years of age in a rural area of Akoko North, Ondo State, Nigeria. A total of 856 households with children less than 5-years old were randomly selected for the questionnaire and observational investigations. A two-week prevalence rate of the diseases among the children was 8.1%. The rate was highest among children 0-11 months old and slightly higher among the boys than girls. The infant mortality rate was 102/1000 and the mortality rate in less than 5-year old children was 62.1/1000 in the area. The majority of these deaths took place in the homes and health centres and were never reported. Social and environmental factors including dirty feeding bottles and utensils, inadequate disposal of faeces and household refuse, and poor storage of drinking water were found to be significantly related to the high incidence of the diseases. Educational interventions recommended for the control of the disease focused on these factors.",Journal of diarrhoeal diseases research,1991 Dec,Bangladesh,1991,90
8823347,Considerations of natural history and pathophysiology in the psychopharmacology of Tourette's syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: The increasing recognition of Tourette's syndrome is probably responsible for the broadening range of symptom severities seen in clinic patients. Greater clinical diversity also brings greater treatment challenges, particularly for children in whom the risks and benefits of medication for the developing central nervous system must be weighed against the long-term risks associated with the disorder itself. Knowledge of the natural history and pathophysiology of Tourette's syndrome is vitally important for informed clinical decision making. METHOD: A MEDLINE literature search was undertaken to identify studies of the natural history and pathophysiology of Tourette's syndrome that would be relevant to clinical psychopharmacology. RESULTS: Although impossible to predict with certainty for any given patient, the natural history of Tourette's syndrome is typically characterized by an early childhood onset, a prepubertal exacerbation, postpubertal attenuation, and an adult stabilization of symptoms. Symptoms fluctuate in all phases of the illness, often in response to stress. The natural history and clinical phenotype of Tourette's syndrome are thought to have both genetic and nongenetic determinants that are mediated through their effects on basal ganglia nuclei and related neural systems. Medications used in the treatment of Tourette's syndrome are thought to modulate the functioning of these neural systems. CONCLUSION: Although medication decisions must consider tic symptom severity, expectations of the disorder's natural history, and the child's adaptive capacities-his or her comorbid illnesses, coping mechanisms, interpersonal relatedness, impulse control, affect regulation, and family and social supports-are the most important determinants of well-being and outcome. These therefore are the most important considerations when making treatment decisions, as well.",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,1996,United States,1996,90

The census data allow an evaluation of socio-economic status of each subject, using variables such as education or occupation, or constructing indexes inclusive of deprivation indexes. Follow-up is from the census up to 1995 and for specific causes of death from 1987 (Leghorn) or 1991 (Florence). Estimates of risk are computed comparing rates of mortality among socio-economic groups, by means of poisson regression models, or by means of Standardized Mortality Ratios using the indirect method. The causes of deaths have been selected mainly because explained by known and strong determinants. As far as overall mortality, the results suggest the persistence of gradients by social class, more often negative among males. Mortality from lung cancer has a strong negative social class gradient among males, and a divergent gradient among women in the two towns, which is interpreted as the effect of a different prevalence of smoking by period, social class and sex. High RRs among lower socio-economic groups have been detected for liver cirrhosis mortality. Excess mortality of AIDS and overdose, an expression of the recent drug crisis, concentrates on the lower social strata and in young adults. Whereas mortality from AIDS has been detected among both sexes, deaths from overdose are occurring among males only. Being AIDS and overdose recent diseases, they stress the persistence of social inequalities over time.",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,1999 Jul-Sep,Italy,1999,90

METHODS: 1078 tenth grade high school students, 15-16 years old answered an anonymous questionnaire including, perceived concerns and risk behaviors, (e.g., smoking, alcohol, drugs, and sexual activity). Concerns were grouped into six domains. RESULTS: The most frequently reported concerns related to school, weight, coping with aggression, fatigue, war, enlistment into army, and relationships with peers. Girls had more concerns in the domains of self-image, anxiety, and relationships with peers (p < .05). Adolescents with mothers who had less education had significantly more concerns in the domains of anxiety and relationships with peers and adults (p < .05). Forty-seven percent engaged in at least one risk behavior (boys 63% and girls 34%). The Guttman scalogram indicated the following sequence of risk behaviors: alcohol, cigarettes, sex, and drugs. There were statistically significant associations between concerns and risk behaviors in the domains of anxiety, sex, and relationships with adults and peers. CONCLUSION: Many adolescent concerns are universal, although the ranking and prevalence may vary based on different regional and population characteristics (e.g., in this population a high rate of concerns relating to aggression and war were identified).

DESIGN: Recognizing the vulnerabilities of infants and children and their dependence on caring adults, a model of pain communication is proposed. The model examines (a) the pain experiences of children, including social determinants; (b) developmental variations in the capacity to encode the severity and qualities of pain as expressive behavior; (c) adult skills and deficiencies in decoding pain; and (d) the actions of adults predicated on the meaning and significance attached to children's actions. Limitations in care were examined. DATA SOURCES: The current research and professional literature were accessed through searches of the Psyclit and Medline databases for relevant investigations on the basis of our working knowledge of the literature. CONCLUSION: Numerous deterrents to optimal care are identified in the domains of commonplace beliefs about the nature of pain in infants and children: failure to recognize the impact of socialization in familial and cultural modes of experience and expression; needs for age-specific assessment instruments; the limited capacity to use available evidence concerning pain; the need to employ clinicians, parents, and other adults more effectively in delivering care; and structural problems in the health care system.",The Clinical journal of pain,1996 Sep,United States,1996,90

1796339,Predicting elderly cardiac patients at risk for readmission.,"Elder patients with cardiac disease are at high risk for physical deterioration during post hospital recovery and suffer frequent early readmission. It is important to identify such patients who frequently need help with discharge planning from social workers during their first admission. This study utilized computerized data on 628 patients, 238 of whom were readmissions. Question was raised as to what factors (functional, psychological, social and environmental), differentiated patients who were readmitted from those who were not. Using logistic regression, three variables: marital status, presence of coping difficulty and age of patients were identified as predictors of readmission within three months. Those who were married were less likely to be readmitted. Those with coping difficulties and older individuals were more likely to be readmitted. The accuracy of prediction, using these three factors, was 61 percent. Of those patients predicted as not being readmitted, sixty-nine percent were correctly predicted, while 39 percent were readmitted. Of patients predicted as readmissions, 49 percent were correctly predicted, while 51 percent were not. The major limitation of this study was that key physiological determinants of readmission were not collected. It is imperative that a valid screening device for predicting who is at risk for readmission should include physiological preconditions as well as functional and psychosocial data.",Social work in health care,1991,United States,1991,90

This was a complete rupture with the medical thinking which had prevailed since the time of Hippocrates. Yet, for the vast majority of mankind, harmony with environmental reality remains the most important determinant of good or ill health. This scission explains to a great extent the differences between traditional and Western medicine, which are based on entirely different concepts and on distinct paradigms. Environment as a health determinant--in its broadest definition to include both physical and social environments--is again being considered of importance as a result of better understanding of causality factors, and because of the influence of disciplines such as ecology and epidemiology. Here we show that human societies can develop different methods of adjusting to their environments, some of which would increase the risks of disease and others which can be considered as resistance factors of a social nature. Societies and individuals alike are not equal in relation to health risks.","Sante (Montrouge, France)",1995 Nov-Dec,France,1995,90
1514117,"Reproductive and socioeconomic determinants of child survival: confounded, interactive, and age-dependent effects.","Studies of infant and child mortality have evolved to distinguish between two sets of explanatory variables-factors related to reproductive or maternal characteristics and socioeconomic factors, generally described as characteristics of the family or household. Almost all multivariate analyses include variables from each of these two sets, but there has been little consideration of the relationship between them. We examine how these two sets of variables jointly affect mortality. We test first for confounded effects by examining socioeconomic effects while excluding and then including reproductive variables in nested multivariate models. Next, we look for age-dependent effects among the explanatory variables and find that reproductive and socioeconomic factors affect mortality at differing ages of children. Finally, we examine interactive effects of the two sets of variables. We conclude that the higher mortality observed among the low status groups is not a result of greater concentration of poor reproductive patterns in those groups. Instead, higher status groups probably have more resources available for combating the negative effects of the same high-risk reproductive patterns.",Social biology,1992 Spring-Summer,United States,1992,90

1408862,Determinants of career attainments of doctorates in nursing.,"The career attainments of graduates of doctoral programs in nursing during two academic career stages after the doctorate were examined. Educational associations and work experiences were the most important determinants of postdoctoral career attainments. The quality of the doctoral program attended and predoctoral work experiences significantly influenced initial institutional quality, which in turn influenced current institutional quality. The current institutional quality, then, had direct effects on current attainments in the areas of professorial rank, publication productivity, and income. Graduate school quality was the most important factor in first institutional quality, as it tracked faculty into certain strata of the higher educational hierarchy. Consistent with the academic stratification system in higher education, those in high quality programs attained lower professorial ranks but higher publication productivity and higher recognition than those who gained employment in unranked schools.",Nursing research,1992 Jul-Aug,United States,1992,90
7674044,Staff nurse work empowerment and perceived autonomy. Testing Kanter's theory of structural power in organizations.,"Nurse executives have been striving for the means to equalize the power base in healthcare settings. They also have been seeking ways to overcome the perceived powerlessness of their staffs. Empowerment and increased autonomy in the work setting often are described as mechanisms to achieve these goals. This study, based on Kanter's theory of the structural determinants of behavior in organizations, examined formal and informal power as predictors of job-related empowerment and autonomy. Results of the study lend support to the use of the theory in healthcare settings as a way for nurse executives to develop increased access to the sources of job-related empowerment for their staffs.",The Journal of nursing administration,1995 Sep,United States,1995,90

8543930,"Maternal factors related to parenting practices, developmental expectations, and perceptions of child behavior problems.","Parenting practices of a representative sample of 1,056 urban mothers with very young children were studied via the Parent Behavior Checklist (Fox, 1994) and the Behavior Screening Questionnaire (Richman & Graham, 1971). Potential determinants of parenting practices were also addressed, including maternal age, marital status, education level, number of children living at home, and family socioeconomic status. Less positive parenting practices concerning nuturing and discipline were found among mothers who were younger, had more than one child living at home, were single, had a lower income level, and had lower educational attainment. These mothers also tended to perceive their children as demonstrating more difficult behavior problems. However, the negative influence of some determinants of parenting practices, such as low income, was found to be moderated by the presence of other determinants, such as more education. The present results provide evidence that multiple determinants influence parenting practices among parents of young children.",The Journal of genetic psychology,1995 Dec,United States,1995,90
9695890,Motivation for physical activity among children and adolescents.,"Assisting children and adolescents in adopting physically active lifestyles is an integral part of the health education and health promotion services provide by nurses in school, family, community, and primary care settings. In order to effectively engage in physical activity counseling, the determinants of physical activity must be understood and integrated into effective interventions for youths. This review of research literature includes a critique of intervention studies aimed at helping children and adolescents adopt active lifestyles that will be sustained throughout life. Social cognitive theory provided the theoretical basis for most of the studies reviewed but specification of how theory concepts were operationalized in the interventions was often unclear. Suggestions for increasing the rigor of theoretically based intervention studies aimed at promoting physical activity are proposed. Models and variables are identified that need further testing to determine their relevance to the promotion of physical activity during childhood and adolescence.",Annual review of nursing research,1998,United States,1998,90
8780608,Method for separating patient and procedural factors while analyzing interdepartmental differences in rates of surgical infections: the Israeli Study of Surgical Infection in Abdominal Operations.,"The objective of this study was to develop a method for analyzing differences in the performance of hospitals with respect to outcome by separating patient factors from procedural factors. The setting included a prospective follow-up of a sample of 5571 patients undergoing all types of surgical procedures in general surgery departments of 11 hospitals (20 surgical departments) across Israel. Of these, 769 underwent surgery involving the opening of the bowel, and they are the subjects of this report. Our method consisted of a prospective follow-up by a nurse epidemiologist, including detailed clinical data from the day of admission to hospital discharge. Analysis was directed at identifying reasons for the observed variability in wound infections among departments. Observed rates were compared with ""expected"" rates calculated from a logistic model pooled over departments. An attempt was made to separate patient-inherent characteristics, such as age, sex, and diagnosis, from procedural factors, depicting the patient's experience during his hospitalization. Results indicated that the marked interdepartmental differences in the observed infection rates were not accounted for by differences in the ""case mix"" among departments. Procedural risk factors in this data set played the main role in explaining the observed variability among surgical departments. We conclude that the simple method presented here used the data pooled over departments to define the main risk determinants for infection in this data set. It separated intrinsic patient factors from procedural characteristics, and could be used in studies where the main interest is to compare institutions, and point at reasons behind the differences in outcomes.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,1996 Sep,United States,1996,90
1830689,Determinants of sciatica and low-back pain.,"Several factors were studied for their association with the prevalence of chronic low-back syndromes, sciatica, and unspecified low-back pain (LBP) in 2,946 women and 2,727 men (age range, 30-64 years) participating in the Mini-Finland Health Survey, a project aimed at comprehensive evaluation of the population's health. On the basis of a standardized clinical examination, a physician diagnosed sciatica in 5.1% and LBP in 11.6% of the subjects. Those with a previous traumatic back injury had a 2.5-fold risk of having sciatica or LBP. The fractions of sciatica and LBP attributable to such back injuries were estimated to be 16.5% and 13.7%, respectively. Sum indices of both physical and mental stress at work were found to be directly proportional to the prevalence of sciatica and LBP. Smokers had an increased risk of LBP, and body height was related positively to the prevalence of sciatica. These associations, however, were inconsistent between sex and age subgroups. In the presence of osteoarthritis in the knee, hip, or hand, LBP was prevalent (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-6.9), but sciatica was not (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.7). Diabetics were found to have a significantly decreased prevalence of LBP (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8). Many factors, independent of each other, determine the occurrence of chronic low-back syndromes. The determinants of sciatica and LBP are different to some extent.",Spine,1991 Jun,United States,1991,90
7780295,Determinants of early alcohol and drug use among young women in alcoholism treatment.,"Substance abuse experimentation may be one of several types of problem behaviors. Data from 99 Caucasian women interviewed in alcoholism treatment (19-29 years old) were used to test a developmental model of substance experimentation. Respondents were classified into three groups based on their use prior to age 15: nonusers, users of alcohol only, and users of alcohol and other drugs. Family history of alcoholism was not related to childhood anxiety and impulse control problems. Childhood anxiety and impulse control problems predicted adolescent emotional and impulse control problems but did not differentiate early experimenters. Whereas adolescent emotional problems were not related to early experimentation, early drug and alcohol users were significantly more likely to have engaged in other impulsive behaviors (e.g., running away from home, trouble with school authorities) than were nonusers or users of alcohol only. Alcoholism prevention programs, therefore, would do well to target youth who exhibit acting-out behaviors as a high-risk group for early alcohol and drug use.",Journal of substance abuse,1994,United States,1994,90
10512426,Fibrinogen and factor VII levels are related to adiposity but not to fetal growth or social class in children aged 10-11 years.,"Factors operating in fetal life or during childhood may be important in determining fibrinogen and factor VII concentrations in adult life, and particularly in explaining social gradients in cardiovascular disease risk. In 1994, the authors measured fibrinogen and factor VIIc levels in 641 children aged 10-11 years (61% response rate) from schools in five towns in England and Wales. Birth weight was obtained by maternal recall, and other data on measures of fetal growth were obtained from birth records. Fibrinogen levels were higher in girls (258.8 mg/dl) than in boys (245.4 mg/dl) (95% confidence interval (CI) for difference: 5.5, 21.5). Fibrinogen and factor VIIc levels were linearly related to adiposity, rising by 37.1 mg/dl (95% CI: 24.7, 49.5) and 13.0% of standard (95% CI: 6.3, 19.7), respectively, between the bottom and top quintiles of ponderal index (weight (kg)/height (m)3). Fibrinogen was independently related to heart rate (p < 0.001) and was negatively but nonsignificantly related to measures of physical activity. Factor VIIc was positively correlated with total cholesterol (p < 0.001). No relations were found with measures of fetal growth or social class. These data do not support the concept that fibrinogen or factor VII levels are determined in utero or by social factors in childhood. Adiposity and physical training appear to be the important determinants of fibrinogen and factor VII levels in childhood.",American journal of epidemiology,1999 Oct 1,United States,1999,90

The theoretical approach highlights regional differences in the returns to skills: regions that pay higher returns to skills attract more skilled workers than regions that pay lower returns. Our empirical results suggest that interstate differences in the returns to skills are a major determinant of both the size and skill composition of internal migration flows. Persons whose skills are most mismatched with the reward structure offered by their current state of residence are the persons most likely to leave that state, and these persons tend to relocate in states which offer higher rewards for their particular skills.""",Journal of urban economics,1992 Sep,United States,1992,90

2014409,The Tromso Study: predictors of self-evaluated health--has society adopted the expanded health concept?,"The determinants of self-evaluated general health status were examined in a comprehensive population study of 9408 men aged 20-61 and 9152 women aged 20-56. Reduced self-evaluated health was in both sexes closely related to symptoms and diseases connected to the musculo-skeletal system and psycho-social problems and less to age and some of the major chronic diseases. Physical activity at leisure time and workload were positively associated with self-evaluated health. Our findings indicate that an important dimension reflected by self-evaluation of health is the individual's perception of own physical performance and suffice in general. There is a striking gap between the conditions which reduce the population's subjective perceived health and our ability to offer these conditions effective treatment through the health care system. This suggests differences in health concept between the medical society and the population. The association between our applied measure and coronary risk profile, based on serum cholesterol, blood pressure and cigarette smoking, was found to be almost non-existent. This supports previous findings of self-evaluation of health as an independent predictor of survival.",Social science & medicine (1982),1991,England,1991,90
1894842,Relationship of role conflict and role ambiguity to selected job dimensions among joint appointees.,"The purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of role conflict and role ambiguity experienced by nurse faculty in joint academic-clinical appointments and non-joint-appointed faculty (traditional faculty), and to examine the relationships of these two constructs with social support, job satisfaction, and propensity to leave the joint appointment. Scholarly productivity of the two groups was also examined. Five hypotheses were proposed. The sample (N = 113) was drawn from the five Canadian university nursing faculties with the largest proportion of joint academic-clinical appointees. Findings indicate that assuming a joint appointment does not necessarily lead to an increase in role conflict and role ambiguity, and that joint appointees do not differ from traditional faculty in levels of role conflict and role ambiguity, scholarly productivity levels, or job satisfaction. Within the joint-appointee group (N = 33), role conflict was significantly higher than role ambiguity, both role conflict and role ambiguity had an adverse effect on job satisfaction and are determinants of intent to leave the joint appointment. In addition, social support was found to have a buffering effect on role conflict.",Journal of professional nursing : official journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing,1991 Jul-Aug,United States,1991,90

The analysis uses highly reliable data collected from the 1992 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of Malawi. The results show that the substantial birth interval and maternal age effects are largely limited to the infant period. The influence of social and economic variables on the mortality risk and on the relationship between biodemographic variables and mortality risk is much enhanced with increasing age of the child. It has also been found that consideration of breastfeeding status of the child does not significantly alter interpretation of effects of preceding birth interval length on mortality risk, but does partially diminish the succeeding birth interval effect. The results are discussed and then summarized in the context of policy implications for Malawi. The paper addresses a very important issue in Malawi and it adds valuable insights to the base of knowledge in childhood mortality in sub-Sahara Africa.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Feb,England,1999,90
9077016,[Hierarchical model: a proposal for a model to be applied in the investigation of risk factors for severe diarrhea].,"In epidemiological investigations of infant diseases, data are usually collected on a large set of variables. The associations between presumptive risk factors and the outcome is commonly evaluated through statistical modeling, but the model-building strategies are seldom described. In the project, data collected in a case-control study of risk factors for dehydrating diarrhea in infants have been used to present a hierarchized approach to the assessment of risk factors. The variables were grouped into a hierarchy of categories, ranging from distal determinants to proximate ones. These categories included, in this order, socioeconomic, environmental, reproductive maternal, nutritional and demographic sets. According to the univariate analyses all variables were associated with the outcome. As the purpose was to identify a parsimonious model to explain the data, in each set the confounders were selected through backward elimination, according to an alpha level of 0.10. The risk factors were evaluated through logistic regression after adjustment for confounders in the same set or in hierarchically superior sets. This approach allows researchers to quantify the contribution of each level of adjustment, to understand the model-building strategy as well as interpret the independent associations. The goodness-of-fit assessed at each set showed significant improvements in the model. The gamma coefficient of association was employed to quantify the proportion of cases and controls correctly identified by comparing the observed value with that predicted by the variables in the model. The final model resulted in a gamma of 0.74. The children's ages did not improve the prediction of cases and controls, but they have been kept in the model as they affect some exposures such as breastfeeding.",Revista de saude publica,1996 Apr,Brazil,1996,90

8698013,Induced abortion in Kenya: its determinants and associated factors.,"In a study involving 1077 women who were admitted and treated for incomplete abortion and its related problems at eight hospitals (seven district and one mission hospitals) in six of the eight provinces of Kenya, between October 1988 and March 1989, 169 (15.7%) had illegally induced unsafe abortion, based on their own history and clinical findings. The illegally induced unsafe abortions were common among both rural and urban dwellers, and women from almost all social and economic strata were involved. However, they were more common among the youth (< 25 year olds), school girls, those with high formal education, in formal employment, and not currently married. Majority (90.4%), of the induced group said their pregnancies were unwanted, as compared to only 29.1% of the non-induced (p < 0.05). The main determining factor for termination of pregnancy amongst these women appeared to be the fact that it was unwanted and/or unplanned, either because of inappropriate timing, the type of man responsible, the relationship itself and the social and economic implications thereof. This is contributed to by poor contraceptive use inspite of very good awareness, and/or desire to use. There is urgent need to integrate abortion care and related services into the overall reproductive health care and as a part of the broader safe motherhood initiative in Kenya. In addition it is necessary to revise the legal provisions on abortion so as to make them more relevant. Appropriate management of adolescent fertility, should be undertaken with the aim of reducing the extent of illegally induced unsafe abortion with attendant sequealae.",East African medical journal,1996 Mar,Kenya,1996,90
8372248,[A new strategy for the classification of mental disorders: an example of a multi-dimensional model for psychopathology].,"Present diagnostic classification systems stand in the way of a concurrence between events in our social lives and the biological substrates of common mental disorders. A two dimensional model is presented for common mental disorders, defined by symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although anxiety symptoms are often related to threat and depressive symptoms to loss, the two types of symptoms are not independent and often co-exist. The data from two independent studies with general practice patients in which a common standardized research interview was used were analyzed using latent trait modeling. The results obtained for the symptoms of anxiety and depression, as for the diagnoses (ICD-9 or DSM-III) confirm the robustness of this model. The strength of this conceptual model is based on its potential simultaneously to illustrate the relationship between biological and social determinants of these common symptoms. These two types of symptoms are related to the physiological reactions in response to punishment and reward. They also illustrate how certain events in our social environment are specifically associated with the constitution of anxiety and depression. Conversely, genetic vulnerability appears to be non-specific and may determine an increased overall likelihood to develop symptoms under stress, but the nature of those symptoms (anxiety or depression) depend on other factors. Moreover, other variables (i.e. personality, social relations) modify the effect of these relationships. Our knowledge of inter-relationships between common psychiatric symptoms and events from the social environment thus appears sound, and is likely to withstand future developments in biological psychiatry.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1993,France,1993,90
9415513,Determinants of pressure pain threshold in adult twins: evidence that shared environmental influences predominate.,"The objective of this study was to examine the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors in determining pain perception in a classical twin study. Dolorimeter measurements of pressure pain threshold (PPT) were recorded in 609 healthy female-female twin pairs of whom 269 pairs were monozygotic (MZ) and 340 were dizygotic (DZ). There was a strong correlation (R) in PPT in both MZ and DZ pairs (R(MZ) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): [0.49, 0.65]; R(DZ) = 0.51, 95% CI: [0.42, 0.59]). The slight excess in intraclass correlation observed in MZ when compared with DZ twins corresponds to a heritability for PPT of only 10% and is not statistically significant. Neither estimate of intraclass correlation was substantially altered after adjusting for a range of potential confounding variables including age, current tobacco and alcohol use, current analgesic use, psychological status assessed by the general health questionnaire, and social class. The dolorimeter measurements were shown to be reliable (between observer agreement R = 0.66; within observer agreement R = 0.70-0.76) and stable over time. In conclusion, these data suggest that there is no significant genetic contribution to the strong correlation in PPT that is observed in twin pairs.

In this paper, we discuss the impact of the recent economic crisis on the health sector in Indonesia, and analyze the potential for implementing effective reform following the managed care model. The health sector is discussed, highlighting pre-existing problems in the health care supply environment. The determinants of the economic crisis are summarized, and the broad impacts of the crisis to date on the health sector are assessed. Next the prospects for success of current managed-care reform proposals are examined in some detail: viability of expanded managed care reform measures are assessed in light of the continuing crisis and its likely impacts on the consumers and suppliers of health care. Analysis of the potential impact of the continuing crisis focuses on key participants in health care reform: households, the government, and private health care providers. In conclusion the potential viability of managed care appears poor, given the current economic, political, and institutional conditions and likely future impacts, and suggest some alternative reform measures.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",1999 Mar,Ireland,1999,90
10564848,"[Determinants of quitting smoking in Catalonia, Spain].","OBJECTIVE: While trends in the prevalence of smoking and ex-smoking in Catalonia, Spain have been monitored, the characteristics of those smokers who quit have not been investigated. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the prevalence of cessation, or quit ratio, in Catalonia and to study its sociodemographic, life-style, and smoking correlates. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data collected in the Catalan Health Interview Survey conducted in 1994. This is a cross-sectional study based on a representative sample of the non-institutionalized population of Catalonia. We included for analysis a total of 5,424 subjects (3,649 males and 1,775 females) who declared to be current smokers (2,335 males and 1,331 females) or past smokers (1,314 males and 444 females). We computed the crude and age-standardized quit ratios (QR) or prevalence of cessation, as well as the odds ratio (OR) of quitting smoking, according to gender and the variables studied. RESULTS: The age-standardized QR was 31. 8% for males and 30.9% for females and increased with age. The QR was, both in males and females, greater among married subjects, with higher socioeconomic status, and with healthy life-styles (moderate and heavy leisure physical activity and moderate alcohol consumption). The OR of quitting smoking was higher in heavy smokers (OR = 2.9; 95% CI: 2.2-3.8; smokers of > 30 cigarettes/day vs. 1-10 cigarettes/day) in males, while it was < 1 for females of medium intensity, conforming a shaped curve rather than a linear trend (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.0-2.9, in heavy smokers). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a positive association in males and females between quitting smoking and increasing age, a higher socioeconomic level, heavy smoking, and healthy life-styles. The identification of these groups should facilitate the planning of successful interventions. Further effort is also necessary to target groups with low cessation rates, such as individuals in disadvantaged social classes and light smokers.",Gaceta sanitaria,1999 Sep-Oct,Spain,1999,90

Cases were 261 women aged < 45 years with histologically confirmed invasive cervical cancer. Controls were 257 women aged < 45 years, with acute, non-neoplastic conditions, judged to be unrelated to any of the known or suspected risk factors for cervical cancer. In comparison with women reporting one or no sexual partner, the multivariate odds ratio (OR) of cervical cancer was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.3-4.6), for women reporting two or more sexual partners, and, in comparison with women reporting their first intercourse at 17 years of age or before, the multivariate OR was 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-0.9) in women aged > or =23 years at first intercourse. The risk of cervical cancer was higher in parous women and increased with number of births (OR = 8.1 for three or more births). Among parous women the risk tended to increase with later age at last birth; in comparison with parous women reporting their last birth before age 25, the OR was 1.9 in those reporting their last birth at > or =35 years.

Detailed information gathered in interviews with 548 youths in 1989-90 and 1991-92, provide a history of change in condom use and HIV-related high-risk behaviors. Condom use as a whole increased with time and age. Positive beliefs concerning condoms and awareness of HIV transmission were determinants of increases in use, and negative beliefs were determinants of decreases. Nevertheless, those youths who engaged in the highest HIV-risk behaviors (prostitution, IV drug use, and male homosexuality) were no more likely than lower-risk youths to increase their condom use. Financial need, indicated by receipt of welfare, appeared to be a significant barrier to increasing condom use. Also noteworthy was the negative association between using health clinics and condom use. Although youths with high-risk behaviors make more clinic visits, those visits do not result in condom use.",Adolescence,1994 Winter,United States,1994,90

Consistent with the Teibout theory, the general population is found to prefer high public school-related spending and low taxes. The elderly, in contrast, choose locations where school spending and taxes are low. Nonschool-related taxes positively impact the migration of both groups. Contrary to previous studies, there is evidence of a role, albeit a mostly negative one, for the economic determinants of elderly migration.

Bimanual feeding was defined as the active use of one hand for feeding with the opposite hand holding other food items. In terms of strength of hand preference, adults were more lateralized than sub-adults. Additionally, mother-reared chimpanzees were more lateralized than nursery-reared chimpanzees.

12345926,Personality characteristics of condom users.,"The California Psychological Inventory (CPI) and a survey of sexual behavior and condom use specifically developed for this descriptive study were administered to 132 sexually active, heterosexual male university students (mean age = 19.2 years; 75% Caucasian). Condom ""users"" (44% of this sample) were defined as those who reported using a condom in their last sexual encounter to ejaculation. ""Sexually active"" men were defined as those who reported some form of intercourse with a partner to ejaculation within the past 3 months. On the CPI, the condom users scored significantly higher than nonusers on the Achievement via Independence scale and marginally higher on the Socialization and the Social Presence scales. The mean CPI profile for the condom users yielded the Gamma personality type which denotes an externally-oriented, norm questioning personality. Gammas tended to be uninhibited, clever, witty, pleasure-seeking risk takers. Those men who did not use a condom in their last sexual encounter offered their reasons for not doing so. The most common reasons were not expecting intercourse to occur and they were not available. In terms of perceived risk for HIV-infection, only 12.3% of the men had taken the antibody test and 75% considered themselves to be at zero or low risk. Several suggestions were made for counseling strategies in promoting condom use in college-age populations.",Journal of sex education and therapy,1994 Summer,United States,1994,90

""Using the one per cent public use sample from the 1970 and 1980 United States census, we first compare changes in socio economic characteristics from 1970 to 1980, and then examine the determinants of fertility of female immigrants to the United States, aged 16-49, from four Latin American areas or countries of birth.... The findings...suggest that there are direct effects of demographic, assimilation, and socioeconomic variables beyond those mediated by the variables in each of these sets. Further, regardless of the model, the effect of the clusters of demographic characteristics is most apparent.

9919629,Dead mothers and injured wives: the social context of maternal morbidity and mortality among the Hausa of northern Nigeria.,"Northern Nigeria has a maternal mortality ratio greater than 1,000 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Serious maternal morbidity (for example, vesico-vaginal fistula) is also common. Among the most important factors contributing to this tragic situation are: an Islamic culture that undervalues women; a perceived social need for women's reproductive capacities to be under strict male control; the practice of purdah (wife seclusion), which restricts women's access to medical care; almost universal female illiteracy; marriage at an early age and pregnancy often occurring before maternal pelvic growth is complete; a high rate of obstructed labor; directly harmful traditional medical beliefs and practices; inadequate facilities to deal with obstetric emergencies; a deteriorating economy; and a political culture marked by rampant corruption and inefficiency. The convergence of all of these factors has resulted in one of the worst records of female reproductive health existing anywhere in the world.",Studies in family planning,1998 Dec,United States,1998,90
9090699,The Pharmacists' Implementation of Pharmaceutical Care (PIPC) model.,"PURPOSE: Study purpose was to develop a theoretical framework that will explain pharmacists' behavior relative to the provision of pharmaceutical care. The model was developed from four attitude models by testing their predictive validity relative to pharmaceutical care implementation. Four hypotheses and one research question were investigated to identify determinants of behavioral intention and behavior. METHODS: 617 community pharmacists in the state of Florida, U.S.A., were surveyed twice using mail survey methodology to collect data. The first survey assessed community pharmacists' attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, past behavior recency, self-efficacies, instrumental beliefs and affect. The second survey assessed pharmacists' behavior relative to the implementation of pharmaceutical care. After establishing reliability and validity of measures, regression analysis was used to test hypotheses and research question investigated. RESULTS: The Pharmacists' Implementation of Pharmaceutical Care (PIPC) model developed postulates that (i) behavior is directly determined by past behavior recency, behavioral intention and perceived behavioral control; (ii) psychological appraisal processes-instrumental beliefs, self-efficacies, and affect toward means-influence behavior through past behavior recency; and (iii) behavioral intention is determined by attitude, social norm and perceived behavioral control. CONCLUSIONS: The PIPC model provides a formal scientifically validated theoretical framework which can be used to design successful intervention for pharmaceutical care implementation.",Pharmaceutical research,1997 Feb,United States,1997,90
2260287,To strike or not to strike? House-staff attitudes and behaviors during a hospital work action.,"Work actions by house staff are an infrequent response to sometimes difficult working conditions, but they can have a notable effect on institutional cohesiveness and represent a challenge to traditional notions of medical ethics. To determine the extent of participation in a hospital-wide doctors' strike and factors associated with participation, we surveyed 432 house officers at a university-affiliated public hospital where a contract dispute had recently led to a 4-day work action. Of 257 respondents, 69% approved of the strike and 50% participated in it. Both strikers and nonstrikers agreed that quality of care and specific contract issues were important precipitants of the event. By logistic regression, factors independently associated with strike participation (P less than .05) included being unmarried, training in internal medicine or psychiatry, being in earlier stages of training, being assigned to an outpatient service at the time of the strike, holding a favorable view of physician activism, and perceiving nurses, faculty, peers, and the public to have favored the strike. These associations may provide a basis for understanding the individual and social determinants of house-staff strike activity.",The Western journal of medicine,1990 Nov,United States,1990,90
7935243,Government and mental health policy: a structural analysis.,"It is generally recognized that mental health policy is shaped by the interaction of complex social, economic, intellectual, and medical variables. An often neglected, yet significant, factor, however, is the very structure of the American political system that was created by the adoption of the federal Constitution in 1789. The constitutional framework made intergovernmental relations--local, state, federal--important determinants in shaping and transforming social policy in general and mental health policy in particular. The division of power among three levels of government created incentives to shift responsibilities, which in turn changed and distorted coverage patterns, thereby inadvertently transforming both costs and policy goals. It is thus critical to take into account the ways in which America's political structure mediates and recasts the context of mental health policy.",The Milbank quarterly,1994,United States,1994,90

10346032,Ecological and geographic characteristics predict nutritional status of communities: rapid assessment for poor villages.,"The quality of poverty alleviation programmes relies heavily on appropriate targeting and priority setting. Major problems in assessing poverty include identification of the indicators of poverty and the methods used for its assessment. Nutritional status, expressed by anthropometric indices, has been proposed as a poverty indicator because of its validity, objectivity, reliability and feasibility. This study was conducted to explore the application of remote sensing to poverty mapping based on nutritional status at the community level. Relationships between the nutritional status within a community and the ecological characteristics of the community were investigated. Multiple linear regression tests were executed, and the resultant equations were tested for their validity in predicting communities with poor nutritional status. Among geographical and ecological indicators used, distance to the nearest market, main soil type, rice field area, and perennial cultivation area were found to be most useful predictors for the ranking of the communities by nutritional status. Among non-ecological determinants, food consumption, health service status and living conditions were also found as predictors. The highest correlation was found if total population was also taken into account in the regression model (R2 = 0.69; p < 0.0001). In the assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of the eight models studied, 'undernutrition' was defined as a condition where a community belongs in the first quartile for nutritional status (highest prevalence of undernutrition), and the baseline nutritional survey was considered as a standard method for final diagnosis. Most models which included only ecological factors in the equations had lower sensitivity and specificity than models which included all determinant factors in the equations. All models which took into account the total population had higher sensitivity and specificity than those that did not take total population into account. The best model of those that took into account only the geographical and ecological characteristics of the community's living environment had similar sensitivity and specificity (80% and 94.1%, respectively) as the models that considered non-geographical and non-ecological variables in addition to geographical and ecological variables. In the case of West Sumatra, only four ecological and geographic characteristics were sufficient to predict poverty in village. Since these characteristics could be surveyed by remote sensing, it may well be possible to use remote sensing for a rapid method for poverty mapping.",Health policy and planning,1998 Dec,England,1998,90
10472279,Trends in teenage pregnancy in England and Wales: how can we explain them?,"Teenage pregnancy is associated with adverse social and physical outcomes for both mother and child. We drew on various sources--birth and abortion statistics from the Office for National Statistics, data from the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, and routinely collected data from family planning clinics--to identify trends in England and Wales and their possible determinants. The rate of teenage sexual activity has increased steadily and consistently over the past four decades, whilst the rate of teenage fertility has shown greater variation. When the teenage fertility rate is calculated against the denominator of sexually active women, rather than the total sample of teenage women, the underlying trend in teenage fertility over the past four decades has been downwards, though not consistently so. Fluctuations in the teenage fertility rate seem to track intervention-related factors such as access to, and use of, contraceptive services and the general climate surrounding the sexual health of young people.",Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,1999 Jun,England,1999,90

Simply eating with one other person increases the average amount ingested in meals by 44% and with more people present the average meal size grows even larger. The impact of social facilitation of energy intake on the individual appears to result from genetic effects both on the individuals' sensitivity to the presence of other people and also on the number of other people an individual tends to eat with. Culture markedly affects the choice of foods in the diet and the pattern of meals over the day.

METHODS: Unionized New York City health care workers (n = 1394) with comprehensive medical insurance were screened for hypertension. Union records documenting all physician visits and prescription medications for the year before screening provided the opportunity to relate patterns of treatment to blood pressure outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 409 employees found to have hypertension, 289 (71%) were aware of their condition and 201 (49%) had been treated, but only 51 (12%) had their blood pressure controlled at the recommended level (< 140/90 mm Hg). In a logistic regression model, the only variable of treatment associated with control was days of antihypertensive medication. The total number of physician visits was not associated with control. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that in conventional community settings, even in the absence of financial barriers, treatment for hypertension continues to be characterized by poor outcomes. Improving access to primary care, without changes in the nature of that care, may not substantially improve blood pressure control.",American journal of public health,1994 Nov,United States,1994,90

9212534,The social determinants of the decline of life expectancy in Russia and eastern Europe: a lifestyle explanation.,"This paper examines the social origins of the rise in adult mortality in Russia and selected Eastern European countries. Three explanations for this trend are considered: (1) Soviet health policy, (2) social stress, and (3) health lifestyles. The socialist states were generally characterized by a persistently poor mortality performance as part of a long-term process of deterioration, with particularly negative outcomes for the life expectancy of middle-aged, male manual workers. Soviet-style health policy was ineffective in dealing with the crisis, and stress per se does not seem to be the primary cause of the rise in mortality. Although more research is needed, the suggestion is made that poor health lifestyles--reflected especially in heavy alcohol consumption, and also in smoking, lack of exercise, and high-fat diets--are the major social determinant of the upturn in deaths.",Journal of health and social behavior,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90

9884113,The developmental psychobiology of behavioural plasticity in mice: the role of social experiences in the family unit.,"Small perturbations of young animals' sensory experience or hormonal milieu have been shown to alter ontogenetic pathways and to potentially produce huge effects on CNS functioning and behaviour later in life. From a social point of view, variables such as the expression of affiliative bonding and of playful interactions among littermates, the quantity/quality of maternal care, or episodes of maternal or sibling deprivation during critical phases in development, seem to interfere as epigenetic factors with the rigidly ordered temporal sequences of events that occur during the ontogenesis of CNS. This leads to the onset of adaptive neurodevelopmental changes, which are observable within a continuum that encompasses both ""normal"" individual variability and potential behavioural disorganisation, which in turn will probably be related to profound alteration in the establishment of adult social competence. The present review summarises the more recent work in mice dealing with short-term, as well as long-term modifications, in naturally occurring species-typical social and non-social responses as a function of the early manipulation of social characteristics of the family unit (such as litter gender composition and time of weaning). These analyses were carried out on infant animals, i.e. during the ontogenetic stage of the establishment of social bonding, as well as on pre-pubertal and adult mice and on lactating adult females. Critical issues, such as the respective roles of sibling-sibling and dam-offspring interactions in the shaping of ""sibling effects"", are also addressed. Overall, these studies indicate that, within their natural range of variation, early patterns of social stimulation are powerful determinants of subsequent behaviour of developing altricial rodents, and confirm that early social life events warrant attention because they can strongly affect neurobehavioural development. Evidence of a relationship between social events occurring during early rearing (i.e. when dramatic transitions in neuroendocrine and neurochemical CNS systems occur) and individual behavioural variability in the infant and adult response to the effects of psychostimulants abused by humans is presented. A better understanding of the mechanisms that mediate such remarkable plasticity might have great psychobiological as well as clinical importance, especially when considering the issue of vulnerability to drug abuse.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,1998,United States,1998,90

Drawing on an attributional model of expressed emotion it was predicted that high EE relatives would have less knowledge of the illness and would attribute negative symptoms to the personality, rather than the illness, of the sufferer. Thirty-one caregivers of schizophrenic patients were interviewed. Results indicated that EE status was related to knowledge, coping and causal attributions of negative symptoms. Low EEs, as compared with High EEs, tended to have more knowledge of the illness and to cope better with the patient, and were less likely to attribute the cause of negative symptoms to the sufferer's personality. Support was therefore obtained for the utility of an attributional model in attempting to understand the determinants of levels of EE.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,1992 Sep,England,1992,90

The analysis focuses on the role of income and financial assistance from relatives and public programs. Using data from the NLS Youth Panel, I construct a casual model of birthweight containing exogenous social and demographic risk factors and intervening proximate determinants of birthweight. A substantial part of the gap in birthweight between white Anglos and other ethnic groups (especially blacks) can be explained by the unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the latter. On the other hand, blacks and other minorities smoke less and have other favorable proximate characteristics that depress differences in birthweight. When these proximate determinants are controlled, large ethic differences in birthweight remain unexplained by income and other sociodemographic factors.",Demography,1995 May,United States,1995,90

The sample consisted of 1,447 women older than 34 years, living in Hawaii, who participated in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The percentage of women in the sample reporting a screening mammogram within the past two years was 31.4% in 1987, 54.1% in 1989, and 51.6% in 1990. Women of Hawaiian ancestry had the lowest percentage of mammogram use in the past two years (38.7%), while Japanese women had the highest percentage (49.8%). Results of logistic regression analysis indicate a significant increase in mammography use from 1987 to 1989 and no difference from 1989 to 1990. Findings also showed an association between age, income, and ethnicity with use in the past two years. Greater age, higher income, and Japanese origin, compared to Hawaiian, were all independently associated with increased odds of having had a mammogram in the past two years.

Using logistic regression analysis in case and control groups, we assessed, the association of individual characteristics with MM (n = 240) and SCC (n = 184). We also compared differences in risk factors (eye/hair colour, skin type, smoking history, occupation, social class, tumour site) between MM/BCC and SCC/BCC. MM patients were more likely to have red/blonde hair and blue/green eyes than controls, and those with SCC more likely to have red/blonde hair, blue/green eyes, outdoor occupation, skin type 1 and to have smoked more. There were few differences in individual characteristics between the skin cancer groups, illustrating their non-specific nature. Tumour site, however, showed marked differences: MM patients were more likely to have a tumour on the trunk or limbs than BCC patients, while patients with SCC were more likely to have a tumour on the limbs. Reasons for this variation are unclear. The relatively weak effect of individual factors supports the view of a multifactorial disease and suggests that interactions between UV exposure and genetic predisposition may be more significant determinants of risk.",International journal of clinical practice,1998 Apr-May,England,1998,90

Living status was only of significance to men who, if single, consumed 2.66 portions of fruits and vegetables per day compared with an overall mean of 4.1. The salient question is therefore not ""Are you living alone?"" but "" s there a woman in the household?"". Those respondents who were older and less educated ate less vegetables and those respondents who had a lower income or social grade ate less fruit. Men were less likely to be able to cook a range of meals, to have had a job that involved cooking or to watch cookery programmes on television. Single men were more likely than single women to say that eating food that was easy to cook and prepare was an important influence on their food choice. Single women on the other hand were more influenced by body image. Finding foods that were the right portion size and easy to open, prepare and cook was more important to single men than married men, as was the amount of money left after paying the bills.",Appetite,1998 Feb,England,1998,90
1634431,On the relationship between self-injurious behavior and self-restraint.,"Many individuals who exhibit self-injurious behavior (SIB) also exhibit self-restraint. Three hypotheses about the determinants of self-restraint have been suggested: (a) Self-restraint is maintained by escape from or avoidance of aversive aspects of SIB, (b) self-restraint and SIB are members of the same functional class, and (c) self-restraint and SIB are functionally independent. This study examined a method by which the relationship between self-restraint and SIB may be investigated using functional analysis. Data were collected on the self-restraint and SIB exhibited by 5 mentally retarded males, while conditions suspected to maintain SIB were manipulated. Results suggested that self-restraint, like SIB, may be maintained by idiosyncratic contingencies.

9110831,Cues to action in the process of changing lifestyle.,"This research has been carried out in order to evaluate cues to action in health behavior. Which cues produce changes and how does the process of change proceed? In-depth qualitative interviews based on the Grounded Theory Method were made with 21 40-year-old men. Ten men were interviewed three times during a 1-year period to trace the process of change. In total 40 interviews were carried out during 1989-1990. All the interviewees were randomly selected from the population registers in the municipalities of Aarhus and Vejle. The main themes of the interviews are changes in previous health behavior, motivation for intentions to change in health behavior, and the role of health education in the process of change. Health behavior determinants seem to be knowledge, attitude, confidence, social influence, experiences and possibilities for change. Individuals typically exhibit a wide range of these determinants which makes it difficult to affect behavioral change through health education. Cues to action seem to arise from social influence, experiences, or underlying shifts in the possibilities of change. Experiences and social influence due to the health behavior in question seem to initiate changes in confidence, attitude and thereby motivation to change. Cues to action arising from these determinants are categorized as own illness or illness among friends and relatives, changes in self-perception, exceeded limits determined by the behavior in question, and social pressure. Shifts in the possibilities for change, such as change of partner or other life events, produce changes also affecting health behavior. A strategy to initiate changes in health behavior could be to create cues to action through personal experiences in the context of a specific health behavior or to establish contact to people when they are experiencing new life circumstances.",Patient education and counseling,1997 Jan,Ireland,1997,90
7950741,Attempt at deriving a formula for setting general practitioner fundholding budgets.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility of using routine Hospital Episode Statistics, census data, and vital statistics to derive weights for an equitable capitation formula for setting general practitioner fundholding budgets for buying acute hospital services. DESIGN: Analysis of a routine dataset of 9 million hospital episodes in 1991-2, extracting elective general practitioner fundholding procedures, combined with 1991 census variables, vital statistics, and data on supply of health care at ward level. Costs were attached to each procedure according to the average cost of the relevant ""Mersey"" band category. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Variation in age and sex adjusted expenditure per head on fundholding procedures across wards modelled for the impact of health and social needs variables after adjusting for variations in supply. RESULTS: No sensible simple model including determinants of use other than age and sex could be derived. The most parsimonious but statistically acceptable model showed that though standardised mortality ratio and self reported illness and several social class variables were associated with utilisation, the signs and the size of the coefficients were contradictory. The most important explanation of variation was provided by age and sex differences between wards. CONCLUSIONS: An equitable system of setting general practitioner fundholders' budgets is needed. In the short term age and sex weighted capitation should form the principal basis of fundholder budgets. Utilisation data at ward level are inadequate for developing a formula which adequately adjusts for the differences in the health care needs of populations. A capitation formula based on information derived from individual cohort data may be the only means of promoting equity and efficiency and of avoiding discriminating against patients with known high cost health problems.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1994 Oct 22,England,1994,90
9581450,Early life and later determinants of adult disease: a 50 year follow-up study of the Newcastle Thousand Families cohort.,"The relative contribution of socioeconomic, behavioural and biological factors operating in fetal and infant life, childhood and adulthood to risk for cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases and non-insulin-dependent diabetes in middle age has become an important research issue. All 1142 babies born in Newcastle upon Tyne in May and June 1947 were recruited into a prospective cohort study of child health (the 'Thousand Families' study) and followed in great detail to the age of 15 y, with a brief further follow up at age 22 y. Children from poorer families were at greatest risk of severe respiratory tract infection in infancy. Children from professional and managerial families were on average taller and heavier throughout childhood than those from semi- and unskilled manual social classes. Repeated infections in early childhood greatly increased the risk of developing chronic respiratory disease by age 15 y. This paper outlines a new investigation designed to trace surviving members of this cohort and to chart the relationships between their socioeconomic circumstances, lifestyles, experiences and health from birth through to the present day. Existing data on socioeconomic circumstances and infections in infancy and childhood, infant nutrition, birthweight and physical development to age 22 y will be linked to information gained from a new study. This comprises a postal questionnaire survey of study members' adult health, socioeconomic circumstances and lifestyle, and a hospital based clinical examination including heart and lung function, glucose tolerance, blood lipids and anthropometric measurements at age 49-51 y. Out of a target sample of 979 people for whom sufficient data are available on the first year of life, 866 (88%) have been traced and 649 are still resident in the North of England. Those study members who have been traced are highly representative of the original cohort. The Thousand Families cohort provides a unique opportunity for detailed epidemiological study because of the wealth of data available on infant and childhood socioeconomic and family circumstances, all of which was collected prospectively. In addition, there has been comparatively little loss to follow-up since 1948.",Public health,1998 Mar,Netherlands,1998,90

This study seeks to identify groups of individuals who share various features in terms of drinking styles and other health indicators. Data used are a subset of the 1990 Ontario Health Survey, corresponding to men and women aged 20-64 with complete data in four substantive areas: alcohol use; demographic characteristics; current health status; and various behavioural risk factors for chronic disease. Cluster analysis was used to groups of male and female respondents who were similar in terms of their style of alcohol use, along with other constructs relevant to health risk and health status. For both sexes, clusters were identified which matched expectation in terms of drinking patterns and other relevant variables. For both sexes, clusters were found with generally higher social class indicators, generally positive health behaviours and health status and drinking patterns which did not include drinking to excess. Clusters were also found for which high-volume drinking occasions corresponded with poor health status and high levels of risk factors for chronic disease. Other unanticipated patterns were also identified. This information may assist in identifying confounding effects in epidemiological studies as well as identifying the characteristics of unique sub-populations which are likely to be the focus of primary prevention efforts.",Drug and alcohol review,1998 Dec,Australia,1998,90
9731156,Towards a framework for women's health.,"The health of women involves their emotional, social, cultural, spiritual and physical well-being and is influenced by social, political and economic factors, as well as by a woman's biology. This definition of women's health provides the conceptual framework for a relevant and effective approach to patient education, health promotion and disease prevention activities in women. Such activities must focus not only on diseases that are more common, more prevalent or more serious in women, but also on priority health issues identified by women themselves, the diversity of women, the determinants of health and above all, the impact of gender on health. These programs must also be based on knowledge resulting from gender sensitive, bias-free health research. The traditional oppression and disempowerment of women must also be addressed at both personal and societal levels, thus broadening our approach so that we become social as well as health activists.",Patient education and counseling,1998 Mar,Ireland,1998,90
7750377,Competence and memory: integrating psychosocial and cognitive correlates of child depression.,"Positive and negative peer nominations of multiple competencies and incidental recall of positive and negative self-referential adjectives were measured in relatively depressed and nondepressed fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-grade children (9 to 15 years old). Positive and negative peer evaluations related significantly to children's ability to recall positive and negative self-referential information (respectively), even after controlling for concurrent depressive symptoms. Positive and negative peer evaluations also related strongly to children's self-reported depressive symptoms. Incidental recall of positive and negative information significantly related to self-reported depression. In fact, the relation between recall of negative information and depression significantly increased in the eighth grade. Finally, preliminary support emerged that cognitive processes related to the incidental recall of negative self-descriptive information may mediate the relation between peer evaluations and depression. Implications for further research into the social determinants of cognitive processes and into the social and cognitive determinants of depression are discussed.",Child development,1995 Apr,United States,1995,90
1879391,Changes in condom use among homosexual men in San Francisco.,"Employed data from two longitudinal surveys of gay men in San Francisco (a) to examine for cohort (Study 1) and attrition (Studies 1 and 2) bias effects on reported changes in condom use by gay men and (b) to investigate predictors of condom use (Study 2). Substantial increases in condom use were observed, and these changes were unrelated to attrition and cohort bias. In terms of predictors of condom use, men who always used condoms had higher levels of social support from informal sources of help, had more positive expectations that condoms would have positive interpersonal and personal consequences, and were more likely to be HIV positive than men who used condoms occasionally or never. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for HIV-prevention research.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1991,United States,1991,90
9150097,Practical issues in psychosocial measures.,"Psychosocial variables were recognized as key clinical determinants and outcomes in rheumatic disease. Clinical interventions can produce clinically important improvement in psychological status, and clinicians regularly employ anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs. Yet assessment of psychological status is rarely undertaken in routine clinical practice. In part, this failure stems from the fact that most formal psychological instruments are too complicated, take too much time to administer, cannot be administered in real time, and are difficult to interpret. A practical way to assess psychological status in the clinic is to use short depression instruments such as the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) or the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) anxiety and depression subscales. Another approach to psychological assessment is to measure surrogate variables, that is, variables that are not primarily psychological and have practical use in rheumatic disease care. The Clinical Health Assessment Questionnaire (CLINHAQ) assesses such surrogate variables via visual analog scales for pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, the helplessness subscale of the Rheumatology Attitudes index, a self-report measure of satisfaction with health, and the AIMS anxiety and depression scales. This instrument, which also contains the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index, a pain diagram, and assessment of global severity, can be completed in 5 minutes by almost all clinic patients.",The Journal of rheumatology,1997 May,Canada,1997,90
2236224,Motivational considerations in physical activity involvement.,"The purpose of this article is to examine movement science research on personal and social-environmental motivational influences in physical activity contexts. Motivation is defined as a process in which internal and external factors direct and energize thoughts, feelings, and actions. Motivation is described as a consequence of meaning, which is derived from a combination of personal and social factors, including personal goals or incentives, expectations of personal efficacy, movement-related perceptual and affective experiences, and social and physical features of the environment. Recent literature from sport and exercise psychology is presented on these variables, their determinants, and their consequences for choice, effort, persistence, and performance behavior in exercise and sport contexts.",Physical therapy,1990 Dec,United States,1990,90
8372248,[A new strategy for the classification of mental disorders: an example of a multi-dimensional model for psychopathology].,"Present diagnostic classification systems stand in the way of a concurrence between events in our social lives and the biological substrates of common mental disorders. A two dimensional model is presented for common mental disorders, defined by symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although anxiety symptoms are often related to threat and depressive symptoms to loss, the two types of symptoms are not independent and often co-exist. The data from two independent studies with general practice patients in which a common standardized research interview was used were analyzed using latent trait modeling. The results obtained for the symptoms of anxiety and depression, as for the diagnoses (ICD-9 or DSM-III) confirm the robustness of this model. The strength of this conceptual model is based on its potential simultaneously to illustrate the relationship between biological and social determinants of these common symptoms. These two types of symptoms are related to the physiological reactions in response to punishment and reward. They also illustrate how certain events in our social environment are specifically associated with the constitution of anxiety and depression. Conversely, genetic vulnerability appears to be non-specific and may determine an increased overall likelihood to develop symptoms under stress, but the nature of those symptoms (anxiety or depression) depend on other factors. Moreover, other variables (i.e. personality, social relations) modify the effect of these relationships. Our knowledge of inter-relationships between common psychiatric symptoms and events from the social environment thus appears sound, and is likely to withstand future developments in biological psychiatry.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1993,France,1993,90
8241491,Supply and demand factors in occupational health; determinants of self-reported compliance with the work place related requirements of the German Work Safety Law.,"The study evaluates the extend to which West German company doctors reported that they carried out the workplace related activities as required by the German Work Security Law 'ASiG'. Postal questionnaires were completed by 502 of West German company doctors. About one third of those who responded, reported that they carried out the requirements of the German Work Safety Law with regard to workplace-related prevention. Multivariate analysis was applied to discover the factors that influenced compliance. We conclude that investment in supply-side factors (doctors' qualifications, experiences and recourses) are not enough to bring about compliance. More important are the demand-side regulations which directly address the health and safety culture of the companies.","Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)",1993,England,1993,90
9511134,What makes women tired? A community sample.,"We aimed to determine the major health concerns or problems of women and their personal attributions for the causes of their primary health concerns. We used a survey of women from the Toronto area attending a women's health symposium. Completed questionnaires were returned by 153 (85%) of 180 women attendees. Persistent fatigue was the primary and most commonly cited health concern. Fatigue was ranked first by 42 (27.5%) women and among the top 10 concerns by 123 (80.4%) women. Women attributed their fatigue to a combination of home and outside work (63.4%), poor sleep (38.2%), lack of time for self (34.1%), lack of exercise (32.5%), financial worries (28.5%), relationship problems (22.0%), emotional causes (17.9%), care of ill family members (13.8%), lack of social or individual support (9.8%), poor physical health (8.9%), work in home or child care (3.3%), or gender bias/harassment (2.4%). Our subjects, women from the community, overwhelmingly endorsed social determinants as the cause of their persistent fatigue. Although depression and anxiety form the most robust associations with persistent fatigue in primary care and community studies, women in this sample ranked these factors in seventh place in their attributions. Similarly, although physicians often assume physical causes for fatigue, women rank physical health low in their own attributions. Given the high prevalence of fatigue in women and its impact on quality of life, more attention needs to be given to the social, systemic, and personal factors that women feel contribute to their fatigue to develop more effective interventions.",Journal of women's health,1998 Feb,United States,1998,90

The effects of individual indicators of the status of women on fertility are decomposed into effects through each of the proximate variables, notably those affecting marriage duration, marital fertility, and contraception. There is considerable variation in the direction and magnitude of the relationships between the status indicators and fertility behavior and in the relationship to the underlying mechanisms at the two points in time. On balance, the evidence suggests improvements in the status of women come to exert an increasingly negative effect on fertility over the course of demographic transition.",Studies in family planning,1991 Jul-Aug,United States,1991,90

Measures were taken of respondents' attitudes to four imaginary scenarios depicting their commission of the four violations concerned. Demographic subgroups of drivers within the sample were differentiated on the basis of their beliefs about and evaluations of their commission of the violations. We were able to identify attitude items differentiating the younger, statistically more ""accident liable"" drivers in the sample from their older, and statistically safer counterparts. The implications of using this approach to inform future road safety campaigns are discussed.",Accident; analysis and prevention,1992 Apr,England,1992,90
1920063,Group members' reactions to opinion deviates and conformists at varying degrees of proximity to decision deadline and of environmental noise.,"Four experiments examined freely interacting groups to investigate the determinants of group members' reactions to opinion deviates and conformists. In the 1st experiment, the deviate was rejected more when he or she articulated the dissenting opinion in close proximity to the group-decision deadline versus at an earlier point in the group discussion. In the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th experiment, the deviate was rejected more when the group discussion was carried out in a noisy versus a quiet environment. Furthermore, when the conformist's contributions to the group's attempts to reach consensus were made salient (in Experiment 4), he or she was evaluated more positively in a noisy versus a quiet environment. The results were discussed in terms of the notion that group members' tendency to denigrate a deviate or extol a conformist may be stronger when their need for collective cognitive closure is heightened.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1991 Aug,United States,1991,90
9458585,The dental health status of five-year-old children in north and west Belfast.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of social deprivation upon the diet, dental health behaviours and dental health status of five-year-old children in Northern Ireland. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Fifty-eight primary schools in North and West Belfast. SUBJECTS: A nine per cent (240) random sample of 2,666 five-year-old children resident and attending school in North and West Belfast. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dental health status measured by dmft index; parental assessments of the child's dental health behaviours: parental dental attendance patterns and attitudes towards dental health; parental assessments of the child's diet and snacking behaviours: parental attitudes towards snack foods; and demographic profile of child's family. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three children were examined, a 68 per cent response. The majority of the families were either in low income employment or unemployed. Sixty-eight per cent of children had experience of dental caries. Dental decay was unrelated to parental employment status but more children from unemployed families attended when in pain. The diet of the children was related to both employment status and parental attitude and was reflected in their caries experience. Caries experience was dependent upon parental dental attendance, the consumption of carbonated drinks and sugar containing bedtime drinks. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that unemployment and parental attitudes are important as determinants of dental caries in five-year-old children from North and West Belfast. These factors may influence the child's dental health care as well as type of diet.",Community dental health,1997 Dec,England,1997,90
12320418,Selective effects of marriage migrations on the population redistribution in a hierarchical regional system of Japan.,"""Based on the data on 11,470 household heads and spouses in a national survey [in Japan], this paper studies the selective effects of marriage migrations on five types of prefectures: (1) metropolitan core, (2) suburban, (3) regional growth pole, (4) peripheral non-kaso, and (5) peripheral kaso prefectures. The selective effects are examined in terms of five personal factors: sex, nativity, education, period of marriage, and sibling status.... Primary and onward migrations were much more important than return migrations so that marriage migrations increased the non-native's share of the population of every type of [prefecture]. Marriage migrations resulted in further deterioration of the quality of human capital in peripheral prefectures. The transition from high to moderate economic growth in the early 1970s was accompanied by sharp reversals in the net transfers of marriage migrants in metropolitan cores and regional growth poles in opposite directions.""

9080569,"The integration of two health systems: social stratification, work and health in East and West Germany.","This is an analysis of system integration, social stratification and work for health status and health care in East and West Germany. It is based on aggregate data and representative survey data of random samples of 2554 adults in both subsystems. Findings show that there were marked differences in life-expectancy prior to unification. The integration of the two systems, which occurred almost totally with regard to terms of West German health care organization, shows adjustment problems in the East for the public Health-Care-Funds and few if any for ambulatory care. The work situation has an impact on health, but there are no significant differences for East versus West. Social stratification variables show an influence on subjective health status for education (East) and for income, social status (West), while physician utilization (despite a preference of specialists by those with higher status) is not significantly determined by stratification variables in either East or West Germany. Beyond the central focus on work and stratification determinants a major finding pertains to a comparatively worse health situation for the aged and for women in what was the former East Germany. System models of Capitalism versus Socialism fit the results and recent history of the two systems to only a limited degree, as the West German corporate health system shows clear limits in following free market principles. The East German system, regardless of its centralized organization and move towards a socialist system, never fully abandoned the traditional model of German health care. Unlike the East German health system, that of West Germany, with its general expansion to 92% of the population, shows an increasing effect for social redistribution. The latter may be a reason why standard indicators of social stratification show less of an impact on health and health care than expected, while conditions at work clearly determine the health of people-the latter being the case in both the former East and West Germany.",Social science & medicine (1982),1997 Mar,England,1997,90
9244971,[Asylum seekers and refugees in ambulatory health care: communication between physician and patient].,"Communication between asylum seekers/refugees and general practitioners/physicians of the three main outpatient sectors for the Swiss national Health System (general practice, medical outpatient and accident & emergency departments) are being described and analysed. The data have been collected during three cross-sectional studies investigating the health status of asylum seekers and refugees and the health services provided to them. These studies addressed the problem exclusively from the point of view of the health care providers. Data on language capabilities, sociocultural aspects of communication and the necessity and availability of interpreters have been collected with questionnaires. The main results of the questionnaires have been followed up in group discussions with general practitioners. The majority of general practitioners/physicians felt that most of the communication problems were related to speaking a common language. Only about one out of two adult asylum seekers/refugees knew German, French, Italian or English. Particularly during the group discussions it was brought forward that cultural and social factors additionally complicate communication during patient-doctor interactions. When the data of the outpatient consultations of the main studies were analysed, it became obvious that interpreters were significantly more often present in consultations with patients with psychological/psychosocial diagnoses than those with somatic diagnoses (72% vs. 55%). This can be interpreted in two ways: (1) if a patient suffers from a psychological/psychosocial problem, it is more likely that an interpreter will be asked to assist during the consultation or (2) if an interpreter is present during a consultation, it is more likely that a psychological/psychosocial problem will be detected. With the exception of children, most of the general practitioners/physicians felt that non-professional interpreters (relatives, friends) were adequate for coping with most of the tasks. The following areas for improvements were identified: (1) availability of professional interpreters and quality as well as organisational issues related to interpretation, (2) language training for asylum seekers and refugees and (3) creation of awareness among general practitioners/physicians towards cultural and socioeconomic determinants of patient-doctor interactions and training.",Praxis,1997 May 7,Switzerland,1997,90
2014415,Determinants of mental illness in a rural Ethiopian adult population.,"A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 2000 adult Ethiopians living in rural communities to determine firstly the prevalence of mental illness and secondly its association with stress and demographic variables. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire developed by WHO experts was used as the measure of mental illness. A modified version of the Holmes-Rahe Social Readjustment Scale was the measure of stress. Respondents were interviewed in their homes. Those experiencing 11 or more of the 20 neurotic symptoms and 3 or more of the 4 psychotic symptoms were considered mentally ill. Despite the use of high cut-off points for identifying potential cases, the prevalence of mental illness was 17.2%--neurotic 11.2% and psychotic 6.0%. This is higher than earlier reports for Ethiopia, but comparable to rates found in other African countries. Mental illness scores were most strongly associated with stress in that the odds of experiencing 6 or more stressful life events in the past year were 2.7 times greater for neurotics and 2.1 times greater for psychotics. In addition, neuroses and psychoses were significantly associated with a family history of mental illness and with being divorced, separated or widowed. Neurosis alone was also associated with chronic illness, females, those between the ages of 35 and 44, and illiteracy. These findings were discussed in terms of their relevance for identifying high stress groups and thus for preventing mental illness through community activities.",Social science & medicine (1982),1991,England,1991,90
7950741,Attempt at deriving a formula for setting general practitioner fundholding budgets.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility of using routine Hospital Episode Statistics, census data, and vital statistics to derive weights for an equitable capitation formula for setting general practitioner fundholding budgets for buying acute hospital services. DESIGN: Analysis of a routine dataset of 9 million hospital episodes in 1991-2, extracting elective general practitioner fundholding procedures, combined with 1991 census variables, vital statistics, and data on supply of health care at ward level. Costs were attached to each procedure according to the average cost of the relevant ""Mersey"" band category. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Variation in age and sex adjusted expenditure per head on fundholding procedures across wards modelled for the impact of health and social needs variables after adjusting for variations in supply. RESULTS: No sensible simple model including determinants of use other than age and sex could be derived. The most parsimonious but statistically acceptable model showed that though standardised mortality ratio and self reported illness and several social class variables were associated with utilisation, the signs and the size of the coefficients were contradictory. The most important explanation of variation was provided by age and sex differences between wards. CONCLUSIONS: An equitable system of setting general practitioner fundholders' budgets is needed. In the short term age and sex weighted capitation should form the principal basis of fundholder budgets. Utilisation data at ward level are inadequate for developing a formula which adequately adjusts for the differences in the health care needs of populations. A capitation formula based on information derived from individual cohort data may be the only means of promoting equity and efficiency and of avoiding discriminating against patients with known high cost health problems.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1994 Oct 22,England,1994,90
8211537,Patterns of condom use and sexual behavior among never-married women.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Use of condoms is one of the main methods sexually active persons may choose to prevent infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Little is known about patterns of condom use among women in the United States. We provide a conceptualization of patterns of condom use and factors associated with these patterns. GOAL OF THIS STUDY: To examine patterns of condom use and associated characteristics among sexually active, never-married women in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of data from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth, which is a nationally representative sample of women in their childbearing years. RESULTS: Only a minority of sexually active, never-married women report using condoms, and even fewer report using them consistently. Women with characteristics traditionally associated with increased risk of infection with STD and HIV appear to be less likely to report using condoms and to report using them consistently. Women who report use of condoms to prevent STDs are more likely to report consistent condom use; less likely to cease using condoms; and more likely to initiate consistent condom use. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the need for innovative programming targeted for specific sexually active populations to promote both initiation and maintenance of use of condoms.",Sexually transmitted diseases,1993 Jul-Aug,United States,1993,90

The focus is on the complete reproductive histories of single mothers and the life expectancies among infants born to women who at least once in their reproductive life history experienced the birth of an illegitimate child. In Sundsvall, industrialization only temporarily affected the illegitimacy ratio, but its effect was obvious even in agrarian parishes. The number of illegitimate children per woman remained relatively stable over time, with the exception of the town of Sundsvall. It was more common in the urban environment to give birth to several illegitimate children. Mortality was also higher among these infants, but the negative effects can be seen equally among both legitimate and illegitimate children.""",The history of the family : an international quarterly,1996,United States,1996,90

In the analysis, SSI application is conceptualized as an outcome of a complex interaction among financial, sociodemographic, health, and informational factors as well as those indicative of elderly persons' subjective perception of need. The findings indeed confirmed that objective financial need does not automatically lead to SSI application. Sociodemographic and health-related factors mediating the objective financial need are identified, although the subjective perception of need and informational barriers requires further evaluation. Policy implications include continued dissemination of information about SSI and relaxation of the resource test to qualify more low-income elderly.",Journal of aging & social policy,1998,England,1998,90

12346413,"Do you need to shop around? Age at marriage, spousal alternatives, and marital dissolution.","""This article attempts to shed light on the oft-observed relationship between age at marriage and marital dissolution by first deriving a hypothesis from marital search theory that relates both variables to the supply of spousal alternatives in the local marriage market. This hypothesis states that, relative to people who marry later in life, persons who marry at comparatively young ages will be especially susceptible to divorce when confronted with abundant alternatives to their current spouse. Marital history data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were then merged with aggregated data from the Public Use Microdata Samples of the 1980 U.S. census to test this hypothesis."" The author finds that ""discrete-time event history analyses offer no support for this hypothesis. Although the risk of marital dissolution is highest where either husbands or wives chance numerous spousal alternatives, the impact of age at marriage on divorce is significantly weaker in marriage markets containing abundant remarriage opportunities. Some of the effect of age at marriage on marital dissolution is attributable to the detrimental impact of early marriage on educational attainment.""",Journal of family issues,1995 Jul,United States,1995,90

7610436,Social inequalities and health among children aged 10-11 in The Netherlands: causes and consequences.,"Socioeconomic health differences (SEHD) are relatively small in childhood. In adolescence they almost seem to disappear and among young adults they re-emerge. This article deals with mechanisms that contribute to the emergence of health differences by studying a group of 10-11 year old children in The Netherlands (n = 908). The role of determinants of health in the relation between socioeconomic status and health (causation) is studied, as well as the influence of health on school performance (selection). Both causation and selection mechanisms prove to exist. Life style and life circumstances are unequally distributed among the socioeconomic groups and can (partly) explain the relation between socioeconomic status and health. The health of the children is related with school performance, which can be seen as health selection. This relation however was only found in the lowest socioeconomic groups. In the lowest socioeconomic groups less healthy children perform worse at school than healthy children. The unequal distribution of determinants of health and health selection in the educational career among children probably contribute to SEHD in adult life.",Social science & medicine (1982),1995 May,England,1995,90
