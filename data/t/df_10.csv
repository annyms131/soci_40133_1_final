27355137,"Determinants of virological response to antiretroviral therapy: socio-economic status still plays a role in the era of cART. Results from the ANRS-VESPA 2 study, France.","BACKGROUND: Disparities in combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) outcomes have been consistently reported among people living with HIV (PLWHIV). The present study aims at investigating the mechanisms underlying those disparities among PLWHIV in France. METHODS: We used data from the Vespa2 survey, a large national cross-sectional survey, representative of HIV-infected people followed at hospitals in 2011. Among participants diagnosed >/=1996, HIV treatment-naive at the time of cART initiation and on cART for at least 12 months, the frequency of sustained virological suppression (SVS; undetectable viral load [<50 copies/ml] for at least 6 months) at the time of the survey, was assessed and its social determinants were measured through logistic regression, accounting for clinical and biological determinants of response to cART. RESULTS: Among 1,246 participants, 77.7% had achieved SVS. SVS was less frequent among those unemployed (0.6 [range 0.3-1.0]) and those with the lowest level of education (0.4 [range 0.2-0.9]). The late presenters, diagnosed at a CD4(+) T-cell count <200/mm(3) (0.5 [range 0.3-0.9]) and the late starters, diagnosed at a CD4(+) T-cell count >200 but initiating cART at CD4(+) T-cell count <200 (0.3 [range 0.1-0.8]) were less likely than the ideal starters (>/=350 CD4(+) T-cells/mm(3) at cART initiation) to achieve SVS, as were those who reported suboptimal adherence versus those reporting optimal adherence (0.4 [range 0.2-0.7]). In bivariate analyses, material deprivation, discrimination and a weak social network were also associated with a poorer treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Structural social factors remain strong determinants of treatment response and should be addressed in a broad approach of care, but wider political issues should also be investigated.",Antiviral therapy,2016,England,2016,10
31380316,Prevalence of high blood pressure in Iranian adults based on the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline.,"Background: : In 2017, American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) presented a new guideline for assessing blood pressure in adults. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of hypertension in Iranian adults based on ACC/AHA 2017 guideline. Methods: Data from 9801 Iranian adults (59.2% women) aged between 20-69 years were obtained from the sixth round of National Surveillance of Risk Factors of Non-Communicable Diseases (SuRFNCD) performed in 2011. Blood pressure was classified as normal, elevated blood pressure, and stage 1 and 2 hypertension using a weighted analysis and 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. Data were presented as prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). All analyses were performed in Stata/SE 14.0. Results: Overall prevalence of hypertension in Iranian men was 52.0%. Also, 32.9% (95% CI: 29.9-36.0) and 19.1% (95% CI: 16.9-21.6) of men had stage 1 and 2 hypertension, respectively. In addition, 44.3% of women had hypertension, of whom 26.3% (95% CI: 24.5 - 28.2) had stage 1 and 18.0% (95% CI: 16.1-20.1) stage 2 hypertension. Furthermore, 16.5% (95% CI: 14.4-18.9) and 9.6% (95% CI: 7.86-11.7) of men and women had elevated blood pressure, respectively. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated that adopting the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines showed a higher prevalence of adult hypertension (48.2%) in Iran. In this study, the prevalence of hypertension in men was higher than in women, which was steadily increased by age in older adults in both sexes.",Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,2019,Iran,2019,10
28332408,Trauma and autobiographical memory: contents and determinants of earliest memories among war-affected Palestinian children.,"The contents of earliest memories (EM), as part of autobiographical memory, continue to fascinate scientists and therapists. However, research is scarce on the determinants of EM, especially among children. This study aims, first, to identify contents of EM of children living in war conditions, and, second, to analyse child gender, traumatic events and mental health as determinants of the contents of EM. The participants were 240 Palestinian schoolchildren from the Gaza Strip (10-12 years, M = 11.35, SD = 0.57; 49.4% girls). They responded to an open-ended EM question, and reported their trauma exposures (war trauma, losses and current traumatic events), posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms and psychosocial well-being, indicating mental health. The EM coding involved nature, social orientation, emotional tone and specificity. Results showed, first, that 43% reported playing or visiting a nice place as EM, and about a third (30%) traumatic events or accidents (30%) or miscellaneous events (27%). The individual and social orientation were almost equally common, the emotional tone mainly neutral (45.5%), and 60% remembered a specific event. Second, boys remembered more EM involving traumatic events or accidents, and girls more social events. Third, war trauma was associated with less positive emotional tone and with more specific memories.","Memory (Hove, England)",2017 Nov,England,2017,10
28298205,"Prevalence and determinants of erectile dysfunction among diabetic patients attending in hospitals of central and northwestern zone of Tigray, northern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of erectile dysfunction among diabetic men varies between 35-90%. Although erectile dysfunction is widespread among men with diabetes, the condition often remains undiagnosed and demands appropriate assessment and prompt treatment. Erectile dysfunction can affect all aspects of a patient's life including physical, emotional, social, sexual, and relationships. The main aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and determinants of erectile dysfunction among diabetic patients attending hospitals in the Central and Northwest zone of Tigray, Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted on 249 male diabetic patients attending five hospitals in the Central and Northwestern Zone of Tigray, Ethiopia using systematic random sampling. The data was collected from January 1 - February 30, 2016 and was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Correlation and multivariate logistic regression was employed to test associations between independent and outcome variables. RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 43.39 years and the mean duration of diabetes diagnosis was 6.22 years. The overall prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 69.9%, with 32.9% suffering from mild, 31.7% moderate, and 5.2% severe erectile dysfunction. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that erective dysfunction was significantly predicted by old age (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] =15.013, CI:3.212-70.166), longer duration of diabetes (AOR = 3.77, CI:1.291-11.051), and lower monthly income (AOR = 0.285, CI:0.132-0.615). No association was found with body mass index, co-morbidity, glycemic control, and alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of erective dysfunction in this study population was very high. Age, income, and duration of diabetes were the independent predictors of erectile dysfunction. Nearly all of the patients in the sample (97%) had not been screened or treated for erectile dysfunction. Assessment and management of erectile dysfunction in the diabetic clinic should be part of routine medical care during follow-up visits with diabetic patients. Healthcare providers should put an emphasis on screening and treating older patients and those who had a diabetes diagnosis for a longer duration.",BMC endocrine disorders,2017 Mar 15,England,2017,10
20143215,"Risk factors for mortality in neonatal tetanus: a 15-year experience in Sagamu, Nigeria.","BACKGROUND: Neonatal tetanus (NNT) is a major cause of newborn deaths especially in the developing world. While efforts aimed at eradicating NNT should be sustained, it is equally imperative to reduce death among affected infants. Therefore, the factors associated with mortality rate in this condition need to be studied. METHODS: The records of infants with NNT over a 15-year period (1991-2005) were reviewed. A statistical comparison of the survivors and fatalities for relevant clinical characteristics was done, and the determinants of fatality rate were also determined using logistic regression. RESULTS: Ninety-six of 151 newborns with NNT died, giving a mortality rate of 63.6%. The case fatality rate during the study period varied between 33.3% and 100%. More deaths occurred in the infants with low birth weight (P=0.004) within 1 day at the onset of symptoms (P<0.001), whose mothers aged 18 years or less (P=0.001) belonged to socio-economic class V (P=0.001). Determinants of mortality in these infants with NNT included low socio-economic class (P=0.002), no antitetanus vaccination (P=0.006), presentation with spasms (P<0.001), and non-administration of anti-tetanus serum during treatment (P=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate in infants with NNT remains signifi cantly high in Nigeria. Improved maternal anti-tetanus vaccination and timely recognition and treatment of affected infants may jointly reduce the incidence and fatality rate of NNT.",World journal of pediatrics : WJP,2010 Feb,Switzerland,2010,10
31067117,Impact of Political Economy on Population Health: A Systematic Review of Reviews.,"Background. Although there is a large literature examining the relationship between a wide range of political economy exposures and health outcomes, the extent to which the different aspects of political economy influence health, and through which mechanisms and in what contexts, is only partially understood. The areas in which there are few high-quality studies are also unclear. Objectives. To systematically review the literature describing the impact of political economy on population health. Search Methods. We undertook a systematic review of reviews, searching MEDLINE, Embase, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, ProQuest Public Health, Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, EconLit, SocINDEX, Web of Science, and the gray literature via Google Scholar. Selection Criteria. We included studies that were a review of the literature. Relevant exposures were differences or changes in policy, law, or rules; economic conditions; institutions or social structures; or politics, power, or conflict. Relevant outcomes were any overall measure of population health such as self-assessed health, mortality, life expectancy, survival, morbidity, well-being, illness, ill health, and life span. Two authors independently reviewed all citations for relevance. Data Collection and Analysis. We undertook critical appraisal of all included reviews by using modified Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) criteria and then synthesized narratively giving greater weight to the higher-quality reviews. Main Results. From 4912 citations, we included 58 reviews. Both the quality of the reviews and the underlying studies within the reviews were variable. Social democratic welfare states, higher public spending, fair trade policies, extensions to compulsory education provision, microfinance initiatives in low-income countries, health and safety policy, improved access to health care, and high-quality affordable housing have positive impacts on population health. Neoliberal restructuring seems to be associated with increased health inequalities and higher income inequality with lower self-rated health and higher mortality. Authors' Conclusions. Politics, economics, and public policy are important determinants of population health. Countries with social democratic regimes, higher public spending, and lower income inequalities have populations with better health. There are substantial gaps in the synthesized evidence on the relationship between political economy and health, and there is a need for higher-quality reviews and empirical studies in this area. However, there is sufficient evidence in this review, if applied through policy and practice, to have marked beneficial health impacts. Public Health Implications. Policymakers should be aware that social democratic welfare state types, countries that spend more on public services, and countries with lower income inequalities have better self-rated health and lower mortality. Research funders and researchers should be aware that there remain substantial gaps in the available evidence base. One such area concerns the interrelationship between governance, polities, power, macroeconomic policy, public policy, and population health, including how these aspects of political economy generate social class processes and forms of discrimination that have a differential impact across social groups. This includes the influence of patterns of ownership (of land and capital) and tax policies. For some areas, there are many lower-quality reviews, which leave uncertainties in the relationship between political economy and population health, and a high-quality review is needed. There are also areas in which the available reviews have identified primary research gaps such as the impact of changes to housing policy, availability, and tenure.",American journal of public health,2019 Jun,United States,2019,10
29409730,Incidence of filled antidepressant prescriptions among people with newly diagnosed diabetes and its interaction with occupational status within the working population of Denmark 1996-2010.,"AIMS: People with diabetes have heightened levels of depressive symptoms, but less is known about the development of these symptoms in relation to diabetes duration. In this study, we examined the use of prescribed antidepressants in the first five years after diagnosis of diabetes among the working-age population in Denmark. METHODS: All Danish adults aged 18-54 years, diagnosed with diabetes in the study period were included. Diabetes status and purchase of prescription antidepressants were obtained from validated population registers. Data analysis focused on filled antidepressant prescriptions at </=1 and </=5years from diagnosis with diabetes. RESULTS: 35,677 people diagnosed with diabetes were included in the study. At </=1 year post-diagnosis, 2.6% had filled antidepressant prescriptions. At </=5years, this figure rose to 10.4%. Overall, both female gender and lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher incidence of filled antidepressant prescriptions. Diabetes duration modified the degree of differences between men and women and socioeconomic strata. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis with diabetes immediately impacts mental wellbeing, with higher rates of filled antidepressant prescriptions in the first year after diagnosis. People of working age diagnosed with diabetes face specific challenges and addressing such challenges would enhance patient experiences. Focus on mental health in the clinical encounter with people newly diagnosed with diabetes is warranted and important.",Primary care diabetes,2018 Aug,England,2018,10
22064317,Storytelling to access social context and advance health equity research.,"OBJECTIVE: Increased understanding of individual and social determinants of health is crucial to moving toward health equity. This essay examines storytelling as a vehicle for advancing health equity research. METHOD: Contemplative examination of storytelling as a research strategy. RESULTS: An overview of story theory is provided. This is followed by an examination of storytelling as a tool for increasing understanding about the contexts in which people negotiate health, strengthening participation of communities in addressing health issues, and building bridges between researchers and target populations. CONCLUSION: Storytelling can be a powerful tool for advancing health equity research. However, its effective use requires a renegotiation of relationships between researchers and target communities, as well as setting aside routine time to attend storytelling events and read a variety of stories.",Preventive medicine,2012 Nov,United States,2012,10
30806532,"Prevalence of trachoma in the area councils of the Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria: results of six population-based surveys.","PURPOSE: The World Health Organization's (WHO's) global trachoma elimination programme recommends mapping of trachoma at district level for planning of elimination activities in affected populations. This study aimed to provide data on trachoma prevalence for the Area Councils of Nigeria's Federal Capital Territory (FCT). METHODS: Using the Global Trachoma Mapping Project (GTMP) protocols, in March and April 2014, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey in each of the six Area Councils of FCT. Signs were defined based on the WHO simplified grading scheme. RESULTS: 98% to 100% of the targeted households were enrolled in each Area Council. The number of children aged 1-9 years examined per Area Council ranged from 867 to 1248. The number of persons aged >/=15 years examined ranged from 1302 to 1836. The age-adjusted prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular in 1-9-year-olds was <5% in each Area Council. The age- and gender-adjusted prevalence of trichiasis in those aged >/=15 years ranged from 0.0% to 0.3%; two Area Councils (Gwagwalada and Kwali) had prevalences above the 0.2% elimination threshold. The proportion of households with access to improved latrines and water sources ranged from 17 to 90% and 39 to 85% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Gwagwalada and Kwali Area Councils need to perform more trichiasis surgeries to attain the trichiasis elimination prevalence target of 0.2% in persons aged >/=15 years. No Area Council requires mass antibiotic administration for the purposes of trachoma's elimination as a public health problem. All Area Councils need to accelerate provision of access to improved water sources and latrine facilities, to achieve universal coverage.",Ophthalmic epidemiology,2018 Dec,England,2018,10
24456203,"Quality of emergency medical care in Gondar University Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia: a survey of patients' perspectives.","BACKGROUND: Ethiopia has fairly good coverage but very low utilization of health care services. Emergency medical care services require fast, correct and curious services to clients as they present with acute problems. In Ethiopia and Gondar in particular, the quality of emergency medical care has not been studied. The main aim of this study was to assess the disease profile and patients' satisfaction in Gondar University Referral Hospital (GURH). METHODS: A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted among patients visiting GURH for emergency care. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of University of Gondar. Patients were selected by systematic random sampling, using patient flow list in the day and night emergency services. Data were collected using a standard Press Ganey questionnaire by BSc health science graduates. Data were entered in to Epi Info 3.5.3 software and exported to SPSS version 20.0 for windows for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 963 patients (response rate = 96.8%) were studied. The mean (+ s.d.) age of patients was 28.4 (+17.9) years. The overall satisfaction using the mean score indicates that 498 (51.7%) 95%CI: (48.4% - 54.9%) were satisfied with the service, the providers and the facility suitability whereas 465(48.3%) 95%CI: (45.1%- 51.6%) were not satisfied. Seven hundred and six (73.3%) 95%CI: 70.4%-76.1%, patients reported that they have been discriminated or treated badly during the service provision in the hospital. OPD site visited (p < 0.0001), visiting days of the week (P < 0.049), medical condition on arrival (P < 0.0001), degree of confidence in the hospital (AOR = 1.9, 95%CI: 1.1, 3.1), reported discrimination/bad treatment of patients with service (AOR = 0.4, 95%CI: 0.2, 0.7), were significantly associated determinants of patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Non-communicable disease emergencies like injuries and cardiovascular diseases are common. There is a low level of patient satisfaction related to lack of confidence in the hospital for treatment, discrimination towards patient care, and under and delayed treatment of patients who were not in serious medical conditions. Hospitals shall prepare themselves to address the increasing challenge of non-communicable disease emergencies. It is important to revise the service delivery in the emergency department to improve staff courtesy and politeness, commitment, reduce discrimination and bad treatment and proper triage of emergencies at all points of care to increase patient satisfaction giving emphasis to earlier working days.",BMC emergency medicine,2014 Jan 23,England,2014,10

30687462,Influence of Smoking on Bone Mineral Density in Elderly Men.,"Background: Smoking has deleterious effects on bone mass and is associated with the subsequent development of osteoporosis, particularly in elderly participants. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of smoking in the elderly male smokers. Methods: All male participants aged 60 years and older of the Amirkola cohort who performed bone densitometry entered the study. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) using the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry method. In statistical analysis, the smokers and nonsmokers were compared according to BMD, frequency of low bone mass defined as BMD T-score <-1 at either LS or FN, and the number of bone fractures. SPSS software version 18 was used for analysis. Results: A total of 203 smokers with mean smoking duration of 21.67 +/- 17.7 years and the mean number of 36.4 + 15.8 cigarettes per day were compared with 408 nonsmokers. The mean BMD values in LS (0.90 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.19) and FN section (0.87 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.15) and also the frequency of bone fractures were significantly lower, and the frequency of low bone mass at either LS and FN was significantly higher in smokers (P = 0.014, 0.038, 0.003, and 0.004, respectively). In multiple logistic regression analysis, smoking was independently associated with low bone mass by odds ratio of = 2.27 (95% confidence interval: 1.49-3.44).

23740863,Social factors and coping status in asymptomatic middle-aged Danes: association to coronary artery calcification.,"AIMS: Understanding the determinants of social and coping inequalities in subclinical cardiovascular disease is an important prerequisite in developing and implementing preventive strategies. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between social factors and coping status, respectively, and subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD) in middle-aged Danes. METHODS: This is a DanRisk screening substudy, thus including healthy Danish males and females aged 50 or 60 years. Social measures included grade of education, employment and co-habiting status. The coping status was estimated by the general self-efficacy (GES) scale. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was assessed by computed tomography using the Agatston score (AS). Conventional clinical risk factors included sex, family history of CAD, BMI > 25, smoking, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension. RESULTS: In 568 individuals the prevalence of subjects with CAC was 267 (45%). Independent predictors of CAC in males were age (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.04-1.16, p < 0.001), smoking (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.03-2.99, p = 0.038), and low co-habiting status (OR = 3.66, 95% CI = 1.19-11.25, p = 0.023). Independent predictors in females were age (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.02-1.12, p = 0.006), and smoking (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.06-2.78, p = 0.029). Higher AS was associated to lower employment level in females (p = 0.001) but not in males (p = 0.833). CONCLUSIONS: Social factors are associated to the prevalence and severity of CAC in asymptomatic middle-aged individuals with gender differences. The relative value of gender specific social versus conventional clinical risk factors in the risk assessment of subclinical CAC in middle-aged individuals needs further investigation in future prospective studies.",Scandinavian journal of public health,2013 Nov,Sweden,2013,10
30691480,"Study protocol: a pragmatic, stepped-wedge trial of tailored support for implementing social determinants of health documentation/action in community health centers, with realist evaluation.","BACKGROUND: National leaders recommend documenting social determinants of health and actions taken to address social determinants of health in electronic health records, and a growing body of evidence suggests the health benefits of doing so. However, little evidence exists to guide implementation of social determinants of health documentation/action. METHODS: This paper describes a 5-year, mixed-methods, stepped-wedge trial with realist evaluation, designed to test the impact of providing 30 community health centers with step-by-step guidance on implementing electronic health record-based social determinants of health documentation. This guidance will entail 6 months of tailored support from an interdisciplinary team, including training and technical assistance. We will report on tailored support provided at each of five implementation steps; impact of tailored implementation support; a method for tracking such tailoring; and context-specific pathways through which these tailored strategies effect change. We will track the competencies and resources needed to support the study clinics' implementation efforts. DISCUSSION: Results will inform how to tailor implementation strategies to meet local needs in real-world practice settings. Secondary analyses will assess impacts of social determinants of health documentation and referral-making on diabetes outcomes. By learning whether and how scalable, tailored implementation strategies help community health centers adopt social determinants of health documentation and action, this study will yield timely guidance to primary care providers. We are not aware of previous studies exploring implementation strategies that support adoption of social determinants of action using electronic health and interventions, despite the pressing need for such guidance.

30517193,Patient and provider perceptions of a comprehensive care program for HIV-positive adults over 50 years of age: The formation of the Golden Compass HIV and aging care program in San Francisco.,"OBJECTIVE: People living with HIV (PLWH) are living longer and developing comorbidities and aging-related syndromes. New care models are needed to address the combined burden and complexity of HIV and its comorbidities in this group. The goal of this study is to describe qualitative data from patients and providers that informed the development of a comprehensive care model for older PLWH. METHODS: Patient and provider perspectives on the clinical care and service needs of patients living and aging with HIV were explored via surveys and focus groups at a safety net HIV clinic in San Francisco. We surveyed 77 patients and 26 providers and conducted separate focus groups of older patients living with HIV (n = 31) and staff (n = 20). Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes for a care program were additionally explored using findings from the literature on HIV and aging. FINDINGS: Themes from surveys and focus groups emphasized (a) the need for knowledge expertise in HIV and aging, (b) focus on medical conditions and determinants of health of particular import (e.g. marginal housing) among older PLWH, (c) co-locating specialty services (e.g. cardiology, geriatrics) with primary care, and (d) addressing social isolation. Findings informed the design of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary care model for PLWH called the Golden Compass program composed of four ""points"": Heart and Mind (North), Bones and Strength (East), Network and Navigation (South), and Dental, Hearing, and Vision (West). CONCLUSION: Based on patient and clinic staff perspectives from surveys and focus groups, we designed a multidisciplinary program of integrated primary and specialty care, as well as housing and social support, to address the needs of older PLWH within a safety-net infrastructure. Golden Compass launched in 2017 for PLWH older than 50 years. Future research to evaluate the effectiveness of this care program in improving patient outcomes and satisfaction is ongoing.",PloS one,2018,United States,2018,10
27044694,Childhood Poverty and Its Effect on Health and Well-being: Enhancing Training for Learners Across the Medical Education Continuum.,"OBJECTIVE: Childhood poverty is unacceptably common in the US and threatens the health, development, and lifelong well-being of millions of children. Health care providers should be prepared through medical curricula to directly address the health harms of poverty. In this article, authors from The Child Poverty Education Subcommittee (CPES) of the Academic Pediatric Association Task Force on Child Poverty describe the development of the first such child poverty curriculum for teachers and learners across the medical education continuum. METHODS: Educators, physicians, trainees, and public health professionals from 25 institutions across the United States and Canada were convened over a 2-year period and addressed 3 goals: 1) define the core competencies of child poverty education, 2) delineate the scope and aims of a child poverty curriculum, and 3) create a child poverty curriculum ready to implement in undergraduate and graduate medical education settings. RESULTS: The CPES identified 4 core domains for the curriculum including the epidemiology of child poverty, poverty-related social determinants of health, pathophysiology of the health effects of poverty, and leadership and action to reduce and prevent poverty's health effects. Workgroups, focused on each domain, developed learning goals and objectives, built interactive learning modules to meet them, and created evaluation and faculty development materials to supplement the core curriculum. An editorial team with representatives from each workgroup coordinated activities and are preparing the final curriculum for national implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive, standardized child poverty curriculum developed by an international group of educators in pediatrics and experts in the health effects of poverty should prepare medical trainees to address child poverty and improve the health of poor children.",Academic pediatrics,2016 Apr,United States,2016,10
31667630,"Hearing and justice: The link between hearing impairment in early childhood and youth offending in Aboriginal children living in remote communities of the Northern Territory, Australia.","BACKGROUND: High prevalence of chronic middle ear disease has persisted in Australian Aboriginal children, and the related hearing impairment (HI) has been implicated in a range of social outcomes. This study investigated the association between HI in early childhood and youth offending. METHOD: This was a retrospective cohort study of 1533 Aboriginal children (born between 1996 and 2001) living in remote Northern Territory communities. The study used linked individual-level information from health, education, child protection and youth justice services. The outcome variable was a youth being ""found guilty of an offence"". The key explanatory variable, hearing impairment, was based on audiometric assessment. Other variables were: child maltreatment notifications, Year 7 school enrolment by mother, Year 7 school attendance and community 'fixed- effects'. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between HI and youth offending; and the Royston R(2) measure to estimate the separate contributions of risk factors to youth offending. RESULTS: The proportion of hearing loss was high in children with records of offence (boys: 55.6%, girls: 36.7%) and those without (boys: 46.1%; girls: 49.0%). In univariate analysis, a higher risk of offending was found among boys with moderate or worse HI (HR: 1.77 [95% CI: 1.05-2.98]) and mild HI (HR: 1.54 [95% CI:1.06-2.23]). This association was attenuated in multivariable analysis (moderate HI, HR: 1.43 [95% CI:0.78-2.62]; mild HI, HR: 1.37 [95% CI: 0.83-2.26]). No evidence for an association was found in girls. HI contributed 3.2% and 6.5% of variation in offending among boys and girls respectively. Factors contributing greater variance included: community 'fixed-effects' (boys: 14.6%, girls: 36.5%), child maltreatment notification (boys: 14.2%, girls: 23.9%) and year 7 school attendance (boys: 7.9%; girls 12.1%). Enrolment by mother explained substantial variation for girls (25.4%) but not boys (0.2%). CONCLUSION: There was evidence, in univariate analysis, for an association between HI and youth offending for boys however this association was not evident after controlling for other factors. Our findings highlight a range of risk factors that underpin the pathway to youth-offending, demonstrating the urgent need for interagency collaboration to meet the complex needs of vulnerable children in the Northern Territory.",Health & justice,2019 Oct 30,England,2019,10
29439099,Addressing the Root Cause: Rising Health Care Costs and Social Determinants of Health.,"The United States is the only high-income country that does not have publicly-financed universal health care, yet it has one of the world's highest public health care expenditures. This financial outlay is not bringing the desired result in health outcomes because the root cause is not being addressed: solving the systematic disparities and social determinants that lead to poor health and health inequities. Targeting resources for the most vulnerable populations and linking health care plans with community-based organizations to address social determinants of health at the outset is a cost-effective means of preventing expensive chronic illnesses and health inequities.",North Carolina medical journal,2018 Jan-Feb,United States,2018,10
27527198,Psychosocial Determinants of Fruit and Vegetable Consumption in a Japanese Population.,"There is limited evidence in Japan regarding the psychosocial determinants of fruit/vegetable intake. We performed a cross-sectional study of people aged 18 years or older in four regions of Japan; 2308 (men: 1012, women: 1296) individuals who completed the questionnaires were included. We found that 24.8% of people were aware of the current recommendations for vegetables and 13.2% for fruit and that ""ability to design meals"" and ""availability when eating outside of the home"" were the most important factors related to self-efficacy and barriers to fruit and vegetable intake, respectively. People with high self-efficacy (OR: 3.16; 95% CI: 2.17, 4.60 for fruit; OR: 4.52; 95% CI: 3.08, 6.64 for vegetables) were more likely to consume more fruit and vegetables. People with high scores on attitude (OR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.24) and social support (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.27) were more likely to consume more fruit. People with high perceived barriers (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.98) were less likely to consume fruit. This study suggests a need to increase the general population's awareness of the fruit and vegetable intake recommendations; facilitating positive attitudes, self-efficacy, and social support for individuals and strengthening the ability of individuals to design meals with more vegetables and fruit might be useful intervention programs.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2016 Aug 5,Switzerland,2016,10
21450119,Spousal agreement on preferred waiting time to next birth in sub-Saharan Africa.,"This study investigates how various social, demographic and economic factors affect spousal agreement on preferred waiting time to next birth. Data for matched cohabiting couples from ten Demographic and Health Surveys in sub-Saharan Africa (Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe), conducted between 2003 and 2006, were analysed to compare reported waiting time to next birth by the husband and the wife. Couples where the reported waiting time to next birth was the same for both partners (difference is 0 months) were defined as having agreement on waiting time to next birth. In sub-Saharan Africa, spousal agreement on waiting time to next birth was found to be associated with wanting the next child sooner. When the spouses disagree on waiting time to next birth, the wives want to wait longer than their husbands in most cases. Additionally, the study found that demographic factors are the primary determinants of spousal agreement on waiting time to next birth, not socioeconomic factors. The strongest predictors of spousal agreement on waiting time to next birth were number of living children, difference between the number of ideal and living children and wife's age. Couples with fewer children, a younger wife and those with a difference of five or more children between ideal and living number of children were more likely to agree on waiting time to next birth. Effects of socioeconomic factors, such as education and wealth status, on spousal agreement on waiting time to next birth were generally weak and inconsistent. The findings highlight some of the challenges in developing programmes to promote spousal communication and birth spacing and underscore the need for programmes to be gender-sensitive.",Journal of biosocial science,2011 Jul,England,2011,10
27087576,Doubly blind: a systematic review of gender in randomised controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: Although observational data show social characteristics such as gender or socio-economic status to be strong predictors of health, their impact is seldom investigated in randomised controlled studies (RCTs). OBJECTIVE & DESIGN: Using a random sample of recent RCTs from high-impact journals, we examined how the most often recorded social characteristic, sex/gender, is considered in design, analysis, and interpretation. Of 712 RCTs published from September 2008 to 31 December 2013 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal, Lancet, Canadian Medical Association Journal, or New England Journal of Medicine, we randomly selected 57 to analyse funding, methods, number of centres, documentation of social circumstances, inclusion/exclusion criteria, proportions of women/men, and reporting about sex/gender in analyses and discussion. RESULTS: Participants' sex was recorded in most studies (52/57). Thirty-nine percent included men and women approximately equally. Overrepresentation of men in 43% of studies without explicit exclusions for women suggested interference in selection processes. The minority of studies that did analyse sex/gender differences (22%) did not discuss or reflect upon these, or dismissed significant findings. Two studies reinforced traditional beliefs about women's roles, finding no impact of breastfeeding on infant health but nevertheless reporting possible benefits. Questionable methods such as changing protocols mid-study, having undefined exclusion criteria, allowing local researchers to remove participants from studies, and suggesting possible benefit where none was found were evident, particularly in industry-funded research. CONCLUSIONS: Social characteristics like sex/gender remain hidden from analyses and interpretation in RCTs, with loss of information and embedding of error all along the path from design to interpretation, and therefore, to uptake in clinical practice. Our results suggest that to broaden external validity, in particular, more refined trial designs and analyses that account for sex/gender and other social characteristics are needed.",Global health action,2016,United States,2016,10
27170791,"The Adolescent ""Expanded Medical Home"": School-Based Health Centers Partner with a Primary Care Clinic to Improve Population Health and Mitigate Social Determinants of Health.","INTRODUCTION: Access to high-quality health care is a crucial social determinant of health. We describe the implementation of an ""expanded medical home"" partnering a primary care practice (the Ypsilanti Health Center [YHC]) with local school-based health centers (the Regional Alliance for Healthy Schools [RAHS]), and to assess whether this model improves access to and quality of care for shared patients. METHODS: Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we define the steps in, barriers to, and facilitating factors in implementing the expanded medical home model. Visits and quality measures were assessed for patients seen by YHC only versus YHC/RAHS at baseline and during the intervention. RESULTS: At baseline, patients seen at YHC/RAHS had higher compliance with most quality metrics compared with those seen at YHC only. The proportion of shared patients significantly increased because of the intervention (P < .001). Overall, patients seen in the expanded medical home had a higher likelihood of receiving quality metric services than patients in YHC only (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-2.05) across all measures. CONCLUSIONS: Thoughtful and intentional implementation of an expanded medical home partnership between primary care physicians and school-based health centers increases the number of shared high-risk adolescent patients. Shared patients have improved compliance with quality measures, which may lead to long-term improved health equity.",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,2016 May-Jun,United States,2016,10
29526537,"Body weight regulation, socioeconomic status and epigenetic alterations.","Obesity is a complex disease which has reached epidemic dimensions. Thus, prevention of excessive weight gain and associated metabolic and cardiovascular diseases has to start as early in life as possible. The impact of epigenetic mechanisms on the regulation of genes involved in obesity is increasingly recognized. On the other hand, it is well known that socioeconomic factors influence the risk for obesity. These factors can also have an impact on epigenetic gene regulation. There is increasing body of evidence that several factors and interventions addressing extragenetic causes of obesity may not only improve individual health, but also the health of future generations by epigenetic alterations. Our current understanding of epigenetic changes has shown that many of them are potentially reversible, i.e. by physical exercise, by pharmacological treatment, by environmental factors or nutrition, or even by influencing socioeconomic factors, which might have impact on improving health in future generations by avoiding epigenetic dysregulation. In this review we present the current state of the art with regard to the interplay between social determinants, weight status and epigenetic alterations.",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2018 Aug,United States,2018,10
30218915,Safe sex norm questionnaire for female sex workers: development and validation study in Iran.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a safe sex norm questionnaire as an appropriate instrument which would be adaptable to the female sex worker (FSW) population. STUDY DESIGN: A mixed method study. METHODS: Appropriate content was prepared through a literature review. Content validation indices were assessed using interviews with content experts and lay experts. A conservative approach was used to assess the inter-rater agreement among the participants about the instrument relevance and clarity. The scale content validity index was computed using the average method. Non-parametric Mokken scale analysis was used for assessing scalability and unidimensionality of the questionnaire in a sample of 170 FSWs in Tehran. To evaluate the reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaire intra-class correlation and Cronbach's alpha were employed. RESULTS: A list of 34 items was finalized, with subscales for actual behavioral norms and for perceived norms. The relevance of the actual and perceived norms subscales in the final questionnaire was higher than 96%; clarity of the subtests was 99% and higher. The comprehensiveness of the actual and perceived norms subscales was 85% for both. Mokken scale analysis showed that the two subscales were distinct constructs, and all items are good indicators for the constructs. CONCLUSION: Our findings support that the safe sex norm questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure that would be useful to harm reduction programs and help effective HIV prevention among female sex workers.",Public health,2018 Nov,Netherlands,2018,10
29387320,Relationship between beta-Thalassemia minor and Helicobacter pylori infection.,"Background: Until now, no study has been reported investigating the association between beta-thalassemia minor and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. This study was designed to compare H. pylori infection rate between beta-thalassemia minor patients and healthy controls. Methods: A number of 100 beta-thalassemia minor patients (50 males, 50 females) and 100 gender-matched healthy controls were prospectively recruited in this study in a period of 3 months. The study population consisted of the people who referred to a health center in Babol, North of Iran, for premarital counseling. H. pylori status was assessed by measuring the anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Demographic information and informed consent were collected from all participants. Results: The overall H. pylori infection rate was 43%. The infection was significantly more prevalent in thalassemia patients (53%) than in the controls (33%) in both univariate (OR=2.29, 95% CI: 1.3-4.06) and multivariable analyses (OR=2.05, 95% CI: 1.12-3.76). Age was the only significant factor which was positively correlated with the infection in beta-thalassemia minor cases (OR=1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.2). Gender, blood groups, residency, and education level were not related to the infection. Conclusions: According to the results, it can be concluded that beta-thalassemia minor patients are possibly more susceptible to H. pylori infection than healthy people. Further studies are needed to discover more about the exact mechanisms of increased susceptibility to H. pylori infection in beta-thalassemia minor patients.",Caspian journal of internal medicine,2018 Winter,Iran,2018,10
29557608,Psychomotor development index in children younger than 6 years from Argentine provinces.,"OBJECTIVE: To obtain a psychomotor development index (PDI) for each Argentine province. POPULATION AND METHODS: Using a national, probabilistic, and stratified sample of 13 323 male and female children younger than 6 years selected for the National Survey on Nutrition and Health (Encuesta Nacional de Nutricion y Salud, ENNyS 2004), we estimated the PDI per province based on compliance with 10 developmental milestones. The median age at attainment (median age) of each milestone was estimated adjusting a logistic regression. The PDI was estimated as 100* (1 + b), where ""b"" is the regression coefficient of y= a + b x, where ""y"" is the median age as per the national reference (x) minus the median age at attainment of a milestone. The theoretical value expected for the PDI was 100. RESULTS: The PDI per province ranged between 72.1 and 106.4. Most provinces showed a negative regression coefficient, which indicated a progressive increase of the delay in the age at attainment of milestones. The correlation coefficient between the PDI per province and infant mortality in 2005was extremely high: -0.85, suggesting that both indicators share similar biological and social determinants. The PDI was negative because the higher the mortality, the lower the PDI. CONCLUSION: We have now a positive health indicator available in Argentina: the psychomotor development index, which is a low-cost, easy to collect, and reliable tool that may be used in national health statistics.",Archivos argentinos de pediatria,2018 Apr 1,Argentina,2018,10
21139854,Determinants of arsenicosis patients' perception and social implications of arsenic poisoning through groundwater in Bangladesh.,"Adverse human health effects ranging from skin lesions to internal cancers as well as widespread social and psychological problems caused by arsenic contaminated drinking water in Bangladesh may be the biggest arsenic calamity in the world. From an arsenicosis patients survey, this paper empirically analyzes the determinants of arsenicosis patients' perception about chronic arsenic poisoning and social and psychological implications of arsenicosis. In this study, cross-sectional data were collected from the Matlab and Hajiganj Upzillas of Chandpur district which are known to be highly contaminated with arsenic in their underground water. Respondents informed that arsenic poisoning causes a wide range of social and psychological problems. Female respondents were less vulnerable in the case of social problems (p < 0.01) and more vulnerable for the psychological problems (p < 0.001) of arsenicosis than male respondents. The results based on logit analysis showed that education (p < 0.01) and household income (p < 0.05) were significantly correlated to respondents' perception about arsenicosis. The arsenicosis related special program (s) needs a clear understanding of people's perception about arsenic exposure for abating the health burden as well as social and psychological problems.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2010 Oct,Switzerland,2010,10
24914712,"Street hawking among in-school adolescents in a south-western town in Nigeria: pattern, determinants and effects on school performance.","Street hawking is the commonest form of child labor in Nigeria. Although street hawking is very pervasive, there is the increasing need to fully understand its pattern and effects on those involved in hawking particularly adolescents who combine schooling with hawking. In Nigeria, data on the effects of street hawking on in-school adolescents are generally scanty. Therefore, the present study was undertaken in Ife Central Local Government Area (LGA) of Osun State, Nigeria to assess the pattern, determinants of street hawking among in-school adolescents and its effect on school performance. A cross-sectional study of 435 adolescents (aged 10-19) attending public secondary schools was done. Data were collected using facilitated self-administered questionnaires alongside a review of class records. Appropriate statistical analysis including multiple regression was done. Results showed mean age of respondents to be 14.6+/-2.1 years with prevalence of street hawking at 37.2%. Early adolescents (10-13 years) were more likely to engage in street hawking compared to their counterparts in late adolescence (aged 17-19). Female adolescents and students of trading mothers were significantly more likely to engage in street hawking. Respondents engaged in street hawking were significantly more likely to have failed the last academic term examination. The findings from this study will be useful for stakeholders as they develop policies and programmes to address the challenge of street hawking among adolescent school goers.",International journal of adolescent medicine and health,2015 Feb,Germany,2015,10
30847753,"Should We Activate Risk Perceptions in the Context of Suicide Prevention? Examining Fear Appeals, Help-Seeking Determinants, and Help-Seeking Sources Among University Employees Who Suffer from Depression.","Health promotion strategies have largely focused on activating risk perceptions for health conditions in resistant at-risk populations in order to induce behavior change. Yet, doing so remains a questionable approach when promoting help-seeking behaviors among individuals who suffer from depression because clinical symptoms can negatively affect interpretations and responses to such efforts. This study sought to test the effects and effectiveness of risk-based health messaging utilizing fear appeals on help-seeking determinants, intentions, and sources. One hundred seventeen university employees affected by symptoms of depression were recruited to participate in a lab-based experimental setting. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three message conditions that differed in strength of fear appeal (low, moderate, high) when inducing suicide risk perceptions and promoting help-seeking. Consistent with previous research, participants indicated high stigma perceptions and low intentions to seek help. Risk-based messaging strategies such as fear appeals did not have an effect on help-seeking intentions in this sample. Intentions were largely determined by positive outcome expectations and social norms, whereas efficacy perceptions were positive and not a predictor of help-seeking intentions. Participants were most likely to seek help from intimate partners and friends and least likely to utilize a help-line. Health promotion messages should contain cues that activate, rather than change, the already positive outcome expectations of seeking help when targeting at-risk populations. Future research should explore possibilities for health promotion and education among support networks of those who suffer from depression and anxiety.",Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,2019 Aug,United States,2019,10
21547499,Effects of tutor-related behaviours on the process of problem-based learning.,"Tutors in a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) curriculum are thought to play active roles in guiding students to develop frameworks for use in the construction of knowledge. This implies that both subject-matter expertise and the ability of tutors to facilitate the learning process must be important in helping students learn. This study examines the behavioural effects of tutors in terms of subject-matter expertise, social congruence and cognitive congruence on students' learning process and on their final achievement. The extent of students' learning at each PBL phase was estimated by tracking the number of relevant concepts recalled at the end of each learning phase, while student achievement was based on students' ability to describe and elaborate upon the relationship between relevant concepts learned. By using Analysis of Covariance, social congruence of the tutor was found to have a significant influence on learning in each PBL phase while all of the tutor-related behaviours had a significant impact on student achievement. The results suggest that the ability of tutors to communicate informally with students and hence create a less threatening learning environment that promotes a free flow exchange of ideas, has a greater impact on learning at each of the PBL phases as compared to tutors' subject-matter expertise and their ability to explain concepts in a way that is easily understood by students. The data presented indicates that these tutor-related behaviours are determinants of learning in a PBL curriculum, with social congruence having a greater influence on learning in the different PBL phases.",Advances in health sciences education : theory and practice,2011 Oct,Netherlands,2011,10
27894043,Treatment seeking in cannabis dependence: The role of social cognition.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Relatively few cannabis dependent individuals seek treatment and little is known about the determinants of treatment seeking. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) provides a useful framework for examining human behaviour and motivation which may be helpful in explaining treatment seeking. This study examined the differences in cannabis outcome expectancies and cannabis refusal self-efficacy between treatment seekers and non-treatment seekers with cannabis dependence. DESIGN: Non-treatment seekers were referred to an illicit drug diversion program. Treatment seekers commenced an outpatient cannabis treatment program and completed a comprehensive assessment that included measures of cannabis outcome expectancies and refusal self-efficacy. SETTING: A public hospital alcohol and drug outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: 269 non-treatment seekers and 195 individuals commencing cannabis dependence treatment. MEASUREMENTS: The Cannabis Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ), Cannabis Refusal Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (CRSEQ), Severity of Dependence Scale - Cannabis (SDS-C), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) and Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RTC) were completed. FINDINGS: Treatment seekers had significantly higher levels of negative cannabis outcome expectancies and significantly lower levels of emotional relief refusal self-efficacy (belief in ability to resist using cannabis when experiencing negative affect) (ps<0.001). Treatment seekers had significantly higher levels of psychological distress and self-perceived cannabis dependence compared to non-treatment seekers (ps<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High negative cannabis outcome expectancies and low emotional relief refusal self-efficacy may play a key role in motivation to seek treatment.",Drug and alcohol dependence,2017 Jan 1,Ireland,2017,10
22235151,Social determinants of health for Native Hawaiian children and adolescents.,"INTRODUCTION: Traditional Hawaiian thought places children in a position of prominence in the family. Yet in Hawai'i, Native Hawaiian children and adolescents face significant inequity in health outcomes. From prenatal alcohol and tobacco use, late or no prenatal care, macrosomia as well as low birth rates, to exclusive breastfeeding rates at 6 months, and high rates of infant mortality, Native Hawaiians face inequities in pre and early childhood indicators. During childhood and adolescence, Native Hawaiians experience high rates of obesity, and physical, mental and sexual abuse. This review examines the determinants behind the health inequities encountered by Native Hawaiian children and adolescents, and contextualizes those inequities s in a human rights-based approach to health. METHODS: A literature review was conducted for relevant research on Native Hawaiian and other indigenous children and adolescents. Existing data sources were also reviewed for relevant Native Hawaiian data. RESULTS: There is a significant dearth of data on the determinants of health for Native Hawaiian children and adolescents. Some prenatal data is available from the Prenatal Risk Assessment Monitoring System, while selected youth data is available from the Youth Behavioral Risk Factor system. Available data show significant inequities for Native Hawaiian children and adolescents, compared to other groups in Hawai'i. Based on comparisons with other indigenous and marginalized peoples, the etiology of these disparities may be a lack of health equity, deriving from multigenerational trauma and discrimination as well as poverty and inequities of housing, education, environment, healthcare access, and social capital. CONCLUSIONS: The significant barriers facing Native Hawaiian children and adolescents achieving their full potential constitute a challenge to the fulfillment of the human right to health. Future research needs to more fully articulate the linkage between the health status of Native Hawaiian children and adolescents, the determinants of that status, and the requirements of the human right to health. Needed particularly are longitudinal studies which provide data that may link multigenerational trauma and discrimination to poverty and other factors, ultimately producing healthy inequity for Native Hawaiian children and adolescents.",Hawaii medical journal,2011 Nov,United States,2011,10

28936356,Implementation of the European health interview survey (EHIS) into the German health update (GEDA).,"BACKGROUND: This methodological paper describes the integration of the 'European Health Interview Survey wave 2' (EHIS 2) into the 'German Health Update' 2014/2015 (GEDA 2014/2015-EHIS). METHODS: GEDA 2014/2015-EHIS is a cross-sectional health survey. A two-stage stratified cluster sampling approach was used to recruit persons aged 15 years and older with permanent residence in Germany. Two different modes of data collection were used, self-administered web questionnaire and self-administered paper questionnaire. The survey instrument implemented the EHIS 2 modules on health status, health care use, health determinants and social background variables and additional national questions. Data processing was conducted according to the quality and validation rules specified by Eurostat. RESULTS: In total, 24,824 questionnaires were completed. The response rate was 27.6%. The two-stage cluster sample method seems to have been successful in achieving a sample with high representativeness. The final micro data file was inspected, approved and certified by Eurostat. Access to micro data of the EHIS 2 can be provided by Eurostat via research contract and to the GEDA 2014/2015-EHIS public use file by the Research Data Centre of the Robert Koch Institute. First EHIS 2 results are available at the Eurostat website. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating a multinational health survey into an existing national health monitoring system was a challenge in Germany. The national survey methodology for conducting the survey had to be further developed in order to meet the overarching goal of harmonizing the health information from national statistical offices and public health research institutes across the European Union. The harmonized EHIS 2 data source will profoundly impact international public health research in the near future.

30782593,Income inequality and firearm homicide in the US: a county-level cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: Income inequality has been rising in the US and thought to be associated with violence especially homicide. About 75% of homicides involve firearms. We quantified the association between county-level income inequality and all-race/ethnicity and race/ethnicity-specific firearm homicide rates among individuals aged 14-39 years. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of US counties to examine the association of Gini Index (ranging from 0 [perfect income equality] to 1.0 [perfect income inequality]) separately measured in 1990 and 2000 with all-race/ethnicity and race/ethnicity-specific firearm homicide rates in 2005-2015. Generalised linear mixed models with Poisson distribution including a random intercept for state provided IRRs and 95% CIs. Bayesian Poisson-lognormal hierarchical modelling with integrated nested Laplace approximations was used in exploratory spatial analyses. Models accounted for county-level age, sex and race/ethnicity composition, crime rate, deprivation, social capital, urbanicity, and firearm ownership. FINDINGS: The Gini Index was associated with firearm homicide rates among all races/ethnicities. After accounting for contextual determinants of firearm homicide, the association persisted among African-Americans. In this group, a 1 SD greater Gini Index in 1990 (IRR=1.09; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.16) and 2000 (IRR=1.09; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.17) was associated with greater firearm homicide rates in 2005-2015. Exploratory spatial analyses did not materially change the results. CONCLUSION: Policies addressing the gap between the rich and the poor deserve further considerations for reducing firearm homicide rates. Incorporating income inequality to refine measures of socioeconomic position may advance public health and clinical research and practice for firearm violence prevention.",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,2019 Sep,England,2019,10
25813505,Sociopolitical determinants of international health policy.,"For decades, two opposing logics have dominated the health policy debate: a comprehensive health care approach, with the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration as its cornerstone, and a private competition logic, emphasizing the role of the private sector. We present this debate and its influence on international health policies in the context of changing global economic and sociopolitical power relations in the second half of the last century. The neoliberal approach is illustrated with Chile's health sector reform in the 1980s and the Colombian reform since 1993. The comprehensive ""public logic"" is shown through the social insurance models in Costa Rica and in Brazil and through the national public health systems in Cuba since 1959 and in Nicaragua during the 1980s. These experiences emphasize that health care systems do not naturally gravitate toward greater fairness and efficiency, but require deliberate policy decisions.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2015,United States,2015,10
26425696,Vaccine Hesitancy Among General Practitioners and Its Determinants During Controversies: A National Cross-sectional Survey in France.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess: 1) vaccine hesitancy (VH) prevalence among French general practitioners (GPs) through the frequency of their vaccine recommendations, and 2) the determinants of these recommendations. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study in 2014 nested in a national panel of 1712 randomly selected GPs in private practice in France. We constructed a score of self-reported recommendation frequency for 6 specific vaccines to target populations. RESULTS: 16% to 43% of GPs sometimes or never recommended at least one specific vaccine to their target patients. Multivariable logistic regressions of the dichotomized score showed that GPs recommended vaccines frequently when they felt comfortable explaining their benefits and risks to patients (OR = 1.87; 1.35-2.59), or trusted official sources of information highly (OR = 1.40; 1.01-1.93). They recommended vaccines infrequently when they considered that adverse effects were likely (OR = 0.71; 0.52-0.96) or doubted the vaccine's utility (OR = 0.21; 0.15-0.29). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that after repeated vaccine controversies in France, some VH exists among French GPs, whose recommendation behaviors depend on their trust in authorities, their perception of the utility and risks of vaccines, and their comfort in explaining them. Further research is needed to confirm these results among health care workers in other countries.",EBioMedicine,2015 Aug,Netherlands,2015,10
30279179,Education can reduce health differences related to genetic risk of obesity.,"This work investigates whether genetic makeup moderates the effects of education on health. Low statistical power and endogenous measures of environment have been obstacles to the credible estimation of such gene-by-environment interactions. We overcome these obstacles by combining a natural experiment that generated variation in secondary education with polygenic scores for a quarter-million individuals. The additional schooling affected body size, lung function, and blood pressure in middle age. The improvements in body size and lung function were larger for individuals with high genetic predisposition to obesity. As a result, education reduced the gap in unhealthy body size between those in the top and bottom terciles of genetic risk of obesity from 20 to 6 percentage points.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2018 Oct 16,United States,2018,10
29579522,The Relationship of Maternal-Fetal Attachment and Postpartum Depression: A Longitudinal Study.,"AIM: To determine the relationship between maternal-fetal attachment and postpartum depression. METHODS: This longitudinal study was done on 242 primiparous women in 2016. The data collection tools used included a socio-demographic characteristics questionnaire and Cranley's Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale - which was completed at 32-37weeks of pregnancy - and obstetrics information questionnaire and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale -which was completed at 6-8weeks after birth. A multivariate linear regression was used to estimate the extent to which maternal-fetal attachment affected postpartum depression. RESULTS: The mean Maternal-Fetal Attachment score was 90.0 (SD: 10.3) from the attainable score of 23 to 115. The mean depression score was 8.0 (SD: 3.8) from the attainable score of 0 to 30. Pearson's correlation test showed a significant inverse relationship between maternal-fetal attachment and postpartum depression (r=-0.196, p<0.001). The multivariate linear regression model showed that postpartum depression correlated significantly with the mother's age and two dimensions of attachment including differentiation of self from fetus and attributing characteristics to the fetus. CONCLUSION: According to the findings, maternal-fetal attachment is one of the factors contributing to postpartum depression. Greater emphasis should be placed on the preparation of pregnant women for accepting their maternal role, so that the maternal-neonatal relationship can be enhanced and postpartum depression thus reduced.",Archives of psychiatric nursing,2018 Apr,United States,2018,10

According to recent statistics, the current rate of cesarean in Iran is in fact 3-4 times as more than the standard rate defined by WHO. Therefore, the present study is aimed to estimate the effect of an instructional program based on health belief model on reducing cesarean rate among primiparous pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this semi-experimental research, 60 primiparous women who had visited Bandar Abbas Healthcare Centers were selected as the subjects. They were in their 26-30(th) week of pregnancy. They were selected in a multi-stage cluster sampling method (a combination of clustering and simple randomization), and were divided into two groups, subjects and control group. The data were gathered using a valid and reliable questionnaire. The instructional intervention was done after the completion of the pretest questionnaire based on the sub-constructs of the health belief model in six instructional sessions. 1 month after the intervention, posttest questionnaires were completed by the subjects in both groups. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, standard deviation, independent t-test, and paired t-test. The significance level was set at <0.05. RESULTS: Two groups had a significant difference between awareness score, perceived sensitivity, intensity, benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, and the performance (P < 0.001). In the experimental group, nine subjects (30%) had a natural delivery. CONCLUSION: According to the findings of the current research, an instructional program illuminated (designed) by the health belief model can significantly influence pregnant women's awareness, intention, and choice of delivery type.",Journal of education and health promotion,2016,India,2016,10
21186663,[Body perception among determinants of self-rated health in 13-year-old adolescents in Poland].,"UNLABELLED: The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of body image on the subjective health of adolescents, taking into consideration the modifying factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data were collected in 2008 as part of a postal survey conducted among 605 children born in Poland in January 1995. Self-reported health was analysed in two categories: 1) excellent or very good health; 2) good, fair or poor health. Body image was examined using three variables: self-perception of physical appearance, subjective assessment of body weight and self-body image according to the Body Image Subscale (BIS) by Orbach and Mikulincer. In addition, the impact of twelve other variables was analysed, which were related to: socio-demographic characteristics, physical and psychosocial health and also social relations. The impact of all the fifteen variables on self-rated health was compared using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In the surveyed group, 31.9% of adolescents assessed their health as worse than very good, of which 6.3% considered it fair or poor. Gender, place of residence and body mass index (BMI) had no impact on health self-assessment. The percentage of those who assessed their health as worse than very good, was equal to 48.5% in the group which had a very negative attitude towards their body, and 61.5% in the subgroup which had big reservations about their body image. In the multivariate analysis, the strongest predictor variables for worse health self-assessment were chronic diseases and negative self-body image. The following factors, which can protect young people against worse well-being, were included in the final model: positive thinking, social support and high physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: There exist many factors which influence the self-perceived health in early adolescence, and they may not be classified only as physical ailments. Body image appears to be a very important factor at that age. High physical activity, support from family, peers and neighbours and positive attitude toward themselves are important resources for health which affect adolescents' well-being.",Medycyna wieku rozwojowego,2010 Jul-Sep,Poland,2010,10
27365954,"Knowledge, attitude, and practice of people toward epilepsy in a South Indian village.","INTRODUCTION: People living with epilepsy continue to suffer from enacted or perceived stigma that is based on myths, misconceptions, and misunderstandings that have persisted for many years. In the last decade, there has been an increase in individual literacy rate and increased access to technology in rural population. However, it is unclear if this has any effect on knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) attitude toward epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim is to evaluate KAP toward epilepsy. In addition, we also estimated the prevalence of stroke and epilepsy in rural South India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a 14-item questionnaire, we assessed KAP toward epilepsy and identified determinants of inappropriate attitudes toward people with epilepsy and 10-item questionnaires to assess the prevalence of epilepsy and stroke among 500 randomly selected populations in a Pattaravakkam village (Tamil Nadu, India). RESULTS: About 87.7% of the people had heard or read about epilepsy. Negative attitudes appeared to be reinforced by beliefs that epilepsy is hereditary (23.1%), kind of insanity (22.6%), or as contagious (12.0%). The knowledge about the clinical characteristics and first aid to a person during a seizure was 25.8%. About 36.5% of people think that society discriminates people with epilepsy. Moreover, our prevalence study showed that 8.7% people are suffering from epilepsy and 3.7% had stroke previously and at the day of survey, the stroke prevalence is 3.3%. CONCLUSION: Even with increased literacy, technology, and communication devices, the KAP of people toward epilepsy is relatively low. General public education campaigns and specific school education campaigns children should be encouraged to increase the KAP toward epilepsy. The prevalence and pattern of epilepsy and stroke is on the higher side in the village of Pattaravakkam. Future research regarding the value of targeted education in improving KAP will be worthwhile.",Journal of neurosciences in rural practice,2016 Jul-Sep,United States,2016,10
26369774,Impact of New Genomic Technologies on Understanding Adverse Drug Reactions.,"It is well established that variations in genes can alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of a drug and immunological responses to it. Early advances in pharmacogenetics were made with traditional genetic techniques such as functional cloning of genes using knowledge gained from purified proteins, and candidate gene analysis. Over the past decade, techniques for analysing the human genome have accelerated greatly as knowledge and technological capabilities have grown. These techniques were initially focussed on understanding genetic factors of disease, but increasingly they are helping to clarify the genetic basis of variable drug responses and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We examine genetic methods that have been applied to the understanding of ADRs, review the current state of knowledge of genetic factors that influence ADR development, and discuss how the application of genome-wide association studies and next-generation sequencing approaches is supporting and extending existing knowledge of pharmacogenetic processes leading to ADRs. Such approaches have identified single genes that are major contributing genetic risk factors for an ADR, (such as flucloxacillin and drug-induced liver disease), making pre-treatment testing a possibility. They have contributed to the identification of multiple genetic determinants of a single ADR, some involving both pharmacologic and immunological processes (such as phenytoin and severe cutaneous adverse reactions). They have indicated that rare genetic variants, often not previously reported, are likely to have more influence on the phenotype than common variants that have been traditionally tested for. The problem of genotype/phenotype discordance affecting the interpretation of pharmacogenetic screening and the future of genome-based testing applied to ADRs are also discussed.",Clinical pharmacokinetics,2016 Apr,Switzerland,2016,10
21350896,Advancing maternal age is associated with lower bone mineral density in young adult male offspring.,"SUMMARY: Advancing maternal age has been related to increased risk of fetal death and morbidity, as well as higher fracture risk during childhood, in the offspring. In the present study, we demonstrate that advancing maternal age is independently associated with reduced bone mass in the young adult male offspring. INTRODUCTION: In Sweden the maternal age in both primi- and multipara mothers has steadily increased during the last three decades. It has been previously reported that advancing maternal age increases the risk of fetal death, but also of morbidity in the offspring, such as chromosome abnormalities, leukemia, diabetes mellitus type 1, and schizophrenia. Whether or not maternal age influences peak bone mass has not been reported. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a high maternal age was associated with lower peak bone mass, as measured using DXA in a large cohort of male offspring [the Gothenburg Osteoporosis and Obesity Determinants study (GOOD)]. METHODS: Through the Swedish multi-generation register, we identified the mothers of 1,009 GOOD study subjects. From the Swedish medical birth register detailed information about the medical circumstances at the time of child birth were obtained, including maternal and offspring anthropometrics (birth height and weight), maternal age, and smoking habits, parity and length of pregnancy. RESULTS: Maternal age was inversely correlated to areal BMD (aBMD) at the total body (r =-0.07, p = 0.03) and the lumbar spine (r =-0.09, p < 0.01). Using a linear regression model (with covariates including current physical activity, smoking, calcium intake, weight, present height and birth height, total body lean and fat mass in the offspring, and length of pregnancy), we found that maternal age negatively independently predicted lumbar spine aBMD (beta =-0.08, p < 0.01) in the male offspring. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results suggest that advancing maternal age could negatively affect bone mass in young adult men.",Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2012 Feb,England,2012,10
21473167,The concept of post-racial: how its easy dismissal obscures important questions.,"Nearly all of today's confident dismissals of the notion of a ""post-racial"" America address the simple question, ""Are we beyond racism or not?"" But most of the writers who have used the terms post-racial or post-ethnic sympathetically have explored other questions: What is the significance of the blurring of ethnoracial lines through cross-group marriage and reproduction? How should we interpret the relatively greater ability of immigrant blacks as compared to standard ""African Americans"" to overcome racist barriers? What do we make of increasing evidence that economic and educational conditions prior to immigration are more powerful determinants than ""race"" in affecting the destiny of population groups that have immigrated to the United States in recent decades? Rather than calling constant attention to the undoubted reality of racism, this essay asks scholars and anti-racist intellectuals more generally to think beyond ""the problem of the color line"" in order to focus on ""the problem of solidarity."" The essay argues that the most easily answered questions are not those that most demand our attention.",Daedalus,2011,United States,2011,10

28715788,Smoke-free homes and attitudes towards banning smoking in vehicles carrying children in Spain (2016).,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the voluntary adoption of smoke-free homes and social attitudes in Spain towards banning smoking in vehicles in which children are present. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of a representative sample of the adult Spanish population age range, 18-75 years (n=1036). The field work was conducted via a computer-assisted telephone survey in March and April 2016. Survey respondents answered questions about smoking rules at home and attitudes towards a smoking ban in cars with or without children. Home smoking rules were defined as complete (smoking not allowed anywhere in the house), partial (smoking allowed in some areas inside the house) or absent (smoking allowed everywhere). RESULTS: Most (83.0%) of the surveyed population had some type of smoking restriction in place at home (45.6% complete and 37.5% partial). There were significant differences between groups according to age group (the highest prevalence was 86.1% from 66 to 75 years and the lowest prevalence was 77.8% from 46 to 65 years) and smoking status (the highest prevalence was 89.4% in people who had never been smokers and the lowest prevalence was 75.0% in current smokers) with regards to the prevalence of smoke-free homes (p<0.05), with partial bans more prevalent in smoking households (49.0%). Most (61.6%) of the population favored banning smoking in cars, and 90.1% supported a ban in cars carrying minors. Attitudes towards smoking regulation in cars (with or without children) varied significantly by age group (the highest prevalence was 81.9% from 66 to 75 years and the lowest prevalence was 54.5% from 18 to 45 years) and smoking status (the highest prevalence was 71.4% in people who had never been smokers and the lowest prevalence was 46.0% in current smokers). However, no significant differences were found with regard to attitudes towards smoking regulation in cars carrying children, regardless of sex, age, social class, or smoking status. CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the adult population in Spain have implemented a complete smoke-free rule at home. More than 9 out of 10 adults favor regulating smoking in cars in the presence of minors. These findings support the expansion of smoke-free regulations to include private vehicles, particularly when minors are in the car.",Environmental research,2017 Oct,Netherlands,2017,10
28194085,Association of quality of life and job stress in occupational workforce of India: Findings from a cross-sectional study on software professionals.,"BACKGROUND: There is limited scientific evidence on the relationship of job stress with quality of life (QoL). PURPOSE: This study aims to explore different domains of job stress affecting IT/ITES professionals and estimate the levels of stress that these professionals endure to reach positive levels of QoL given that other determinants operating between these two variables are accounted for. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We estimated levels of stress that software professionals would have endured to reach positive levels of QoL considering that other factors operating between these two variables are accounted for. The study participants comprised 1071 software professionals who were recruited using a mixed sampling method. Participants answered a self-administered questionnaire containing questions on job stress, QoL, and confounders. RESULTS: All the domains (physical, psychological, social, and environmental) of QoL showed statistically significant positive associations with increasing stress domains of autonomy, physical infrastructure, work environment, and emotional factors. CONCLUSIONS: The respondents clearly found the trade-off of higher stress to be acceptable for the improved QoL they enjoyed. It is also possible that stress might actually be responsible for improvements in QoL either directly or through mediation of variables such as personal values and aspirations. Yerkes-Dodson law and stress appraisal models of Folkman and Lazarus may explain the plausible positive association.",Indian journal of occupational and environmental medicine,2016 May-Aug,India,2016,10
30293318,[Study on the status of frailty and related determinants among the elderly in China].,"Objective: To investigate the frailty status and related determinants among the elderly in China. Methods: Frailty index (FI) was applied to evaluate the frailty status of the elderly. Data used in this study was from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in 2011-2015. Binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify the determinants related to the status on frailty. Results: The prevalence rates of frailty in the elderly were 18.7%, 20.6% and 28.4% in 2011, 2013 and 2015, respectively. Being female or elderly under advanced age, were both associated with the higher level of FI. Factors as hip fracture, falls, alcohol intake more than once a month, and less participation in social activities etc., might serve as the risk factors for frailty. Conclusion: Chinese elderly showed relatively high prevalence on frailty and with annual increasing trend. The status of frailty was related to factors as adverse events and unhealthy lifestyles. Comprehensive intervention strategies should be adopted in early life of the elderly to delay the development process of frailty.",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,2018 Sep 10,China,2018,10
30714214,Prevalence and determinants of subjective cognitive decline in a representative Greek elderly population.,"OBJECTIVES: We studied the prevalence of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and its determinants in a sample of 1456 cognitively normal Greek adults >/=65 years old. METHODS/DESIGN: Subjects were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team on their neurological, medical, neuropsychological, and lifestyle profile to reach consensus diagnoses. We investigated various types of SCD, including single-question, general memory decline, specific subjective memory decline based on a list of questions and three types of subjective naming, orientation, and calculation decline. RESULTS: In a single general question about memory decline, 28.0% responded positively. The percentage of our sample that reported at least one complaint related to subjective memory decline was 76.6%. Naming difficulties were also fairly common (26.0%), while specific deficits in orientation (5.4%) and calculations/currency handling (2.6%) were rare. The majority (84.2%) of the population reported subjective deficits in at least one cognitive domain. Genetic predisposition to dementia increased the odds for general memory decline by more than 1.7 times. For each one-unit reduction in the neuropsychological composite score (a mean of memory, executive, language, visuospatial, and attention-speed composite scores), the odds for decline in orientation increased by 40.3%. Depression/anxiety and increased cerebrovascular risk were risk factors for almost all SCD types. CONCLUSIONS: SCD regarding memory is more frequent than non-memory decline in the cognitively normal Greek elderly population. Genetic predisposition to dementia, lower cognitive performance, affective symptoms, and increased cerebrovascular risk are associated with prevalent SCD. Further prospective research is needed to improve understanding of the evolution of SCD over time.",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2019 Jun,England,2019,10
30883958,The Economic Value of Education for Longer Lives and Reduced Disability.,"Policy Points Although it is well established that educational attainment improves health and longevity, the economic value of this benefit is unknown. We estimate that the economic value of education for longer, healthier lives is comparable to or greater than the value of education for lifetime earnings. Policies that increase rates of completion of high school and college degrees could result in longer, healthier lives and substantial economic value for the population. We provide a template for assigning an economic value to the health benefits associated with education or other social determinants, allowing policymakers to prioritize those interventions that yield the greatest value for the population. CONTEXT: Policymakers often frame the value of educational attainment in terms of economic outcomes (eg, employment, productivity, wages). But that approach may understate the value of education if it ignores the economic value of both longer lives and the reduced disability associated with more education. METHODS: In this article, we estimated the present value of the longer life and reduced disability associated with higher educational attainment at age 25 through age 84. We used prospective survival data and cross-sectional disability data from the National Health Interview Survey-Linked Mortality Files and drew on published estimates of the economic value of a statistical life. In addition, we used data from the Current Population Survey-Annual Social and Economic supplement to estimate the present value of education for lifetime earnings at age 25 through age 64 in order to provide a benchmark for comparing the value of education for health. FINDINGS: Compared with those with less than a high school degree, the longer lives of those with a high school degree are worth an additional $450,000 for males and $479,000 for females, and the additional disability-adjusted life for those with a high school degree is worth $693,000 for males and $757,000 for females. By comparison, the additional lifetime earnings for those with a high school degree, rather than less than a high school degree, is $213,000 for males and $194,000 for females. Compared with those with a high school degree, the longer lives for those with a baccalaureate degree are worth an additional $446,000 for males and $247,000 for females. The value of the additional disability-adjusted life associated with having a baccalaureate degree rather than a high school degree is $611,000 for males and $407,000 among females. By comparison, the additional lifetime earnings for those with a baccalaureate degree, rather than a high school degree, is $628,000 for males and $459,000 for females. CONCLUSIONS: The value of education for longer, healthier lives may surpass the value for earnings. Estimates of the economic value of the social determinants of health, such as education, can help policymakers prioritize those policies that provide the greatest value for population health.",The Milbank quarterly,2019 Mar,United States,2019,10
29040562,Collider scope: when selection bias can substantially influence observed associations.,"Large-scale cross-sectional and cohort studies have transformed our understanding of the genetic and environmental determinants of health outcomes. However, the representativeness of these samples may be limited-either through selection into studies, or by attrition from studies over time. Here we explore the potential impact of this selection bias on results obtained from these studies, from the perspective that this amounts to conditioning on a collider (i.e. a form of collider bias). Whereas it is acknowledged that selection bias will have a strong effect on representativeness and prevalence estimates, it is often assumed that it should not have a strong impact on estimates of associations. We argue that because selection can induce collider bias (which occurs when two variables independently influence a third variable, and that third variable is conditioned upon), selection can lead to substantially biased estimates of associations. In particular, selection related to phenotypes can bias associations with genetic variants associated with those phenotypes. In simulations, we show that even modest influences on selection into, or attrition from, a study can generate biased and potentially misleading estimates of both phenotypic and genotypic associations. Our results highlight the value of knowing which population your study sample is representative of. If the factors influencing selection and attrition are known, they can be adjusted for. For example, having DNA available on most participants in a birth cohort study offers the possibility of investigating the extent to which polygenic scores predict subsequent participation, which in turn would enable sensitivity analyses of the extent to which bias might distort estimates.",International journal of epidemiology,2018 Feb 1,England,2018,10
29193298,What Aspects of Rural Life Contribute to Rural-Urban Health Disparities in Older Adults? Evidence From a National Survey.,"PURPOSE: Rural-urban health disparities are well-documented and particularly problematic for older adults. However, determining which specific aspects of rural or urban living initiate these disparities remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess associations between place-based characteristics of rural-urban status and health among adults age 65+. METHODS: Data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were geographically linked to place-based characteristics from the American Community Survey. Self-reported health (SRH), obesity, and health checkup within the last year were modeled against rural-urban status (distance to nearest metropolitan area, population size, population density, percent urban, Urban Influence Codes [UIC], Rural-Urban Continuum Codes [RUCC], and Rural-Urban Commuting Area [RUCA]) using generalized linear models, accounting for covariates and complex sampling, overall, and stratified by area-level income. FINDINGS: In general, increasing urbanicity was associated with a reduction in negative SRH for all 7 measures of rural-urban status. For low-income counties, this association held for all measures and characteristics of rural-urban status except population density. However, for high-income counties, the association was reversed-respondents living in areas of increasing urbanicity were more likely to report negative SRH for 4 of the 7 measures (RUCC, UIC, RUCA, and percent urban). Findings were mixed for the outcome of obesity, where rural areas had higher levels, except in low-income counties, where the association between rurality and obesity was reversed (OR 1.033, 95%CI: 1.002-1.064). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that rural-urban status is both a continuum and multidimensional. Distinct elements of rural-urban status may influence health in nuanced ways that require additional exploration in future studies.",The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,2018 Jun,England,2018,10
30312474,Cardiovascular Disease Profile of the Oldest Adults in Rural South Africa: Data from the HAALSI Study (Health and Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of INDEPTH Communities).,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the cardiovascular disease (CVD) profile of individuals aged 80 and older in rural South Africa. DESIGN: First wave of population-based longitudinal cohort. SETTING: Agincourt subdistrict (Mpumalanga Province) in rural South Africa. PARTICIPANTS: Adults residents (N = 5,059). MEASUREMENTS: In-person interviews were conducted to obtain social, behavioral, economic, and clinical data. Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, high waist-to-hip ratio, overweight and obesity, high-risk high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, smoking, stroke, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and heart failure in individuals younger than 65, aged 65 to 79, and aged 80 and older were compared. Associations between self-reported treatments and determinants of hypertension treatment in those aged 80 and older were assessed using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Of 5,059 individuals included, 549 (10.8%) were aged 80 and older, and their CVD prevalence was 17.9% (stroke 3.8%, myocardial infarction 0.5%, angina pectoris 13.5%, heart failure 0.7%). Hypertension prevalence in this group was 73.8%, and along with angina pectoris, it increased with age (p<.001), whereas overweight and obesity (46.4%), dyslipidemia (39.1%), and smoking prevalences (3.1%) decreased (p<.001). Hypertension treatment was significantly associated with being aged 80 and older (odds ratio (OR)=1.48; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.14-1.92, p=.003). Male sex (OR=0.73, 95% CI=0.66-0.88, p=.001), being an immigrant (OR=0.80, 95% CI=0.65-0.98; p=.03), higher socioeconomic status (OR=1.28, 95% CI=1.06-1.53, p=.009), and higher depression score (OR=1.12, 95% CI=1.05-1.19, p<.001) were associated with hypertension treatment in those aged 80 and older. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to characterize the CVD profile of individuals aged 80 and older in sub-Saharan Africa and provides baseline data for comparison with future studies in this rapidly growing age group.

30175986,An intelligent algorithm for assessing patient safety culture and adverse events voluntary reporting using PCA and ANFIS.,"BACKGROUND: Patient safety culture (PSC) as a main component of the organizational culture plays a key role in providing safe, effective and economic cares and services in healthcare organizations. PSC provides a way to assist hospitals in order to improve patient safety and prevent medical errors. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to measure PSC and healthcare professionals' attitude towards voluntary reporting of adverse events in two hospitals in Iran and to develop a hybrid intelligent approach for modeling PSC grades. METHODS: The Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) questionnaire and a two-part questionnaire were used for examining the PSC and healthcare professionals' attitude towards voluntary reporting of adverse events, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to extract of the main components in the HSOPSC questionnaire and to construct 12 dimensions of patient safety culture. The overall grade of patient safety culture was modeled using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) as a classification problem. RESULTS: Almost half of the participants have experienced a medical error and adverse events. The PSC grade was acceptable from the point of view of 55.5% and 50% of participants in hospital No.1 and hospital No.2, respectively. The overall accuracy of ANFIS in modeling overall grades of patient safety culture in both study hospitals was 0.84. Of those individuals gave an acceptable grade on patient safety culture in both study hospitals, more than 50% believed that all medical errors and near misses should be reported. CONCLUSIONS: The ANFIS algorithm was proposed for modeling and predicting of PSC for healthcare organizations. The results confirm the capability of the proposed model to predict patient safety grades in healthcare settings.",The International journal of risk & safety in medicine,2019,Netherlands,2019,10
28877695,Methodological barriers to studying the association between the economic crisis and suicide in Spain.,"BACKGROUND: The hypothetical relationship between economic recession and the increase in suicides in Spain is subject to various arguments. In addition to the inherent complexity of capturing and explaining the underlining mechanisms that could describe this causal link, different points of contention have been be identified. The period of this association and its possible starting points, the socioeconomic determinants that may explain the variation in suicide rate, and the data sources available are the main focus of controversy. The present study aims to identify the phases of association between different periods of economic recession and suicide rates, and compare the effect of different social determinants of health that have been mentioned in previous studies. METHODS: We have used interrupted time series analyses to assess the impact of economic recession on national rates of suicide mortality provided by the Spanish Statistical Office (1980-2014). In an attempt to consider the factors that have affected the study of suicide in Spain, different data sources/periods, predictors, and regions in Spain were analysed. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a positive and significant relationship between the Great Recession and suicide rates during the second period of economic recession (2011-2014), while appeared to decrease during the first recession period. However, the first decreasing trend was not statistically significant in the global analysis of the evolution of monthly suicide rates for the entire country. Both unemployment and per capita GDP were positively related to suicide trends. Finally, the regional analysis demonstrates a similar pattern in different Spanish areas. CONCLUSION: Although previous studies have mentioned the double-dip in the suicide rate associated with the corresponding period of double recession, our study only identify a positive relationship during the second recession period. These results points out that the major impact of economic problems might have had a delayed effect due to initial protection policies.",BMC public health,2017 Sep 6,England,2017,10
28044046,"Contextual and Psychosocial Determinants of Effective Handwashing Technique: Recommendations for Interventions from a Case Study in Harare, Zimbabwe.","Handwashing has been shown to considerably reduce diarrhea morbidity and mortality. To decontaminate hands effectively, the use of running water, soap, and various scrubbing steps are recommended. This study aims to identify the behavioral determinants of effective handwashing. Everyday handwashing technique of 434 primary caregivers in high-density suburbs of Harare, Zimbabwe, was observed and measured as an 8-point sum score of effective handwashing technique. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to predict observed handwashing technique from potential contextual and psychosocial determinants. Knowledge of how to wash hands effectively, availability of a handwashing station with functioning water tap, self-reported frequency of handwashing, perceived vulnerability, and action planning were the main determinants of effective handwashing technique. The models were able to explain 39% and 36% of the variance in overall handwashing technique and thoroughness of handscrubbing. Memory aids and guided practice are proposed to consolidate action knowledge, and personalized risk messages should increase the perceived vulnerability of contracting diarrhea. Planning where, when, and how to maintain a designated place for handwashing with sufficient soap and water is proposed to increase action planning. Since frequent self-reported handwashing was associated with performing more effective handwashing technique, behavior change interventions should target both handwashing frequency and technique concurrently.",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2017 Feb 8,United States,2017,10

Fourteen focus group discussions were conducted with nurses in 2 university hospitals in Egypt. The interviews were tape recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was conducted by 2 independent investigators. The findings highlighted that nurses did not perceive the benefits of hand hygiene, and that they linked the need to wash hands to a sense of dirtiness. Knowledge of hand hygiene and related products was limited and preference for water and soap was obvious. Environmental constraints, lack of role models and social control were identified as barriers for compliance with hand hygiene.

Data were collected by face-to-face interviews on socio-demographic, obstetric, and psychosocial characteristics. Depression symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The List of Threatening Experiences questionnaire (LTE-Q) and the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSS-3) were used to assess stressful events and social support, respectively. Data were entered into Epi-info and analyzed using SPSS-20. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were carried out. RESULTS: The prevalence of antenatal depression was found to be 11.8%. Having debt (OR = 2.79, 95% CI = 1.33, 5.85), unplanned pregnancy (OR = 2.39, 95% CI = (1.20, 4.76), history of stillbirth (OR = 3.97, 95% CI = (1.67,9.41), history of abortion (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.005, 6.61), being in the third trimester of pregnancy (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.07,2.72), presence of a complication in the current pregnancy (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.66,6.53), and previous history of depression (OR = 3.48, 95% CI = 1.71,7.06) were factors significantly associated with antenatal depression. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of antenatal depression was high, especially in the third trimester. Poverty, unmet reproductive health needs, and obstetric complications are the main determinants of antenatal depression. For early detection and appropriate intervention, screening for depression during the routine antenatal care should be promoted.",PloS one,2016,United States,2016,10
29499372,Frailty and health status of older individuals in three European countries: The COURAGE cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Frailty is characterized by several deficits in multiple health related domains. Although cognition is among the important components of frailty, there is lack of evidence on the role of specific neuro-cognitive dimensions. The primary aim of the present work was to evaluate the multidimensional definition of frailty, and to assess whether neuro-cognitive function is a constituent of the frailty syndrome among adults aged >/=50years living in three European countries. As a secondary aim, the construct validity of the created frailty index was tested (with inpatient and outpatient hospitalization), as well as its determinants. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cross-sectional, community-based, nationally-representative survey conducted in Finland, Poland and Spain (n=7987 individuals aged >/=50years). Socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle and social factors were assessed using validated procedures. Cognitive function was assessed with the following tests: learning and short-term memory, working memory and verbal fluency. A frailty index was constructed based on 31 frailty attributes. Principal component analysis was used to identify the components of the frailty index. Logistic and Poisson regression analysis was also conducted. RESULTS: The factor analysis on the components of the index extracted three main dimensions for frailty (disability and daily functioning, cognitive function, chronic health conditions), confirming the multiple dimensions of frailty. Various socio-demographic (e.g., financial status, education level) and lifestyle habits (alcohol consumption) were related with frailty. The presence of frailty was associated with 3.1 times higher odds for inpatient hospitalization (95%CI 2.75 to 3.51). Frailty was also related with higher frequency of outpatient visits. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that frailty is a multidimensional concept with three major dimensions. Neuro-congitive function seems to be a separate dimension of the frailty syndrome. Smoking habits and alcohol intake were positively related with frailty while inpatient and outpatient hospitalization were found to be associated to the level of frailty.",Experimental gerontology,2018 Jun,England,2018,10
25363118,"The impact of reality therapy on metacognition, stress and hope in addicts.","INTRODUCTION: Drug dependence is a major problem in our country and in international level. Reality therapy is an internal control system that determines why and how to choose the options that are set for our lives. This study aimed to investigate the effect of reality therapy on metacognition, stress and decline in hope in drug addicts. MATERIALS & METHODS: This study is quasi-experimental study. Samples were chosen convenient among 60 drug addicts in Jahrom in 2012. Samples were randomly divided into two groups (each group = 30) of intervention and control groups. Control group received usual care and experimental group received reality therapy. RESULTS: Results revealed that there was significant difference between the mean scores of metacognition and hope before and after the intervention of experimental group (p < 0.05). Also, there was statistically significant difference between the two groups from these two variables (p < 0.05).but, Stress level wasn't statistically different in two groups. DISCUSSION: Reality therapy is a method that emphasizes the accountability and the current behavior of individuals. Setting negative emotions, reality therapy promotes metacognition and, through increasing accountability to self-behavior improves hope.",Global journal of health science,2014 Sep 23,Canada,2014,10
21994088,Genetic determinants of aggression and impulsivity in humans.,"Human aggression/impulsivity-related traits have a complex background that is greatly influenced by genetic and non-genetic factors. The relationship between aggression and anxiety is regulated by highly conserved brain regions including amygdala, which controls neural circuits triggering defensive, aggressive, or avoidant behavioral models. The dysfunction of neural circuits responsible for emotional control was shown to represent an etiological factor of violent behavior. In addition to the amygdala, these circuits also involve the anterior cingulated cortex and regions of the prefrontal cortex. Excessive reactivity in the amygdala coupled with inadequate prefrontal regulation serves to increase the likelihood of aggressive behavior. Developmental alterations in prefrontal-subcortical circuitry as well as neuromodulatory and hormonal abnormality appear to play a role. Imbalance in testosterone/serotonin and testosterone/cortisol ratios (e.g., increased testosterone levels and reduced cortisol levels) increases the propensity toward aggression because of reduced activation of the neural circuitry of impulse control and self-regulation. Serotonin facilitates prefrontal inhibition, and thus insufficient serotonergic activity can enhance aggression. Genetic predisposition to aggression appears to be deeply affected by the polymorphic genetic variants of the serotoninergic system that influences serotonin levels in the central and peripheral nervous system, biological effects of this hormone, and rate of serotonin production, synaptic release and degradation. Among these variants, functional polymorphisms in the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) may be of particular importance due to the relationship between these polymorphic variants and anatomical changes in the limbic system of aggressive people. Furthermore, functional variants of MAOA and 5-HTT are capable of mediating the influence of environmental factors on aggression-related traits. In this review, we consider genetic determinants of human aggression, with special emphasis on genes involved in serotonin and dopamine metabolism and function.",Journal of applied genetics,2012 Feb,England,2012,10
30337977,Emotional Processing In Patients with Ischemic Heart Diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the most prevalent public health problem on a worldwide scale, and ischemic heart disease accounts for approximately one-half of these events in high-income countries. One of the most important risk factors for this disease is mental and psychological especially stressful experiences. AIM: This research was established to compare emotional processing, as a key factor in stress appraisal, between IHD patients and people with no cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Using simple sampling, fifty patients were selected from people who diagnosed as IHD in the hospital and referred for treatment after discharging care and treatment. Control group participants were selected as control group peoples, using neighbourhood controls selection. The Emotional Processing Scale was filled by all members of the two groups. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the two groups on the EPS-25 total scores, as well as on emotional processing dimensions of signs of unprocessed emotion, unregulated emotion; avoidance and impoverished. Also, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the dimension of Suppression. The final step of regression revealed a beta of 10.15 and 1.05 for AVO and IEE subscales respectively. CONCLUSION: The result showed that patients with IHD are using more negative emotional processing styles.",Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,2018 Sep 25,North Macedonia,2018,10
27291299,Empowerment in nurse leader groups in middle management: a quantitative comparative investigation.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate structural empowerment in nurse leaders in middle management positions. Objectives were to determine levels of empowerment of nurse leaders and to compare levels of empowerment between nurse leader groups. BACKGROUND: Access to formal and informal power, opportunity, resources, information and support are determinants of structural empowerment. Empowerment of nurse leaders in middle management positions is vital given their roles in enabling nursing teams to deliver high-quality care, benefitting both patient and workforce outcomes. DESIGN: Quantitative component of a mixed methods study using survey principles. METHODS: The Conditions of Work Effectiveness Questionnaire II was distributed to the total population (n = 517) of nurse leaders in an NHS Foundation Trust in England. Nurse leader groups comprised unit leaders (sisters, matrons) and senior staff nurses. Quantitative data entered on spss v 17/18, were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Overall, the unit response rate was 44.1% (n = 228). Levels of total and global empowerment were moderate and moderate to high respectively. Groups did not differ significantly on these parameters or on five elements of total empowerment, but significantly higher scores were found for unit leaders' access to information. Significantly higher scores were found for senior staff nurses on selected aspects of informal power and access to resources, but scores were significantly lower than unit leaders for components of support. CONCLUSIONS: A moderately empowered population of nurse leaders differed in relation to access to information, aspects of support, resources and informal power, reflecting differences in roles, spheres of responsibility, hierarchical position and the constraints on empowerment imposed on unit leaders by financial and resource pressures. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Empowerment of nurse leaders in middle management is vital in enabling nursing teams to deliver high-quality care. Roles, spheres of responsibility, hierarchical position and constraints imposed by financial and resource pressures influence nurse leader empowerment. Administrative support is needed to sustain practice engagement.",Journal of clinical nursing,2017 Jan,England,2017,10
30479558,Geographic Information Science and the Analysis of Place and Health.,"The representation of place is a key theoretical advancement that Geographic Information Science can offer to improve the understanding of environmental determinants of health, but developing robust computational representations of place requires a substantial departure from conventional notions of geographic representation in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Unlike conventional GIS representations based on either objects or locations, we suggest place representation should incorporate dynamic subjective, experiential, and relational aspects of place, as the influence of place on health behavior concerns not only the features that can be objectively observed at a particular location but also the environmental perceptions of the individual, as molded by biological, social, and experiential characteristics. In addition, assessments of environmental exposures on health outcomes should focus on individuals' time-activity patterns and microenvironment profiles, which form a potentially unique personalized exposure environment for each individual. Addressing these representational challenges via collaborative research has the potential to advance both Geographic Information Science and health research.",Transactions in GIS : TG,2018 Jun,England,2018,10
21819576,Complex problems require complex solutions: the utility of social quality theory for addressing the Social Determinants of Health.,"BACKGROUND: In order to improve the health of the most vulnerable groups in society, the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) called for multi-sectoral action, which requires research and policy on the multiple and inter-linking factors shaping health outcomes. Most conceptual tools available to researchers tend to focus on singular and specific social determinants of health (SDH) (e.g. social capital, empowerment, social inclusion). However, a new and innovative conceptual framework, known as social quality theory, facilitates a more complex and complete understanding of the SDH, with its focus on four domains: social cohesion, social inclusion, social empowerment and socioeconomic security, all within the same conceptual framework. This paper provides both an overview of social quality theory in addition to findings from a national survey of social quality in Australia, as a means of demonstrating the operationalisation of the theory. METHODS: Data were collected using a national random postal survey of 1044 respondents in September, 2009. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that people on lower incomes (less than $45000) experience worse social quality across all of the four domains: lower socio-economic security, lower levels of membership of organisations (lower social cohesion), higher levels of discrimination and less political action (lower social inclusion) and lower social empowerment. The findings were mixed in terms of age, with people over 65 years experiencing lower socio-economic security, but having higher levels of social cohesion, experiencing lower levels of discrimination (higher social inclusion) and engaging in more political action (higher social empowerment). In terms of gender, women had higher social cohesion than men, although also experienced more discrimination (lower social inclusion). CONCLUSIONS: Applying social quality theory allows researchers and policy makers to measure and respond to the multiple sources of oppression and advantage experienced by certain population groups, and to monitor the effectiveness of interventions over time.",BMC public health,2011 Aug 5,England,2011,10
31728559,Relative importance of perceived physical and social neighborhood characteristics for depression: a machine learning approach.,"PURPOSE: The physical and social neighborhood environments are increasingly recognized as determinants for depression. There is little evidence on combined effects of multiple neighborhood characteristics and their importance. Our aim was (1) to examine associations between depression severity and multiple perceived neighborhood environments; and (2) to assess their relative importance. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were drawn from a population-representative sample (N = 9435) from the Netherlands. Depression severity was screened with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and neighborhood perceptions were surveyed. Supervised machine learning models were employed to assess depression severity-perceived neighborhood environment associations. RESULTS: We found indications that neighborhood social cohesion, pleasantness, and safety inversely correlate with PHQ-9 scores, while increasing perceived distance to green space and traffic were correlated positively. Perceived distance to blue space and urbanicity seemed uncorrelated. Young adults, low-income earners, low-educated, unemployed, and divorced persons were more likely to have higher PHQ-9 scores. Neighborhood characteristics appeared to be less important than personal attributes (e.g., age, marital and employment status). Results were robust across different ML models. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the perceived social environment plays, independent of socio-demographics, a role in depression severity. Contrasted with person-level and social neighborhood characteristics, the prominence of the physical neighborhood environment should not be overstated.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2019 Nov 14,Germany,2019,10
20153135,"[Elderly people, precariousness, social handicap and length of stay: pilot study at the Lariboisiere-Fernand Widal Hospital Group in Paris].","OBJECTIVES: To administer a social handicap questionnaire associated with French DRGs (PMSI) to determine the social handicaps of a population hospitalized in a public health establishment and to measure the cost implications for the establishment due to increased length of stay (DMS). METHOD: A prospective pilot study has been carried out in the Lariboisiere-Fernand Widal Hospital Group in Paris targeting users 50 or more years old hospitalized for short stays in medicine, surgery and obstetrics. Data of the PMSI and answers to the questionnaire for hospitalisations longer than 24 hours have been exploited. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two stays from 8 to 23 November 2005 have been analyzed: 140 pertained to patients aged 50-69 years (27.8%) and 82 to patients aged 70 or more years (16.3%). Three-fourths of the persons aged 50-69 and 70 or over presented a social handicap: 45% showed a strong handicap and a third an average handicap. The three indicators ""renter/owner"", ""interior comfort"" and ""family relations"" were the major determinants of social handicap for those aged 70 or more, 50-69 and 50 or more years. For the patients 70 years and over and those 50-69 years, with an average handicap, the indicator was ""income"" with the domain ""patrimony."" For strong handicaps, it was the indicator ""scolarisation"" for the 70 or more years and the indicator ""income"" for the 50-69 years old. When all classes and populations were pooled, the DMS was significantly lower than that of the ENC (p<0.001 for the 70 years and over; p<0.05 for the 50-69 years). With again all classes and populations pooled, patients 70 and over stayed in hospital 6.50 days less on average compared to data published by the ENC; those 50-69 years stayed 3.57 days less. Persons aged 50 and over with a social handicap remained hospitalized on average more than 2.5 days: 2.2 days for the 70 and over and 3.1 days for the 50-69 years group. In terms of hospital days that produces an increase of 18%, corresponding to a supplementary expenditure attributable to social handicap of approximately 5.9 million euros. CONCLUSION: This pilot study with a questionnaire disability social PMSI proposing specific aid, but also reducing the DMS, provides several promising information but also indicates the limits of our approach. Among these, we note in particular: (a) its regular feasibility requires constant supervision, wider and well-trained, (b) that the measurement of our tool can only be affirmed after its use in many patients, and (c) the classification of disability in social class could even be discussed again. We still wanted to explore whether through this initiative without much logistical, markers of interest had emerged, which seems to be the case.","Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",2010 Apr,France,2010,10

Diabetes is a chronic disease associated with micro- and macro-vascular complications and deterioration in general health status. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate general health status among Iranian diabetic patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis of study utilizing the Short-Form-36 questionnaire. METHODS: Searching the EMBASE, PubMed, ISI/Web of Sciences (WOS), MEDLINE via Ovid, PsycoINFO, as well as Iranian databases (MagIran, Iranmedex, and SID) from January 2000 to December 2017. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the ""A Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool: for Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions"" (ACROBAT-NRSI). Random-effect model was used and the means were reported with their 95% confidence interval (CI). To evaluate the heterogeneity between studies, I(2) test was used. Egger's regression test was used to assess the publication bias. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were retained in the final analysis. The mean general health status using SF-36 in diabetic patients of Iran was 51.9 (95% CI: 48.64 to 53.54). The mean physical component summary was 52.92 [95% CI: 49.46-56.38], while the mean mental component summary was 51.02 [95% CI: 46.87-55.16]. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study showed that general health status in Iranian diabetic patients is low.

30325359,Psychometric Properties of Persian Version of the Short-Form Workplace Social Capital Questionnaire for Female Health Workers.,"BACKGROUND: The workplace social capital is one of the important features of clinical work environment that improves the productivity and quality of services and safety through trust and social participation. Evaluation of workplace social capital requires a valid and reliable scale. The short-form workplace social capital questionnaire developed by Kouvonen has long been used to evaluate the workplace social capital. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the questionnaire among a group of female Iranian health care workers. METHODS: The Persian version of the short-form questionnaire of workplace social capital was finalized after translation and back-translation. 500 female health care workers completed the questionnaire. Then, the content validity and the construct validity of the questionnaire were assessed. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed by Cronbach's alpha, theta, and McDonald's Omega. The construct reliability and ICC were also evaluated. RESULTS: Based on the maximum likelihood exploratory factor analysis (n=250) and confirmatory factor analysis (n=250), two factors were identified. The factors could explain 65% of the total variance observed. The model had an acceptable fit: GFI=0.953, CFI=0.973, IFI=0.974, NFI=0.953, PNFI=0.522, RAMSEA=0.090, CMIN/DF=2.751, RMR=0.042. Convergent and divergent validity as well as internal consistency and construct reliability of the questionnaire were confirmed. CONCLUSION: The Persian version of Kouvonen workplace social capital has acceptable validity and reliability. The questionnaire can thus be used in future studies to assess the workplace social capital in Iranian health care workers.",The international journal of occupational and environmental medicine,2018 Oct,Iran,2018,10
20643315,Childhood and adolescent anxiety and depression: beyond heritability.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the methodology of behavior genetics studies addressing research questions that go beyond simple heritability estimation and illustrate these using representative research on childhood and adolescent anxiety and depression. METHOD: The classic twin design and its extensions may be used to examine age and gender differences in the genetic determinants of complex traits and disorders, the role of genetic factors in explaining comorbidity, the interaction of genes and the environment, and the effect of social interaction among family members. An overview of the methods typically employed to address such questions is illustrated by a review of 34 recent studies on childhood anxiety and depression. RESULTS: The review provides relatively consistent evidence for small to negligible sex differences in the genetic etiology of childhood anxiety and depression, a substantial role of genetic factors in accounting for the temporal stability of these disorders, a partly genetic basis of the comorbidity between anxiety and depression, a possible role of the interaction between genotype and the environment in affecting liability to these disorders, a role of genotype-environment correlation, and a minor, if any, etiological role of sibling interaction. CONCLUSION: The results clearly demonstrate a role for genetic factors in the etiology and temporal stability of individual differences in childhood anxiety and depression. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,2010 Aug,United States,2010,10
29017564,Factors influencing risky sexual behaviour among Mozambican miners: a socio-epidemiological contribution for HIV prevention framework in Mozambique.,"BACKGROUND: Information dealing with social and behavioural risk factors as well as their mechanisms among Mozambican migrants working in South African mines remains undocumented. This study aims to understand the various factors influencing HIV-related risk behaviours and the resulting HIV positive status of Mozambican miners employed by South African mines. This analysis was undertaken in order to inform a broader and more effective HIV preventive framework in Mozambique. METHOD: This study relied upon data sourced from the first Integrated Biological and Behavioural Survey among Mozambican miners earning their living in South African mines. It employs quantitative techniques using standard statistical tools to substantiate the laid-down objectives. The primary technique applied in this paper is the multivariable statistical method used in the formulation and application of a proximate determinants framework. RESULTS: The odds of reporting one sexual partner were roughly three times higher for miners working as perforators as opposed to other types of occupation. As well, the odds of condom use - always or sometimes - for miners in the 31-40 age group were three times higher than the odds of condom use in the 51+ age group. Miners with lower education levels were less likely to use condoms. The odds of being HIV positive when the miner reports use of alcohol or drugs (sometimes/always) is 0.32 times lower than the odds for those reporting never use of alcohol or drugs. And finally, the odds of HIV positive status for those using condoms were 2.16 times that of miners who never used condoms, controlling for biological and other proximate determinants. CONCLUSION: In Mozambique, behavioural theory emphasising personal behavioural changes is the main strategy to combat HIV among miners. Our findings suggest there is a need to change thinking processes about how to influence safer sexual behaviour. This is viewed to be the result of a person's individual decision, due to of the complexity of social and contextual factors that may also influence sexual behaviours. This only stresses the need for HIV prevention strategies to exclusively transcend individual factors while considering the broader social and contextual phenomena influencing HIV risk among Mozambican miners.",International journal for equity in health,2017 Oct 10,England,2017,10
29963833,"Addiction disorders: a need for change. Proposal for a new management. Position paper of SIA, Italian Society on Alcohol.","Various epidemiological and biological evaluations and the recent publication of the DSM-V (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders) has imposed on the scientific community a period of reflection on the diagnosis and treatment of what in the DSM-IV was defined as ""addiction"". To date, the term ""addiction"" has been replaced by the DSM-5, because there is no global scientific consensus that has unequivocally characterized its clinical characteristics. This, we will talk about substance/alcohol use disorders (SUDs/AUDs) and disorders related to behavioral alterations (DBA) that can generate organic diseases, mental disorders, and social problems. In the first psychotic episode 40-70% of subjects meet the criteria of a SUDs/AUDs, excluding tobacco dependence. Substances can not only be the cause of a psychotic onset, but they can also disrupt a psychotic picture or interfere with drug therapy. The pharmacodynamic profiles of many substances are able to provoke the phenomenology of the main psychotic symptoms in a way that can be superimposed onto those presented by psychotic subjects without a history of SUDs/AUDs. The Department of Addictions (DAs) must not be absorbed by or incorporated into the Departments of Mental Health (DMH), with which, however, precise operational cooperation protocols will have to be defined and maintained, but it will have to maintain its own autonomy and independent connotation. Addiction Medicine is a discipline that brings together elements of public health, prevention, internal medicine, clinical pharmacology, neurology, and even psychiatry. The inclusion of the DAs in those of DMH refers purely to a problem of pathology that has to do with lifestyle, choices, and behaviors. These, over time, show their dysfunctionality and only then do related problems emerge. Moreover, epidemiological, social, and clinical motivations impose the creation of alcohological teams dedicated to alcohol-related activities. The collaboration with self-help-groups (SHGs) is mandatory. The action of SHGs is accredited in numerous international recommendations both on the basis of consensus and evidence in the literature.",Minerva medica,2018 Oct,Italy,2018,10
21994843,Evidence-based approaches to remedy and also to prevent abuse of community-dwelling older persons.,"Elder abuse is a global issue, with an estimated 4-10% of older persons in Canada abused each year. Although Canadian legislation has been created to prevent and punish the abuse of older persons living in nursing homes and other care facilities, community-dwelling older persons are at greater risk of abuse. This paper highlights the importance of evidence-based actions targeted at three determinants of health: (a) personal health practices and coping skills, (b) social support networks, and (c) social environments. Two research studies are profiled as case studies that illustrate the ready possibility and value of two specific types of actions on community-based older-person abuse. This paper argues for the immediate and widespread adoption of these evidence-based measures and for additional empirical evidence to guide the correction of underreporting of abuse, raise awareness of its serious nature, and increase options to not only stop it but ultimately prevent it.",Nursing research and practice,2011,Egypt,2011,10
25237135,"Health insurance and accessibility to health services among Roma in settlements in Belgrade, Serbia--the journey from data to policy making.","The Serbian constitution and health-related laws assert that citizens and residents are universally entitled to health care, provided that they hold health insurance. However, until 2010, persons who did not hold a national identification number (ID) were required to present a plethora of documents to be granted one. We assessed the relationship between citizenship, residency and possession of health insurance cards, together with utilization of health services, among Roma residing in disadvantaged settlements in Belgrade. The Roma Health and Nutrition Survey was conducted in 2009 to assess the social determinants of health among Roma. Data were analysed, using logistic regression, to examine health insurance status and utilization of services by citizenship and residency. Eighty-nine per cent of respondents said they were Serbian citizens. Approximately 11% were refugees, 7% internally displaced persons (IDPs) and remainder domicile. Multivariate analysis revealed that non-citizens were more likely to lack health insurance [odds ratio (OR) = 9.2, confidence interval (CI) (3.5, 24.1)], as were refugees and IDPs [OR = 3.1, CI (1.4, 6.9), OR = 4.0, CI (1.4, 11.5), respectively]. Having health insurance was a positive predictor for being seen by a physician [OR = 2.3, CI (1.3, 4.2), OR = 2.3, CI (1.3, 3.9)]. Data from this survey indicated that non-citizen Roma had limited access to health services. These findings led the Serbian Ministry of Health and National Health Insurance Fund to reduce the administrative and legislative hurdles in obtaining health insurance, to ensure the Roma rights to health care. This demonstration of data-driven policies on Roma health could serve as a model for other countries.",Health policy and planning,2015 Oct,England,2015,10

31287852,"Exploring households' resilience to climate change-induced shocks using Climate Resilience Index in Dinki watershed, central highlands of Ethiopia.","This study assessed households' resilience to climate change-induced shocks in Dinki watershed, northcentral highlands of Ethiopia. The data were collected through a cross-sectional survey conducted on 288 households, three focus group discussions, and 15 key informant interviews. The Climate Resilience Index (CRI) based on the three resilience capacities (absorptive, adaptive and transformative) frame was used to measure households' resilience to climate change-induced shocks on an agro-ecological unit of analysis. A principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression analysis were used to identify determinant factors and indicators to households' resilience, respectively. Findings indicate that the indexed scores of major components clearly differentiated the study communities in terms of their agro-ecological zones. Specifically, the absorptive capacity (0.495) was the leading contributing factor to resilience followed by adaptive (0.449) and transformative (0.387) capacities. Likewise, the Midland was relatively more resilient with a mean index value of 0.461. Both the PCA and multiple regression analysis indicated that access to and use of livelihood resources, such as farmlands and livestock holdings, diversity of income sources, infrastructure and social capital were determinants of households' resilience. In general, it might be due to their exposure to recurrent shocks coupled with limited adaptive capacities including underdeveloped public services, poor livelihood diversification practices, among others, the study communities showed minimal resilience capacity with a mean score of 0.44. Thus, in addition to short-term buffering strategies, intervention priority focusing on both adaptive and transformative capacities, particularly focusing on most vulnerable localities and constrained livelihood strategies, would contribute to ensuring long-term resilience in the study communities.",PloS one,2019,United States,2019,10
28252377,Understanding perceptions of community participation in persons with severe mental illness: A mixed-methods approach.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to measure community participation in persons with severe mental illness (SMI) in Toronto, Ontario and outlines a methodological approach for understanding the dimensions of community participation. METHODS: A mixed methods approach was used to define activity spaces through participatory mapping and a qualitative survey interview for participants (N = 31), selected through a stratified purposeful sampling strategy. Five neighbourhoods in Toronto were sampled in an attempt to obtain an ethnically diverse sample. Participants were interviewed over the study period and asked to draw maps indicating places that constituted their community. A qualitative interview was also administered to understand participants' perceptions of their communities. Point locations from the mapping exercise were used to measure and construct activity spaces using a mean circle approach; outlying locations were simultaneously recorded. Observed spatial patterns were then analyzed alongside the findings of the qualitative interviews. RESULTS: There were no observed relationships between the number of locations reported by participants and the resultant activity space or outlier count. There were no quantitative relationships between activity space size and perceptions of community by participants. However, qualitative data revealed that a number of underlying factors (mental health status and associated stigma; relationships with friends and family; cultural background; income; and neighbourhood safety) influenced participants' activity spaces. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the ways that community participation is influenced by an interplay of determinants, all of which have implications for service delivery and population-level interventions. They also point to the importance of mixed methods approaches in spatial analysis.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2017 Mar 1,Switzerland,2017,10
25563356,A systematic review and meta-analysis of mobile devices and weight loss with an intervention content analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Overweight and obesity constitute leading global public health challenges. Tackling overweight and obesity by influencing human behaviour is a complex task, requiring novel emerging health psychology interventions. The aims of this review will be to determine whether mobile devices induce weight loss and improvements in diet and physical activity levels when compared with standard controls without a weight loss intervention or controls allocated to non-mobile device weight loss interventions. METHODS: A systematic review on mobile devices and weight loss was conducted. The inclusion criteria were all randomized controlled trials with baseline and post-intervention weight measures in adult subjects >18 years of age without pre-specified co-morbidities. Mobile device specifications included modern, portable devices in the form of smartphones, PDAs, iPods, and Mp3 players. Cohen's d for standardized differences in mean weight loss was calculated. A random effects meta-analysis was generated using Comprehensive meta-analysis software. Theories and intervention content were coded and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies were identified, of which 12 were primary trials and 5 were secondary analyses. The meta-analysis generated a medium significant effect size of 0.430 (95% CI 0.252-0.609) (p-value </= 0.01), favouring mobile interventions. Throughout the systematic review, mobile devices were found to induce weight loss relative to baseline weight. When comparing them with standard no intervention controls as well as controls receiving non-mobile weight loss interventions, results favoured mobile devices for weight loss. Reductions in Body mass index, waist circumference, and percentage body fat were also found in the review. Improvements in the determinants of weight loss in the form of improved dietary intake and physical activity levels were also found. Theory appears to largely inform intervention design, with the most common theories being Social Cognitive Theory, Elaboration Likelihood Theory, Control Theory, and Goal Theory. The use of behavioural change techniques was widespread across the studies, with a minimum of five per intervention. CONCLUSION: Mobile devices appear to induce positive changes in the behavioural determinants of weight and subsequently are associated with weight loss. Mobile device interventions are heavily informed by theory and behaviour change techniques. The use of theory appears to effectively enhance levels of constructs targeted by interventions.",Journal of personalized medicine,2014 Jun 30,Switzerland,2014,10
28823119,Determinants of health-related quality of life in Iranian adults: evidence from a cross-sectional study.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to measure the level and determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adults in Kermanshah, a city in the western region of Iran. METHODS: Convenience sampling was employed to obtain a sample of 998 adults aged 18 years and older (646 males and 352 females) in the city of Kermanshah. A 2-part self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data over the period between March 1 and May 30, 2017. The first part was designed to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle factors (10 items). The second part consisted of the EuroQoL 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) EuroQoL-3-level and the EuroQoL visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) questions. A multiple linear regression model was used to determine the factors associated with the EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS score among study participants. RESULTS: The mean values for the EQ-5D index and the EQ-VAS score were 0.74 (standard deviation [SD], 0.19) and 80.9 (SD, 16.5), respectively. The highest percentage of self-reported problems ('some' and 'severe' problems) across the 5 dimensions of the EQ-5D index were associated with the dimensions of anxiety/depression (35.3%) and pain/discomfort (32.9%). The percentage of self-reported problems for the dimensions of usual activities, mobility, and self-care were 19.0, 12.8, and 8.9%, respectively. Our regression analyses indicated that there were statistically significant positive associations between being physically active, monthly household income per capita, and post-secondary education and the EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS score. In contrast, negative associations were found between older age, being married, having a chronic disease, and smoking and the EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS score. A negative association was also found between being uninsured and the EQ-5D index. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that interventions aiming to improve physical activity, to prevent chronic diseases, and to reduce the smoking rate among adults living in the city of Kermanshah may improve their HRQoL.",Epidemiology and health,2017,Korea (South),2017,10
23819138,Health impact assessments.,"Health Impact Assessment (HIA) serves as a tool for policymakers and planners when considering a new policy, project, or plan that will influence the health of people outside of the doctor's office. HIA is a series of steps that can be used to determine how a proposed plan, policy, or project may affect any number of social or environmental conditions, and ultimately health. HIA does not evaluate whether a project or plan should or should not be implemented, but rather serves to inform policymakers and planners on how to make a proposed plan, policy or project more likely to promote health and avoid potentially negative health outcomes. In this article, we present the steps, considerations needed to perform an HIA and illustrations of HIAs that have been done.",Rhode Island medical journal (2013),2013 Jul 1,United States,2013,10
24991697,FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION BY ECOLOGICAL ZONE AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS IN GHANA.,"The disease burden in both developed and developing countries is moving towards higher proportions of chronic diseases, and diseases such as cancers are now considered to be of public health concern. In sub-Saharan Africa, healthy behaviours such as fruit and vegetable consumption are recommended to reduce the chances of onset of chronic diseases. This paper examines the determinants of fruit and vegetable consumption in Ghana with particular emphasis on consumption by ecological zone. Data were from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (n=4916 females; n=4568 males). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using basic descriptive and Poisson regression. The main independent variable was ecological zone and the dependent variables were levels of fruit and vegetable consumption. The mean number of fruits and vegetables consumed in a week was higher among females (fruits: 7.5, 95% CI=7.3-7.7; vegetables: 8.1, 95% CI=7.8-8.3) than males (fruits: 6.2, 95% CI=6.0-6.4; vegetables: 7.9, 95% CI=7.7-8.2). There were significant differences in consumption by ecological zone. Respondents in the Savannah zone consumed less fruit than those in the Coastal and Forest zones, but the differences in fruit and vegetable consumption between the Coastal and Savannah zones were not consistent, especially for vegetable consumption. The findings suggest that one of the key interventions to improve fruit and vegetable consumption could lie in improving distribution systems since their consumption is significantly higher in the Forest zone, where the production of fruit and vegetables is more developed than in the Savannah and Coastal zones. The findings relating to household wealth challenge conventional knowledge on fruit and vegetable consumption, and rather argue for equal consideration of spatial differences in critical health outcomes.",Journal of biosocial science,2015 Sep,England,2015,10
28701166,Which early life events or current environmental and lifestyle factors influence lung function in adolescents? - results from the GINIplus & LISAplus studies.,"BACKGROUND: Various factors may affect lung function at different stages in life. Since investigations that simultaneously consider several factors are rare, we examined the relative importance of early life, current environmental/lifestyle factors and allergic diseases on lung function in 15-year-olds. METHODS: Best subset selection was performed for linear regression models to investigate associations between 21 diverse early life events and current factors with spirometric parameters (forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s and maximal mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75)) in 1326 participants of the German GINIplus and LISAplus birth cohorts. To reduce model complexity, one model for each spirometric parameter was replicated 1000 times in random subpopulations (N = 884). Only those factors that were included in >70% of the replication models were retained in the final analysis. RESULTS: A higher peak weight velocity and early lung infections were the early life events prevalently associated with airflow limitation and FEF25-75. Current environmental/lifestyle factors at age 15 years and allergic diseases that were associated with lung function were: indoor second-hand smoke exposure, vitamin D concentration, body mass index (BMI) and asthma status. Sex and height captured the majority of the explained variance (>75%), followed by BMI (</=23.7%). The variance explained by early life events was comparatively low (median: 4.8%; range: 0.2-22.4%), but these events were consistently negatively associated with airway function. CONCLUSIONS: Although the explained variance was mainly captured by well-known factors included in lung function prediction equations, our findings indicate early life and current factors that should be considered in studies on lung health among adolescents.",Respiratory research,2017 Jul 12,England,2017,10
23312793,Seasonal and locational variations in children's play: implications for wellbeing.,"Physical activity, through independent outdoor play, has come to the fore as a way to improve children's health through it fostering healthy mental and social as well as physiological development. However, in many high-income countries children's autonomous play opportunities have diminished due to urban intensification and declining parental license. Regardless of this trend, children's play varies across countries, cities, cultures and seasons. This paper offers new insights into the complexities of play as a vital aspect of children's wellbeing. Within the context of New Zealand - whose citizens generally regard themselves as outdoor people - this paper explores why 'play' might resonate differently across localities and seasons. We contrast the play affordances provided by Auckland's central city (dominated by apartment living) with Beach Haven, a suburban area. We employed a multi-method approach and included 20 children and their parents who were recruited through school and summer holiday programs embracing different gender and ethnicities to reflect the general cultural mix of the respective neighbourhoods. We advance two arguments. First, we suggest that the rarity of children playing outdoors unsupervised normalises supervised indoor play and reduces children's opportunities to see outdoor play as an alternative to interior or supervised pastimes. Second, we follow Bourdieu's theory of practice to argue that the regard parents and children have towards outdoor play reflects locally constituted beliefs about what is seasonally 'appropriate' children's activity. We found that extra-curricular activities and supervised excursions are undertaken in the central city all year around and only vary between social groups by the type of destination. In the suburb, independent outdoor play in summer represents children's main business after school in ways that enhance their environmental literacy and potential future health gain. For others these symbolic values were replaced by safety concerns. In contrast, it seems that even in a relatively mild climate winter is the time to relax and stay indoors unless children have an outdoor habitus. We find that the determinants of seasonal outdoor play transcend modifiable barriers such as traffic and unsuitable play spaces as well as the inevitable issue of inclement weather.",Social science & medicine (1982),2013 Aug,England,2013,10
23192377,Rural and urban married Asian immigrants in Taiwan: determinants of their physical and mental health.,"Different geographical areas with unique social cultures or societies might influence immigrant health. This study examines whether health inequities and different social factors exist regarding the health of rural and urban married Asian immigrants. A survey was conducted on 419 rural and 582 urban married Asian immigrants in Taiwan in 2009. Whereas the descriptive results indicate a worse mental health status between rural and urban married Asian immigrants, rural married immigrants were as mentally healthy as urban ones when considering different social variables. An analysis of regional stratification found different social-determinant patterns on rural and urban married immigrants. Whereas social support is key for rural immigrant physical and mental health, acculturation (i.e., language proficiency), socioeconomics (i.e., working status), and family structure (the number of family members and children living in the family) are key to the mental health of urban married immigrants in addition to social support. This study verifies the key roles of social determinants on the subjective health of married Asian immigrants. Area-differential patterns on immigrant health might act as a reference for national authorities to (re)focus their attention toward more area-specific approaches for married Asian immigrants.",Journal of immigrant and minority health,2013 Dec,United States,2013,10
30168879,Inactive lifestyles in peri-urban Australia: A qualitative examination of social and physical environmental determinants.,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: Australians living in peri-urban areas are insufficiently active, sedentary and experience poorer health than people in major cities. There are health benefits attributable to active lifestyles that could contribute to the improved health and well-being of this population. To support the adoption of active lifestyles, it is important to understand the unique context in which behaviour occurs. METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify characteristics of the social and physical peri-urban environment that may impact active lifestyles. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in peri-urban southern Queensland. Data were analysed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: The natural environment, weather, distance, accessibility and walkability were features of the physical environment relevant to active lifestyles. Social factors included social capital and crime. Activity-supportive characteristics (eg, community spirit) were identified, in addition to active lifestyle barriers (eg, lack of public transport). CONCLUSIONS: Despite activity-supportive social and environmental characteristics, most participants reported inactive lifestyles. The barriers to active lifestyles in peri-urban environments may negate these activity-supportive features. Some barriers are difficult to modify (eg, distance and accessibility). However, some may be alleviated through the adoption of activity-supportive policy and urban design (eg, pedestrian mobility infrastructure). SO WHAT?: Strategies to support active lifestyles in peri-urban environments must take into account unmodifiable contextual barriers, whilst encouraging utilisation of existing activity-supportive infrastructure and resources. The enhancement of activity-supportive environments through improved neighbourhood walkability and the usability of public transport may encourage some peri-urban residents to undertake more active forms of transport and recreational physical activity.",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2019 Apr,Australia,2019,10
30788293,Weaknesses in the Reporting of Cross-sectional Studies in Accordance with the STROBE Report (The Case of Congenital Anomaly among Infants in Iran): A Review Article.,"Background: The inadequate reporting of cross-sectional studies, as in the case of the prevalence of Congenital Anomaly, could cause challenges in the synthesis of new evidence and make possible mistakes in the creation of public policies. This study was conducted to critically appraise the quality of the articles involving congenital anomaly prevalence in Iranian infants with the STROBE recommendations. Methods: We performed a thorough literature search using the words ""congenital anomaly"" ""birth defect"" and ""Iran"" in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, SID, Elmnet, Magiran, IranDoc, Iranmedex, and Google Scholar until Aug 2017. In this critical appraisal we focused on cross-sectional studies that reported the prevalence of congenital anomaly in Iranian infants. Data were analyzed using the STROBE score per item and recommendation. Results: The results of 17 selected articles on Congenital Anomaly prevalence showed that the overall accordance of the cross-sectional study reports with STROBE recommendations was about 63%. All articles met the recommendations associated with the report of the study's rationale, objectives, setting, key results and provision of summary measures. Methods and results were the weakest part of the articles, in which recommendations associated with the participant flowchart and missing data analysis were not reported. The recommendations with the lowest scores were those related to the sensitivity analysis (6%, n=1/17), bias (6%, n=1/17), and funding (41%, n=7/17). Conclusion: Cross-sectional studies about the prevalence of congenital anomaly in Iranian infants have an insufficient reporting on the methods and results parts. We recognized a clear need to increase the quality of such studies.",Iranian journal of public health,2018 Dec,Iran,2018,10
27840344,Oxidative Stress Biomarkers in Exhaled Breath of Workers Exposed to Crystalline Silica Dust by SPME-GC-MS.,"BACKGROUND: Silicosis is considered an oxidative stress related disease that can lead to the development of lung cancer. In this study, our purpose was to analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath of workers exposed to silica containing dust and compare peak area of these compounds with silicosis patients and healthy volunteers (smokers and nonsmokers) groups. METHODS: In this cross sectional case-control study, the exhaled breath of 69 subjects including workers exposed to silica (n=20), silicosis patient (n=4), healthy non-smoker (n=20) and healthy smoker (n=25) were analyzed. We collected breath samples using 3-liter Tedlar bags. The VOCs were extracted with solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Personal exposure intensity was measured according to NIOSH 7601 method. Respiratory parameters were measured using spirometry. RESULTS: Seventy percent and 100% of the exposures to crystalline silica dust exceeded from 8 h TWA ACGIH TLVs in case and positive control groups, respectively. A significant negative correlation was found between dust exposure intensity and FEV1/FVC when exposure and positive control groups were studied in a group (r2=-0.601, P<0.001). Totally, forty VOCs were found in all exhaled breath samples. Among the VOCs, the mean of peak area acetaldehyde, hexanal, nonanal, decane, pentad cane, 2-propanol and 3-hydroxy-2-butanone were higher in exhaled breath of the workers exposed to silica and silicosis patient compared to the healthy smoker and nonsmoker controls. In some cases the difference was significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of some VOCs in exhaled breath of subjects is appropriate biomarker to determine of exposure to silica.",Journal of research in health sciences,2016 Summer,Iran,2016,10
29921260,"Underlying determinants of health provider choice in urban slums: results from a discrete choice experiment in Ahmedabad, India.","BACKGROUND: Severe underutilization of healthcare facilities and lack of timely, affordable and effective access to healthcare services in resource-constrained, bottom of pyramid (BoP) settings are well-known issues, which foster a negative cycle of poor health outcomes, catastrophic health expenditures and poverty. Understanding BoP patients' healthcare choices is vital to inform policymakers' effective resource allocation and improve population health and livelihood in these areas. This paper examines the factors affecting the choice of health care provider in low-income settings, specifically the urban slums in India. METHOD: A discrete choice experiment was carried out to elicit stated preferences of BoP populations. A total of 100 respondents were sampled using a multi-stage systemic random sampling of urban slums. Attributes were selected based on previous studies in developing countries, findings of a previous exploratory study in the study setting and qualitative interviews. Provider type and cost, distance to the facility, attitude of doctor and staff, appropriateness of care and familiarity with doctor were the attributes included in the study. A random effects logit regression was used to perform the analysis. Interaction effects were included to control for individual characteristics. RESULTS: The relatively most valued attribute is appropriateness of care (beta=3.4213, p = 0.00), followed by familiarity with the doctor (beta=2.8497, p = 0.00) and attitude of the doctor and staff towards the patient (beta=1.8132, p = 0.00). As expected, respondents prefer shorter distance (beta= - 0.0722, p = 0.00) but the relatively low importance of the attribute distance to the facility indicate that respondents are willing to travel longer if any of the other statistically significant attributes are present. Also, significant socioeconomic differences in preferences were observed, especially with regard to the type of provider. CONCLUSION: The analyses did not reveal universal preferences for a provider type, but overall the traditional provider type is not well accepted. It also became evident that respondents valued appropriateness of care above other attributes. Despite the study limitations, the results have broader policy implications in the context of Indian government's attempts to reduce high healthcare out-of-pocket expenditures and provide universal health coverage for its population. The government's attempt to emphasize the focus on traditional providers should be carefully reconsidered.",BMC health services research,2018 Jun 19,England,2018,10
32002439,Comparison of the effect of standardized patient-based training with team-based learning on the knowledge of midwifery students in providing services to victims of rape.,"BACKGROUND: Rape is a widespread and important issue in the field of public health, and its victims require comprehensive and gender-sensitive health services. Healthcare providers, especially midwives, play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of rape, and improving their knowledge has been an essential factor in enhancing the quality of service provided. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to compare the impact of standardized patient-based training and team-based learning on midwifery students' knowledge for providing services to rape victims. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized quasiexperimental study, 75 midwifery students of Mashhad School of Nursing and Midwifery were selected using available sampling method and were assigned to two groups of standardized patient-based training (n = 38) and team-based learning (n = 37). After performing pretest, standardized patient-based training group and team-based learning group were trained separately for 6 h. One week after intervention, posttest was performed. Data were collected and analyzed using the Academic Specifications Questionnaire and the Knowledge Assessment Questionnaire. Significance level was considered at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The two groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic characteristics. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the posttest in terms of knowledge score (P = 0.079). However, there was a statistically significant difference in the level of knowledge between the two groups (P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Given the effectiveness of both standardized patient-based training method and team-based learning method on enhancing midwifery students' knowledge for providing services to rape victims, these methods can be used in students' education.",Journal of education and health promotion,2019,India,2019,10
21936605,Managing environmental risks: the benefits of a place-based approach.,"CONTEXT: Effective management of environmental risks such as food and water contamination requires both high quality scientific information and effective, informed social policy. Not only must health practitioners and policy-makers recognize the complexities of human health as a social phenomenon, they must also negotiate the vagaries of uncertainty, precaution, and ethics in their implementation of public health guidelines and advisories. For example, some health practitioners in Alaska have argued against implementation of US Environmental Protection Agency and World Health Organization's standardized consumption advisories for methylmercury (MeHg) in fish, in favor of place-based approaches to evaluating and communicating risk. They stress the importance of traditional subsistence foods and lifestyles, along with other local environmental, economic, and cultural drivers and determinants of environmental health. Such place-based approaches have been successful in improving health outcomes in Alaska and elsewhere. ISSUE: Nevertheless, debate continues regarding the validity and ethics of place-based approaches to developing and communicating standards and advice for managing environmental risks. Recent critiques suggest that place-based approaches to environmental health represent an undesirable kind of regional 'exceptionalism': the implication of which is that precaution, in respect to acting on the best available objective science, is undermined by attention to subjective local values. In this article we comment on this debate, a debate rooted in concerns regarding the delineation between science-based and policy-based decision-making. LESSONS LEARNED: Our experience with the social and ecological dimensions of MeHg contamination of fish and game in Alaska and elsewhere offers three considerations regarding the potential benefits available through place-based approaches: (1) they can contribute to the accuracy and systematic characterization of risks and their relationship to multiple direct and indirect health outcomes; (2) they are more likely to inform actual changes in behavior; and (3) they afford greater transparency to the risk management process and therefore facilitate environmental justice. We stress that standardized risk assessments and advisories remain important for providing a precautionary baseline that can inform the management and enforcement of industrial and other polluting activities at the state level. However, the management of environmental health at the regional and local level requires an approach that is cognizant of local circumstances and needs, and addresses health in a systemic and integrative fashion capable of incorporating qualitative social, cultural, and economic drivers and determinants. Thus, we recommend a two-tiered approach that blends state-based and place-based environmental risk management.",Rural and remote health,2011,Australia,2011,10
31170953,"Examining social determinants of health: the role of education, household arrangements and country groups by gender.","BACKGROUND: The majority of empirical studies focus on a single Social Determinant of Health (SDH) when analysing health inequalities. We go beyond this by exploring how the combination of education (micro level) and household arrangements (mezzo level) is associated with self-perceived health. METHODS: Our data source is the 2014 cross-sectional data from the European Survey of Living Conditions (EU-SILC). We calculate the predicted probabilities of poor self-perceived health for the middle-aged European population (30-59 years) as a function of the combination of the two SDHs. This is done separately for five European country groups (dual-earner; liberal; general family support; familistic; and post-socialist transition) and gender. RESULTS: We observe a double health gradient in all the country groups: first, there is a common health gradient by education (the higher the education, the lower the probability of poor health); second, household arrangements define a health gradient within each educational level according to whether or not the individual lives with a partner (living with a partner is associated with a lower probability of poor health). We observe some specificity in this general pattern. Familistic and post-socialist transition countries display large differences in the predicted probabilities according to education and household arrangements when compared with the other three country groups. Familistic and post-socialist transition countries also show the largest gender differences. CONCLUSIONS: Health differences in European populations seem to be defined, first, by education and, second, by living or not living with a partner. Additionally, different social contexts (gender inequalities, educational profile, etc.) in European countries change the influences on health of both the SDHs for both women and men.",BMC public health,2019 Jun 6,England,2019,10
28856834,Disparities in hypertension and cardiovascular disease in blacks: The critical role of medication adherence.,"Blacks are two to three times as likely as whites to die of preventable heart disease and stroke. Declines in mortality from heart disease have not eliminated racial disparities. Control and effective treatment of hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, among blacks is less than in whites and remains a challenge. One of the driving forces behind this racial/ethnic disparity is medication nonadherence whose cause is embedded in social determinants. Eight practical approaches to addressing medication adherence with the potential to attenuate disparities were identified and include: (1) patient engagement strategies, (2) consumer-directed health care, (3) patient portals, (4) smart apps and text messages, (5) digital pillboxes, (6) pharmacist-led engagement, (7) cardiac rehabilitation, and (8) cognitive-based behavior. However, while data suggest that these strategies may improve medication adherence, the effect on ameliorating racial/ethnic disparities is not certain. This review describes the relationship between disparities and medication adherence, which likely plays a role in persistent disparities in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.","Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)",2017 Oct,United States,2017,10
30804841,Evaluating the Psychometric Properties of the 7-Item Persian Game Addiction Scale for Iranian Adolescents.,"The 7-item Gaming Addiction Scale (GAS) is a brief instrument based on DSM criteria to assess gaming addiction. Although the psychometric properties of the GAS have been tested using classical test theory, its psychometric properties have never been tested using modern test theory (e.g., Rasch analysis). The present study used a large adolescent sample in Iran to test the psychometric properties of the Persian GAS through both classical test and modern test theories. Adolescents (n = 4442; mean age = 15.3 years; 50.3% males) were recruited from Qazvin, Iran. In addition to the GAS, all of them completed the following instruments: the nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form (IGDS-SF9), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and a generic quality of life instrument. Two weeks later, all participants completed the GAS again. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch analysis were used to test the unidimensionality of the GAS. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to test the test-retest reliability, and a regression model was used to test the criterion-related validity of the GAS. Both CFA and Rasch analysis supported the unidimensionality of the GAS. Pearson correlations coefficients showed satisfactory test-retest reliability of the GAS (r = 0.78 to 0.86), and the regression model demonstrated the criterion-related validity of the GAS (beta = 0.31 with IGDS-SF9; 0.41 with PSQI). Based on the results, the Persian GAS is a reliable and valid instrument for healthcare providers to assess the level of gaming addiction among Persian-speaking adolescents.",Frontiers in psychology,2019,Switzerland,2019,10

27642259,Subjective wellbeing and income: Empirical patterns in the rural developing world.,"A commonality in the economics of happiness literature is that absolute income matters more for the subjective wellbeing of people at low income levels. In this article, we use a large sample of people in rural areas of developing countries with relatively low income levels to test whether subjective wellbeing an increasing function of absolute income in our sample, and to analyze the existence of adaptation and social comparison effects on subjective wellbeing. Our sample includes 6973 rural households in 23 countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The average total income per adult equivalent in our sample was US$1555, whereas levels of subjective wellbeing resembled levels found in previous research using cross-country data. We find that, despite low levels of absolute income, levels of subjective wellbeing of our respondents resemble levels found in previous research using cross-country data. We also find remarkable similarities in many of the determinants of subjective wellbeing previously tested. Our data show that absolute income covariates with subjective wellbeing, but -as for richer samples- the magnitude of the association is lower once we control for adaptation and social comparison. Finally, our results suggest that social comparison has a stronger effect than adaptation in explaining the subjective wellbeing of our sample. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptation and social comparison even at low levels of absolute income.",Journal of happiness studies,2016 Apr,Netherlands,2016,10

30183971,"[Methodological guidelines to evaluate public health policies, and assessment of food and nutritional security policies].","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Food and Nutrition Security Policy of Colombia (PSAN by its acronym in Spanish). METHODOLOGY: A qualitative formative evaluation was applied, based on an academic focus, to validate the methodology established by the ""Methodological guidelines for the assessment and analysis of public health policies."" This evaluation inquired about the following aspects: Does the design of the Food and Nutrition Security Policy comply with the coherence between the problem, the proposed solutions and the proposed measures? What is the progress in objective compliance during the implementation? RESULTS: The Nutritional Food Security Policy (PSNP in Spanish) is pertinent and consistent with the diagnosis. Its objectives and strategies correlate, and aim to solve the problem of food and nutrition insecurity of the entire population of the country, especially, the poorest and more vulnerable. This policy is relevant because the activities programmed in the action plan of the National Plan for Food and Nutrition Security 2012-2019 are aligned with the needs and priorities of the territory, and with the institutional offer of the entities that participate in the development of the policy. CONCLUSIONS: Redesigning PSAN according to the current dynamics of the country in terms of international commitments, the objectives of sustainable development, the right to food, sovereignty and governance in food and nutrition security, and the approach of social determinants in health.","Revista de salud publica (Bogota, Colombia)",2017 Mar-Apr,Colombia,2017,10
25500618,"Socioeconomic inequalities in dental caries and their determinants in adolescents in New Delhi, India.","OBJECTIVES: To determine whether socioeconomic inequalities are correlated to dental caries experience and decayed teeth of Indian adolescents, and assess whether behavioural and psychosocial factors mediate this association. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 1386 adolescents living in three diverse areas of New Delhi. Caries experience and number of decayed teeth were assessed clinically and a questionnaire was used to gather sociodemographic and psychosocial data. Zero Inflated Negative Binomial regression models were used to assess the relationship between the outcomes (caries experience and decayed teeth) and area of residence, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Significant inequalities in caries experience and number of decayed teeth were observed. Odds of an adolescent being caries free decreased by 66% (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.49) and 70% (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.43) in adolescents living in resettlement communities or urban slums, respectively, when compared with the middle class group. No difference was observed among those with caries experience/decayed teeth. Adjusting for covariates did not affect the inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Area of residence appears to be a very strong and significant determinant for an adolescent to be caries/decay free in India. Psychosocial and behavioural factors do not mediate the association between area of residence and oral health.",BMJ open,2014 Dec 12,England,2014,10
29198520,[Socioeconomic inequalities and kidney transplantation].,"Studies at the population level must take into account the effect of social insecurity and socioeconomic inequalities on the patient outcomes. Socioeconomic inequalities depend on many determinants that are socially determined. In renal transplantation, these social determinants are not registered in the databases. The European Deprivation Index (EDI) is a composite index of social vulnerability with a French version. The EDI is an ecological measure of deprivation including the individual perception of basic needs for daily life that is called ""subjective poverty"". The Townsend index, Carstairs index and the Index of Multiple Deprivation are other ecological index available. It has been demonstrated in the United States that socioeconomic indicators of deprivation were associated with both the access to the waiting list for renal transplantation and transplantation failure. In France, socioeconomic deprivation may also affect the access to the waiting list and outcome of transplantation.

21702639,"The use of Photovoice to document and characterize the food security of users of community food programs in Iqaluit, Nunavut.","INTRODUCTION: Food insecurity is a chronic problem affecting Inuit communities. The most comprehensive assessment of Inuit food security to-date, the Inuit Health Survey, reported that 70% of Inuit pre-school children lived in 'food insecure' households. Food banks and soup kitchens are relatively new in the Arctic but the number of users is increasing. Little is known about the experience and determinants of food insecurity among food program users who are often among the most marginalized (socially and economically) in communities. The use of participatory research methods when working in the north of Canada can promote meaningful knowledge exchange with community members and this approach was used in the present 'Photovoice' research. Photovoice uses photography to develop a baseline understanding of an issue, in this case the experience and determinants of food insecurity among users of community food programs in Iqaluit, Nunavut. The target population includes those who face significant social and economic marginalization, an often neglected group in Arctic food systems research. METHODS: Eight regular users of food programs were recruited and engaged in a Photovoice research project to document factors determining their daily food consumption. The research method was introduced in workshops and discussion included the ethical concerns related to photography and how to take pictures. Participants were supplied with digital cameras, and asked to answer the following question using photography: 'What aspects of your everyday life affect what you eat and how much you have to eat?'. In the final workshop, photographs were discussed among the group and participants identified key themes in the photographs, offering an understanding of food insecurity from their perspectives. The group then discussed what should be done with the knowledge gained. RESULTS: Factors improving food security were the customary systems for sharing 'country food', and the presence of social support networks in the community, such as the Food Bank, the Soup Kitchen and the Tukisigiarvik Center. Factors identified as negatively affecting food security were the high cost of food in the Arctic, and substance abuse. The participants decided by consensus whether and how the knowledge from this project would be disseminated. They decided that a museum exhibit of the photographs in the summer of 2010 and promotion of the results among policy-makers in Nunavut were of high priority. CONCLUSION: The use of participatory research approaches such as Photovoice offers promise for exploring food security issues among similarly disadvantaged and vulnerable populations elsewhere in the Arctic. This approach was found to be a useful method for gathering and sharing research data because the data was generated and analysed by the participants. The clear and concise messages developed by the participants can be used to inform policy. This research method can assist in making a valuable contribution to health research, both in the Arctic and worldwide, because it promotes an understanding of the experiences of individuals from their own perspective.",Rural and remote health,2011,Australia,2011,10

This study examined the psychosocial health needs of patients at four urban interdisciplinary primary health teams. Quantitative analysis revealed that nearly 80% of patients reported anxiety and/or depression. Self-reported anxiety and depression was correlated with poor social relationships, compromised health status and underdeveloped problem-solving skills. These findings suggest that social workers have a vital role to play within interdisciplinary primary health teams in the amelioration of factors associated with anxiety and depression.",Social work in health care,2016,United States,2016,10
31755621,Determinants associated with areas with higher tuberculosis mortality rates: an ecological study.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterise tuberculosis deaths in a region of northeast Brazil during the period from 2006 to 2017 and to identify determinants associated with areas with higher tuberculosis mortality rates. METHODS: Ecological descriptive study of deaths from tuberculosis with multivariate mapping and logistic regression, carried out from 2006 to 2017 in the 75 municipalities of Sergipe, Brazil. The focus of the analysis was the mean mortality rate from tuberculosis, dichotomised according to the median. The independent variables were selected based on the conceptual model of the social determinants of health. RESULTS: Mortality due to tuberculosis in Sergipe, Brazil, was most prevalent among males, mixed-race people, and people over 40 years old and with a low level of education. Multivariate logistic regression identified the mean incidence rate for tuberculosis (aOR: 1.06), the proportion of HIV testing (aOR: 7.10), people without primary education and with informal occupation (aOR: 1.26) and people living in urban households without waste collection service (aOR: 0.10) as determinants associated to municipalities with higher tuberculosis mortality rates, with area under the ROC curve of 84% (P-value 0.000). Mapping revealed evident spatial variability. CONCLUSIONS: The tuberculosis epidemic in Brazil is determined by access to health services, especially the provision of HIV testing among those diagnosed with tuberculosis, accelerated urbanisation with large pockets of poverty and unsanitary housing conditions, corroborating global trends.",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,2019 Nov 22,England,2019,10

25943795,[Preventive health care and health promotion: Which models for supporting the evolution of clinical practice in primary health care?].,"OBJECTIVES: Published operating models about preventive health care and health promotion in primary care were sought with the aim of (1) compiling a functional inventory; and (2) to formulate working hypotheses for the improvement of clinical practice towards more efficiency and more equity. METHODS: Narrative literature review, using keywords related to the various prevention classes, health promotion, primary care, practice models and health care delivery. The diversity of models led to a multi-criteria analysis. RESULTS: Twelve models were selected. Their characteristics were unevenly distributed. The models, whose authors announce that they apply to prevention, mainly describe approaches that focus on individuals within physician-patient relationship, and take into account practice organization. Some socio-ecological and systems models illustrate health promotion: educational practice, group- or population-based targets, community environment and social determinants of health. There is little room for patients in elaborating the models, as they have little role in health care systems. The definitions of prevention, health promotion and patient education greatly differ from one model to another. DISCUSSION: Little is known about practical implementation of the models; assessment data are scarce. Some elements valued by health promotion could be integrated to health care: empowerment of citizens, addressing community environment; increased involvement in local health professionals' networks; integration of individual and collective approaches within the same health care facilities to address simultaneously individual customization, efficiency and equity objectives. These developments may call for adaptation in vocational training and continuous professional development: communication skills, awareness to public health concepts, and early and longitudinal exposure to community-based learning experiences for students.","Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",2015 Jun,France,2015,10
21177122,Applying an expanded social determinant approach to the concept of adherence to treatment: the case of Colombian women living with HIV/AIDS.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to explore and analyze social determinants that influence adherence among Colombian women living with HIV/AIDS in poverty conditions. METHODS: A qualitative, descriptive-interpretative study was developed. Forty-seven women participated in five focus group discussions. Also, in-depth interviews with six women were conducted. FINDINGS: Results showed that women with lower adherence sell their antiretroviral medication to satisfy economic needs, and prioritize the care of their HIV-positive children over their own adherence needs. In contrast, women with higher adherence were found to participate in social support groups offered by nongovernmental organizations. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the need to understand the social determinants that facilitate and/or hinder adherence among women in poverty-associated conditions. Results indicate the need to facilitate access to treatment on a timely and continual basis; provide economic resources, including support to meet basic needs as well as subsidies for transportation to health care centers; and explore mechanism for supporting the care of their offspring.",Women's health issues : official publication of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health,2011 Mar-Apr,United States,2011,10
29157994,The importance of population differences: Influence of individual characteristics on the Australian public's preferences for emergency care.,"A better understanding of the public's preferences and what factors influence them is required if they are to be used to drive decision-making in health. This is particularly the case for service areas undergoing continual reform such as emergency and primary care. Accordingly, this study sought to determine if attitudes, socio-demographic characteristics and healthcare experiences influence the public's intentions to access care and their preferences for hypothetical emergency care alternatives. A discrete choice experiment was used to elicit the preferences of Australian adults (n=1529). Mixed logit regression analyses revealed the influence of a range of individual characteristics on preferences and service uptake choices across three different presenting scenarios. Age was associated with service uptake choices in all contexts, whilst the impact of other sociodemographics, health experience and attitudinal factors varied by context. The improvements in explanatory power observed from including these factors in the models highlight the need to further clarify their influence with larger populations and other presenting contexts, and to identify other determinants of preference heterogeneity. The results suggest social marketing programs undertaken as part of demand management efforts need to be better targeted if decision-makers are seeking to increase community acceptance of emerging service models and alternatives. Other implications for health policy, service planning and research, including for workforce planning and the possible introduction of a system of co-payments are discussed.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2018 Feb,Ireland,2018,10
23785866,"Rural-urban population movement, community context and impact on DEC fortified salt program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.","Diethylcarbamazinecitrate (DEC) salt in conjunction with annual single-dose mass drug administration (MDA) with DEC tablets can be considered as potential option to hasten the process of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) elimination. Consumption of DEC tablet/salt by at least 80% of the endemic population is crucial in achieving elimination in five years. This study examines the determinants of rural-urban population movement and its implication on DEC fortified salt program to control LF. Data was collected through questionnaire from 150 each movers and non-movers from 10 randomly selected villages and also using Key informant (KI) interviews in Villupuram district in Tamil Nadu. Households with at least one family member engaged in movement at any point of time in the previous year, range from 24 - 43% in different villages. Knowledge on cause, control, ongoing LF elimination programs and compliance with DEC tablets (28.7%) and salt (30%) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) among non-movers than movers (4.7% and 3.3% respectively). In order to achieve the goal of elimination of LF by 2020, measures need to be undertaken to ensure that the social mobilization activities and LF intervention programs need to cover the 24-43% of mobile population.",The Journal of communicable diseases,2011 Jun,India,2011,10
20056001,Snazer: the simulations and networks analyzer.,"BACKGROUND: Networks are widely recognized as key determinants of structure and function in systems that span the biological, physical, and social sciences. They are static pictures of the interactions among the components of complex systems. Often, much effort is required to identify networks as part of particular patterns as well as to visualize and interpret them.From a pure dynamical perspective, simulation represents a relevant way-out. Many simulator tools capitalized on the ""noisy"" behavior of some systems and used formal models to represent cellular activities as temporal trajectories. Statistical methods have been applied to a fairly large number of replicated trajectories in order to infer knowledge.A tool which both graphically manipulates reactive models and deals with sets of simulation time-course data by aggregation, interpretation and statistical analysis is missing and could add value to simulators. RESULTS: We designed and implemented Snazer, the simulations and networks analyzer. Its goal is to aid the processes of visualizing and manipulating reactive models, as well as to share and interpret time-course data produced by stochastic simulators or by any other means. CONCLUSIONS: Snazer is a solid prototype that integrates biological network and simulation time-course data analysis techniques.",BMC systems biology,2010 Jan 7,England,2010,10
31355958,The impact of social determinants of health on laryngotracheal stenosis development and outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: The social determinants of health affect a wide range of health outcomes and risks. To date, there have been no studies evaluating the impact of social determinants of health on laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS). We sought to describe the social determinants in a cohort of LTS patients and explore their association with treatment outcome. METHODS: Subjects diagnosed with LTS undergoing surgical procedures between 2013 and 2018 were identified. Matched controls were identified from intensive care unit (ICU) patients who underwent intubation for greater than 24 hours. Medical comorbidities, stenosis characteristics, and patient demographics were abstracted from the clinical record. Tracheostomy at last follow-up was recorded from the medical record and phone calls. Socioeconomic data was obtained from the American Community Survey. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two cases met inclusion criteria. Cases had significantly lower education compared to Tennessee (P = .009) but similar education rates as ICU controls. Cases had significantly higher body mass index (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04, P = .035), duration of intubation (OR: 1.21, P < .001), and tobacco use (OR: 1.21, P = .006) in adjusted analysis when compared to controls. Tracheostomy dependence within the case cohort was significantly associated with public insurance (OR: 1.33, P = .016) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 1.34, P = .018) in adjusted analysis. CONCLUSION: Intubation practices, medical comorbidities and social determinants of health may influence the development of LTS and tracheostomy dependence after treatment. Identification of at-risk populations in ICUs may allow for prevention of tracheostomy dependence through the use of early tracheostomy and specialized follow-up.

23835148,A capabilities approach to population health and public policy-making.,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to outline a capabilities approach to the social determinants of population health and to compare its explanatory power and implications for public policy-making with psychosocial approaches. METHODS: A model linking the structures of economic and social relations to health outcomes is developed and logistic methods used to confirm its base validity for a representative sample of 16,488 citizens in 19 developed democracies drawn from the World Values Surveys of 1990 and 2005. Self-reported health is the dependent variable. Age, gender, education, employment status, self-mastery, income, autonomy at work, ties to family and friends, subjective social status, associational memberships and sense of national belonging are considered. RESULTS: At baseline, risk ratios reflecting movement from the 25th to 75th percentile in the distribution of the variable indicate that increases in income reduce the likelihood of poor health (0.78; 0.73-0.82) as does higher autonomy at work (0.90; 0.85-0.94) but so does access to social resources reflected in ties to family and friends (0.89; 0.86-0.92), associational memberships (0.93; 0.89-0.98), subjective social status (0.77; 0.54-0.90) while the absence of feelings of national belonging increases the likelihood of poor health (1.14; 1.06-1.23). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that population health is dependent on the distribution of social as well as economic resources along the dimensions predicted by a capabilities model. Governments should be attentive to the impact of policy on the distribution of social, as well as economic, resources.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,2013 Aug,France,2013,10
30296837,Ethnic differences in hypertension prevalence and contributing determinants - the HELIUS study.,"AIMS: There are important ethnic differences in the prevalence of hypertension and hypertension-mediated cardiovascular complications, but there is ongoing debate on the nature of these differences. We assessed the contribution of lifestyle, socio-economic and psychosocial variables to ethnic differences in hypertension prevalence. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the Healthy Life In an Urban Setting (HELIUS) study, including 21,520 participants aged 18-70 years of South-Asian Surinamese ( n = 3032), African Surinamese ( n = 4124), Ghanaian ( n = 2331), Turkish ( n = 3594), Moroccan ( n = 3891) and Dutch ( n = 4548) ethnic origin. Ethnic differences in hypertension prevalence rates were examined using logistic regression models. RESULTS: After adjustment for a broad range of variables, significant higher hypertension prevalence compared to the Dutch population remained in Ghanaian men (odds ratio 2.62 (95% confidence interval 2.14-3.22)) and women (4.16 (3.39-5.12)), African Surinamese men (1.62 (1.37-1.92)) and women (2.70 (2.29-3.17)) and South-Asian Surinamese men (1.22 (1.15-1.46)) and women (1.84 (1.53-2.22)). In contrast, Turkish men (0.72 (0.60-0.87)) and Moroccan men (0.50 (0.41-0.61)) and women (0.57 (0.46-0.71)) had a lower hypertension prevalence compared with the Dutch population. The differences in hypertension prevalence were present across different age groups and persisted after stratification for body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio. CONCLUSION: Large ethnic differences in hypertension prevalence exist that are already present in young adulthood. Adjustment for common variables known to be associated with a higher risk of hypertension explained the higher adjusted prevalence rates among Turks and Moroccans, but not in African and South-Asian descent populations who remained to have a higher rate of hypertension compared to the Dutch host population.",European journal of preventive cardiology,2018 Dec,England,2018,10
22089682,Tobacco use: a major risk factor for non communicable diseases in South-East Asia region.,"Tobacco use is a serious public health problem in the South East Asia Region where use of both smoking and smokeless form of tobacco is widely prevalent. The region has almost one quarter of the global population and about one quarter of all smokers in the world. Smoking among men is high in the Region and women usually take to chewing tobacco. The prevalence across countries varies significantly with smoking among adult men ranges from 24.3% (India) to 63.1% (Indonesia) and among adult women from 0.4% (Sri Lanka) to 15% (Myanmar and Nepal). The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among men varies from 1.3% (Thailand) to 31.8% (Myanmar), while for women it is from 4.6% (Nepal) to 27.9% (Bangladesh). About 55% of total deaths are due to Non communicable diseases (NCDs) with 53.4% among females with highest in Maldives (79.4%) and low in Timor-Leste (34.4%). Premature mortality due to NCDs in young age is high in the region with 60.7% deaths in Timor Leste and 60.6% deaths in Bangladesh occurring below the age of 70 years. Age standardized death rate per 100,000 populations due to NCDs ranges from 793 (Bhutan) and 612 (Maldives) among males and 654 (Bhutan) and 461 (Sri Lanka) among females respectively. Out of 5.1 millions tobacco attributable deaths in the world, more than 1 million are in South East Asia Region (SEAR) countries.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Questionnaire study among 97 consecutively recruited inpatients (72.2% male; mean age 60.6 years) with acute coronary syndrome. We examined the role of socio-demographic, illness-related and psycho-social factors (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, General Self-Efficacy Scale and Life Orientation Test-Revised) for perceived consequences, controllability and causes (Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire) with standard multiple regression. RESULTS: In final models, dispositional pessimism was associated with perceptions of more severe consequences, less personal control and more attribution of illness to immune system factors. Dispositional optimism was associated with less severe perceived consequences. Higher general self-efficacy was associated with less attribution of illness to psychological factors, smoking and poor medical care. Greater perceived social support was associated with higher perceived treatment control and less attribution of illness to immune system factors, poor medical care, chance and accident. Also, gender, educational status, previous heart disease and family history of cardiovascular disease were significantly related to illness perceptions, whereas present disease severity (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) was not. CONCLUSION: Psycho-social resources and illness history were more important determinants of cardiac illness perceptions than present disease severity.

31108331,A gender-focused analysis of structural and social precipitators to child institutionalization in Azerbaijan: A qualitative study.,"Deinstitutionalization reforms in the post-Soviet region-the region with the highest rate of institutional care worldwide-are aimed at reducing the number of children in institutions. To develop context-specific gatekeeping strategies and prevent new cohorts of children from entering institutions, it is crucial to understand the local factors that contribute to institutional placement. Using a phenomenological approach, this qualitative study explores the contexts of institutional placement of children in Azerbaijan from their caregivers' perspectives. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews of the parents and primary caregivers (N=26) of children placed in the institutional care system in Azerbaijan. Using systematic thematic analysis with inductive coding, we identified caregivers' reasons for placing children in the system, and inferred the life circumstances that led parents-women in particular-to be more likely to place their children in institutions. Our findings reveal multiple, gendered pathways that contribute to such placement. The majority of caregivers were single mothers, many of whom had divorced their husbands in response to domestic violence (often attributed to the husband's substance addiction). The strong stigma against divorce led women to be ostracized by close family members, often leaving them without economic and social support. Because of the limitations of public benefits available in the region, publicly-funded child institutions are often the only remaining way to provide education and care for their children. This qualitative study shows the importance of addressing the social and economic needs of parents, single mothers in particular, to prevent child institutional placement in the post-Soviet Caucasus region.",Social science & medicine (1982),2019 Jul,England,2019,10
29255953,Synthetic Biology and the Translational Imperative.,"Advances at the interface between the biological sciences and engineering are giving rise to emerging research fields such as synthetic biology. Harnessing the potential of synthetic biology requires timely and adequate translation into clinical practice. However, the translational research enterprise is currently facing fundamental obstacles that slow down the transition of scientific discoveries from the laboratory to the patient bedside. These obstacles including scarce financial resources and deficiency of organizational and logistic settings are widely discussed as primary impediments to translational research. In addition, a number of socio-ethical considerations inherent in translational research need to be addressed. As the translational capacity of synthetic biology is tightly linked to its social acceptance and ethical approval, ethical limitations may-together with financial and organizational problems-be co-determinants of suboptimal translation. Therefore, an early assessment of such limitations will contribute to proactively favor successful translation and prevent the promising potential of synthetic biology from remaining under-expressed. Through the discussion of two case-specific inventions in synthetic biology and their associated ethical implications, we illustrate the socio-ethical challenges ahead in the process of implementing synthetic biology into clinical practice. Since reducing the translational lag is essential for delivering the benefits of basic biomedical research to society at large and promoting global health, we advocate a moral obligation to accelerating translational research: the ""translational imperative.""",Science and engineering ethics,2019 Feb,England,2019,10
23286654,"The impact of social disadvantage on preconception health, illness, and well-being: an intersectional analysis.","PURPOSE: To understand how social and structural contexts shape individual risk, vulnerability, and interconception health-related behaviors of African-American women. APPROACH OR DESIGN: A longitudinal ethnographic study was conducted. SETTING: The study was conducted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: The sample included 19 African-American women who were participants in the intervention group of a randomized clinical trial of interconceptional care. METHOD: Data were collected through interaction with participants over a period of 6 to 12 months. Participant observation , structured and unstructured interviews, and Photovoice were used to obtain data; grounded theory was used for analysis. The analysis was guided by intersectional theory. RESULTS: Social disadvantage influenced health and health care-seeking behaviors of African-American women, and the disadvantage centered on the experience of racism. The authors identify seven experiences grounded in the interactions among the forces of racism, class, gender, and history that may influence women's participation in and the effectiveness of preconception and interconception health care. CONCLUSION: African-American women's health and wellness behaviors are influenced by an experience of racism structurally embedded and made more virulent by its intersection with class, gender, and history. These intersecting forces create what may be a unique exposure that contributes significantly to the proximal determinants of health inequities for African-American women. Health promotion approaches that focus on the individual as the locus of intervention must concomitantly unravel and address the intertwining structural forces that shape individual circumstance in order to improve women's interconceptional health and to reduce disparities.",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,2013 Jan-Feb,United States,2013,10
21083624,Migration background: a risk factor for caries development during adolescence.,"The influence of child and parental migration background on the risk of approximal caries increment in Swedish adolescents was investigated. This retrospective longitudinal register-based cohort study included all 13-yr-old adolescents (n = 18,142) who were resident in the County of Stockholm, Sweden, in 2000, and followed them up to 19 yr of age. At follow-up, 15,538 subjects were examined. Caries data [decayed, missing, and filled teeth/surfaces (DMFT/S)], were collected from a dental database. Socio-demographic determinants were collected from Swedish National Registers. After adjustments for socio-demographic confounders, logistic regression analysis revealed that adolescents with foreign-born parents, irrespective of whether the child was born in Sweden or abroad, exhibited a significantly elevated risk for approximal caries increment (DMFSa > 0), and developed, on average, 0.53 and 1.14 more approximal caries lesions, respectively, compared with their counterparts with Swedish-born parents. Furthermore, adolescents born in eastern Europe exhibited an increased risk for approximal caries increment (DMFSa > 0) and developed, on average, 1.06 more approximal caries lesions compared with Swedish-born adolescents. In conclusion, parental migration background must be considered as a risk factor for caries development during adolescence, irrespective of whether or not the adolescent was born in Sweden.",European journal of oral sciences,2010 Dec,England,2010,10
30813953,The status of international collaborations in compilation of Iranian scientific articles on environmental health engineering.,"BACKGROUND: Scientific cooperation is one of the effective methods to access current knowledge and technologies and also to use successful experiences of researchers in developed countries by academicians living in developing countries. This study aimed to determine the level of international contribution in compilation of scientific articles in Iranian journals published in the field of environmental health engineering. METHODS: This descriptive and retrospective study was conducted within a 10-year period (2008-2017), in which all articles published in five specialized Iranian journals of environmental health engineering were reviewed using a researcher-made checklist. The information collected in the checklist included: the year of publication, number of issues and articles, information about the status of authors' participation in terms of number of authors, sex, institutional affiliation, country, continents, and research centers. Descriptive and inferential statistics such as index of dispersion, measures of central tendency, and Chi-square and t tests were used to statistically analyze the data. Besides, VOSviewer software was used to visualize the data. RESULTS: The review of 1276 articles published in 102 issues of the five journals of environmental health engineering in Iran showed that 184 articles were written with the participation of researchers from other countries. Most articles with the participation of international authors during the last decade were published in 2014. Chi-square test indicated a significant difference in the publication of these articles within 2014-2015 than other years (P = 0.001). Among the five journals, the best participation of international researchers was observed in J Environ Health Sci Engineer (168 articles, 91.3%). Considering the number of joint articles with Iran, the top continents were Asia, Europe, and Africa each with 117, 52, and 32 articles, respectively. India, Turkey, and Malaysia had the highest level of cooperation with Iranian researchers with 53, 16, and 14 articles, respectively. 637 authors contributed in 184 articles, of whom 469 (73.6%) were male and 121 (18.9%) were female. T test was used to compare the mean number of male and female authors in the articles with or without the participation of international researchers, which showed no significant difference. CONCLUSION: International contribution of researchers in compilation of specialized environmental health articles was good. Given the low level of cooperation between researchers from developed European and American countries and their Iranian counterparts, it seems necessary to adopt different methods to attract more collaboration from researchers working in developed countries considering their significant role in health-related areas.",Globalization and health,2019 Feb 27,England,2019,10
31130196,"Social capital in the creation of cultural capital: Family structure, neighborhood cohesion, and extracurricular participation.","Past research has found that participation in extracurricular activities helps develop children's cultural capital that is crucial to both education and career successes. Previous studies have examined various determinants of extracurricular participation, but mostly focused on social class, demographics, and school characteristics. In this paper we renew the Coleman tradition by putting social capital (as measured by family structure and neighborhood cohesion) in the spotlight and studying the effect of social capital on youth participation in organized extracurricular activities. By using longitudinal data from the 2004 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation of representative households in the U.S. and conducting various robust statistical analyses, we provide updated results on the subject. We find that a two-parent household (especially in relative to households with cohabiting parents) and neighborhood cohesion (i.e., a set of cohesive relationships among parents in the neighborhood) both have a positive and significant association with extracurricular participation. We also find such associations vary somewhat by child's sex, age, race, and the type of extracurricular activity. We conclude that to equalize children's participation in extracurricular activities future social policies should consider interventions that target low-income families and families with single-parent or cohabiting parents, that can improve neighborhood cohesion, and that are tailored by the type of extracurricular activity.",Social science research,2019 Jul,United States,2019,10
21973249,Kava drinking associated with suicidal behaviour among young Kanaks using kava in New Caledonia.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between recreational use of kava and indicators of suicidal behaviour among youth in New Caledonia. METHODS: This cross-sectional community-based survey was administered to 1,400 young people aged 16-25 years. A multivariate analysis tested for associations between lifetime kava use and lifetime suicidal ideation and attempts. Because ethnicity affected the correlation between kava use and suicidal behaviour, data were analysed separately for Kanak youth and youth of other ethnic communities. RESULTS: Overall, 42% of respondents reported any lifetime kava use, 34% reported past suicidal ideation and 12% any suicide attempts. Among Kanak youth, kava use increased the likelihood of reporting both suicidal ideation (aOR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.58-3.66) and suicide attempts (aOR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.11-3.52). No such association was found in the non-Kanak group. CONCLUSIONS: The discrepancy between the effects of kava drinking on suicidal behaviour between Kanak youth and youth of other ethnic groups may be related to differences in patterns and quantity of kava use. In view of the paucity of data on the effects of kava on mental health in young people, further investigation is required. IMPLICATIONS: The results call for an increased awareness of the potential adverse health effects of kava consumption in New Caledonia where it has spread in recent times and among communities where previously it was never used.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2011 Oct,Australia,2011,10
28299102,Understanding the Barriers to the Utilization of Primary Health Care in a Low-Income Setting: Implications for Health Policy and Planning.,"The essence of primary health care is the provision of essential health services and commodities to individuals and communities using available, acceptable and sustainable resources. However, there has been a growing lack of confidence by the populace as evidenced by poor utilization of the services. This study sought to identify the predominant barriers affecting the utilization of primary health care services in Batsari Local Government in Katsina State, Nigeria. A cluster of 630 households was surveyed in the catchment of the 21 health primary health facilities. A catchment been defined as a household located within 5 km of a primary health center. Using a three digit randomly generated numbers a household was selected. Once selected the start house and twenty-nine contiguous houses were visited. a total of 630 households were surveyed. In all households, questions were asked on the predominant health problems, as well as the major determinants of access and utilization of primary health care services .The results were computed and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software SPSS. Version 17.0. The findings from all the respondents (n=630) showed that majority of the people preferred to seek care from the patent medicine stores (53.63%) as against only 7.6% who utilized the primary health care services. The commonest reasons why respondents do not utilize these services were lack of essential drugs, high cost of services as well as inadequate infrastructure in primary healthcare facilities. The study has highlighted some of the multiple factors affecting the utilization of primary healthcare services. It is expected that these findings will guide policy makers in improving healthcare delivery particularly where the need is greatest - at the grassroots - in line with the national health policy and national health strategic development plan.",Journal of public health in Africa,2013 Dec 3,Italy,2013,10
21975027,"Why is U.K. medicine no longer a self-regulating profession? The role of scandals involving ""bad apple"" doctors.","This article identifies the role played by a series of medical scandals in the U.K., occurring from the mid-1990s onwards, in ending a collegial model of self-regulation of the medical profession that had endured for 150 years. The state's original motive in endorsing professional self-regulation was to resolve the principal-agent problem inherent in the doctor-patient relationship. The profession, in return for its self-regulating privileges, undertook to act as a reliable guarantor for the competence and conduct of each of its members. Though sufficient to ensure that most doctors were ""good"", the collegial model adopted by the profession left it fatally vulnerable to the problem of ""bad apples"": those unwilling, incapable or indifferent to delivering on their professional commitments and who betrayed the trust of both patients and peers. Weak administrative systems in the NHS failed to compensate for the defects of the collegium in controlling these individuals. The scandals both provoked and legitimised erosion of the profession's self-regulatory power. Though its vulnerability to bad apples had been present since the founding of the 19th century profession, it was the convergence of social and political conditions at a particular historical moment that transformed the scandals into an unstoppable imperative for reform. Huge public anger, the voice permitted to a coalition of critics, shifts in social attitudes, the opportunity presented for imposing standards for accountability, and the increasing ascendancy of pro-interventionist managerialist and political agendas from the early 1990s onwards were all implicated in the response made to scandals and the shape the reforms took. Scandals need to be understood not as simple determinants of change, but as one performative element in a constellation of socially contingent forces and contexts. The new rebalancing of the ""countervailing powers"" has dislodged the profession as the senior partner in the regulation of doctors, but may introduce new risks.",Social science & medicine (1982),2011 Nov,England,2011,10
24077479,"The status of diabetes control in Kurdistan province, west of Iran.","BACKGROUND: Based on some estimation more than two million peoples in Iran are affected by Type 2 diabetes. The present study was designed to evaluate the status of diabetes control among Type 2 diabetes patients in Kurdistan, west of Iran and its associated factors. METHODS: In our cross sectional study conducted in 2010, 411 Type 2 diabetes patients were randomly recruited from Sanandaj, Capital of Kurdistan. Chi square test was used in univariate analysis to address the association between HgAlc and FBS status and other variables. The significant results from Univariate analysis were entered in multivariate analysis and multinomial logistic regression model. RESULTS: In 38% of patients, FBS was in normal range (70-130) and in 47% HgA1c was <7% which is normal range for HgA1c. In univariate analysis, FBS level was associated with educational levels (P=0.001), referral style (P=0.001), referral time (P=0.009), and insulin injection (P=0.016). In addition, HgA1c had a relationship with sex (P=0.023), age (P=0.035), education (P=0.001), referral style (P=0.001), and insulin injection (P=0.008). After using multinomial logistic regression for significant results of univariate analysis, it was found that FBS was significantly associated with referral style. In addition HgA1c was significantly associated with referral style and Insulin injection.

20579999,Delivery route preferences of urban women of low socioeconomic status.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the main determinants of mode of delivery preference among urban dwelling women of lower socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: Over a 12-month period, a self-completion 36-item questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of 308 women within the first 3 postpartum days. Non-parametric tests were used for analysis. RESULTS: Study participants were mostly African American (>85%), single mothers (>75%), and unemployed (>/=55%). Among the women, 85.7% had vaginal delivery (VD) and 14.3% had cesarean delivery (CD). Women who preferred CD (10%) were more likely to be concerned about a vaginal tear/episiotomy during VD, forceps, and a ""big"" baby compared with women who preferred VD, for whom ""pushing the baby out myself"" and ""fear of cesarean"" were the most important factors. In the final model of 7 factors, the 3 main factors found to positively impact maternal preference for CD were a vaginal cut during VD (P<0.001), higher mean BMI (P=0.001), and cesarean as the most recent delivery type (P<0.001). The total explained variance by this model was 46%. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term complications of a VD, higher BMI, and a previous cesarean delivery are the most significant factors that impact the preferences of women of lower SES for future mode of delivery.",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,2010 Oct,United States,2010,10
30845902,Regional and sex-specific variation in BMI distribution in four sub-Saharan African countries: The H3Africa AWI-Gen study.,"BACKGROUND: African populations are characterised by diversity at many levels including: demographic history, genetic ancestry, language, wealth, socio-political landscape, culture and behaviour. Several of these have a profound impact on body fat mass. Obesity, a key risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, in the wake of the epidemiological and health transitions across the continent, requires detailed analysis together with other major risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To compare regional and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) distributions, using a cross-sectional study design, in adults aged 40-60 years across six study sites in four sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries and to compare the determinants of BMI at each. METHODS: Anthropometric measurements were standardised across sites and BMI calculated. Median BMI and prevalence of underweight, lean, overweight and obesity were compared between the sexes and across sites. Data from multivariable linear regression models for the principal determinants of BMI were summarised from the site-specific studies. RESULTS: BMI was calculated in 10,702 participants (55% female) and was significantly higher in women than men at nearly all sites. The highest prevalence of obesity was observed at the three South African sites (42.3-66.6% in women and 2.81-17.5% in men) and the lowest in West Africa (1.25-4.22% in women and 1.19-2.20% in men). Across sites, higher socio-economic status and educational level were associated with higher BMI. Being married and increased dietary intake were associated with higher BMI in some communities, whilst smoking and alcohol intake were associated with lower BMI, as was HIV infection in the regions where it was prevalent. CONCLUSION: In SSA there is a marked variation in the prevalence of obesity both regionally and between men and women. Our data suggest that the drive for social upliftment within Africa will be associated with rising levels of obesity, which will require the initiation of targeted sex-specific intervention programmes across specific African communities.",Global health action,2018,United States,2018,10
28959171,Health-related Quality of Life Assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 Questionnaire in the General Slovenian Population.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to obtain reference data of the EORTC QLQ-C30 quality of life dimensions for the general Slovenian population. We intend to provide the researchers and clinicians in our country with the expected mean health-related quality of life (HRQL) scores for distinctive socio-demographic population groups. METHODS: The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire supplemented by a socio-demographic inquiry was mailed or distributed to 1,685 randomly selected individuals in the Slovenian population aged 18 - 90. Answers from 1,231 subjects representing socio-demographic diversity of the Slovenian population were collected and transformed into EORTC dimensions and symptoms. The impact of socio-demographic features on HRQL scores was assessed by multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: Gender, age and self-rated social class are the important confounders in the quality of life scores in our population. Men reported better quality of life on the majority of the specific scales and, at the same time, reported fewer symptoms. There was no gender-specific difference in cognitive functioning. The mean scores were consistently lower with age in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report the normative EORTC QLQ-C30 scores for one of the south-eastern European populations. The reported expected mean scores allow Slovenian oncologists to estimate what the quality of life in cancer patients would be, had they not been ill. As they are derived by common methodology, our results can easily be included in any further international comparisons or in the calculation of European summarized HRQL scores.",Radiology and oncology,2017 Sep,Poland,2017,10
20051124,Bio-psychosocial determinants of time lost from work following non life threatening acute orthopaedic trauma.,"BACKGROUND: To determine factors predicting the duration of time away from work following acute orthopaedic non life threatening trauma METHODS: Prospective cohort study conducted at four hospitals in Victoria, Australia. The cohort comprised 168 patients aged 18-64 years who were working prior to the injury and sustained a range of acute unintentional orthopaedic injuries resulting in hospitalization. Baseline data was obtained by survey and medical record review. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to examine the association between potential predictors and the duration of time away from work during the six month study. The study achieved 89% follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 168 participants recruited to the study, 68% returned to work during the six month study. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified that blue collar work, negative pain attitudes with respect to work, high initial pain intensity, injury severity, older age, initial need for surgery, the presence of co-morbid health conditions at study entry and an orthopaedic injury to more than one region were associated with extended duration away from work following the injury. Participants in receipt of compensation who reported high social functioning at two weeks were 2.58 times more likely to have returned to work than similar participants reporting low social functioning. When only those who had returned to work were considered, the participant reported reason for return to work "" to fill the day"" was a significant predictor of earlier RTW [RR 2.41 (95% C.I 1.35-4.30)] whereas ""financial security"" and ""because they felt able to"" did not achieve significance. CONCLUSIONS: Many injury-related and psycho social factors affect the duration of time away from work following orthopaedic injury. Some of these are potentially modifiable and may be amenable to intervention. Further consideration of the reasons provided by participants for returning to work may provide important opportunities for social marketing approaches designed to alleviate the financial and social burden associated with work disability.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,2010 Jan 5,England,2010,10
27215758,"The influence of marital status on the use of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening.","PURPOSE: To examine the impact of marital status on the use of screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer. METHODS: We relied on 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey age-appropriate screening cohorts. Appropriate screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer was determined according to United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations in effect at the time of the 2012 survey. Complex samples logistic regression models were performed to examine the effect of marital status on cancer screening. RESULTS: Overall, 81.6, 83.9, and 68.9% of married participants underwent breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer, respectively, relative to 74.2, 75.1, and 60.9% for divorced/widowed/separated, individuals, and 74.7, 78.7, and 53.4% for never married individuals. Marital status (married vs. never married) was an independent predictor of screening for all cancers examined: breast cancer, odds ratio (OR): 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-1.61); cervical cancer, OR: 1.29 (95% CI: 1.16-1.43); colorectal cancer, OR: 1.63 (95% CI: 1.51-1.77). Gender-specific subgroup analyses for colorectal cancer suggests that marital status may exert a greater effect in men, relative to women (married men: OR 1.75, 95% CI: 1.56-1.96; married women: OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.35-1.70). CONCLUSION: Being married is associated with increased utilization of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. The influence of marital status was greater in men relative to women eligible for colorectal cancer screening. Our results emphasize the importance of social determinants of health-seeking behaviors.",Preventive medicine,2016 Aug,United States,2016,10
27411373,Determinants of stigma in a cohort of hellenic patients suffering from multiple sclerosis: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from several neurologic disorders may bear the ""stigma"" of their disease, being disqualified from full social acceptance. Although stigma is considered to be present in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the factors that influence its levels are ambiguous. Aim of our study was to examine, for the first time in the literature, the basic determinants of stigma in a Hellenic MS-patients cohort, as well as how stigma affects their Quality-of-Life (QoL) profiles. METHODS: Three hundred forty two patients were recruited in this study. Data collected concerned sociodemographic and disease-related variables, mental illness assessment, Multiple-Sclerosis-QoL-54 (MSQoL-54) and Stigma-Scale-for-Chronic-Illness-24 (SSCI-24) questionnaires. Potential determinants were evaluated with univariate statistical analyses for their contribution to total, internalized (inner-self derived) and externalized (society derived) stigma. Important findings were further evaluated on hierarchical regression models. RESULTS: Disability levels were found to be the most powerful predictor in all stigma categories, followed by the presence of mental illness. Working and caregiving status were also ascertained as determinants of internalized stigma. Stigma levels displayed strong negative correlation with all composites of MSQoL-54. CONCLUSIONS: Stigma is present in the social environment of MS patients and was confirmed as a barrier (according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health), with detrimental effects on their QoL levels and functioning performances. Disability and mental illness were shown as the principal determinants of stigma, while financial characteristics were not as equally involved. Further validation of these results in other MS populations may provide safer conclusions, towards more efficacious patient-centered care outcomes.",BMC neurology,2016 Jul 13,England,2016,10
27241136,Time to go global: a consultation on global health competencies for postgraduate doctors.,"BACKGROUND: Globalisation is having profound impacts on health and healthcare. We solicited the views of a wide range of stakeholders in order to develop core global health competencies for postgraduate doctors. METHODS: Published literature and existing curricula informed writing of seven global health competencies for consultation. A modified policy Delphi involved an online survey and face-to-face and telephone interviews over three rounds. RESULTS: Over 250 stakeholders participated, including doctors, other health professionals, policymakers and members of the public from all continents of the world. Participants indicated that global health competence is essential for postgraduate doctors and other health professionals. Concerns were expressed about overburdening curricula and identifying what is 'essential' for whom. Conflicting perspectives emerged about the importance and relevance of different global health topics. Five core competencies were developed: (1) diversity, human rights and ethics; (2) environmental, social and economic determinants of health; (3) global epidemiology; (4) global health governance; and (5) health systems and health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Global health can bring important perspectives to postgraduate curricula, enhancing the ability of doctors to provide quality care. These global health competencies require tailoring to meet different trainees' needs and facilitate their incorporation into curricula. Healthcare and global health are ever-changing; therefore, the competencies will need to be regularly reviewed and updated.",International health,2016 Sep,England,2016,10
23829329,Atazanavir and other determinants of hyperbilirubinemia in a cohort of 1150 HIV-positive patients: results from 9 years of follow-up.,"Hyperbilirubinemia is common among patients exposed to atazanavir (ATV), but its long-term significance is not well documented. The objective was to analyze hyperbilirubinemia (incidence, regression, determinants, and outcome) among 1150 HIV-positive patients followed-up in a prospective cohort between 2003 and 2012. Cumulative incidence of hyperbilirubinemia grades 3-4 and its probability of regression were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards model was used to study the determinants. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression was used to evaluate the association between hyperbilirubinemia grades 3-4 and adverse health outcome. Eight years cumulative incidence of hyperbilirubinemia was 83.6% (95% CI:79.0-87.7) and 6.6% (95% CI:4.7-9.2) among ATV users and non-users, respectively. This clinical outcome fluctuated considerably, as most patients exposed to ATV (91%) regressed, transiently, to lower grade at some point during follow-up. Determinants were atazanavir (HR=147.90, 95% CI: 33.64-604.18), ritonavir (HR=5.18, 95% CI:2.33-11.48), zidovudine (HR=2.62, 95% CI:1.07-6.46), and age (HR=1.04 95% CI:1.01-1.08). Alcohol consumption and others non-antiretroviral medications including hepatotoxic and recreational drugs were not available for analyses. Incidence of hyperbilirubinemia was very high among ATV users and, although regression to lower grade was frequent in the clinical follow-up of these patients, this was usually transient as the mean level of bilirubin stayed at a relatively high level. Importantly, long-term hyperbilirubinemia was not associated with adverse health outcome.",AIDS patient care and STDs,2013 Jul,United States,2013,10
30742757,"Health Indicators Related to Disease, Death, and Reproduction.","One of the primary goals of epidemiology is to quantify various aspects of a population's health, illness, and death status and the determinants (or risk factors) thereof by calculating health indicators that measure the magnitudes of various conditions. There has been some confusion regarding health indicators, with discrepancies in usage among organizations such as the World Health Organization the, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the CDC of other countries, and the usage of the relevant terminology may vary across papers. Therefore, in this review, we would like to propose appropriate terminological definitions for health indicators based on the most commonly used meanings and/or the terms used by official agencies, in order to bring clarity to this area of confusion.

29485788,Psychosocial Determinants of Satisfaction with Hospital Care in Adult Patients Suffering from Advanced Cancer.,"In this observational study, direct and indirect (moderator and mediator) relationships between sociodemographic (age, gender, life partner, education level, income and length of treatment) and psychological (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS) variables and satisfaction with hospital care (EORTC INPATSAT32) in adult (advanced cancer) patients were investigated. Study sample consisted of 75 hospitalized advanced cancer patients recruited at the Zagreb University Hospital Centre and Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Centre in 2015. Statistically significant negative correlations were found between HADS and elementary school education level, as well as with all satisfaction variables (satisfaction with physicians, nurses and organization). Moderate to high and statistically significant positive correlations were found between elementary school level and all satisfaction variables. Gender and level of education appeared as significant moderator variables in the relationship between HADS and satisfaction with nurse care. There were no significant mediator effects of sociodemographic variables on the correlation between HADS and satisfaction with care. Male participants who were more disturbed emotionally were more satisfied with nurses. Participants with elementary and high school levels of education and lower scores on HADS were more satisfied with nurses, while participants with university level of education had higher HADS scores and lower level of satisfaction with nurses.",Acta clinica Croatica,2017 Jun,Croatia,2017,10
30696297,Temporal and geospatial trends of adolescent intentional overdoses with suspected suicidal intent reported to a state poison control center.,"Background: In the United States, adolescent suicide attempts are increasing. Indiana has the highest rate of adolescent suicidal ideation in the US. Using the National Poison Data System (NPDS), we analyzed Indiana's increase in suicide attempts by poisoning. Methods: Utilizing NPDS and Toxicall data repositories, we selected 10-19 year-old intentional overdose cases with suspected suicidal intent from 2006-2016. Age, sex, outcome, involved substances and case volume by weekday and month were assessed. Geospatial analysis of the proportion of cases by county was also performed. To determine the association between known social determinants of health and adolescent intentional overdose cases with suspected suicidal intent, we correlated county-wide statistics from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps dataset from 2010-2016 with the proportion of teen suicide cases by county. Results: Over the eleven years, adolescent intentional overdoses with suspected suicidal intent cases significantly increased starting in 2012 (p-value < .001). The majority of cases (73.7%) involved females with an average age of 15.96 +/- 0.27 years. Monday and Tuesday had the highest rates and Saturday had the lowest. June and July had the lowest case rate while November had the highest. The most commonly involved agents were over-the-counter analgesics and antidepressants. Geospatial analysis shows an increased number of cases in the northern third of the State. Among county statistics analyzed, only violent crime was associated, albeit intermittently, with the 11-year proportion of adolescent intentional overdoses with suspected suicidal intent by county. Conclusions: Intentional overdoses with suspected suicidal intent involving adolescent females are significantly increasing. These rates correlate with the school schedule with summer months and weekends having a lower frequency of calls. We did not find associations between county wide social determinants of care with the exception of violent crime. Further studies are needed to establish the factors that might better predict adolescents at risk for suicide.","Clinical toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.)",2019 Sep,England,2019,10
25542838,Impact of Comorbidities on Prostate Cancer Stage at Diagnosis in Florida.,"To examine the association of major types of comorbidity with late-stage prostate cancer, a random sample of 11,083 men diagnosed with prostate cancer during 2002-2007 was taken from the Florida Cancer Data System. Individual-level covariates included demographics, primary insurance payer, and comorbidity following the Elixhauser Index. Socioeconomic variables were extracted from Census 2000 data and merged to the individual level data. Provider-to-case ratio at county level was alsocomputed. Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess associations between these factors and late-stage diagnosis of prostate cancer. Higher odds of late-stage diagnosis was significantly related to presence of comorbidities, being unmarried, current smoker, uninsured, and diagnosed in not-for-profit hospitals. The study reported that the presence of certain comorbidities, specifically 10 out of the 45, was associated with late-stage prostate cancer diagnosis. Eight out of 10 significant comorbid conditions were associated with greater risk of being diagnosed at late-stage prostate cancer. On the other hand, men who had chronic pulmonary disease, and solid tumor without metastasis, were less likely to be diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer. Late-stage diagnosis was associated with comorbidity, which is often associated with increased health care utilization. The association of comorbidity with late-stage prostate cancer diagnosis suggests that individuals with significant comorbidity should be offered routine screening for prostate cancer rather than focusing only on managing symptomatic health problems.",American journal of men's health,2016 Jul,United States,2016,10
30360395,"The Influence of Stress and Anxiety on the Expectation, Perception and Memory of Dental Pain in Schoolchildren.","The aim of this study was to investigate the association of stress and anxiety with the expectation, perception and memory of dental pain among schoolchildren. A follow-up study involving 46 children aged 9 to 12 years was conducted in a public school in the city of Petropolis (RJ), Brazil. Demographic characteristics, stress (children's stress scale), and state and trait anxiety (state(-)trait anxiety inventory) were recorded before a dental procedure to restore the occlusal surface of a permanent first molar under local anaesthetic. Dental pain was assessed using the faces pain scale before (dental pain expectation), immediately after (dental pain perception) and six weeks after (memory of dental pain) the dental procedure. Dental pain expectation scores were significantly higher than dental pain perception, independent of the levels of stress, state anxiety and trait anxiety. Children with high scores of stress (OR 1.05 95%CI 1.02(-)1.09), state anxiety (OR 1.15 95%CI 1.05(-)1.27) and trait anxiety (OR 1.18 95%CI 1.07(-)1.30) were more likely to report greater scores of dental pain expectation. Children anticipated more dental pain than what was actually perceived after the dental restoration. Children with greater levels of stress and anxiety have a distorted evaluation of expected dental pain before the dental procedure.",Dentistry journal,2018 Oct 22,Switzerland,2018,10
30669940,Malnutrition in children and its determinants: a study from east India.,"Malnutrition continues to be a major killer of children, predominantly in low- and middle-income countries such as India. An ecological study was undertaken to correlate different demographic factors with the prevalence of underweight children. Based on findings from the National Family Health Survey 4 (2015-2016), 81 districts were analysed from three states in the eastern part of India. The findings suggest that female literacy (r = -0.556) and improved sanitation (r = -0.741) reduces the burden of malnutrition. Regarding childbirth, four antenatal visits (ANC), institutional deliveries, full immunisation, early breast feeding and adequate diet also reduce the degree of malnutrition among children. For preventing malnutrition, emphasis should be laid on improving social determinants and maternal health awareness.",Tropical doctor,2019 Apr,England,2019,10
27987566,Predictors and determinants for weight reduction in overweight and obese children and adolescents.,"INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, overweight and obesity are known as posing serious health risks. Successful methods for weight reduction have remained elusive. This multicenter non-randomised trial aimed to identify parameters and determinants of long-term weight reduction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 143/159 overweight and obese children and adolescents (90 %) completed the prospective multicenter trial (age 13.9+/-2.4 years, BMI 31.2+/-5.4kg/m(2), BMI-SDS 2.51+/-0.57). During a 6-week rehabilitation period the patients participated in a structured treatment and teaching program (STTP). Following in-patient treatment the children and adolescents were monitored over a period of 24 months (physical examination, measurements of BMI, BMI-SDS, body composition, carotid intima-media thickness, laboratory parameters, blood pressure, standardized questionnaires to assess socio-demographic and socio-economic parameters, eating behavior, well-being, quality of life, intelligence, intrafamilial conflicts, self-efficacy, resilience, sense of coherence, stress management, social support, actual body shape). RESULTS: 66% of the children and adolescents had abnormal laboratory parameters as well as higher blood pressure and/or an increased carotid intima-media thickness. The mean carotid intima-media thickness was 0.53+/-0.09mm (range 0.40 to 0.80); 15% of the patients showed normal range values (< 0.45mm), 40% a slightly elevated (>/= 0.45 to </= 0.50mm) and 45% an elevated (> 0.50mm) thickness. After the inpatient treatment lasting 40.4+/-4.1 (range 28 to 49) days, children and adolescents reached a mean weight reduction of 5.52+/-3.94 (0.4 to 13.3) kg (p<0.01) that was accompanied by a reduction in body fat mass. Using multivariate analyses, the most important psychological factors associated with long-term weight reduction were identified (R-square=0.53): well-being (beta=-0.543), resilience (beta=0.434), and sense of coherence (beta=0.315). CONCLUSION: The different parameters (i. e., well-being, resilience, sense of coherence) have demonstrated their utility, and strategies should be developed allowing an adaption of these into the STTPs.","Zeitschrift fur Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualitat im Gesundheitswesen",2016 Dec,Netherlands,2016,10
30263926,A multifaceted analysis of social stressors and chronic inflammation.,"Chronic stress has been linked to negative health outcomes, including increased inflammation, which can be measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP). Prior research has focused almost exclusively on relationships between individual social and demographic stressors and CRP. The objective of this study is to assess the role of multiple potential stressors simultaneously to determine which key stressors are related to risk of high CRP, given that sustained stress and resulting inflammation may have long-term health implications. We hypothesized that negative social and environmental factors would be associated with high CRP. Data from two waves of Midlife in the United States were used to predict high CRP with variable selection procedures and logistic regression. Results indicated females, those with greater BMI, those with improvements in family strain, and those with higher A1c had a greater risk of high CRP. There was limited evidence that negative social factors were associated with CRP to the extent seen in prior literature. A key advantage of the study was testing multiple potential determinants of chronic stress and inflammation simultaneously, advancing the existing literature. Results demonstrate the potential usefulness of a multifaceted approach to evaluating the risk of chronic inflammation and high CRP.",SSM - population health,2018 Dec,England,2018,10
27054013,Comparison of the Ministry of Health's tariffs with the cost of radiology services using the activity-based costing method.,"INTRODUCTION: Efficient use of resources in organizations is one of the most important duties of managers. Appropriate allocation of resources can help managers to do this well. The aim of this study was to determine the cost of radiology services and to compare it with governmental tariffs (introduced by the Ministry of Health in Iran). METHODS: This was a descriptive and applied study that was conducted using the retrospective approach. First, activity centers were identified on the basis of five main groups of hospital activities. Then, resources and resource drivers, activities, and hospital activity drivers were identified. At the next step, the activities related to the delivery of radiology process were identified. Last, through allocation of activities cost to the cost objects, the cost price of 66 services that were delivered in the radiology department were calculated. The data were collected by making checklists, using the hospital's information system, observations, and interviews. Finally, the data were analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test, Microsoft Excel, and SPSS software, version 18. RESULTS: The findings showed that from the total cost of wages, materials, and overhead obtained, the unit cost of the 66 cost objects (delivered services) in the Radiology Department were calculated using the ABC method (Price of each unit of Nephrostogram obtained $15.8 and Cystogram obtained $18.4). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated that the distribution of data of cost price using the ABC method was not normal (p = 0.000). The Wilcoxon test showed that there was a significant difference between the cost of services and the tariff of radiology services (p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The cost of delivered services in radiology departments was significantly higher than approved tariffs of the Ministry of Health, which can have a negative impact on the quality of services.",Electronic physician,2016 Feb,Iran,2016,10
31646255,Urogenital chlamydia trachomatis treatment failure with azithromycin: A meta-analysis.,"Background: Chlamydia Trachomatis is one of the most common pathogens transmitted through the genital tract in humans that leads to urogenital infection. Objective: Given the high prevalence of chlamydia infection and its adverse effects on the health of women and men, the present meta-analysis was conducted to determine the rate of treatment failure with azithromycin. Materials and Methods: Databases including MEDLINE, ISI - Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest, and Science Direct were searched for articles published between 1991 and 2018. The quality of the selected articles was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Heterogeneity was determined using the I2 and Cochrane Q-Test. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to compare the prevalence rates on different levels of the variables. Results: A total of 21 articles that met the inclusion criteria were ultimately assessed. The pooled estimate of azithromycin failure rate was 11.23% (CI 95%: 8.23%-14.24%). Also, the azithromycin failure rate was 15.87% (CI 95%: 10.20%-21.54%) for the treatment of urethritis, 7.41% (CI 95%: 0.60%-14.22%) for cervicitis, and 7.14% (CI 95%: 10.90%-3.39%) for genital chlamydia. The pooled estimate of failure rate difference was 2.37% (CI 95%: 0.68%-4.06%), which shows that azithromycin has a higher failure rate in the treatment of chlamydia compared to doxycycline and other examined medications. The meta-regression results showed that the patient's age contributes significantly to the heterogeneity for azithromycin treatment failure rate (beta25% shaded block=25% shaded block0.826; p25% shaded block=25% shaded block0.017). Conclusion: Azithromycin has a higher failure rate than doxycycline and other studied medications in treating urogenital chlamydia infections.","International journal of reproductive biomedicine (Yazd, Iran)",2019 Sep,Iran,2019,10
20051124,Bio-psychosocial determinants of time lost from work following non life threatening acute orthopaedic trauma.,"BACKGROUND: To determine factors predicting the duration of time away from work following acute orthopaedic non life threatening trauma METHODS: Prospective cohort study conducted at four hospitals in Victoria, Australia. The cohort comprised 168 patients aged 18-64 years who were working prior to the injury and sustained a range of acute unintentional orthopaedic injuries resulting in hospitalization. Baseline data was obtained by survey and medical record review. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to examine the association between potential predictors and the duration of time away from work during the six month study. The study achieved 89% follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 168 participants recruited to the study, 68% returned to work during the six month study. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified that blue collar work, negative pain attitudes with respect to work, high initial pain intensity, injury severity, older age, initial need for surgery, the presence of co-morbid health conditions at study entry and an orthopaedic injury to more than one region were associated with extended duration away from work following the injury. Participants in receipt of compensation who reported high social functioning at two weeks were 2.58 times more likely to have returned to work than similar participants reporting low social functioning. When only those who had returned to work were considered, the participant reported reason for return to work "" to fill the day"" was a significant predictor of earlier RTW [RR 2.41 (95% C.I 1.35-4.30)] whereas ""financial security"" and ""because they felt able to"" did not achieve significance. CONCLUSIONS: Many injury-related and psycho social factors affect the duration of time away from work following orthopaedic injury. Some of these are potentially modifiable and may be amenable to intervention. Further consideration of the reasons provided by participants for returning to work may provide important opportunities for social marketing approaches designed to alleviate the financial and social burden associated with work disability.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,2010 Jan 5,England,2010,10
30829593,STUDY OF BONE TISSUE REPARATION AFTER A FEMUR FRACTURE DEPENDING ON THE CORRECTION OF ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION IN MODEL OBJECT RATTUS NORVEGICUS (RAT GRAY).,"The processes of bone remodeling and regulation of blood pressure are caused by common genetic determinants underlying the development of these diseases. To solve practical medical problems, it seems relevant to carry out the correction and treatment of syntropic diseases at the same time with the aim of achieving the maximum positive effect. The most serious complication of osteoporosis is bone fractures, especially fractures of the proximal femur, which are a serious medical and social problem. The aim of our work was to evaluate the repair of bone tissue after fractures of the proximal femur with subsequent intramedullary osteosynthesis on the background of arterial hypertension and its correction. A model object was used in the work - gray rats, lines Wistar and SHR, which were operated on. For the animals of one of the groups with genetically determined arterial hypertension, correction of the above-mentioned pathology in the form of enalapril monotherapy in the postoperative period was applied. In this group, the picture of the dynamics of blood pressure indices corresponded to the cumulative effect of enalapril - after three weeks of taking the drug, the rats' systolic blood pressure indices corresponded to those of normotensive animals, and the indicators of adhesion of the fracture zone were higher than in the group of rats with arterial hypertension, which was not corrected. Adequate correction of the level of blood pressure in the postoperative period favorably affects the reparative capabilities of the bone, while at the same time increasing the chances of positive results of surgical treatment of patients.",Georgian medical news,2019 Jan,Georgia (Republic),2019,10
20621569,The determinants of misreporting weight and height: The role of social norms.,"Given the lack of availability of measured anthropometric data for the whole of Spain, this paper combines data from the 2006 Catalan Health and Health Examination Surveys to compute the size of weight and height self-reporting biases. The underlying determinants of these biases are then analyzed, placing special emphasis on the role played by social norms. Our findings show that social norms regarding ""ideal"" weight (proxied by the average weight of a reference group based on gender and age) tend to affect the self-reporting weight (relative) bias. This finding suggests that the more satisfied individuals feel with their own body image the less prone they are to under-report their weight, although this effect is contingent upon the definition of social norms and the correction of endogeneity. However, we found no evidence of a similar impact caused by the social norms governing height. The relationship found between the measured and self-reported anthropometric data was applied to the Spanish National Health Survey (NHS) so as to correct the self-reported information contained in it. After correcting for self-reporting errors, both the BMI and the prevalence of obesity were found to be significantly underestimated, with instances of misreporting being more prevalent among women.",Economics and human biology,2011 Jan,Netherlands,2011,10
29239586,Factors Associated With Nutritional Risk Among Homebound Older Adults With Depressive Symptoms.,"OBJECTIVES: This study used the Evans model of public health determinants to identify factors associated with nutritional risk in older adults. DESIGN: The Evans model domains (physical and mental well-being, social/environmental statuses, individual choice, and economic security) were measured in a sample of homebound older adults. Regularized logistic regression analysis with LASSO penalty function was used to determine the strongest domain of the Evans model. Using traditional logistic regression, individual variables across all domains were compared to identify the significant predictors. SETTING: Older adults receiving home meal services were referred to the study by community program staff. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 164 homebound older adults (age > 60) who endorsed at least one gateway symptom of depression. MEASUREMENTS: Measurements: Nutritional risk was determined using the Mini Nutritional Assessment. Domains of the Evans model were measured using the MAI Medical Condition Checklist, items from the IADL scale, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, the Duke Social Support Index, living arrangements, marital status, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, items from the SCID Screening Module, and a self-report of perceived financial security. RESULTS: Poor mental well-being, defined by a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, was identified as the strongest Evans model domain in the prediction of nutritional risk. When each variable was independently evaluated across domains, instrumental support (Wald's Z=-2.24, p=0.03) and a history of drug use (Wald's Z=-2.40, p=0.02) were significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: The Evans model is a useful conceptual framework for understanding nutritional health, with the mental domain found to be the strongest domain predictor of nutritional risk. Among individual variables across domains, having someone to help with shopping and food preparation and a history of drug use were associated with lower nutritional risk. These analyses highlight potential targets of intervention for nutritional risk among older adults.",The Journal of frailty & aging,2016,France,2016,10
26554358,Mapping the role of structural and interpersonal violence in the lives of women: implications for public health interventions and policy.,"BACKGROUND: Research on interpersonal violence towards women has commonly focused on individual or proximate-level determinants associated with violent acts ignores the roles of larger structural systems that shape interpersonal violence. Though this research has contributed to an understanding of the prevalence and consequences of violence towards women, it ignores how patterns of violence are connected to social systems and social institutions. METHODS: In this paper, we discuss the findings from a scoping review that examined: 1) how structural and symbolic violence contributes to interpersonal violence against women; and 2) the relationships between the social determinants of health and interpersonal violence against women. We used concept mapping to identify what was reported on the relationships among individual-level characteristics and population-level influence on gender-based violence against women and the consequences for women's health. Institutional ethics review was not required for this scoping review since there was no involvement or contact with human subjects. RESULTS: The different forms of violence-symbolic, structural and interpersonal-are not mutually exclusive, rather they relate to one another as they manifest in the lives of women. Structural violence is marked by deeply unequal access to the determinants of health (e.g., housing, good quality health care, and unemployment), which then create conditions where interpersonal violence can happen and which shape gendered forms of violence for women in vulnerable social positions. Our web of causation illustrates how structural factors can have negative impacts on the social determinants of health and increases the risk for interpersonal violence among women. CONCLUSION: Public health policy responses to violence against women should move beyond individual-level approaches to violence, to consider how structural and interpersonal level violence and power relations shape the 'lived experiences' of violence for women.",BMC women's health,2015 Nov 11,England,2015,10
22905076,"Psychosocial, socio-cultural, and environmental influences on mental health help-seeking among African-American men.","The social determinants unique to African-American men's health contribute to limited access and utilization of health and mental health care services and can have a deleterious effect on their overall health and well-being. There is a need to examine the complex issues concerning African-American men's help-seeking behaviors relative to mental health concerns. Current research estimates that African-American men are approximately 30% more likely to report having a mental illness compared to non-Hispanic Whites and are less likely to receive proper diagnosis and treatment. There is an extensive body of research that supports the view that women are more likely to seek help for psychological problems than African-American men. This review explores the psychosocial, environmental and socio-cultural factors that influence mental health help-seeking behavior among African-American men and explains the urgency to engage various stakeholders to pursue effective behavioral strategies. Research literature concerning the relationships between social determinants of health and their mental health help-seeking behaviors is reviewed and discussed in this paper. The article illustrates the need for mental health providers and researchers to establish feasible, culturally competent prevention and intervention strategies to increase help seeking behavior among African-American men, thereby contributing to the reduction of mental health disparities.",Journal of men's health,2012 Jun 1,Canada,2012,10
28438406,Coverage and determinants of childhood immunization in Nigeria: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The proportion of fully immunized children in Nigeria is reportedly low. There are concerns over national immunization data quality, with this possibly limiting country-wide response. We reviewed publicly available evidence on routine immunization across Nigeria to estimate national and zonal coverage of childhood immunization and associated determinants. METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, Global Health and African Journals Online (AJOL) was conducted. We included population-based studies on childhood immunization in Nigeria. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted on extracted crude rates to arrive at national and zonal pooled estimates for the country. RESULTS: Our search returned 646 hits. 21 studies covering 25 sites and 26,960 children were selected. The estimated proportion of fully immunized children in Nigeria was 34.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.0-41.9), with South-south zone having the highest at 51.5% (95% CI: 20.5-82.6), and North-west the lowest at 9.5% (95% CI: 4.6-14.4). Mother's social engagements (OR=4.0, 95% CI: 1.9-8.1) and vaccines unavailability (OR=3.9, 95% CI: 1.2-12.3) were mostly reported for low coverage. Other leading determinants were vaccine safety concerns (OR=3.0, 95% CI: 0.9-9.4), mother's low education (OR=2.5, 95% CI: 1.8-3.6) and poor information (OR=2.0, 95% CI: 0.8-4.7). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests a low coverage of childhood immunization in Nigeria. Due to the paucity of data in the Northern states, we are still uncertain of the quality of evidence presented. It is hoped that this study will prompt the needed research, public health and policy changes toward increased evenly-spread coverage of childhood immunization in the country.",Vaccine,2017 May 19,Netherlands,2017,10

27160832,Weight self-stigma and its association with quality of life and psychological distress among overweight and obese women.,"BACKGROUND: There are limiting studies evaluating the weight self-stigma and its association with eating disorders and health concerns. However, no study is available evaluating weight self-stigma and its determinants among reproductive age women in Iran. The aim of this study was to evaluate weight self-stigma and its association with quality of life and psychological distress among overweight and obese Iranian women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current cross-sectional study was performed among 170 women aged 17-45 years referring to health centers of Tabriz-Iran. Anthropometric assessments were performed. Weight self-stigma was assessed by weight self-stigma questionnaire (WSSQ). Evaluation of quality of life and psychological distress was performed using SF-12 and general health questionnaires (GHQ-12), respectively. Analysis of data was performed by multivariate hierarchical regression analysis using SPSS 18 software. RESULTS: In this study, the multivariate hierarchical regression analysis revealed that being married and having low total weight self-stigma and fear of enacted stigma (FES) scores were associated with better physical component summary scores (p < 0.05). Whereas, younger ages and lower total weight self-stigma scores were associated with better mental component summary scores. In addition, lower weight self-stigma total scores and lower self-devaluation scores were predictors of lower psychological distress. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated the negative impacts of weight self-stigma on quality of life and psychological distress among overweight and obese women. Since weight stigma might be a potent barrier of obese individuals to engage in health promoting behaviors, therefore, the results of the current study further warrants the need for developing interventional strategies to reduce the adverse impacts of weight stigma on quality of life via including the reduction of weight self-stigma as a key therapeutic goal in obesity treatment programs.",Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2017 Sep,Germany,2017,10
31875177,Efficacy of Custom-Made Appliance by the Method of CAD/CAM Compared with Conventional Dressing for Reducing Facial Swelling after Maxillofacial Surgery.,"Statement of the Problem: Swelling of the surrounding tissue of surgical site is one of the most common, devastating effects after maxillofacial surgery and can have an effect on quality of life and the patients' satisfaction. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a custom-made appliance by the method of Computer-aided design/Computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) compared with conventional dressing for reducing facial swelling after maxillofacial surgery. Materials and Method: This clinical trial accomplished in 14 patients voluntarily referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Bahonar hospital in Kerman. These patients were the candidate for surgical treatment of similar bilateral facial fractures (10 patients) and orthognathic surgery (4 patients). Facial computed tomography (CT) scans of the patients were taken to build up a custom-made appliance. Based on three-dimensional reconstruction from facial CT scan data, custom-made appliance was designed and built. Swelling on one side with custom-made appliance and on the opposite side with conventional dressing measured with paper tape graded before surgery, immediately after surgery, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7 days later, we divided the patients into two groups of trauma and orthognathic surgical procedures. Results: Based on the defined landmarks, all of the measurements were performed on both sides. Statistical analyses do not show any asymmetry before surgery (p= 0.48). In addition, there was no significant difference between two methods of dressing on the day of surgery and a day later (p= 0.084, p= 0.09), but there was a significant difference between two methods of dressing on second and seventh days. The swelling has decreased faster and further in our new method. Conclusion: Regarding the exact adaptation to the surgical site on facial skin, using custom-made appliance by the method of CAD/CAM could be an effective tool that reduces swelling after maxillofacial surgery.","Journal of dentistry (Shiraz, Iran)",2019 Dec,Iran,2019,10
28401626,A theory-informed qualitative exploration of social and environmental determinants of physical activity and dietary choices in adolescents with intellectual disabilities in their final year of school.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity is higher in those with intellectual disabilities than the general population. The aim of the study was to understand the determinants of physical activity and dietary patterns in this population during their final year of school. METHOD: Qualitative data were generated from 10 interviews with adolescents with mild-moderate intellectual disabilities. Data were analysed using deductive thematic analysis, employing Self-Determination Theory as a theoretical framework. RESULTS: Adolescents' environment and social interactions play a pivotal role in influencing physical activity and dietary patterns. Three themes emerged from the analysis: situatedness, motivation and wider environmental influences. CONCLUSIONS: School structure, high self-efficacy and social connectedness facilitate increased physical activity and healthier diet in adolescents with intellectual disabilities. Home life, low self-efficacy and a lack of social connectedness can serve as a barrier to PA and a healthy diet.",Journal of applied research in intellectual disabilities : JARID,2018 Jan,England,2018,10
22131548,Identifying potential programs and platforms to deliver multiple micronutrient interventions.,"This article reviews the potential of four broad types of platforms, health, agriculture, market-based, and social protection programs, to deliver multiple micronutrient (MMN) interventions (supplementation, fortification, and dietary modification). We assessed the platforms' potential based on seven performance criteria related to programs within these platforms: 1) targeting, 2) efficacy of interventions, 3) quality of implementation, 4) utilization, 5) impact, 6) coverage, and 7) sustainability. We highlight one type of program per platform to illustrate strengths and weaknesses for delivering MMN interventions, identify critical knowledge gaps, and highlight what is needed to increase effectiveness for delivering MMN interventions. We found that all four platforms have the potential to effectively deliver MMN interventions if the following key program elements are addressed: 1) strong behavior change communication strategies to increase demand and proper utilization of services/products; 2) supply side interventions to ensure consistent availability of high quality interventions, products, and well-trained staff; 3) rigorous evaluations of effectiveness, quality of delivery, and impact pathways to generate best practices for replication and scale-up; and 4) timely dissemination of evaluation results to ensure use by program implementers and policy makers. The diversification of delivery platforms, which simultaneously addresses multiple determinants of MMN deficiencies and expands coverage, is needed to accelerate progress in reducing MMN deficiencies.",The Journal of nutrition,2012 Jan,United States,2012,10
29761588,Infection is the chief cause of mortality and non-death censored graft loss in the first year after renal transplantation in a resource limited population: A single centre study.,"AIM: Few studies have assessed the impact of infections after renal transplantation (RTX) in low and middle income countries. This single centre study aimed to delineate the profile and impact of infections requiring hospitalization (IRH) occurring in the first year after RTX in India. METHOD: Patients who underwent RTX between July 2012 and June 2015 were followed up for 12 months after transplantation. RESULTS: 60.2% of the 387 patients studied had at least one IRH and total 492 infections were diagnosed. The most common were urinary tract (30.3%), gastrointestinal (17.1%) and pulmonary (11.2%) infections. Viral aetiology (33.3%) was most frequent, followed by bacterial (23.6%), parasitic (5.1%), tuberculosis (4.5%), and fungal infections (3.9%). 86.4% deaths were due to infections. One year patient and graft survival were inferior among recipients with IRH compared to those with no IRH: 91.8% vs. 98.1% (log rank = 0.010) and 90.1% vs. 97.4% (log rank = 0.006) respectively. Average monthly income per family member <5000 Rupees (75 USD), NODAT, and acute rejection were independent risk factors for IRH. CONCLUSION: The profile of IRH is unique involving opportunistic, community-acquired and endemic infections seen in this country. It is the predominant cause of mortality and graft loss in the first year after RTX. Poor economic status is an important determinant of IRH in our population.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2019 Apr,Australia,2019,10
25367982,Integrating public health and community development to tackle neighborhood distress and promote well-being.,"Recently there have been calls for public health to reconnect to urban planning in ways that emphasize the impact of place on health and that address fundamental causes of poor health, such as poverty, social inequality, and discrimination. Community developers have realized that poor health limits individuals' and communities' economic potential and have begun to integrate into their work such neighborhood health issues as access to fresh food and open space. In this article we review recent shifts in the community development field and give examples of programs that operate at the intersection of community development, public health, and civic engagement. For example, in Sacramento, California, the Building Healthy Communities program successfully promoted the creation of community gardens and bike paths and the redevelopment of brownfields. A major housing revitalization initiative in San Francisco, California, known as Sunnydale-Velasco, is transforming the city's largest public housing site into a mixed-income community that provides existing residents with new housing, infrastructure, services, and amenities. These examples and others illustrate the need to identify and make use of interdisciplinary approaches to ensure that all places are strong platforms for economic mobility, full democratic participation, and community health.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2014 Nov,United States,2014,10
24741117,THE EDUCATION-HEALTH GRADIENT.,"In this paper, we determine the role played by early cognitive, noncognitive, and health endowments. We identify the causal effect of education on health and health-related behaviors. We develop an empirical model of schooling choice and post-schooling outcomes, where both schooling and the outcomes determined in part by schooling are influenced by measured early family environments and latent capabilities (cognitive, noncognitive and health). We show that family background characteristics, and cognitive, noncognitive, and health endowments developed by age 10, are important determinants of labor market and health disparities at age 30. Not properly accounting for personality traits overestimates the importance of cognitive ability in determining adult health. Selection on factors determined early in life explains more than half of the observed difference by education in poor health, depression, and obesity. Education has an important causal effect in explaining differences in many adult outcomes and healthy behaviors. We uncover significant gender differences. We go beyond the current literature which typically estimates mean effects to compute distributions of treatment effects.

31889661,"[Influence of social inequalities in health on the mortality of the rural and urban population in Spain, 2007-2013].","OBJECTIVE: Describe patterns of cause of death by gender, age and territory. The causes of mortality and their possible relationships with health inequalities in the rural and urban population in Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An ecological study of the mortality data of the Spanish population between 2007 and 2013 was carried out. Mortality data were obtained from the National Statistics Institute (INE). To be able to present the data in the grouped and simplified form, the ICD-10 classification detected by the INE was coded with the classification of Disease Load defined by Murray and Lopez (1996), reduced to 21 categories of diseases. The territory variable has been determined: rural / urban, taking as a reference the cut that establishes that populations over 10,000 inhabitants are urban environments and those that are below rural environments. The chi-square test and the Bonferroni-corrected z test for qualitative factors and the Student's t-test for quantitative factors were considered. RESULTS: The results showed than the main causes of death were cardiovascular diseases with 31% (844,010) and malignant tumors with 26.7% (724,889), neuropsychiatric with 8.8% (238,330) and respiratory with 8.7% (235,448). In the rural setting, for the male gender, 52.7% (366,053) died, while 51.3% (995,470) died in the urban environment. Regarding the female gender, the cases of deaths were 47.3% (329,063) in the rural environment and 48.7% (9545.188) in the urban. Related to age, the means of the ages associated with a later death were nutritional conditions with 85.62 years. As for the earliest ages, obviating those related to the deaths of newborns, were the congenital anomalies with 25.37 years of means. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality differences were found between the 3axes of social inequality in health-age, gender and territory. Therefore, we can say that social determinants condition our life expectancy.",Semergen,2019 Dec 27,Spain,2019,10
29122094,Periconceptional Folic Acid Supplementation in Chinese Women: A Cross-sectional Study.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the status of folic acid (FA) supplementation and determinants of its use in pregnant Chinese women. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, questionnaires were used to collect information of participants and FA supplementation. Women were recruited between 6 and 12 weeks postpartum in Tianjin, China, between July 2015 and July 2016. RESULTS: A total of 1,921 women were recruited in the study. Approximately 93.1% of the study participants used FA, while 14.4% of the women taking FA from three months prior to preconception to three months post-conception. Women who took FA for three months prior to preconception through at least three months into their pregnancy were more likely to be between 30 and 34 years old (OR = 2.91, 95% CI: 1.15, 7.33), employed (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.17, 3.67), primigravida (OR = 5.20, 95% CI: 3.02, 8.96), married to spouses with an intermediate education level (OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.45, 5.89), and earn a high family income (OR = 3.19, 95% CI: 1.57, 6.49). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of periconceptional FA intake was far below the requirements of the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China; therefore, knowledge of FA supplementation should be strengthened among women who are or planning to become pregnant.",Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,2017 Oct,China,2017,10
25801593,"A systems approach to healthcare: agent-based modeling, community mental health, and population well-being.","PURPOSE: Explore whether agent-based modeling and simulation can help healthcare administrators discover interventions that increase population wellness and quality of care while, simultaneously, decreasing costs. Since important dynamics often lie in the social determinants outside the health facilities that provide services, this study thus models the problem at three levels (individuals, organizations, and society). METHODS: The study explores the utility of translating an existing (prize winning) software for modeling complex societal systems and agent's daily life activities (like a Sim City style of software), into a desired decision support system. A case study tests if the 3 levels of system modeling approach is feasible, valid, and useful. The case study involves an urban population with serious mental health and Philadelphia's Medicaid population (n=527,056), in particular. RESULTS: Section 3 explains the models using data from the case study and thereby establishes feasibility of the approach for modeling a real system. The models were trained and tuned using national epidemiologic datasets and various domain expert inputs. To avoid co-mingling of training and testing data, the simulations were then run and compared (Section 4.1) to an analysis of 250,000 Philadelphia patient hospital admissions for the year 2010 in terms of re-hospitalization rate, number of doctor visits, and days in hospital. Based on the Student t-test, deviations between simulated vs. real world outcomes are not statistically significant. Validity is thus established for the 2008-2010 timeframe. We computed models of various types of interventions that were ineffective as well as 4 categories of interventions (e.g., reduced per-nurse caseload, increased check-ins and stays, etc.) that result in improvement in well-being and cost. CONCLUSIONS: The 3 level approach appears to be useful to help health administrators sort through system complexities to find effective interventions at lower costs.",Artificial intelligence in medicine,2015 Feb,Netherlands,2015,10
20158311,Differences in anthropometric measurements between Sudanese newborn twins and singletons.,"UNLABELLED: Twin pregnancies are associated with disturbed fetal growth and a higher risk of low birthweight (LBW), which is one of the most important determinants of perinatal morbidity and mortality in Africa. In this study, we compare anthropometric measurements in Sudanese twins and their mothers with singletons. METHODS: In 1000 Sudanese mothers with singleton births and 30 mothers with twins, maternal (weight, height, mid-arm circumference) and 11 newborn anthropometric measurements were taken within 24 hours of delivery. Maternal education and socio-economic status were additionally recorded. RESULTS: Mothers of twins had a significantly higher body weight (p = .045) and lean body mass (p = .02) after delivery, and were from higher social classes in general (p = .014). In addition to gestational age, twins displayed a statistically significant reduction in all anthropometric data, compared to singletons, mainly in terms of birth-weight, chest and head circumference, whereas differences in triceps and subscapular skin fold thickness and ponderal index were distinctly lower. The LBW rate in twins was markedly higher than that in singletons (43.3% vs. 8.3%, p < .001). In 20 out of 30 twins (66.7%), Twin A weighed more than Twin B (difference (SD) of 443 (335) g), and in the remaining 10 cases (33.7%), the weight of Twin B was equal to or more than that of twin A (difference (SD) of 211 (240) g, p = .039). In unlike-sex pairs, the mean (SD) difference between Twins A and B in birthweight was 459 (481) g, which was distinctly higher, compared to same-sex pairs (boys, 180 (325) g and girls, 36 (413) g). CONCLUSIONS: Sudanese twins displayed significantly reduced anthropometric measurements compared to singletons, but to different degrees. Gender had a higher impact on birthweight in twins than in singletons.",Twin research and human genetics : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies,2010 Feb,England,2010,10
25440841,Trends and group differences in the association between educational attainment and U.S. adult mortality: implications for understanding education's causal influence.,"Has the shape of the association between educational attainment and U.S. adult mortality changed in recent decades? If so, is it changing consistently across demographic groups? What can changes in the shape of the association tell us about the possible mechanisms in play for improving health and lowering mortality risk over the adult life course? This paper develops the argument that societal technological change may have had profound effects on the importance of educational attainment - particularly advanced education - in the U.S. adult population for garnering health advantages and that these changes should be reflected in changes in the functional form of the association between educational attainment and mortality. We review the historical evidence on the changing functional form of the association, drawing on studies based in the United States, to assess whether these changes are consistent with our argument about the role of technological change. We also provide an updated analysis of these functional form patterns and trends, contrasting data from the early 21st Century with data from the late 20th Century. This updated evidence suggests that the shape of the association between educational attainment and U.S. adult mortality appears to be reflecting lower and lower adult mortality for very highly educated Americans compared to their low-educated counterparts in the 21st Century. We draw on this review and updated evidence to reflect on the question whether education's association with adult mortality has become increasingly causal in recent decades, why, and the potential research, policy, and global implications of these changes.",Social science & medicine (1982),2015 Feb,England,2015,10
22953239,2012-2025 Roadmap of I.R.Iran's Disaster Health Management.,"OBJECTIVE: In line with Iran's Comprehensive Health Sector Road Map, the National Institute of Health Research at the Tehran University of Medical Sciences developed the 2012-2025 road map of Disaster Health Management (DHM), including goals and objectives, strategies, activities and related prerequisites. This article presents the process and results of this road mapping project. METHODS: The project started with an expanded literature review followed by stakeholder analysis to assess level of interest and impact of related organizations to DHM; STEEP.V methodology to define determinants with a potential impact on Iran's HDM for duration of 2012 to 2025; strength, weakness, opportunity and threat (SWOT) analysis and formulation of goals and objectives, strategies, activities, and prerequisites. Brainstorming, group discussion and interviews with key informants were used for data collection; nominal group technique was used whenever prioritization was necessary, and Delphi panel methodology was applied for consensus development. RESULTS: STEEP.V analysis revealed the most important Social, Technological, Environmental, Economic, Political and Value-based determinants. Iran's DHM mission and vision were defined respectively as ""Mitigation from, preparedness for, response to and recovery from consequences of natural and man-made hazards at the community level as well as to the health facilities and resources of I.R.Iran"" and ""In 2025, Iran's DHM will be the most developed system in the region resulting in the least vulnerability, the highest readiness in health facilities and resources, and the highest and most effective contribution of the Iranian community to disaster resilience"", respectively. Sixteen strategies and related activities, along with the necessary prerequisites, were developed. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first attempt at comprehensive strategic planning in the field of DHM in Iran. The current framework provides Iran's health system with a list of strategies and activities to be considered in operational planning and actions. However, a dynamic process of evaluation and revision is required to ensure that Iran's health system goals are met by 2025.

27573333,Barriers and facilitators to Electronic Medical Record (EMR) use in an urban slum.,"OBJECTIVE: Rapid urbanization has led to the growth of urban slums and increased healthcare burdens for vulnerable populations. Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have the potential to improve continuity of care for slum residents, but their implementation is complicated by technical and non-technical limitations. This study sought practical insights about facilitators and barriers to EMR implementation in urban slum environments. METHOD: Descriptive qualitative method was used to explore staff perceptions about a recent open-source EMR deployment in two primary care clinics in Kibera, Nairobi. Participants were interviewed using open-ended, semi-structured questions. Content analysis was used when exploring transcribed data. RESULTS: Three major themes - systems, software, and social considerations - emerged from content analysis, with sustainability concerns prevailing. Although participants reported many systems (e.g., power, network, Internet, hardware, interoperability) and software (e.g., data integrity, confidentiality, function) challenges, social factors (e.g., identity management, training, use incentives) appeared the most important impediments to sustainability. DISCUSSION: These findings are consistent with what others have reported, especially the importance of practical barriers to EMR deployments in resource-constrained settings. Other findings contribute unique insights about social determinants of EMR impact in slum settings, including the challenge of multiple-identity management and development of meaningful incentives to staff compliance. CONCLUSIONS: This study exposes front-line experiences with opportunities and shortcomings of EMR implementations in urban slum primary care clinics. Although the promise is great, there are a number of unique system, software and social challenges that EMR advocates should address before expecting sustainable EMR use in resource-constrained settings.",International journal of medical informatics,2016 Oct,Ireland,2016,10
29210249,Closing the Gap: A Human Rights Approach towards Social Determinants of Health.,"Social determinants of health are major contributors to population health as well as health inequalities. The public perception that health inequalities that arise from these social determinants are unjust seems to be widespread across societies. Nevertheless, there is also scepticism about the progress in the implementation of actual policies to reduce health inequalities. Scholars, activists and policy makers from various disciplinary backgrounds increasingly stress the value of the human rights approach to support policies addressing health inequalities, and to hold actors in policies to address social determinants accountable for these inequalities. The 'right to health', in conjunction with the other health-related human rights, captures most elements of social determinants of health, and makes clear appeals to the governmental authorities at all levels to take action when social injustices occur. Existing judicial and non-judicial cases show us how human rights can be instrumental in addressing inequalities in health.",European journal of health law,2016 Dec,Netherlands,2016,10
31425526,Political priority and pathways to scale-up of childhood cancer care in five nations.,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing global attention to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their incorporation into universal health coverage (UHC), the factors that determine whether and how NCDs are prioritized in national health agendas and integrated into health systems remain poorly understood. Childhood cancer is a leading non-communicable cause of death in children aged 0-14 years worldwide. We investigated the political, social, and economic factors that influence health system priority-setting on childhood cancer care in a range of low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Based on in-depth qualitative case studies, we analyzed the determinants of priority-setting for childhood cancer care in El Salvador, Guatemala, Ghana, India, and the Philippines using a conceptual framework that considers four principal influences on political prioritization: political contexts, actor power, ideas, and issue characteristics. Data for the analysis derived from in-depth interviews (n = 68) with key informants involved in or impacted by childhood cancer policies and programs in participating countries, supplemented by published academic literature and available policy documents. Political priority for childhood cancer varies widely across the countries studied and is most influenced by political context and actor power dynamics. Ghana has placed relatively little national priority on childhood cancer, largely due to competing priorities and a lack of cohesion among stakeholders. In both El Salvador and Guatemala, actor power has played a central role in generating national priority for childhood cancer, where well-organized and -resourced civil society organizations have disrupted legacies of fragmented governance and financing to create priority for childhood cancer care. In India, the role of a uniquely empowered private actor was instrumental in creating political priority and establishing sustained channels of financing for childhood cancer care. In the Philippines, the childhood cancer community has capitalized on a window of opportunity to expand access and reduce disparities in childhood cancer care through the political prioritization of UHC and NCDs in current health system reforms. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of key health system actors in determining the relative political priority for childhood cancer in the countries studied points to actor power as a critical enabler of prioritization in other LMIC. Responsiveness to political contexts-in particular, rhetorical and policy priority placed on NCDs and UHC-will be crucial to efforts to place childhood cancer firmly on national health agendas. National governments must be convinced of the potential for foundational health system strengthening through attention to childhood cancer care, and the presence and capability of networked actors primed to amplify public sector investments and catalyze change on the ground.",PloS one,2019,United States,2019,10
28602619,The impact of sanitation on infectious disease and nutritional status: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Sanitation aims to sequester human feces and prevent exposure to fecal pathogens. More than 2.4 billion people worldwide lack access to improved sanitation facilities and almost one billion practice open defecation. We undertook systematic reviews and meta-analyses to compile the most recent evidence on the impact of sanitation on diarrhea, soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, trachoma, schistosomiasis, and nutritional status assessed using anthropometry. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We updated previously published reviews by following their search strategy and eligibility criteria. We searched from the previous review's end date to December 31, 2015. We conducted meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect using random-effects models and conducted subgroup analyses to assess impact of different levels of sanitation services and to explore sources of heterogeneity. We assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence from intervention studies using the Liverpool Quality Appraisal Tool (LQAT) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, respectively. A total of 171 studies met the review's inclusion criteria, including 64 studies not included in the previous reviews. Overall, the evidence suggests that sanitation is protective against diarrhea, active trachoma, some STH infections, schistosomiasis, and height-for-age, with no protective effect for other anthropometric outcomes. The evidence was generally of poor quality, heterogeneity was high, and GRADE scores ranged from very low to high. CONCLUSIONS: This review confirms positive impacts of sanitation on aspects of health. Evidence gaps remain and point to the need for research that rigorously describes sanitation implementation and type of sanitation interventions.",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,2017 Aug,Germany,2017,10
25654657,"Personal, social, and game-related correlates of active and non-active gaming among dutch gaming adolescents: survey-based multivariable, multilevel logistic regression analyses.","BACKGROUND: Playing video games contributes substantially to sedentary behavior in youth. A new generation of video games-active games-seems to be a promising alternative to sedentary games to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. At this time, little is known about correlates of active and non-active gaming among adolescents. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine potential personal, social, and game-related correlates of both active and non-active gaming in adolescents. METHODS: A survey assessing game behavior and potential personal, social, and game-related correlates was conducted among adolescents (12-16 years, N=353) recruited via schools. Multivariable, multilevel logistic regression analyses, adjusted for demographics (age, sex and educational level of adolescents), were conducted to examine personal, social, and game-related correlates of active gaming >/=1 hour per week (h/wk) and non-active gaming >7 h/wk. RESULTS: Active gaming >/=1 h/wk was significantly associated with a more positive attitude toward active gaming (OR 5.3, CI 2.4-11.8; P<.001), a less positive attitude toward non-active games (OR 0.30, CI 0.1-0.6; P=.002), a higher score on habit strength regarding gaming (OR 1.9, CI 1.2-3.2; P=.008) and having brothers/sisters (OR 6.7, CI 2.6-17.1; P<.001) and friends (OR 3.4, CI 1.4-8.4; P=.009) who spend more time on active gaming and a little bit lower score on game engagement (OR 0.95, CI 0.91-0.997; P=.04). Non-active gaming >7 h/wk was significantly associated with a more positive attitude toward non-active gaming (OR 2.6, CI 1.1-6.3; P=.035), a stronger habit regarding gaming (OR 3.0, CI 1.7-5.3; P<.001), having friends who spend more time on non-active gaming (OR 3.3, CI 1.46-7.53; P=.004), and a more positive image of a non-active gamer (OR 2, CI 1.07-3.75; P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Various factors were significantly associated with active gaming >/=1 h/wk and non-active gaming >7 h/wk. Active gaming is most strongly (negatively) associated with attitude with respect to non-active games, followed by observed active game behavior of brothers and sisters and attitude with respect to active gaming (positive associations). On the other hand, non-active gaming is most strongly associated with observed non-active game behavior of friends, habit strength regarding gaming and attitude toward non-active gaming (positive associations). Habit strength was a correlate of both active and non-active gaming, indicating that both types of gaming are habitual behaviors. Although these results should be interpreted with caution because of the limitations of the study, they do provide preliminary insights into potential correlates of active and non-active gaming that can be used for further research as well as preliminary direction for the development of effective intervention strategies for replacing non-active gaming by active gaming among adolescents.",JMIR serious games,2014 Apr 4,Canada,2014,10
31152650,A Revised Occupational Stress Measure for Popular Musicians: Pilot Test of Validity and Reliability.,"OBJECTIVE: Popular (i.e., nonclassical) musicians have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide than the general population. Occupational and financial stress have been suggested to be social determinants of musician mental health burden. A pilot study was conducted to assess the internal consistency and test-retest reliability of a revised measure of popular musician occupational stress and compare the results to those of other, previously validated instruments used in the same survey. METHODS: An online survey was emailed to a convenience sample of 150 musicians who had formerly accessed mental health services through a non-profit organization in Austin, Texas. The survey included a revised Musician Occupational Stress Scale (MOSS), a measure of financial stress, and instruments to screen for clinically significant depression, anxiety, and alcohol misuse. RESULTS: Forty musicians (26.7%) completed the initial survey and 19 completed a repeat survey 2 weeks later for the test-retest comparison. Internal consistency coefficients for individual instruments ranged from 0.86-0.92. The piloted MOSS demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.91; one-sided 95% CI >/=0.88) and test-retest reliability (r=0.86; p<0.0001). The MOSS also showed reasonable construct validity, correlating well with a single question of perceived occupational stress (rho=0.46; p<0.001) over career satisfaction (rho=-0.09; p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The individual, construct-specific measures included in this survey all demonstrated good internal consistency and test-retest reliability on examination. While the results are preliminary due to the small sample size, the MOSS psychometrically performed at a level equal to or better than other widely used and well-validated measures included in this survey.",Medical problems of performing artists,2019 Jun,United States,2019,10
22972210,[Depression of married and employed women based on social-role theory].,"PURPOSE: This study was based on social-role theory, and purposes were to investigate (1) how depression and health determinants vary with married and employed women, and (2) what factors contribute to depression according to family cycle. METHODS: A stratified convenience sample of 765 married and employed women was recruited during May to August 2010. Study variables of depression, socio-demographic threatening factors, psycho-stimulating factors, and social-role related factors were measured via a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Prevalence rate for depression was 18.6%, with highest rate (25.4%) from elementary laborers. Greater levels of depression were related to women's occupation, higher life stress, and poorer health; lower social support and vulnerable personality; higher levels of social-role related stress. From multivariate analysis, women with preadolescents were the most vulnerable to depression affected by occupation, life stress, personality, and parenting stress. These factors (except for occupational class) combined with economic status, social support, and housework unfairness were significant for depression in women with adolescents. CONCLUSION: Depression among married and employed women differs by psycho-stimulating and social role relevant factors in addition to occupational class and family life cycle. Female elementary laborers and women with children need to have the highest prioritization for community mental health programs.",Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing,2012 Aug,Korea (South),2012,10

22841803,Social determinants of breast cancer screening in urban primary care practices: a community-engaged formative study.,"BACKGROUND: The recent decline in the breast cancer mortality rate can be attributed to intensive screening and early detection efforts. However, studies have documented a decline in self-reported recent mammography use and interventions to enhance mammography utilization have yielded modest improvements. To address the root causes of breast cancer disparities and improve mammography use, interventions need to address multiple layers of patient, provider, and health system factors. OBJECTIVE: Using community-based participatory research principles, we sought to learn from women receiving care through urban primary care practices about issues surrounding mammography screening and strategies to increase screening. METHODS: We conducted five focus groups among 41 eligible women who were predominantly African American, recruited using nonprobability purposive sampling methods from urban community health centers in Baltimore, Maryland. Data are reported from three focus groups (n = 28) that provided usable data. We used the social determinants of health perspective to conduct a qualitative content analysis and interpretation of the data. RESULTS: Major obstacles to obtaining a screening mammogram were individual-level (i.e., pain from the procedure) and structural-level factors (i.e., cost, geography, convenience). Strategies to overcome obstacles could include the creation of structural mechanisms whereby women can receive a host of services during one visit to a healthcare professional's office. Important promoters of screening behavior included social-level factors such as social support, hope, and positive treatment outcomes. CONCLUSION: The social determinants of health perspective provided a unique perspective to frame barriers and promoters of mammography utilization and insights to develop interventions aimed at improving cancer control among women receiving care at urban primary care health centers.",Women's health issues : official publication of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health,2012 Sep,United States,2012,10

METHODS: Descriptive cross-sectional study. The study population included immigrants aged 18 and older residing in the Basque Country. Data from the 2014 Foreign Immigrant Population Survey (n=3,456) were used. Log-binomial regression was used to quantify the association between perceived discrimination and self-rated health before and after checking for the selected characteristics. RESULTS: Almost 1 in 10 immigrant adults reports perceiving discrimination. In adjusted analyses, the immigrants perceiving discrimination were almost were 1.92 more likely to rate their health as poor (prevalence ratio: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.44-2.56) than those who did not report discrimination. This association did not vary according to region of origin, age, sex or educational level. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived discrimination shows a consistent relationship with perceived health. Moreover, this association did not depend on the region of origin, age, sex or educational level of immigrants. These results show the need for implementing inclusive policies to eliminate individual and institutional discrimination and reduce health inequalities between the immigrant and native populations.",Gaceta sanitaria,2017 Sep - Oct,Spain,2017,10
31183195,Gender differences in health-related quality of life among patients with colorectal cancer.,"Background: Evidence has shown that colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, especially women have a lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study aimed to assess the QOL of CRC survivors as well as gender-related differences in the QOL of CRC patients in Northwest of Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in East Azarbijaban. All patients aged >/=18 years, and diagnosed with CRC regardless of its stage and plans for treatment, and also referred to teaching hospitals within a two years' time frame of 2014-2016, were included in this study. The Persian version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) was completed for each patient by two trained interviewers. Student t-test and chi(2) test were used to analyze Gender differences among patients, clinical-epidemiological characteristics, as well as the scores of QLQ-C30 dimensions. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between the score of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and gender. Results: Overall 303 patients (167 male, 136 female) with a diagnosis of CRC were included in the study. The mean age of participants was 58.16+/-13.58 years. The mean scores of physical (b=-14.80, P=0.001) and social functioning (b=-9.14, P=0.038) of women with CRC were more negatively affected than men with CRC. In addition, women had a higher mean score in pain (b=10.74, P=0.022) and fatigue (b=12.53, P=0.007) symptom subscales in comparison to men. Based on the results of multivariate linear regression analysis, gender, occupation, and adjuvant therapy can be considered as the independent and strong predictor factors of functional scale in our CRC patients. Conclusions: Women appear to be more affected than men by impaired physical and social functioning after the development of cancer, and they reported more fatigue and pain than men. Therefore, it might be advisable to consider strategies to improve the HRQOL in women.",Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2019 Jun,China,2019,10
31415203,A Framework for Increasing Equity Impact in Obesity Prevention.,"One of the most pressing unmet challenges for preventing and controlling epidemic obesity is ensuring that socially disadvantaged populations benefit from relevant public health interventions. Obesity levels are disproportionately high in ethnic minority, low-income, and other socially marginalized US population groups. Current policy, systems, and environmental change interventions target obesity-promoting aspects of physical, economic, social, and information environments but do not necessarily account for inequities in environmental contexts and, therefore, may perpetuate disparities.I propose a framework to guide practitioners and researchers in public health and other fields that contribute to obesity prevention in identifying ways to give greater priority to equity issues when undertaking policy, systems, and environmental change strategies. My core argument is that these approaches to improving options for healthy eating and physical activity should be linked to strategies that account for or directly address social determinants of health.I describe the framework rationale and elements and provide research and practice examples of its use in the US context. The approach may also apply to other health problems and in countries where similar inequities are observed.",American journal of public health,2019 Oct,United States,2019,10
22115499,Testing the WHO responsiveness concept in the Iranian mental healthcare system: a qualitative study of service users.,"BACKGROUND: Individuals' experience of interacting with the healthcare system has significant impact on their overall health and well-being. To relate patients' experiences to a common set of standards, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the concept of health system responsiveness. This study aimed to assess if the WHO responsiveness concept reflected the non-medical expectations of mental healthcare users in Teheran. METHODS: In this qualitative study, four mixed focus group discussions were formed, comprising 53 mental health service users in Tehran, Iran, in 2010. Content analysis was performed for data analysis. Responses were examined in relation to the eight domains of the WHO's responsiveness model. RESULTS: There were many commonalities between the findings of this study and the eight domains of the WHO responsiveness model, although some variations were found. Effective care was a new domain generated from our findings. In addition, the domain of prompt attention was included in two new labelled domains: attention and access to care. Participants could not differentiate autonomy from choice of healthcare provider, believing that free choice is part of autonomy. Therefore these domains were unified under the name of autonomy. The domains of quality of basic amenities, access to social support, dignity and confidentiality were considered to be important for the responsiveness concept. Some differences regarding how these domains should be defined were observed, however. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the concept of responsiveness developed by the WHO is applicable to mental health services in Iran. These findings might help policy-makers' better understanding of what is useful for the improvement of mental health services.",BMC health services research,2011 Nov 25,England,2011,10
25062996,Improved maternal health since the ICPD: 20 years of progress.,"BACKGROUND: The 1994 Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) was a turning point in the field of sexual and reproductive health--repositioning population and development programs globally in the context of reproductive rights, gender equity, and women's empowerment. PROGRESS SINCE ICPD: ICPD solidified the importance of women's health and safe motherhood alongside other health and development priorities while laying the groundwork for the Millennium Development Goals. CHALLENGES: Some goals envisioned by ICPD have been met. Others still need to be addressed. Global declines in maternal mortality are indicative of success, although improving measurement, quality of care and access to services, while addressing the social determinants that influence maternal health remain priorities. RECOMMENDATIONS: Renewed political will to address the remaining challenges is necessary for the post-2015 development agenda so that women's health throughout the world continues to be supported with ambitious, yet feasible goals that take into account the world's evolving development priorities.",Contraception,2014 Dec,United States,2014,10
28225730,The Medical-Legal Partnership Approach to Teaching Social Determinants of Health and Structural Competency in Residency Programs.,"Medical-legal partnerships (MLPs) embed civil legal services lawyers into health care settings and interprofessional health care teams delivering care to low-income or otherwise vulnerable patients and communities. MLPs present the opportunity to instill in residents a practical understanding of the social determinants of health and provide them with concrete tools to address them. MLP training helps residents develop structural competency and build the skills necessary to address barriers to health at the patient, institutional, and population levels. Through a case study, this Perspective explores how residents can address health-harming legal needs working in partnership with interprofessional health care teams that include lawyers, and illustrates how such MLP experiences can relate to competency-based Milestones that are applicable to training residents in all specialties.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2017 Mar,United States,2017,10
26962483,"Attitudes About Sexual Activity Among Postmenopausal Women in Different Ethnic Groups: A Cross-sectional Study in Jahrom, Iran.","BACKGROUND: Sexual function is affected by personal and interpersonal factors, familial and social traditions, culture, religion, menopause, and aging. So, ethnicity is a determining factor in sexual function. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of sexual dysfunction and attitudes towards sexuality in postmenopausal women among three different ethnic groups in Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 746 postmenopausal women between 50 and 89 years who referred to Honoree clinic, Jahrom in 2013. Among the study participants, 42.4% were Arab, 33.5% were Persian, and 24.1% were Lor. Data were collected about women's socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes regarding sexuality and sexual function. The descriptive statistics were used for demographic variables. Moreover, ANOVA, post hoc (LSD) was used. Besides, p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 60.10+/-6.89 years and the total mean score of Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was 19.31+/-8.5. In addition, 81.5% of the women had sexual dysfunction (FSFI <26.55) and only 147 women (18.5%) had normal sexual function (FSFI >26.55). Sexual dysfunction was 75.3% in Arabs, 83.2% in Persians, and 86.1% in Lors. Besides, the most prevalent sexual dysfunction was dyspareunia in Arabs and arousal disorder in Persians and Lors. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that sexual dysfunction is considerable among postmenopausal women. The most prevalent sexual dysfunction was dyspareunia in Arabs and arousal disorder in Persians and Lors.",Journal of reproduction & infertility,2016 Jan-Mar,Iran,2016,10
31189640,Examining non-attendance of doctor's appointments at a community clinic in Saskatoon.,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify the degree of non-attendance of medical appointments, as well as to identify the social reasons behind the missed appointments, at an inner-city primary care clinic. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review and survey. SETTING: Inner-city clinic in Saskatoon, Sask, serving a primarily low-income and First Nations population. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with appointments in the clinic between January 2016 and June 2016. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of non-attended clinic appointments and the reasons for missed appointments. RESULTS: Of the 1976 booked appointments during the study period, 487 (24.6%) appointments were not attended. Among the patients with walk-in appointments, 123 (15.5%) of them left the clinic before seeing a physician. New patients had a high rate of non-attendance (44.4% did not show up to appointments). Among those who did not attend an appointment, 19.9% of them missed more than 1 appointment; 77.8% of missed appointments were made more than a week in advance of the appointment, and 51.7% of those who missed an appointment saw a physician at the clinic at a later date (18.5 days later on average). The most common reasons for non-attendance were forgetting the appointment or feeling too sick to attend. Social determinants such as transportation were also found to play a role in non-attendance. Most survey participants stated that a telephone call reminder would aid them in keeping their appointments. CONCLUSION: Non-attendance is a multifactorial issue that causes a considerable waste of resources, limits the provision of preventive care, and negatively affects patient health. As forgetting was found to be a frequent cause of missed appointments, introducing a telephone reminder system might be an affordable and effective first measure to address non-attendance. Factors associated with poverty and other social determinants of health also affect attendance and are more challenging to address.",Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,2019 Jun,Canada,2019,10
23663501,Global health experiences of U.S. Physicians: a mixed methods survey of clinician-researchers and health policy leaders.,"BACKGROUND: Interest and participation in global health activities among U.S. medical trainees has increased sharply in recent decades, yet the global health activities of physicians who have completed residency training remain understudied. Our objectives were to assess associations between individual characteristics and patterns of post-residency global health activities across the domains of health policy, education, and research. METHODS: Cross-sectional, mixed methods national survey of 521 physicians with formal training in clinical and health services research and policy leadership. Main measures were post-residency global health activity and characteristics of this activity (location, funding, products, and perceived synergy with domestic activities). RESULTS: Most respondents (73%) hold faculty appointments across 84 U.S. medical schools and a strong plurality (46%) are trained in internal medicine. Nearly half of all respondents (44%) reported some global health activity after residency; however, the majority of this group (73%) reported spending </=10% of professional time on global health in the past year. Among those active in global health, the majority (78%) reported receiving some funding for their global health activities, and most (83%) reported at least one scholarly, educational, or other product resulting from this work. Many respondents perceived synergies between domestic and global health activities, with 85% agreeing with the statement that their global health activities had enhanced the quality of their domestic work and increased their level of involvement with vulnerable populations, health policy advocacy, or research on the social determinants of health. Despite these perceived synergies, qualitative data from in-depth interviews revealed personal and institutional barriers to sustained global health involvement, including work-family balance and a lack of specific avenues for career development in global health. CONCLUSIONS: Post-residency global health activity is common in this diverse, multi-specialty group of physicians. Although those with global health experience describe synergies with their domestic work, the lack of established career development pathways may limit the benefits of this synergy for individuals and their institutions.",Globalization and health,2013 May 11,England,2013,10
23283809,"""Normative content"" and health inequity enculturation: a logic model of men's health advocacy.","Epidemiologic studies and related literature consistently report that males have fewer years of life expectancy than females. Moreover, males experience fewer quality years of life in that they tend to live with greater rates of morbidity such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes among other conditions. Causal evidence traditionally highlights the role of biology in determining the life course for males. However, emerging literature suggests that social determinants of health play a more central role in male morbidity and mortality, and thus contribute to health inequities between the sexes. The purpose of this article is to explore core concepts of social determinants of health as they pertain to male health inequities and provide a systematic conceptualization of how society has become encultured to view these inequities as ""normative."" Strategies to improve male health are discussed using a logic model to illustrate male health advocacy in the face of the social climes of encultured health inequities.",American journal of men's health,2013 May,United States,2013,10
26679312,Conformance contrast testing between rates of pulmonary tuberculosis in Ecuadorian border areas.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate rates of cases of respiratory symptomatic subjects and the incidence rate of pulmonary tuberculosis in two border areas of Ecuador, and contrast them with official figures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional survey in the southeastern (SEBA), and the Andean southern Ecuadorian border areas (ASBA), which were conducted, respectively, in 1 598 and 2 419 persons aged over 15 years recruited over periods of three weeks. In identified respiratory symptomatic cases, a sputum sample was taken for smear testing. The results (odds ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals), were compared with local and national official figures using maximum likelihood contrasts. RESULTS: The rates of respiratory symptomatic subjects (7.7% and 5.9% in the SEBA, and ASBA, respectively) and of pulmonary tuberculosis (cumulative incidence rates of 125 and 140 per 100 000 inhabitants, in the same order) were significantly greater than the official figures (of 0.98 and 0.99% for respiratory symptomatic subjects in the SEBA and ASBA, respectively; and of 38.23 per 100 000 inhabitants for pulmonary tuberculosis in Ecuador as a whole) (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: It is necessary to reinforce both active case finding for respiratory symptomatic subject cases, and epidemiological surveillance of pulmonary tuberculosis in Ecuadorian border regions.",Salud publica de Mexico,2015 Nov-Dec,Mexico,2015,10
28972512,"Seeking an Expanded, Multidimensional Conceptual Approach to Health Literacy and Health Disparities Research.","This chapter compares the conceptual foundations of health literacy and health disparities. It details some of the conceptual differences between health literacy and health disparities and explains some similarities that suggest the need for increased research collaboration. The chapter is among the first to address the structural and social determinants of health together and explain that future research needs to assess their interactions. Overall, the chapter creates a conceptual foundation as well as challenges future scholars/practitioners to take more multidimensional approaches to assess health's determinants. The chapter also attempts to demonstrate there is nothing more practical than good theory, or clear conceptual foundations. The chapter is divided into four sections that address the following topics: three conceptual frameworks about the determinants of health; opportunities in health disparities and health literacy research; seeking an expanded, multidimensional conceptual approach to health literacy and health disparities research; as well as a conclusion. The chapter suggests there are vacuums in current research knowledge that need future attention - especially regarding the integration of health literacy and health disparities research.",Studies in health technology and informatics,2017,Netherlands,2017,10
31543562,Knowledge and Parity: Perspectives of Usage of Emergency Contraceptive Pills among Women of a Rural Area of Delhi.,"Context: Correct use of emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) may prevent up to 95% of unwanted pregnancies which may significantly decrease unsafe abortions and maternal mortality. Aims: Assessment of knowledge and use of ECPs among women and to explore factors associated with them. Materials and Methods: This was a facility-based cross-sectional study. Data were collected using a prestructured, pretested questionnaire from 381 reproductive age women (15-49 years) selected by systematic random sampling. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16 and Epi info (version 7.0.) were used for all statistical analyses. Descriptive analysis was performed, and results were expressed in terms of frequencies and percentages. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used as tests of significance in univariate analysis. Determinants of use of ECPs were identified using logistic regression. Results: Of 381 women interviewed, awareness level of ECPs (ever heard about ECPs) was found to be 34% (n = 128). Ever use of emergency contraception was reported by 38 (9.7%). Age (odds ratio [OR] = 3.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.88-4.87]), education (OR = 0.086, 95% CI [0.047-0.158]), husband's education (OR = 0.11, 95% CI [0.067-0.187]), socioeconomic status (OR = 6.14, 95% CI [3.28-11.51]), and family status (OR = 2.6, 95% CI [1.59-4.24]) were found to be significantly associated with the use of emergency contraceptives. Conclusions: The study identified that most respondents lack adequate knowledge about ECPs, and ever use of ECPs was very low. Factors that were associated with the use of ECPs were age, literacy, socioeconomic status, and knowledge about the method. Creating a sustainable awareness on ECPs and their use may serve them with power to control their parity.",Nigerian medical journal : journal of the Nigeria Medical Association,2019 May-Jun,Nigeria,2019,10
31397801,Unexpected Race and Ethnicity Differences in the US National Veterans Affairs Kidney Transplant Program.,"BACKGROUND: Racial/ethnic minorities have lower rates of deceased kidney transplantation (DDKT) and living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) in the United States. We examined whether social determinants of health (eg, demographics, cultural, psychosocial, knowledge factors) could account for differences in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Kidney Transplantation (KT) Program. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter longitudinal cohort study of 611 Veterans undergoing evaluation for KT at all National VA KT Centers (2010-2012) using an interview after KT evaluation and tracking participants via medical records through 2017. RESULTS: Hispanics were more likely to get any KT (subdistribution hazard ratios [SHR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.8 [1.2-2.8]) or DDKT (SHR [95% CI]: 2.0 [1.3-3.2]) than non-Hispanic white in univariable analysis. Social determinants of health, including marital status (SHR [95% CI]: 0.6 [0.4-0.9]), religious objection to LDKT (SHR [95% CI]: 0.6 [0.4-1.0]), and donor preference (SHR [95% CI]: 2.5 [1.2-5.1]), accounted for some racial differences, and changes to Kidney Allocation System policy (SHR [95% CI]: 0.3 [0.2-0.5]) mitigated race differences in DDKT in multivariable analysis. For LDKT, non-Hispanic African American Veterans were less likely to receive an LDKT than non-Hispanic white (SHR [95% CI]: 0.2 [0.0-0.7]), but accounting for age (SHR [95% CI]: 1.0 [0.9-1.0]), insurance (SHR [95% CI]: 5.9 [1.1-33.7]), presenting with a living donor (SHR [95% CI]: 4.1 [1.4-12.3]), dialysis duration (SHR [95% CI]: 0.3 [0.2-0.6]), network of potential donors (SHR [95% CI]: 1.0 [1.0-1.1]), self-esteem (SHR [95% CI]: 0.4 [0.2-0.8]), transplant knowledge (SHR [95% CI]: 1.3 [1.0-1.7]), and changes to Kidney Allocation System policy (SHR [95% CI]: 10.3 [2.5-42.1]) in multivariable analysis eliminated those disparities. CONCLUSIONS: The VA KT Program does not exhibit the same pattern of disparities in KT receipt as non-VA centers. Transplant centers can use identified risk factors to target patients who may need more support to ensure they receive a transplant.",Transplantation,2019 Dec,United States,2019,10
28160107,Neighborhood Characteristics Associated with Achievement and Maintenance of HIV Viral Suppression Among Persons Newly Diagnosed with HIV in New York City.,"We investigated the effect of neighborhood characteristics on achievement and maintenance of HIV viral suppression among New York City (NYC) residents aged 13 years and older diagnosed between 2006 and 2012. Individual records from the NYC HIV surveillance registry (n = 12,547) were linked to U.S. Census and American Community Survey data by census tract of residence. Multivariable proportional hazards regression models indicated the likelihood of achievement and maintenance of suppression by neighborhood characteristics including poverty, accounting for neighborhood clustering and for individual characteristics. In adjusted analyses, no neighborhood factors were associated with achievement of suppression. However, residents of high- or very-high-poverty neighborhoods were less likely than residents of low-poverty neighborhoods to maintain suppression. In conclusion, higher neighborhood poverty was associated with lesser maintenance of suppression. Assistance with post-diagnosis retention in care, antiretroviral therapy prescribing, or adherence targeted to residents of higher-poverty neighborhoods may improve maintenance of viral suppression in NYC.",AIDS and behavior,2017 Dec,United States,2017,10
25546249,Exploring diversity in socioeconomic inequalities in health among rural dwelling Canadians.,"PURPOSE: To describe the patterning of socioeconomic inequalities in health among rural dwelling women and men in a Canadian province, exploring diversity in associations by measure of socioeconomic position, health outcome, and demographic characteristics. METHODS: Baseline data from the Saskatchewan Rural Health Study was used, an ongoing prospective cohort study examining the health of rural people in Saskatchewan, Canada. Of the 11,004 eligible addresses, responses to mailed questionnaires were obtained from 4,624 (42%) households, representing 8,261 women and men. Multiple logistic regression was the primary method of analysis; generalized estimating equations were utilized to account for household clustering. Associations between 5 health outcomes (self-rated health, chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes, heart attack, high blood pressure) and 4 indicators of socioeconomic position (income, education, financial strain, occupational skill level) were assessed, with age and gender as potential effect modifiers. FINDINGS: With the exception of occupational skill level, socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators were strongly and inversely related to most health outcomes, often in a graded manner. Associations between SEP and several health outcomes were weaker for older than younger participants (heart attack, high blood pressure, lung disease) and stronger among women compared to men (high blood pressure, lung disease). CONCLUSIONS: The patterning of SEP-health associations observed in this rural Canadian sample suggests the need for health promotion strategies and policy initiatives to be broadly targeted at individuals and families occupying a wide range of socioeconomic circumstances.",The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,2015 Spring,England,2015,10
26849899,Educational class inequalities in the incidence of coronary heart disease in Europe.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of social inequalities in coronary heart disease (CHD) and to identify their major determinants in 15 European populations. METHODS: The MORGAM (MOnica Risk, Genetics, Archiving and Monograph) study comprised 49 cohorts of middle-aged European adults free of CHD (110 928 individuals) recruited mostly in the mid-1980s and 1990s, with comparable assessment of baseline risk and follow-up procedures. We derived three educational classes accounting for birth cohorts and used regression-based inequality measures of absolute differences in CHD rates and HRs (ie, Relative Index of Inequality, RII) for the least versus the most educated individuals. RESULTS: N=6522 first CHD events occurred during a median follow-up of 12 years. Educational class inequalities accounted for 343 and 170 additional CHD events per 100 000 person-years in the least educated men and women compared with the most educated, respectively. These figures corresponded to 48% and 71% of the average event rates in each gender group. Inequalities in CHD mortality were mainly driven by incidence in the Nordic countries, Scotland and Lithuania, and by 28-day case-fatality in the remaining central/South European populations. The pooled RIIs were 1.6 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.8) in men and 2.0 (1.7 to 2.4) in women, consistently across population. Risk factors accounted for a third of inequalities in CHD incidence; smoking was the major mediator in men, and High-Density-Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in women. CONCLUSIONS: Social inequalities in CHD are still widespread in Europe. Since the major determinants of inequalities followed geographical and gender-specific patterns, European-level interventions should be tailored across different European regions.",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2016 Jun 15,England,2016,10
28673911,The role of physiological traits in assortment among and within fish shoals.,"Individuals of gregarious species often group with conspecifics to which they are phenotypically similar. This among-group assortment has been studied for body size, sex and relatedness. However, the role of physiological traits has been largely overlooked. Here, we discuss mechanisms by which physiological traits-particularly those related to metabolism and locomotor performance-may result in phenotypic assortment not only among but also within animal groups. At the among-group level, varying combinations of passive assortment, active assortment, phenotypic plasticity and selective mortality may generate phenotypic differences among groups. Even within groups, however, individual variation in energy requirements, aerobic and anaerobic capacity, neurological lateralization and tolerance to environmental stressors are likely to produce differences in the spatial location of individuals or associations between group-mates with specific physiological phenotypes. Owing to the greater availability of empirical research, we focus on groups of fishes (i.e. shoals and schools). Increased knowledge of physiological mechanisms influencing among- and within-group assortment will enhance our understanding of fundamental concepts regarding optimal group size, predator avoidance, group cohesion, information transfer, life-history strategies and the evolutionary effects of group membership. In a broader perspective, predicting animal responses to environmental change will be impossible without a comprehensive understanding of the physiological basis of the formation and functioning of animal social groups.This article is part of the themed issue 'Physiological determinants of social behaviour in animals'.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

24349356,"Disparities in HIV screening among pregnant women--El Salvador, 2011.","OBJECTIVES: To provide an accurate estimate of antenatal HIV screening and its determinants among pregnant women in El Salvador and help local authorities make informed decisions for targeted interventions around mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). METHODS: A total sample of 4,730 women aged 15-49 years were interviewed from a random sample of 3,625 households. We collected data on antenatal care services, including HIV screening, during last pregnancy through a pre-established questionnaire. We used a backward elimination multivariate logistic regression model to examine the association between HIV screening and sociodemographic and health care-related factors. RESULTS: A total of 2,929 women were included in this analysis. About 98% of participants reported receiving antenatal care, but only 83% of these reported being screened for HIV. Screening was lower in geographic areas with higher HIV incidence and ranged from 69.1% among women who were not seen by a physician during antenatal care, to 93.7% among those who attended or completed college. Odds for screening varied also by age, employment status, household economic expenditure, possession of health care coverage, health care settings, and number of antenatal care visits. CONCLUSIONS: We found disparities in HIV screening during antenatal care at the environmental, social, demographic, and structural levels despite a high uptake of antenatal care in El Salvador. Our findings should urge health authorities to tailor and enhance current strategies implemented to eliminate MTCT and reduce inequities and HIV morbidity among women in El Salvador.",PloS one,2013,United States,2013,10
28778331,Self-rated health and all-cause and cause-specific mortality of older adults: Individual data meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies in the CHANCES Consortium.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate, among the elderly, the association of self-rated health (SRH) with mortality, and to identify determinants of self-rating health as ""at-least-good"". STUDY DESIGN: Individual data on SRH and important covariates were obtained for 424,791 European and United States residents, >/=60 years at recruitment (1982-2008), in eight prospective studies in the Consortium on Health and Ageing: Network of Cohorts in Europe and the United States (CHANCES). In each study, adjusted mortality ratios (hazard ratios, HRs) in relation to SRH were calculated and subsequently combined with random-effect meta-analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality. RESULTS: Within the median 12.5 years of follow-up, 93,014 (22%) deaths occurred. SRH ""fair"" or ""poor"" vs. ""at-least-good"" was associated with increased mortality: HRs 1.46 (95% CI 1.23-1.74) and 2.31 (1.79-2.99), respectively. These associations were evident: for cardiovascular and, to a lesser extent, cancer mortality, and within-study, within-subgroup analyses. Accounting for lifestyle, sociodemographic, somatometric factors and, subsequently, for medical history explained only a modest amount of the unadjusted associations. Factors favourably associated with SRH were: sex (males), age (younger-old), education (high), marital status (married/cohabiting), physical activity (active), body mass index (non-obese), alcohol consumption (low to moderate) and previous morbidity (absence). CONCLUSION: SRH provides a quick and simple tool for assessing health and identifying groups of elders at risk of early mortality that may be useful also in clinical settings. Modifying determinants of favourably rating health, e.g. by increasing physical activity and/or by eliminating obesity, may be important for older adults to ""feel healthy"" and ""be healthy"".",Maturitas,2017 Sep,Ireland,2017,10
30242869,Association of single nucleotide autophagy-related protein 5 gene polymorphism rs2245214 with susceptibility to non-small cell lung cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Autophagy is a mechanism that is involved in the regulation of cellular life, apoptosis, and stemness while its intervening genes play important functions in various cancers including lung cancer. ATG5 is one of the key genes for the regulation of the autophagy pathway. In this study, our team has investigated the potential relationship between ATG5 gene polymorphism rs2245214 with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a subpopulation of patients from southern Iran. In this study, 34 patients with NSCLC (20 males and 14 females [mean age: 12.86 +/- 60.47 years]) and 50 healthy subjects (30 males and 20 females [mean age: 13.09 +/- 56.62 years]) were studied in terms of the genotype of the ATG5 gene. We used restriction fragment length polymorphism and analyzed the results using SPSS software (v.23). The results revealed that subjects harboring the guanine/cytosine (GC) genotype of the rs2245214 ATG5 gene polymorphism had suffered less from NSCLC, whereas the prevalence of the C-allele of this polymorphism was significantly higher in patients with NSCLC ( P < 0.05). On the basis of the results of logistic regression, the presence of this C-allele may predict the risk of lung cancer ( P value = 0.011; OR, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.33-9.26). This study concludes that the C-allele of the rs2245214 ATG5 gene polymorphism is associated with increased susceptibility to NSCLC, whereas the GC genotype of this polymorphism is associated with decreased risk and might therefore have a protective role in the development of NSCLC.",Journal of cellular biochemistry,2018 Sep 22,United States,2018,10
31549551,"The Washtenaw ID Project: A Government-Issued ID Coalition Working Toward Social, Economic, and Racial Justice and Health Equity.","Introduction. The policing of identities through policies that restrict access to IDs issued by U.S. governmental entities disparately affects communities of color; communities who identify as low-income, immigrant, older, and/or transgender; and community members who experience chronic mental illness, housing instability, or incarceration. Yet government-issued IDs are increasingly needed to access health-promoting resources such as housing, banking, social services, and health care, and in interactions with law enforcement. Methods. Since 2012, the Washtenaw ID Project's coalition-building process has involved communities affected by restrictive ID policies, advocates, and institutional stakeholders to enact community and systems change regarding inequities in government-issued IDs. We discuss the coalition-building process that culminated in the implementation of a photo ID issued by Washtenaw County government as a policy change strategy. We also highlight the community-academic research partnership evaluating the effectiveness of the Washtenaw ID in order to ensure equity in Washtenaw ID access and acceptance. Results. In 2015, 77% of Washtenaw ID holders reported having no other locally accepted ID. At follow-up, Washtenaw ID holders reported favorable Washtenaw ID acceptance rates in several domains (e.g., health care, school), but not when accessing banking services and housing. Additionally, community discussions suggested racial inequities in carding and ID acceptance. We discuss next steps for policy improvement to ensure equitable impact of the ID. Conclusions. Without national policy reform instating access to government-issued IDs for all, the social movement to establish local IDs may improve access to health-related resources contingent on having an ID. Careful attention must be paid to community organizing processes, policy implementation, and evaluation to ensure equity.",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,2019 Oct,United States,2019,10
21734308,Environmental determinants of children's physical activity in residential children's homes.,"BACKGROUND: Children in residential children's homes (RCH) may be at increased risk for physical inactivity due to decreased access to opportunities for activity. Little is known about environmental determinants of physical activity for children in RCH.

A staff interview, based on the Structural Ecologic Model of Health Behavior, assessed physical activity opportunities, structures, characteristics, policies, and social environment. Wilcoxon 2-sample tests were used to examine differences in environment by location and presence of a recreation director. Mixed model ANOVAs assessed the differences in child level activity by environmental variables. RESULTS: There were significant correlations between opportunities and characteristics of physical activity, facilities, and equipment with total METS for children. Children in homes with a recreation director and homes in rural locations reported more physical activity. Only rural location had a significant effect on physical activity. Presence of a recreation director was significant in several models. CONCLUSIONS: Rural location may be conducive for increased physical activity in children at RCH. Employing a recreation director or other trained personnel may be an important policy determinant of physical activity for children.",Journal of physical activity & health,2011 Jul,United States,2011,10
26794158,Social Determinants of HIV-Related Stigma in Faith-Based Organizations.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between social factors in faith-based settings (including religiosity and proximity to people living with HIV/AIDS) and HIV stigma. METHODS: A total of 1747 congregants from primarily African American faith-based organizations of Project FAITH (Fostering AIDS Initiatives That Heal), a South Carolina statewide initiative to address HIV-related stigma, completed a survey. RESULTS: Female gender (P = .001), higher education (P < .001), knowing someone with HIV/AIDS (P = .01), and knowing someone who is gay (P < .001), but not religiosity, were associated with lower levels of stigma and with lower odds of stigmatizing attitudes (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities for connection with people living with HIV/AIDS tailored to the social characteristics of faith-based organizations may address HIV stigma in African American communities.",American journal of public health,2016 Mar,United States,2016,10
31158243,Understanding the determinants of maternal mortality: An observational study using the Indonesian Population Census.,"BACKGROUND: For countries to contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 of reducing the global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, identifying the drivers of maternal mortality is critically important. The ability of countries to identify the key drivers is however hampered by the lack of data sources with sufficient observations of maternal death to allow a rigorous analysis of its determinants. This paper overcomes this problem by utilising census data. In the context of Indonesia, we merge individual-level data on pregnancy-related deaths and households' socio-economic status from the 2010 Indonesian population census with detailed data on the availability and quality of local health services from the Village Census. We use these data to test the hypothesis that health service access and quality are important determinants of maternal death and explain the differences between high maternal mortality and low maternal mortality provinces. METHODS: The 2010 Indonesian Population Census identifies 8075 pregnancy-related deaths and 5,866,791 live births. Multilevel logistic regression is used to analyse the impacts of demographic characteristics and the existence of, distance to and quality of health services on the likelihood of maternal death. Decomposition analysis quantifies the extent to which the difference in maternal mortality ratios between high and low performing provinces can be explained by demographic and health service characteristics. FINDINGS: Health service access and characteristics account for 23% (CI: 17.2% to 28.5%) of the difference in maternal mortality ratios between high and low-performing provinces. The most important contributors are the number of doctors working at the community health centre (8.6%), the number of doctors in the village (6.9%) and distance to the nearest hospital (5.9%). Distance to health clinics and the number of midwives at community health centres and village health posts are not significant contributors, nor is socio-economic status. If the same level of access to doctors and hospitals in lower maternal mortality Java-Bali was provided to the higher maternal mortality Outer Islands of Indonesia, our model predicts 44 deaths would be averted per 100,000 pregnancies. CONCLUSION: Indonesia has employed a strategy over the past several decades of increasing the supply of midwives as a way of decreasing maternal mortality. While there is evidence of reductions in maternal mortality continuing to accrue from the provision of midwife services at village health posts, our findings suggest that further reductions in maternal mortality in Indonesia may require a change of focus to increasing the supply of doctors and access to hospitals. If data on maternal death is collected in a subsequent census, future research using two waves of census data would prove a useful validation of the results found here. Similar research using census data from other countries is also likely to be fruitful.",PloS one,2019,United States,2019,10
26349447,Determinant factors of the difference between self-reported weight and measured weight among Japanese.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the difference between self-reported and measured weight values in Japanese men and women and to determine the underlying determinants of the differences between self-reported and measured values. METHODS: The data were collected from 363 general Japanese individuals aged 16-88 years living in Kumamoto prefecture. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire designed for this study with self-reported weight and height values. Measured weight and height were measured immediately after questionnaire completion. Paired t-tests identified differences between self-reported and measured values by sex. Multiple-stepwise regression analysis examined the independent variables' effects on the differences between self-reported and measured weights. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between self-reported and measured values for both sexes (p < 0.001). There was a significant negative relationship between the difference in an individual's self-reported and measured weight in each sex, with higher measured weight individuals more likely to underestimate their weight. Multiple-stepwise regression analysis models explained 12.1 % (p < 0.01), 11.3 % (p < 0.01), and 5.6 % (p < 0.01) of the variance in all participants, men, and women, respectively. Significant effects were found for age, weight measurement frequency, and measured weight in total participants, weight measurement frequency, and measured weight for men, and age for women. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the mean absolute value of the weight and height variances proved the unreliability of self-reported weight and height values. This study's findings suggest self-reported weight inaccuracy especially for obese populations. This should be adjusted when using it in epidemiological studies and healthcare planning.",Environmental health and preventive medicine,2015 Nov,England,2015,10
30715291,Understanding of researcher behavior is required to improve data reliability.,"BACKGROUND: A lack of data reproducibility (""reproducibility crisis"") has been extensively debated across many academic disciplines. RESULTS: Although a reproducibility crisis is widely perceived, conclusive data on the scale of the problem and the underlying reasons are largely lacking. The debate is primarily focused on methodological issues. However, examples such as the use of misidentified cell lines illustrate that the availability of reliable methods does not guarantee good practice. Moreover, research is often characterized by a lack of established methods. Despite the crucial importance of researcher conduct, research and conclusive data on the determinants of researcher behavior are widely missing. CONCLUSION: Meta-research that establishes an understanding of the factors that determine researcher behavior is urgently needed. This knowledge can then be used to implement and iteratively improve measures that incentivize researchers to apply the highest standards, resulting in high-quality data.",GigaScience,2019 May 1,United States,2019,10
24385659,"Integrating the 3Ds--social determinants, health disparities, and health-care workforce diversity.","The established relationships among social determinants of health (SDH), health disparities, and race/ethnicity highlight the need for health-care professionals to adequately address SDH in their encounters with patients. The ethnic demographic transition slated to occur during the next several decades in the United States will have numerous effects on the health-care sector, particularly as it pertains to the need for a more diverse and culturally aware workforce. In recent years, a substantial body of literature has developed, exploring the extent to which diversity in the health-care workforce may be used as a tool to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care in the U.S. We explore existing literature on this topic, propose a conceptual framework, and identify next steps in health-care policy for reducing and eliminating health disparities by addressing SDH and diversification of the health-care workforce.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2014 Jan-Feb,United States,2014,10

METHODS: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 66 adults and participatory workshops with 27 teenagers and analyzed through content analysis techniques. Systematized results were discussed at local meetings, and two risk communication initiatives were devised. RESULTS: Study results demonstrated the use of defensive strategies by men and a diminished risk perception among women. Teenagers relied on parents to develop their own work practices. These findings supported the importance of cultural and social determinants of farmers' understandings of risk and of the relevance of different pesticide exposure pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Risk perceptions and work practices are strongly influenced by local cultural patterns and, therefore, must be taken into account when developing effective intervention strategies, including risk communication initiatives.",American journal of industrial medicine,2013 Jan,United States,2013,10
25808022,Diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation.,"The article analyzes the diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation in Norway, using municipality data over a 24-year period (1988-2011). Research has found substantial spatial heterogeneity in this phenomenon but also substantial spatial correlation, and the prevalence of childbearing within cohabitation has increased significantly over time. We consider several theoretical perspectives and implement a spatial panel model that allows accounting for autocorrelation not only on the dependent variable but also on key explanatory variables, and hence identifies the key determinants of diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation across space and over time. We find only partial support for the second demographic transition as a theory able to explain the diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation. Our results show that at least in the first phase of the diffusion (1988-1997), economic difficulties as measured by increased unemployment among men contributed to the diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation. However, the most important driver for childbearing within cohabitation is expansion in education for women.",Demography,2015 Apr,United States,2015,10
31037591,The role of religious coping and social support on medication adherence and quality of life among the elderly with type 2 diabetes.,"PURPOSE: Type 2 diabetes is a major public health issue particularly in the elderly. Religion may affect the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in such patients, mediated by factors such as religious coping and social support. This study aimed to investigate the impact of religiosity on medication adherence and HRQoL. METHODS: 793 adults (> 65 years old, 45% females) were recruited from 4 diabetes care centers and followed for 1 year. Duke University Religion Index, Spiritual Coping Strategies, Multidimensional Perceived Social Support, Medication Adherence Report Scale, WHOQOL-BREF and Diabetes-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire Module were used for assessment, as well as HbA1c and fasting blood glucose level. Using structural equation modeling, the potential paths were tested between religiosity, medication adherence and HRQoL; social support, religious coping and medication adherence served as the mediators. RESULTS: Religious coping and social support were recognized as the significant mediators between religiosity and medication adherence (CFI = 0.983, TLI = 0.985, and RMSEA = 0.021). The relationships between religiosity and HRQoL were considerably mediated by social support, religious coping and medication adherence and these variables explained 12% and 33% of variances of generic and specific HRQoL, respectively. There was no significant direct effect of religiosity on HRQoL. HbA1c and fasting blood glucose level were successfully loaded on the latent construct of medication adherence (factor loading = 0.51 and 0.44, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of religiosity on medication adherence and HRQoL occurs through the mediators such as religious coping and social support. Therefore, to improve the adherence to treatment and quality of life, interventions may be designed based on these mediators.","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2019 Aug,Netherlands,2019,10
23462435,Early childhood caries and body mass index in young children from low income families.,"The relationship between early childhood caries (ECC) and obesity is controversial. This cross-sectional survey investigated this association in children from low-income families in Goiania, Goias, Brazil and considered the role of several social determinants. A questionnaire examining the characteristics of the children and their families was administered to the primary caregiver during home visits. In addition, children (approximately 6 years of age) had their height, weight, and tooth condition assessed. The primary ECC outcome was categorized as one of the following: caries experience (decayed, missing, filled tooth: ""dmft"" index > 0), active ECC (decayed teeth > 0), or active severe ECC (decayed teeth >/= 6). Descriptive, bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted. The participants in the current study consisted of 269 caregiver-child dyads, 88.5% of whom were included in the Family Health Program. Caregivers were mostly mothers (67.7%), were 35.3 +/- 10.0 years old on average and had 9.8 +/- 3.1 years of formal education. The mean family income was 2.3 +/- 1.5 times greater than the Brazilian minimum wage. On average, the children in the current study were 68.7 +/- 3.8 months old. Of these, 51.7% were boys, 23.4% were overweight or obese, 45.0% had active ECC, and 17.1% had severe ECC. The average body mass index (BMI) of the children was 15.9 +/- 2.2, and their dmft index was 2.5 +/- 3.2. BMI was not associated with any of the three categories of dental caries (p > 0.05). In contrast, higher family incomes were significantly associated with the lack of caries experience in children (OR 1.22, 95%CI 1.01-1.50), but the mother's level of education was not significantly associated with ECC.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2013 Mar 5,Switzerland,2013,10
22240450,"Determinants, self-management strategies and interventions for hope in people with mental disorders: systematic search and narrative review.","Developing a recovery focus in mental health services is a policy goal internationally, and hope is a central component of recovery. Yet determinants of hope of people with mental disorders are not well known, nor are strategies and interventions that increase hope. This study aims to systematically summarise the available evidence to fill four relevant knowledge gaps: (1) hope scales used in psychiatric research, (2) determinants of hope, (2) hope-fostering self-management strategies, and (3) interventions to increase hope for people with mental disorders. We conducted a systematic literature search in April 2011 and a narrative synthesis of publications including qualitative and quantitative studies. Results for the first time provide a comprehensive overview of existing evidence and identify important scientific knowledge gaps: (1) Hope scales used do slightly vary in focus but are overall comparable. (2) Most published research used cross-sectional designs resulting in a high number of potential determinants of hope. No studies prospectively investigated the influence of these determinants. (3) Hope fostering self-management strategies of people with mental disorders were described in qualitative studies only with experimental studies completely missing. (4) While some recovery oriented interventions were shown to increase hope as a secondary outcome, there are no successful interventions specifically aimed at increasing hope. This review provides the basis for both practical and research recommendations: The five most promising candidate interventions to improve hope in people with mental disorders are (i) collaborative strategies for illness management, (ii) fostering relationships, (iii) peer support, (iv) helping clients to assume control and to formulate and pursue realistic goals, and (v) specific interventions to support multiple positive factors such as self-esteem, self-efficacy, spirituality and well-being. These may serve to directly improve care and to develop theory-based models and testable interventions to improve hope in mental health as well as in allied fields.",Social science & medicine (1982),2012 Feb,England,2012,10
22438937,Social determinants of health and tobacco use in thirteen low and middle income countries: evidence from Global Adult Tobacco Survey.,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco use has been identified as the single biggest cause of inequality in morbidity. The objective of this study is to examine the role of social determinants on current tobacco use in thirteen low-and-middle income countries. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used nationally representative data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) conducted during 2008-2010 in 13 low-and-middle income countries: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russian Federation, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, and Viet Nam. These surveys provided information on 209,027 respondent's aged 15 years and above and the country datasets were analyzed individually for estimating current tobacco use across various socio-demographic factors (gender, age, place of residence, education, wealth index, and knowledge on harmful effects of smoking). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to predict the impact of these determinants on current tobacco use status. Current tobacco use was defined as current smoking or use of smokeless tobacco, either daily or occasionally. Former smokers were excluded from the analysis. Adjusted odds ratios for current tobacco use after controlling other cofactors, was significantly higher for males across all countries and for urban areas in eight of the 13 countries. For educational level, the trend was significant in Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Philippines and Thailand demonstrating decreasing prevalence of tobacco use with increasing levels of education. For wealth index, the trend of decreasing prevalence of tobacco use with increasing wealth was significant for Bangladesh, India, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay and Viet Nam. The trend of decreasing prevalence with increasing levels of knowledge on harmful effects of smoking was significant in China, India, Philippines, Poland, Russian Federation, Thailand, Ukraine and Viet Nam. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate a significant but varied role of social determinants on current tobacco use within and across countries.",PloS one,2012,United States,2012,10
28747143,"The relationship between physical activity, fitness, physical complaints and BMI in German adults - results of a longitudinal study.","OBJECTIVES: This study's aims were to describe the development of physical activity, physical fitness (PF), subjective (physical complaints (PC)) and objective (Body mass index (BMI)) health measures and to examine the relationship between the development trajectories. In addition, the study also aimed to assess the influence of sociodemographic determinants (age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES)) in German adults over a period of 18 years. METHODS: The longitudinal study population comprises of 721 men and women, aged 33-76 years over the study period. There was self-report of physical activity and PC and testing of physical fitness and BMI in each study year (1992, 1997, 2002 and 2010). Latent growth curve models were used to analyse the development. RESULTS: Physical activity slightly increased while fitness, PC and BMI worsened over the course of 18 years. Sex, age and SES play important roles concerning physical activity, fitness and health. Several integrative associations could be detected between physical activity, fitness, PC and BMI as well as their trajectories. In particular, high initial levels of physical activity and fitness protect from high PC and BMI.The slope of physical activity was not significantly associated with slopes of fitness, PC and BMI. However, increase of fitness resulted in decrease of PC. CONCLUSIONS: A general positive development regarding the amount of physical activity could be detected. However, if it is only an unsystematic increase of physical activity, this is not in itself enough to achieve health benefits. The strengthening of fitness should be focused when increasing physical activity, since only then a health benefit is possible.",European journal of sport science,2017 Sep,England,2017,10
29423357,Reaching consensus: a review on sexual health training modules for professional capacity building.,"Background: Professional capacity building (PCB) is the focus point in health-related subjects.The present study was conducted to systematically review the existing sexual health training modules for health care providers. Methods: The following keywords were used to search: training, education, professional capacity, practitioner, sexual health, skill education, module, course, package and curriculum.The term MESH is referred to Medical Subject Headings and the following databases were investigated: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), The Cochrane Library and Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, SID,Magiran, and Iranmedex. All articles from 1980 to 2015 were extracted. Online modules were excluded. Considering that lesson plan was the basis of instruction, the modules were selected based on the characteristics of the lesson plans. Results: A total number of 38 published training modules in the field of sexuality we redetermined. In total, more than half of the modules (58%) were designed for medical doctor sand allied health professionals and the remaining (42%) were for nurses and midwives. Almost all the modules (97%) were introduced and utilized in developed countries, and only 3% were disseminated in developing countries. Conclusion: There are invaluable modules to build professional capacity in the field of sexual health. As a number of modules have been designed for nurses and midwifes, as the first-line health care providers, the use of these groups in sexual counseling and empowerment for sexual health is essential. No sexual health training program was designed in Iran. Therefore, designing such modules according to Iranian culture is strongly recommended.",Health promotion perspectives,2018,Iran,2018,10

We carried out a trend analysis on data coming from three waves of data collected in 32 countries (mostly European) from 2002 to 2010 coming from the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children surveys. METHODS: SRH in adolescents was assessed using a Likert scale (excellent, good, fair and poor). Responses were dichotomized into 'excellent' vs. 'rest'. Country, age and gender groups were compared based on the odds ratio of declaring excellent SRH in 2010 with respect to 2002 and 2006. RESULTS: The trend for European adolescents indicates an improvement over the last decade, although, in the majority of countries, a higher proportion of adolescents rate their health as excellent during the period 2002-06 with respect to the second half of the decade (2006-10).Girls were found to constantly rate their health as poorer, compared to their male peers, in all countries. Age has also a very stable trend towards a decreasing rating of health with increasing age. CONCLUSION: Decreased rating of health in the period 2006-10 may be a signal of the socio-economic difficulties of Europe in the last part of this decade.",European journal of public health,2015 Apr,England,2015,10
28706605,Embryonic Stem Cell Conditioned Medium Supports In Vitro Maturation of Mouse Oocytes.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the maturation and fertilization rates of immature mouse oocytes using Embryonic Stem Cell Conditioned Medium (ESCM). METHODS: Germinal Vesicle (GV) stage oocytes were observed in 120 NMRI mice, aged 4-6 weeks. GV oocytes with or without cumulus cells were subjected to IVM in either ESCM, Embryonic Stem Cell Growth Medium (ESGM), or alpha-minimum essential medium (alpha-MEM). After recording the Metaphase II (MII) oocyte maturation rate, the oocytes were fertilized in vitro. The fertilization success rate was recorded after 24 hr. The embryos were maintained in potassium Simplex Optimization Medium (KSOM) for 96 hr and allowed to grow until the blastocyst stage. After recording developmental competence, they were transferred into the uteri of pseudopregnant mice and their birth rates were recorded. RESULTS: No significant difference existed between the maturation rates in alpha-MEM (68.18%) and ESCM (64.67%; p>0.05), whereas this rate was significantly higher for both alpha-MEM and ESCM compared to ESGM (32.22%; p<0.05). A significant difference in IVF success rate existed for oocytes grown in alpha-MEM (69.44%), ESCM (61.53%), and ESGM (0%). A significantly higher developmental competence was observed at the blastocyst stage for oocytes grown in alpha-MEM (51.2%) compared to ESCM (35%; p<0.05). 17 days after embryo transfer into the uteri of pseudopregnant mice, there was a nonsignficant (p>0.05), similar birth rate between alpha-MEM and ESCM (47 vs. 40%). CONCLUSION: ESCM is an effective medium for preantral follicle growth, oocyte maturation, and subsequent embryo development.",Avicenna journal of medical biotechnology,2017 Jul-Sep,Iran,2017,10
26682228,Participant Experiences in the Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young Study: Common Reasons for Withdrawing.,"BACKGROUND: To characterize participant reasons for withdrawing from a diabetes focused longitudinal clinical observational trial (TEDDY) during the first three study years. METHODS: 8677 children were recruited into the TEDDY study. At participant withdrawal staff recorded any reason parents provided for withdrawal. Reasons were categorized into (1) family characteristics and (2) protocol reasons. Families who informed staff of their withdrawal were classified as active withdrawals (AW); families without a final contact were considered passive withdrawals (PW). RESULTS: Withdrawal was highest during the first study year (n = 1220). Most families were AW (n = 1549; 73.4%). PW was more common in the United States (n = 1001; 37.8%) and among young mothers (p = 0.001). The most frequent protocol characteristic was blood draw (55%) and the most common family reason was not having enough time (66%). The blood draw was more common among female participants; being too busy was more common among males. Both reasons were associated with study satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that, for families of children genetically at risk for diabetes, procedures that can be painful/frightening should be used with caution. Study procedures must also be considered for the demands placed on participants. Study satisfaction should be regularly assessed as an indicator of risk for withdrawal.",Journal of diabetes research,2016,England,2016,10
29746005,The art of cardiovascular risk assessment.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Healthcare expenditures have been principally allocated toward treatment of CVD at the end of the health/disease continuum, rather than toward health promotion and disease prevention. A focused effort on both primordial and primary prevention can promote cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of CVD. Risk-factor assessment for predicting atherosclerotic CVD events serves as the foundation of preventive cardiology and has been driven by population-based scoring algorithms based on traditional risk factors. Incorporating individual nontraditional risk factors, biomarkers, and selective use of noninvasive measures may help identify more at-risk patients as well as truly low-risk individuals, allowing for better targeting of treatment intensity. Using a combination of validated population-based atherosclerotic CVD risk-assessment tools, nontraditional risk factors, social health determinants, and novel markers of atherosclerotic disease, we should be able to improve our ability to assess CVD risk. Through scientific evidence, clinical judgment, and discussion between the patient and clinician, we can implement an effective evidence-based strategy to assess and reduce CVD risk.",Clinical cardiology,2018 May,United States,2018,10
32039226,A Novel Method to Visualize the Dietary Macronutrient Composition of Smaller Visceral Fat Accumulation.,"The accumulation of visceral fat is considered a potential cause of a clustering of metabolic disorders including hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. These disorders are some of the upstream determinants of serious diseases such as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia. In particular, the accumulation of visceral fat is considered to have a causal relationship with dietary habits. To clarify this relationship, we characterize dietary habits with dietary macronutrient composition and visceral fat accumulation with a measure of visceral fat area (VFA). We then employ a novel multiple regression model with VFA as the objective variable and macronutrient composition, gender, and age group as explanatory variables. The macronutrient composition is converted by the isometric log-ratio transformation since it is compositional data. The squared term of the transformed macronutrient composition is also included as an explanatory variable. To fit the data to the model, variable selection is performed based on Akaike's information criterion to exclude unnecessary interaction terms. The validity of the model is confirmed by a numerical simulation study. We then cross-sectionally analyze real-world data collected through community-wide health examinations of adults living in the Iwaki district in northern Japan. The macronutrient composition data is taken by the dietary history questionnaire and VFA is measured using a bioimpedance-type visceral fat meter. The main factors of macronutirent composition and their interactions with gender and age group are identified through analysis of variance and are significantly associated with VFA (p < 0.05). Moreover, the predicted VFA corresponding to the macronutrient composition stratified by gender and age group are obtained, and visualized seamlessly on a ternary plot. The results show that a diet with a high ratio of %protein to %fat generally corresponds to a lower VFA level. However, in middle-aged female subjects, higher VFA is found in lower %fat and higher %carbohydrate diets. In summary, the association between VFA and dietary macronutrient composition is significantly modulated depending on gender and age group in Iwaki district's adult population. The novel statistical analysis method in this study is useful in exploring favorable dietary macronutrient composition for lower level of visceral fat accumulation.",Frontiers in nutrition,2019,Switzerland,2019,10
25367637,More than seizures: improving the lives of people with refractory epilepsy.,"As captured by the proposed new definition, epilepsy is increasingly recognized as a disorder characterized not only by an enduring predisposition to recurrent seizures but explicitly also by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological and social consequences of this condition. Further, both in the estimated 15 million people worldwide who have ongoing seizures despite optimal management and in a substantial proportion of those in remission, the consequences and comorbidities of epilepsy are the major determinants of quality of life. These include mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, dose related and longer term effects of antiepileptic drugs, including on prenatal development and bone health, and neurobehavioural effects. Whilst separating those that are part of an underlying condition or have unrelated contributors from those that are potentially remediable can be difficult, given the range of tools now available to assist with screening and management there is no excuse for not at least trying as part of standard care for people with epilepsy. Managing epilepsy well is about much more than controlling seizures and this needs to be recognized in planning and delivering services, as well as in prioritizing research.",European journal of neurology,2015 Jan,England,2015,10

Although determinants that influence families' decisions to access pediatric hospice care have been recently identified, the relationship between these determinants and access to pediatric hospice care have not been explicated or grounded in accepted healthcare theories or models. Using the Andersen Behavioral Healthcare Utilization Model, this article presents a conceptual model describing the determinants of hospice access. Predisposing (demographic; social support; and knowledge, beliefs, and values), enabling (family and community resources) and need (perceived and evaluated needs) factors were identified through the use of hospice literature.

27541601,Socioeconomic and sociocultural determinants of psychological distress and quality of life among patients with psoriasis in a selected multi-ethnic Malaysian population.,"Patients with psoriasis may have increased risk of psychological comorbidities. This cross-sectional study aimed at determining associations between sociocultural and socioeconomic factors with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) scores and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores. Adult patients with psoriasis were recruited from a Dermatology outpatient clinic via convenience sampling. Interviews were conducted regarding socio-demographic factors and willing subjects were requested to complete the DASS and DLQI questionnaires. The Pearson chi(2) test, Fisher's exact test and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical analysis to determine independent predictors of depression, anxiety, stress and severe impairment of quality of life. Unadjusted analysis revealed that depression was associated with Indian ethnicity (p = .041) and severe impairment of quality of life was associated with Indian ethnicity (p = .032), higher education (p = .013), higher income (p = .042), and employment status (p = .014). Multivariate analysis revealed that Indian ethnicity was a predictor of depression (p = .024). For stress, tertiary level of education (p = .020) was an independent risk factor while a higher monthly income was a protective factor (p = .042). The ethnic Indians and Malays were significantly more likely than the ethnic Chinese to suffer reduced quality of life (p = .001 and p = .006 respectively) and subjects with tertiary education were more likely to have severe impairment of quality of life (p = .002). Our study was unique in determining sociocultural influences on psychological complications of psoriasis in a South East Asian population.

27896044,Curricular activities and change in determinants of fruit and vegetable intake among adolescents: Results from the Boost intervention.,"Knowledge of the association between implementation of different intervention components and the determinants they are tailored to change may contribute to evaluating the effects and working mechanisms of multi-component interventions. This study examined 1) the effect of a Danish multi-component school-based intervention (2010 - 2011) on key determinants of adolescents' fruit and vegetable intake and 2) if dose of curricular activities was positively associated with change in these determinants. Using multi-level linear and logistic regression analyses stratified by gender and socioeconomic position, we analyzed survey data from the cluster-randomized Boost study targeting Danish 13-year-olds' fruit and vegetable intake. We examined 1) differences in knowledge of recommendations, taste preferences and situational norms between students from 20 intervention (n = 991) and 20 control (n = 915) schools at follow-up; and 2) associations between curriculum dose received and delivered (student and teacher data aggregated to school- and class-level) and these determinants among students at intervention schools only. At follow-up, more students from intervention than control schools knew the recommendation for vegetable intake (OR 1.56, CI:1.18, 2.06) and number of fruits liked (taste preferences) increased by 0.22 (CI:0.04, 0.41). At class-level, curriculum dose received was positively associated with proportion of students knowing the recommendation for vegetable intake (OR 1.06, CI:1.002, 1.13). In stratified analyses, this association was only significant among students from high social class (OR 1.17, CI:1.04, 1.31). The Boost intervention succeeded in improving students' taste preferences for fruit and knowledge of recommendation for vegetable intake, but only the latter determinant was positively associated with curriculum dose.

23945411,Overweight among primary school-age children in Malaysia.,"This study is a secondary data analysis from the National Health Morbidity Survey III, a population-based study conducted in 2006. A total of 7,749 children between 7 and 12 years old were recruited into the study. This study seeks to report the prevalence of overweight (including obesity) children in Malaysia using international cut-off point and identify its associated key social determinants. The results show that the overall prevalence of overweight children in Malaysia was 19.9%. The urban residents, males, Chinese, those who are wealthy, have overweight or educated guardians showed higher prevalence of overweight. In multivariable analysis, higher likelihood of being overweight was observed among those with advancing age (OR=1.15), urban residents (OR=1.16, 95% CI: 1.01-1.36), the Chinese (OR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.19-1.77), boys (OR=1.23, 95% CI: 1.08-1.41), and those who came from higher income family. In conclusion, one out of five of 7-12 year-old-children in Malaysia were overweight. Locality of residence, ethnicity, gender, guardian education, and overweight guardian were likely to be the predictors of this alarming issue. Societal and public health efforts are needed in order to reduce the burden of disease associated with obesity.",Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition,2013,Australia,2013,10
23231784,Planning the diffusion of a neck-injury prevention programme among community rugby union coaches.,"BACKGROUND: This paper describes the development of a theory-informed and evidence-informed, context-specific diffusion plan for the Mayday Safety Procedure (MSP) among community rugby coaches in regional New South Wales, Australia. METHODS: Step 5 of Intervention Mapping was used to plan strategies to enhance MSP adoption and implementation. RESULTS: Coaches were identified as the primary MSP adopters and implementers within a system including administrators, players and referees. A local advisory group was established to ensure context relevance. Performance objectives (eg, attend MSP training for coaches) and determinants of adoption and implementation behaviour (eg, knowledge, beliefs, skills and environment) were identified, informed by Social Cognitive Theory. Adoption and implementation matrices were developed and change-objectives for coaches were identified (eg, skills to deliver MSP training to players). Finally, intervention methods and specific strategies (eg, coach education, social marketing and policy and by-law development) were identified based on advisory group member experience, evidence of effective coach safety behaviour-change interventions and Diffusion of Innovations theory. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published example of a systematic approach to plan injury prevention programme diffusion in community sports. The key strengths of this approach were an effective researcher-practitioner partnership; actively engaging local sports administrators; targeting specific behaviour determinants, informed by theory and evidence; and taking context-related practical strengths and constraints into consideration. The major challenges were the time involved in using a systematic diffusion planning approach for the first time; and finding a planning language that was acceptable and meaningful to researchers and practitioners.",British journal of sports medicine,2014 Jan,England,2014,10
30994167,"The impact of social determinants and lifestyles on dietary patterns during pregnancy: evidence from the ""Mamma & Bambino"" study.","BACKGROUND: During pregnancy, maternal dietary patterns play a critical role in determining maternal and new-born health. Recent evidence highlighted the influence of either social determinants and lifestyles on the adherence to different dietary patterns. STUDY DESIGN: In this cross-sectional analysis, we evaluated the association of social determinants and lifestyles with maternal dietary patterns in the ""Mother & Child"" cohort, a prospective study that enrols mother-child pairs from Catania, Italy. METHODS: Dietary patterns were derived using Food Frequency Questionnaire and Principal Component Analysis. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between socio-demographic factors (i.e., age, educational level and employment status), lifestyles (i.e., smoking status, body mass index, use of folic acid, multivitamin and multi-mineral supplements) and dietary patterns. RESULTS: Overall, 332 women were enrolled and the following dietary patterns were derived: the ""western"" dietary pattern, characterized by high intake of red meat, fries, dipping sauces, salty snacks and alcoholic drinks; the second one, named ""prudent"", characterized by high intake of potatoes, raw and cooked vegetables, legumes, rice and soup. Multivariable analysis showed that young age, low educational level and smoking were positively associated with the adherence to the western dietary pattern. In contrast, pre-gestational body mass index was negatively associated with the adherence to the prudent dietary pattern. CONCLUSION: Our results raise the need of strategies for promoting healthy dietary habits among women in their reproductive age, which might also help control their body weight before and during pregnancy. These strategies should be prioritized to young women of low educational level, who generally share other unhealthy behaviours.",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,2019 Mar-Apr,Italy,2019,10

Evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF). 2. Evaluation of HRQOL in children with CF from the parents' perspective. 3. Evaluation of the relationship between HRQOL and both medical and psychosocial factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Health-related quality of life was measured with the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised. Seventy patients with cystic fibrosis, aged 14-18 years completed the version for adolescents and adults (CFQ-R 14(+) and 70 parents of children aged 6-13 years filled out the version for parents (CFQ-R 6-13). Scores ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. Disease severity was assessed by lung function test, nutritional status, chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and type of CFTR gene mutation. Social indices i.e. the patient's school attendance and the parent's work status were collected. RESULTS: In the adolescents' opinion, Eating problems and Digestive functioning got the highest rate, whereas Vitality, Treatment burden, Health perceptions and Weight got the lowest. Boys estimated their Physical functioning significantly higher than girls. When evaluating their children's quality of life, parents granted the highest score to Physical, Respiratory and Digestive functioning and the lowest results were attributed to Treatment burden. Nutritional status and lung function impairment turned out to be predictors of some other domains but not psychosocial ones. The chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection had an influence on several quality of life areas from the parents' perspective. School attendance had a significant impact on many aspects of the adolescents' functioning. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The study revealed that the health-related quality of life of CF children and adolescents is moderately good. 2. Digestive functioning was one of the highest scored domains, while Treatment burden was one of the lowest, according to both the adolescents' and the parents' perception. 3. The potential impact of disease severity was clearly marked in the group of younger children, whose health related quality of life was assessed by the parents. Self-evaluation conducted by adolescents was more subjective. 4. School attendace was an important factor of the quality of life. Further research is required in order to find other psychosocial indices.",Developmental period medicine,2015 Jan-Mar,Poland,2015,10
25048392,[Determinants of the use of different healthcare levels in the General System of Social Security in Health in Colombia and the Unified Health System in Brazil].,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the use of different healthcare levels, and its determinants, in two different health systems, the General System of Social Security in Health (GSSSH) and the Unified Health System (UHS) in municipalities in Colombia and Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out, based on a population survey in two municipalities in Colombia (n=2163) and two in Brazil (n=2155). Outcome variables consisted of the use of primary care services, outpatient secondary care services, and emergency care in the previous 3 months. Explanatory variables were need and predisposing and enabling factors. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed by healthcare level and country. RESULTS: The determinants of use differed by healthcare level and country: having a chronic disease was associated with a greater use of primary and outpatient secondary care in Colombia, and was also associated with the use of emergency care in Brazil. In Colombia, persons enrolled in the contributory scheme more frequently used the services of the GSSSH than persons enrolled with subsidized contributions in primary and outpatient secondary care and more than persons without insurance in any healthcare level. In Brazil, the low-income population and those without private insurance more frequently used the UHS at any level. In both countries, the use of primary care was increased when persons knew the healthcare center to which they were assigned and if they had a regular source of care. Knowledge of the referral hospital increased the use of outpatient secondary care and emergency care. CONCLUSIONS: In both countries, the influence of the determinants of use differed according to the level of care used, emphasizing the need to analyze healthcare use by disaggregating it by level of care.",Gaceta sanitaria,2014 Nov-Dec,Spain,2014,10

25370736,"Intrapersonal, social and physical environmental determinants of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in working-age women: a systematic review protocol.","BACKGROUND: The majority of North American adult females do not meet current physical activity recommendations (150 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) per week accrued in >/=10 min bouts) ultimately placing themselves at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Working-age females face particular challenges in meeting physical activity recommendations as they have multiple demands, including occupational, family and social demands. To develop effective interventions to increase MVPA among working-age females, it is necessary to identify and understand the strongest modifiable determinants influencing these behaviours. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to examine the available evidence to identify intrapersonal, social and environmental determinants of MVPA among working-age females. METHODS/DESIGN: Six electronic databases will be searched to identify all prospective cohort studies that report on intrapersonal, social and/or environmental determinants of MVPA in working-age females. Grey literature sources including theses, published conference abstracts and websites from relevant organizations will also be included. Articles that report on intrapersonal (e.g. health status, self-efficacy, socio-economic status (SES), stress, depression), social environmental (e.g. crime, safety, area SES, social support, climate and capital, policies), and environmental (e.g. weather, workplace, home, neighbourhood, recreation environment, active transportation) determinants of MVPA in a working-age (mean age 18-65 years) female population will be included. Risk of bias will be assessed within and across all included studies using the Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Harvest plots will be used to synthesize results across all determinants, and meta-analyses will be conducted where possible among studies with sufficient homogeneity. DISCUSSION: This review will provide a comprehensive examination of evidence in this field and will serve to highlight gaps for future research on the determinants of MVPA in working-age females and ultimately inform intervention design.

31763211,Effect of an herbal capsule on chronic constipation among menopausal women: A randomized controlled clinical trial.,"Objective: Chronic constipation is frequently observed in postmenopausal women. An herbal combination including clover plants, Roman anis or Anisone, green anis or fennel, green raisins, Alhagi maurorum, violets, Terminalia chebula, senna and golqand has been introduced in traditional books as an effective laxative. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the combined herbal capsule on chronic constipation in postmenopausal women. Materials and Methods: This triple blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 64 postmenopausal women. Individuals were randomly assigned to combined the herbal capsule and placebo groups. The herbal capsule included cloves (4 units), Anise and Anison (6 units each), violet flowers (12 units), Terminalia Chebula and fresh green raisins (25 units each), senna leaves, Alhagi maurorum, and Golqand (50 units each). Constipation questionnaire and the individual's assessment of constipation symptoms scale were used for data collection. Results: The mean frequency of bowel movements in the herbal capsule group was significantly higher than the placebo group (mean difference=4.2; 95% confidence interval: 0.3 to 4.5; p<0.001). Straining during defecation, stool amount, incomplete defecation, sensation of obstruction during defecation, and need for manipulation to facilitate removal of stools were significantly reduced in the herbal capsule group compared to the placebo group (p<0.001). The amount and consistency of defecation was also improved in the two study groups, but a significant difference was observed between the groups (p<0.001). The mean score of constipation symptoms in the herbal capsule group was significantly reduced compared to the placebo group (-15.4; -11.5 to -19.29; p<0.001).

METHODS: Data came from the 2010-2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study and analyses were limited to respondents with diabetes (n=2951). Depression was indexed by the 8-item Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Weighted logistic regression was used to examine relationships of food insecurity and diabetic morbidity with depressive symptoms, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Path analysis quantified the contribution of diabetic morbidity as a mediation of the relationship of food insecurity with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Food insecurity was associated with having poor diabetes control (odds ratio (OR)=1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-2.5) and diabetes-related kidney problems (OR=1.6; 95% CI=1.1-2.5). Additionally, food insecurity was associated with depression contemporaneously (OR=2.0, 95% CI=1.7-2.4) and longitudinally (OR=1.5, 95% CI=1.3-1.8). However, food insecurity was no longer associated with depression when adjusting for diabetic morbidity. In path analyses, diabetic morbidity explained 12.7% (p-value=.04) of the association of food insecurity with depressive symptoms in 2012 and 18.5% (p-value=.09) of the association with depressive symptoms in 2014. CONCLUSION: The relationship of food insecurity with depression was attributable to worse diabetes morbidity. Interventions that reduce food insecurity among older adults with diabetes may improve disease management and reduce depression severity.",Journal of psychosomatic research,2019 Feb,England,2019,10
25432963,Sustainability and power in health promotion: community-based participatory research in a reproductive health policy case study in New Mexico.,"Health promotion programs are commonly viewed as value-free initiatives which seek to improve health, often through behavior change. An opposing view has begun to emerge that health promotion efforts, especially ones seeking to impact health policy and social determinants of health, are vulnerable to political contexts and may depend on who is in power at the time. This community-based participatory research study attempts to understand these interactions by applying a conceptual model focused on the power context, diverse stakeholder roles within this context, and the relationship of political levers and other change strategies to the sustainability of health promotion interventions aimed at health policy change. We present a case study of a health promotion coalition, New Mexico for Responsible Sex Education (NMRSE), as an example of power dynamics and change processes. Formed in 2005 in response to federal policies mandating abstinence-only education, NMRSE includes community activists, health promotion staff from the New Mexico Department of Health, and policy-maker allies. Applying an adapted Mayer's 'power analysis' instrument, we conducted semi-structured stakeholder interviews and triangulated political-context analyses from the perspective of the stakeholders.We identified multiple understandings of sustainability and health promotion policy change, including: the importance of diverse stakeholders working together in coalition and social networks; their distinct positions of power within their political contexts; the role of science versus advocacy in change processes; the particular challenges for public sector health promotion professionals; and other facilitators versus barriers to action. One problem that emerged consisted of the challenges for state employees to engage in health promotion advocacy due to limitations imposed on their activities by state and federal policies. This investigation's results include a refined conceptual model, a power-analysis instrument, and new understandings of the intersection of power and stakeholder strategies in the sustainability of health promotion and health in all policies.",Global health promotion,2016 Mar,England,2016,10

METHOD: Qualitative data was collected during April and May 2010. One-hundred and thirty-nine adults (56% female) and 52 children (60% female) participated in focus groups across three geographic locations in Rwanda. Eleven interviews were held with child protection stakeholders. RESULTS: Interview and focus group participants reported how children, primarily girls, engaged in transactional sex as a survival strategy in response to situations of adversity including economic deprivation, difficulty accessing school, and social pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Policy and programs should work to address the underlying social and economic determinants of transactional sexual exploitation through structural interventions that reduce gender inequalities to accessing school and securing basic needs.

30476088,Depressive symptoms among migrants and non-migrants in Europe: documenting and explaining inequalities in times of socio-economic instability.,"Background: With the current study, we aim to explore the extent that migrants report higher rates of depressive symptoms than non-migrant populations in light of gender, childhood experiences, socioeconomic factors and social support across European countries that have been differentially influenced by the economic crisis. Methods: Using data from the seventh round of the European Social Survey and the Greek MIGHEAL survey, we compare the prevalence of depressive symptoms among migrants and non-migrants aged 25-65 years old across 21 countries. Results: Our findings show that migrants report significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms in seven of the examined countries, while in Greece and in the UK, they report significantly lower levels compared with non-migrant populations. The current climate of socioeconomic instability does not seem to necessarily associate with increased rates of depressive symptoms across countries neither it affects migrants and non-migrants in a similar way. Financial strain, childhood experiences of economic hardship and domestic conflict, female gender, as well as experiences of perceived discrimination appear to associate with increased levels of depressive symptoms among both migrant and non-migrant populations, while social trust and living with children have a protective impact. Still, much variation exists in the range of these associations between migrants and non-migrants and across countries. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the impact of migration status on depressive symptoms is subject to additional determinants of mental health as well as to contextual factors.",European journal of public health,2018 Dec 1,England,2018,10

This study will set the basis for the development of disability-related services for the rural elderly in northeastern Spain. METHODS: The probabilistic sample was composed of 1,354 de facto residents from a population of 12,784 Social Security card holders (age: > or = 50 years). Cognitive and disability screenings were conducted (period: June 2008-June 2009). Screening instruments were the MMSE and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Participants screened positive for disability underwent an assessment protocol focusing on primary care diagnoses, disability, lifestyle, and social and health service usage. Participants screened positive for cognitive functioning went through in-depth neurological evaluation. RESULTS: The study sample is described. Usable data were available for 1,216 participants. A total of 625 individuals (51.4%) scored within the positive range in the disability screening, while 135 (11.1%) scored within the positive range of the cognitive screening. The proportion of positively screened individuals was higher for women and increased with age.

21976326,Where health disparities begin: the role of social and economic determinants--and why current policies may make matters worse.,"Health disparities by racial or ethnic group or by income or education are only partly explained by disparities in medical care. Inadequate education and living conditions-ranging from low income to the unhealthy characteristics of neighborhoods and communities-can harm health through complex pathways. Meaningful progress in narrowing health disparities is unlikely without addressing these root causes. Policies on education, child care, jobs, community and economic revitalization, housing, transportation, and land use bear on these root causes and have implications for health and medical spending. A shortsighted political focus on reducing spending in these areas could actually increase medical costs by magnifying disease burden and widening health disparities.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2011 Oct,United States,2011,10

Frozen section is a diagnostic method for the evaluation of pelvic tumors during surgery. The purpose of this study was to measure the compatibility of the frozen section method for histopathological specimens of female pelvic masses with pathologic results of tumor markers. Methods: This retrospective study was performed on 188 female pelvic mass specimens during 2014-2016. Medical files for all patients with injury of female genital system who had undergone frozen section surgery was compared with the results of pathology and tumor marker tests. SPSS version 19 was used for statistical analysis. The results were analyzed by Kappa test. Results: Based on the final pathology of the 188 specimens, 150 (79.8%) were benign, 8 (4.2%) intermediate, and 30 (16%) malignant. Sensitivity, specificity, and validity of frozen section in benign tumors were calculated as follow: 96.7 Confidence Interval (CI95% : 92.6-98.9%), 97 (CI95%: 84.7-99.9%), and 96.8%; in intermediate tumors, the respective numbers were: 71.4 (CI95% :29-96.3%), 98.3 (CI95% :95, 2-99%, 7%), and 97.3%; and in the malignant tumors the numbers were: 96.3 (CI95% :81.9-99%), 97.4 (CI95% :93. 4-99.3%), and 97.2%. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated as follow: 99.3 (CI95% :96.3-99.9%) and 86.8% (CI95% :71.9-95.6%) in benign tumors; 62.5 (CI95% :24.5-91.5%) and 98.9% (CI95% :96-99.9%) in intermediate tumors; and 86.7 (CI95% :69.3-96.2%) and 99.3% (CI95% :96.3-99.9%) in malignant tumors.

30424737,"Study protocol of the iMPaCT project: a longitudinal cohort study assessing psychological determinants, sexual behaviour and chlamydia (re)infections in heterosexual STI clinic visitors.","BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia), the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the Netherlands, can lead to severe reproductive complications. Reasons for the sustained chlamydia prevalence in young individuals, even in countries with chlamydia screening programs, might be the asymptomatic nature of chlamydia infections, and high reinfection rates after treatment. When individuals are unaware of their infection, preventive behaviour or health-care seeking behaviour mostly depends on psychological determinants, such as risk perception. Furthermore, behaviour change after a diagnosis might be vital to reduce reinfection rates. This makes the incorporation of psychological determinants and behaviour change in mathematical models estimating the impact of interventions on chlamydia transmission especially important. Therefore, quantitative real-life data to inform these models is needed. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study will be conducted to explore the link between psychological and behavioural determinants and chlamydia (re)infection among heterosexual STI clinic visitors aged 18-24 years. Participants will be recruited at the STI clinics of the public health services of Amsterdam, Hollands Noorden, Kennemerland, and Twente. Participants are enrolled for a year, and questionnaires are administrated at four time points: baseline (before an STI consultation), three-week, six-month and at one-year follow-up. To be able to link psychological and behavioural determinants to (re)infections, participants will be tested for chlamydia at enrolment and at six-month follow-up. Data from the longitudinal cohort study will be used to develop mathematical models for curable STI incorporating these determinants to be able to better estimate the impact of interventions. DISCUSSION: This study will provide insights into the link between psychological and behavioural determinants, including short-term and long-term changes after diagnosis, and chlamydia (re)infections. Our mathematical model, informed by data from the longitudinal cohort study, will be able to estimate the impact of interventions on chlamydia prevalence, and identify and prioritise successful interventions for the future. These interventions could be implemented at STI clinics tailored to psychological and behavioural characteristics of individuals. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register NTR-6307 .

23558960,Health insurance selection in Chile: a cross-sectional and panel analysis.,"In Chile, workers are mandated to choose either public or private health insurance coverage. Although private insurance premiums depend on health risk, public insurance premiums are solely linked to income. This structure implies that individuals with higher health risks may tend to avoid private insurance, leaving the public insurance system responsible for their care. This article attempts to explore the determinants of health insurance selection (private vs public) by individuals in Chile and to test empirically whether adverse selection indeed exists. We use panel data from Chile's 'Encuesta de Proteccion Social' survey, which allows us to control for a rich set of individual observed and unobserved characteristics using both a cross-sectional analysis and fixed-effect methods. Results suggest that age, sex, job type, income quintile and self-reported health are the most important factors in explaining the type of insurance selected by individuals. Asymmetry in insurance mobility caused by restrictions on pre-existing conditions may explain why specific illnesses have an unambiguous relationship with insurance selection. Empirical evidence tends to indicate that some sorting by health risk and income levels takes place in Chile. In addition, by covering a less healthy population with higher utilization of general health consultations, the public insurance system may be incurring disproportionate expenses. Results suggest that if decreasing segmentation and unequal access to health services are important policy objectives, special emphasis should be placed on asymmetries in the premium structure and inter-system mobility within the health care system. Preliminary analysis of the impact of the 'Garantias Explicitas de Salud' plan (explicit guarantees on health care plan) on insurance selection is also considered.",Health policy and planning,2014 May,England,2014,10

The title and abstract of the papers were reviewed, and articles that addressed the epidemiological aspects of pancreatic cancer were included; in total, 20 full papers were reviewed. RESULTS: According to studies, the incidence and mortality rate of pancreatic cancer is steadily increasing with age. Actually, men are more likely to develop this carcinoma than women. Smoking, aging, and lifestyle changes are the most important risk factors for pancreatic cancer in Iran. Due to the lack of initial symptoms or a specific marker for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, this cancer is detected lately and therefore low survival rate is observed. CONCLUSION: Mortality and incidence of pancreatic cancer is increasing in Iran. Pancreatic cancer is more common in men than women. Based on the results of this study, pancreatic cancer depends largely on the lifestyle. Survival of pancreatic cancer is low in untreated patients.",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,2019 Aug 6,United States,2019,10
31315417,Age-Related Effect of Antihypertensive Treatment on Cognitive Performance: Is it Better Preventing Dementia in Older Age?,"The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of optimal antihypertensive medication on cognitive function. In this 6-month clinical trial, 248 adults were randomly selected by a registry of hypertensive-treated patients (based on a National Hypertension Treatment Program), followed health centers located in Rafsanjan County, Southeast, Iran. Blood pressure was measured 3 times in each appointment pre- and posttreatment. Mini-Mental State Examination was used for cognitive performance evaluation. Paired t test and multiple regression model showed significant correlation between ""the differences of systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels"" and ""cognitive performance in treated patients more than 40 years old."" Cognitive performance was not significantly different in patients less than 40 years old post antihypertensive treatment. Cognitive performance scores demonstrated significant increase in responders more than 40 years old post antihypertensive treatment. Antihypertensive treatment in responders with age equal or more than 40 years improves the level of cognitive performance significantly.",American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,2019 Nov-Dec,United States,2019,10
23919598,Does different wording of a global oral health question provide different results?,"OBJECTIVE: Focusing on 70-year-old adults in Sweden and guided by the conceptual framework of International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (ICIDH), the purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported oral disease and social/psychological/physical oral health outcome variables are associated with two global measures of self-assessed satisfaction with oral health in Swedish 70-year-olds and if there is a degree of discordance between these global questions. BACKGROUND: It has become an important task to create a simple way to measure self-perceived oral health. In these attempts to find practical ways to measure health, the 'global oral health question' is a possible tool to measure self-rated oral health, but there is limited knowledge about how important the wording of this question is. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2012, a questionnaire was mailed to all persons born in 1942 in two Swedish counties, Orebro (T) and Ostergotland (E). The total population of 70-year-olds amounted to 7889. Bivariate analyses were conducted by cross-tabulation and Chi-square statistics. Multivariate analyses were conducted using binary multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The two global oral health question of 70-year-olds in Sweden was mainly explained by the number of teeth (OR=5.6 and 5.2), chewing capacity (OR=6.9 and 4.2), satisfaction with dental appearance (OR=19.8 and 17.3) and Oral Impact on Daily Performance (OIDP) (OR=3.5 and 3.9). CONCLUSION: Regardless of the wording, it seems that the concept of a global oral health question has the same main determinants.",Acta odontologica Scandinavica,2015 May,England,2015,10
28874188,Determinants of first-time utilization of long-term care services in the Netherlands: an observational record linkage study.,"BACKGROUND: Since in an ageing society more long-term care (LTC) facilities are needed, it is important to understand the main determinants of first-time utilization of (LTC) services. METHODS: The Andersen service model, which distinguishes predisposing, enabling and need factors, was used to develop a model for first-time utilization of LTC services among the general population of the Netherlands. We used data on 214,821 persons registered in a database of general practitioners (NIVEL Primary Care Database). For each person the medical history was known, as well as characteristics such as ethnicity, income, home-ownership, and marital status. Utilization data from the national register on long-term care was linked at a personal level. Generalized Linear Models were used to determine the relative importance of factors of incident LTC-service utilization. RESULTS: Top 5 determinants of LTC are need, measured as the presence of chronic diseases, age, household size, household income and homeownership. When controlling for all other determinants, the presence of an additional chronic disease increases the probability of utilizing any LTC service by 45% among the 20+ population (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.41-1.49), and 31% among the 65+ population (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.27-1.36). With respect to the 20+ population, living in social rent (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 2.25-2.67, ref. = home-owner) had a large impact on utilizing any LTC service. In a lesser degree this was the case for living alone (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.52-1.75, ref. = not living alone). A higher household income was linked with a lower utilization of any LTC service. CONCLUSIONS: All three factors of the Anderson model, predisposing, enabling, and need determinants influence the likelihood of future LTC service utilization. This implies that none of these factors can be left out of the analysis of what determines this use. New in our analysis is the focus on incident utilization. This provides a better estimate of the effects of predictors than a prevalence based analysis, as there is less confounding by changes in determinants occurring after LTC initiation. Especially the need of care is a strong factor. A policy implication of this relative importance of health status is therefore that LTC reforms should take health aspects into account.",BMC health services research,2017 Sep 5,England,2017,10
22929398,Gambling behavior and problems among older adults: a systematic review of empirical studies.,"OBJECTIVES: With the rapid aging of the population and the increased availability of gambling facilities over the past three decades, older adults may gamble more and may be increasingly at risk for problem gambling (PG) or pathological gambling disorder (PGD). To facilitate a better understanding of gambling behavior among older adults that will inform preventive strategies, this article systematically examined empirical studies on issues related to older adults' gambling. METHOD: This article reviewed 75 empirical studies including data on the distribution and determinants of PG and PGD and the outcomes of gambling. RESULTS: This review used the broad term of ""disordered gambling"" as a means to explain a continuum of problems caused by PG and PGD. The analyses covered seven topics concerning older adults' gambling behaviors: Participation rates for gambling, prevalence rates of disordered gambling, motivation for initially beginning to gamble, risk and protective factors for disordered gambling, and negative and positive health outcomes from gambling. DISCUSSION: Based on research gaps identified in the review, this article proposes six recommendations for future studies focusing on well-being of older adults who gamble, research method issues, and taking into account older adults' inspirations and adjustment to the aging process in the 21st century.","The journals of gerontology.

25199017,Bacterial contamination of different components of the waterpipe.,"SETTING: Waterpipe smoking is an emerging topic in tobacco research that may have unrecognised health hazards. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether waterpipes are a source of bacterial contamination. METHODS: A total of 15 restaurants and waterpipe cafes were randomly selected from the list of locations serving waterpipe tobacco in Kerman city, Iran. Different parts of the waterpipe devices were sampled, including the disposable mouthpiece, the mouthpiece of the hose and the water in the bowl of the waterpipe. The samples were smeared onto bacterial culture media, including eosin methylene blue, blood agar and MacConkey agar growth media, and incubated at 37 degrees C. After 24-48 h, they were examined for colony growth. RESULTS: Of 285 samples from different parts of the waterpipes, 236 (82.8%) showed positive cultures; the rate of contamination ranged from 69% in the fixed mouthpiece to 96% in bowl water. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (32.9%), Streptococcus spp (26.9%), Neisseria spp (13.7%) and Escherichia coli (9.4%) were the most frequent contaminants. CONCLUSION: Waterpipes are frequently contaminated with microorganisms. This study revealed potential microbial hazards in waterpipes that may contribute to respiratory tract colonisation.",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,2014 Aug,France,2014,10
24091068,"[Triggers of bulimia and compulsion attacks: validation of the ""Start"" questionnaire].","AIM: There are few published studies on the triggers of binge eating in anorexia nervosa of binge/purging subtype (BPAN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We validated in 29 patients (10 BPAN, 10 BN and 9 BED) the perspicuity, the clarity and the intra- (doubles) and inter- (test-retest) reproducibility of a 24-item Start questionnaire on the triggers of binge eating. Then the Start questionnaire was administered to 176 patients (65 BPAN, 62 BN and 59 BED patients) being 27.5+9.1 yr old, having 15+9 binge eating (BE) episodes/week, with a mean binge duration of 1 hr 36min (+ 38min)/day. RESULTS: BE episodes occurred mainly during the second part of the day: afternoon after work (67% of the patients), ""tea"" time (55%), evening after dinner (42%) and at night (22%). The principal place for BE episodes was at home (96%). The BED patients avoided binges at the parents' home (89%) more often than the BPAN (62%, P<0.02). The binges occurred mainly in the living room (44%), in the kitchen (43%), and less in the bedroom (31%). Hunger pangs seemed to be a trigger of binges in 31% of the patients, and a stronger trigger in BED (42%) than in the BPAN and BN patients (24%; P=0.04). Binge eating episodes could occur despite a high satiety level (just after lunch or dinner) in 29% of the BN and in 16% of the BED patients (P<0.02). Concerning food, the major triggers were high energy-density food (77%) and comfort food (60%), such as chocolate, cakes, bread and pasta. The food consumed for binge episodes (in-binge food) was more often a strong trigger than the other food (not used for binges): olfaction (19% versus 10%), sight (52% versus 25%) and placing in the mouth (71% versus 26%; P<0.02 for all, in the 3 groups). Being tired could be a strong trigger in 37% of the patients, but ""being aroused"" in the other 38 % of the patients. Stressful events (65%), anxiety (74%), ""being under pressure"" or irritated (51% and 55%) were of course major triggers in a majority of the patients, as well as sadness (61%), feeling of powerlessness (62%), inefficiency (73%) and depressive state (71%). Flashback from traumatism (sexual trauma in 17% of the patients) was a strong trigger of binges more often in BPAN and BED (44%) than in BN (23%; P<0.05). The binge eating was painful (and ""not at all a pleasure"") in 69% of the patients, but could also be a relaxing behavior in 31% of the patients, more often in the BED (43%) than in the BPAN patients (20%; P<0.05). The binge eating behavior was quoted as obsessive in 63% of BPAN, 92% of BN and only 34% of BED patients (P<0.001). The patients said that they were unable to avoid the binge (76% of the patients), more often in BPAN and BN than in BED patients (P<0.01). As a whole, 62% of BPAN, 89% of BN and only 4 % of BED patients (P<0.05) were unable to avoid purging (vomiting). In 12% of the cases, there was a pleasure felt when binging. For the other patients, shame, filth and incapacity were the feelings related to binges in 58% of the BPAN, 45% of BN and 43% of BED patients (P<0.04). The global score of addiction (zero=not addicted, 10=very addicted) was 8.56+1.2 in BPAN, 8.42+1.5 in BN and 6.74+1.1 in BED patients (NS between BPAN and BN; P<0.01 between BPAN and BN on the one hand and BED on the other). CONCLUSION: The present study has demonstrated the usefulness of the Start questionnaire. It also evidences the key role of intrinsic factors, both metabolic and emotional, as strong triggers for binge eating episodes in BPAN, BN and BED. It has also demonstrated the role of environmental determinants.",L'Encephale,2014 Sep,France,2014,10
21792747,Modeling alcohol self-administration in the human laboratory.,"This review focuses on 27 studies employing experimental alcohol self-administration (ASA) in humans which were published between 1989 and 2010. Twelve studies enrolling healthy, non-dependent social drinkers (HSD) were aimed at evaluating physiological and behavioral determinants of alcohol-induced reward or modeling situations of increased risk to develop alcohol use disorders. The remaining 15 studies tested the effect of medications such as naltrexone, nalmefene, nicotine, mecamylamine, varenicline, gabapentin, aripiprazole, and rimonabant on ASA. The participants were either HSD or non-treatment-seeking alcoholics (NTSA). In 25 of these studies, the subjects ingested alcohol orally and reached a mean peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) during baseline conditions between 43 and 47 mg% (0.043-0.047%). Two recent studies employed computer-assisted self-infusion of ethanol (CASE), where subjects press a button to request multiple sequential alcohol exposures intravenously instead of drinking. This method has been demonstrated to be safe and provides increased experimental control of BAC and keeps subjects blind concerning the amount already self-administered. Peak exposures in the CASE studies ranged from 60 to 80 mg% in HSD and up to 240 mg% in NTSA.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2013,Germany,2013,10
28471984,What are the effects of psychological stress and physical work on blood lipid profiles?,"Blood lipids disorders are prevalent in the world. Some of their risk factors are modifiable such as mental and physical stress which existed in some places such as work environment.Objective of this study was to determine the effects of psychological and physical stress on the lipid profiles. It was a historical cohort study. The people who were employed as general worker were participated. The study was conducted with flexible interview for getting history, lipid profile examination, and a checklist including occupational and nonoccupational risk factors and using the health issues. According to the type of stress exposures, the study population was divided into 5 groups. Groups were followed for lipid profiles. These groups were exposed to psychological stress, physical stress or both of them; mild psychological stress (group 1), mild physical work without psychological stress (group 2), mild psychological stress and mild physical work (group 3), moderate physical work without psychological stress (group 4), and heavy physical work without psychological stress (group 5). Data were analyzed with SPSS 16. ANOVA, chi, and exact test were calculated with considering P < .05 as significant level. Relative risks were calculated with confidence interval 95%. The means of lipid profiles were in normal ranges. The relative risks for triglycerides more than 200 mg/dL was 1.57 (1.02-2.42) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) more than 130 mg/dL was 14.54 (3.54-59.65) in group 1. The relative risks for high density lipoprotein (HDL) less than 45 mg/dL was 14.61 (8.31-25.68) in group 1 and 16.00 (8.30-30.83) in group 3. After multinomial logistic regression they had significant differences. Psychological stress was a risk factor for lipid disorders, and suitable physical activity was protective in this situation.",Medicine,2017 May,United States,2017,10
23489711,The challenges of injuries and trauma in Pakistan: an opportunity for concerted action.,"Injuries and trauma are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in low and middle income countries (LMICs). In Pakistan, a low income South Asian developing country, they are among the top ten contributors to disease burden and causes of disabilities, with the majority of the burden falling on younger people in the population. This burden of injuries comes with a high social and economic cost. Several distal and proximal determinants, such as poverty, political instability, frequent natural disasters, and the lack of legislation and enforcement of preventive measures, make the Pakistani population susceptible to injuries. Historically, there has been a low level of investment in the prevention of injuries in Pakistan. Data is limited and while a public sector surveillance project has been initiated in one major urban centre, the major sources of information on injuries have been police and hospital records. Given the cost-effectiveness of injury prevention programs and their success in other LMICs, it is essential that the public sector invest in injury prevention through improving national policies and creating a strong evidence-based strategy while collaborating with the private sector to promote injury prevention and mobilizing people to engage in these programs.",Public health,2013 Aug,Netherlands,2013,10
26204950,"Prevalence of depression and associated factors among Somali refugee at Melkadida camp, Southeast Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Psychological distress, psychosomatic complaints and clinical mental disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder are highly prevalent among refugees than other populations. Even though there were several studies done on mental health of refugees globally, there is very few in Ethiopia regarding the mental health of these vulnerable populations. Thus we aimed at determining the prevalence of depression and identifying determinants of depression among refugees. METHODS: A community based cross-sectional multistage survey with 847 adult refugees was conducted in May 2014 at Melkadida camp, Southeast Ethiopia. Data were collected by face to face interviews on socio demographic by using structured questionnaire, level of exposure to trauma by Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and depression symptoms by using Patient Health Questionnaire. Data entry and clearance were carried out by EpInfo version 7 and analysis was carried out by Statistical Package for Social Sciences version-20 software package. Data was examined using descriptive statistics and logistic regression, odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. RESULT: Over one third (38.3 %) of respondents met the symptoms criteria for depression. Gender, marital status, displaced previously as refugee, witnessing murderer of family or friend, lack of house or shelter and being exposed to increased number of cumulative traumatic events were significantly associated with depression among Somali refugees in Melkadida camp. CONCLUSION: The study revealed a relatively high prevalence of depression episode among refugees. Being female, divorced, deprived of shelter and witnessing the murder of family are most determinants of depression in refugees. Strengthening the clinical set up and establishing good referral linkage with mental health institutions is strongly recommended.",BMC psychiatry,2015 Jul 24,England,2015,10
28400128,HTA programme response to the challenges of dealing with orphan medicinal products: Process evaluation in selected European countries.,"BACKGROUND: Challenges commonly encountered in HTA of orphan medicinal products (OMPs) were identified in Advance-HTA. Since then, new initiatives have been developed to specifically address issues related to HTA of OMPs. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This study aimed to understand why these new HTA initiatives in England, Scotland and at European-level were established and whether they resolve the challenges of OMPs. The work of Advance-HTA was updated with a literature review and a conceptual framework of clinical, regulatory and economic challenges for OMPs was developed. The new HTA programmes were critiqued against the conceptual framework and outstanding challenges identified. RESULTS: The new programmes in England and Scotland recognise the challenges identified in demonstrating the value of ultra-OMPs (and OMPs) and that they require a different process to standard HTA approaches. Wider considerations of disease and treatment experiences from a multi-stakeholder standpoint are needed, combined with other measures to deal with uncertainty (e.g. managed entry agreements). While approaches to assessing this new view of value of OMPs, extending beyond cost/QALY frameworks, differ, their criteria are similar. These are complemented by a European initiative that fosters multi-stakeholder dialogue and consensus about value determinants throughout the life-cycle of an OMP. CONCLUSION: New HTA programmes specific to OMPs have been developed but questions remain about whether they sufficiently capture value and manage uncertainty in clinical practice.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 Feb,Ireland,2019,10
28079622,Prevalence and Determinants of Job Stress in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors have been shown to predict a poor disease course in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but whether this applies to job stress is currently unknown. We assessed the prevalence of job stress and its correlates in a large cohort of patients with IBD. METHODS: We included all adult, professionally active patients enrolled between 2006 and 2015 in the Swiss IBD Cohort. Job stress was measured through the self-report effort-reward imbalance ratio and overcommitment (OC) to work questionnaires. We used multiple linear regressions to assess association with sociodemographic, lifestyle, psychosocial, and disease-related factors. RESULTS: Altogether 1656 patients completed the questionnaires (905 Crohn's disease and 751 ulcerative colitis/IBD unclassified). Only 91 (5.7%) of patients had an effort-reward imbalance ratio >1. Effort-reward imbalance and OC scores were higher in full-time versus part-time employees (coef = 0.050, P = 0.002; coef = 0.906, P < 0.001) and among those absent from the workplace in the previous 3 months (coef = 0.049, P = 0.010; coef = 1.062, P < 0.001). Higher OC scores were associated with sex (women vs. men: coef = 0.568, P = 0.014), being in a relationship (coef = 0.805, P = 0.001), higher level of occupation (director vs. trainee: coef = 1.447, P < 0.001), and extraintestinal manifestations (coef = 0.623, P = 0.005). Patients hospitalized in the previous 12 months had lower OC scores (coef = 0.560, P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The average level of job stress seems to be remarkably low in patients with IBD from Switzerland. The clinician should turn attention especially to women, full-time employees with a high level of education, and patients with extraintestinal manifestations to identify those with the most vulnerability to suffer from job stress.",Inflammatory bowel diseases,2017 Feb,England,2017,10
23965730,Mapping resilience pathways of Indigenous youth in five circumpolar communities.,"This introduction to the Special Issue Indigenous Youth Resilience in the Arctic reviews relevant resilience theory and research, with particular attention to Arctic Indigenous youth. Current perspectives on resilience, as well as the role of social determinants, and community resilience processes in understanding resilience in Indigenous circumpolar settings are reviewed. The distinctive role for qualitative inquiry in understanding these frameworks is emphasized, as is the uniquely informative lens youth narratives can offer in understanding Indigenous, cultural, and community resilience processes during times of social transition. We then describe key shared cross-site methodological elements of the Circumpolar Indigenous Pathways to Adulthood study, including sampling, research design, procedures, and analytic strategies. The site-specific papers further elaborate on methods, focusing on those elements unique to each site, and describe in considerable detail locally salient stressors and culturally patterned resilience strategies operating in each community. The concluding paper considers these across sites, exploring continuities and discontinuities, and the influence of cross-national social policies.",Transcultural psychiatry,2014 Oct,England,2014,10
24495363,Patterns and determinants of the use of complementary and alternative medicine: a cross-sectional study of hypertensive patients in Ghana.,"BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widespread and high utilization rates are associated with people who have chronic conditions like hypertension which management requires adherence to conventional treatment. Often however, the use of alternative medicines has been linked to negative health outcomes. The purpose of the study therefore was to evaluate the pattern, determinants and the association between CAM use and the adherence behaviour of hypertensive patients in Ghana. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using 400 hypertensive patients attending Korle-bu and Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospitals in Ghana from May to July, 2012. Information was gathered on the socio-demographic characteristics of patients, CAM use, and adherence using the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS). RESULTS: Out of the 400 study participants, 78 (19.5%) reported using CAM with the majority (65.38%) utilizing biological based therapies. About 70% of CAM users had not disclosed their CAM use to their healthcare professionals citing fear and the lack of inquiry by these health professionals as the main reasons for non-disclosure. Males were 2.86 more likely to use CAM than females [odds ratio (OR) = 2.86 (95% CI 1.48-5.52), p = 0.002]. Participants who could not afford their medications had 3.85 times likelihood of CAM use than those who could afford their medicines [OR = 3.85 (1.15-12.5), p = 0.029]. In addition, a significant relationship between CAM use and experiences of anti-hypertensive side effects was observed, X2 = 25.378, p < 0.0001. CAM users were 2.22 times more likely to be non-adherent than participants who did not use CAM [OR = 2.22 (0.70-7.14), p = 0.176]. CONCLUSION: Hypertensive patients in Ghana have shown utilization for CAM. It is important that healthcare providers understand the patterns and determinants of CAM use among their patients. Intervention programmes can then be incorporated to enhance the desired health outcomes of patients.",BMC complementary and alternative medicine,2014 Feb 4,England,2014,10
30892532,Functional Health Literacy in chronic cardiovascular patients.,"Functional Health Literacy (FHL) is the ability to retrieve, process and understand information in order to make appropriate decisions regarding self-care, defined by the World Health Organization as a social determinant of health. Its evaluation is important especially between patients with noncommunicable chronic diseases, given the need of permanent health care. This paper aims to evaluate the FHL in patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases and possible implications to the understanding of the disease and medical instructions and adherence to the measures proposed by health professionals. This is a cross-sectional and quantitative study with the application of tool S-TOFHLA and a structured questionnaire on 345 patients of a cardiovascular disease outpatient service in Juiz de Fora. Less than a half (49.3%) of the sample showed adequate FHL. Satisfactory FHL was associated with lower ageand higher schooling. Lower FHL evidenced that it can influence the impaired comprehension of the disease and medical instructions and the rare habit to question professionals. A high prevalence of inadequate FHL was identified in our sample and was associated with the impaired understanding of the disease and medical instructions, showing the need to streamline medical communication in this group.",Ciencia & saude coletiva,2019 Mar,Brazil,2019,10
26863336,The Relationship Between Education and Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Among Urban African American Medicare Beneficiaries.,"PURPOSE: We examined the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) cancer screening among older African American men. METHODS: We analyzed baseline data from a sample of 485 community-dwelling African American men who participated in the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Demonstration Trial. The outcome was receipt of PSA screening within the past year. SES was measured using income and educational attainment. Sequential multivariate logistic regression models were performed to study whether health care access, patient-provider relationship, and cancer fatalism mediated the relationship between SES and PSA screening. RESULTS: Higher educational attainment was significantly associated with higher odds of PSA screening in the past year (odds ratio (OR) 2.08 for college graduate compared to less than high school graduate, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.03-4.24); income was not. Health care access and patient-provider communication did not alter the relationship between education and screening; however, beliefs regarding cancer fatalism partially mediated the observed relationship. CONCLUSION: Rates of prostate cancer screening among African American men vary by level of educational attainment; beliefs concerning cancer fatalism help explain this gradient. Understanding the determinants of cancer fatalism is a critical next step in building interventions that seek to ensure equitable access to prostate cancer screening.",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,2015 Jun,Switzerland,2015,10
22201236,"""We're going to have to cut loose some of our personal beliefs"": barriers and opportunities in providing HIV prevention to African American men who have sex with men and women.","In the United States, there is an urgent need to provide HIV prevention services to African American men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) but who do not identify as gay or homosexual. Engaging these men in HIV prevention has historically been challenging. This study used qualitative methodology to explore the beliefs and experiences from community-based service providers (n = 21) and from African American MSMW (n = 21) regarding the provision of HIV prevention education and counseling to these men. Data analysis revealed that (a) African American MSMW who do not identify as gay can challenge service providers' assumptions about sexual behavior and sexual identity; (b) service providers' attitudes toward these men can be affected by ambivalent or negative beliefs that pervade the general community; (c) African American MSMW need safe and nonjudgmental spaces that offer HIV risk reduction, but they also might experience anxiety about disclosing same-sex behaviors to counselors. Findings highlighted the complexities related to culture, masculinity, and sexuality as determinants of HIV risk in African American MSMW, and findings also revealed tensions between these factors that may affect the quality of HIV prevention services. Service providers may need additional training to provide appropriate and non-judgmental HIV prevention counseling and education.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,2011 Dec,United States,2011,10

21576964,Exploratory study on domain-specific determinants of opiate-dependent individuals' quality of life.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Studies on determinants of quality of life (QoL) among opiate-dependent individuals are scarce. Moreover, findings concerning the role of severity of drug use are inconsistent. This exploratory study investigates the association between domain-specific QoL and demographic, social, person, health and drug-related variables, and potential indirect effects of current heroin use on opiate-dependent individuals' QoL. METHODS: A cohort of opiate-dependent individuals who started outpatient methadone treatment at least 5 years previously (n = 159) were interviewed about their current QoL, psychological distress, satisfaction with methadone treatment and the severity of drug-related problems using the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile, the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Verona Service Satisfaction Scale for Methadone Treatment and the EuropASI. RESULTS: None of the QoL domains were defined by the same compilation of determinants. No direct effect of current heroin use on QoL was retained, but path analyses demonstrated its indirect effects on the domains of 'living situation', 'finances' and 'leisure and social participation'. CONCLUSION: These findings illustrate the particularity of each QoL domain and the need for a multidimensional approach to the concept. The relationship between current heroin use and various domains of opiate-dependent individuals' QoL is complex, indirect and mediated by psychosocial and treatment-related variables.",European addiction research,2011,Switzerland,2011,10
25805778,Trend analyses in the health behaviour in school-aged children study: methodological considerations and recommendations.,"BACKGROUND: This article presents the scope and development of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, reviews trend papers published on international HBSC data up to 2012 and discusses the efforts made to produce reliable trend analyses. METHODS: The major goal of this article is to present the statistical procedures and analytical strategies for upholding high data quality, as well as reflections from the authors of this article on how to produce reliable trends based on an international study of the magnitude of the HBSC study. HBSC is an international cross-sectional study collecting data from adolescents aged 11-15 years, on a broad variety of health determinants and health behaviours. RESULTS: A number of methodological challenges have stemmed from the growth of the HBSC-study, in particular given that the study has a focus on monitoring trends. Some of those challenges are considered. When analysing trends, researchers must be able to assess whether a change in prevalence is an expression of an actual change in the observed outcome, whether it is a result of methodological artefacts, or whether it is due to changes in the conceptualization of the outcome by the respondents. CONCLUSION: The article present recommendations to take a number of the considerations into account. The considerations imply methodological challenges, which are core issues in undertaking trend analyses.",European journal of public health,2015 Apr,England,2015,10
23510643,The Sydney Centenarian Study: methodology and profile of centenarians and near-centenarians.,"BACKGROUND: The study of exceptionally long-living individuals can inform us about the determinants of successful aging. There are few population-based studies of centenarians and near-centenarians internationally, but none in Australia. METHODS: Individuals 95 years and older were recruited from seven electoral districts in Sydney using the electoral roll, Medicare lists, and multiple other strategies to obtain a representative sample. Physical and mental health and cognitive status were assessed using standard instruments in multiple sessions, with assessments individually adapted. An informant was interviewed, and participants were invited to donate a blood sample, undergo an MRI scan, and enrol into the brain donation program. RESULTS: Preliminary data on the first 200 participants are reported. Mean age was 97.4 years (range 95-106), with 29.5% being men, and 58.5% living in a private dwelling. Rates of heart disease and diabetes were lower than in octogenarians, but hearing and visual deficits were common. The mean mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score was 21.1, with men performing better. Rates of psychological distress were low and satisfaction with life high (mean 5.91 out of a maximum of 7); 54% scored <24 on MMSE; 39.5% were impaired on both MMSE and a functional measure; and 20% had previous diagnosis of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: This is a preliminary report describing the methodology of the study. It provides further evidence that dementia is not inevitable at this age and independent living is common. The study provides an excellent resource to determine the genetic and environmental contributions to long and successful cognitive aging.",International psychogeriatrics,2013 Jun,England,2013,10
29989009,Remote Dwelling Location Is a Risk Factor for CKD Among Indigenous Canadians.,"Introduction: Rural and remote indigenous individuals have a high burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared to the general population. However, it has not been previously explored how these rates compare to urban-dwelling indigenous populations. Methods: In a recent cross-sectional screening study, 1346 adults 18 to 80 years of age were screened for CKD and diabetes across 11 communities in rural and remote areas in Manitoba, Canada, as part of the First Nations Community Based Screening to Improve Kidney Health and Prevent Dialysis (FINISHED) program. An additional 284 Indigenous adults who resided in low-income areas in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada were screened as part of the NorWest Mobile Diabetes and Kidney Disease Screening and Intervention Project. Results: Our findings indicate that a gradient of CKD and diabetes prevalence exists for Indigenous individuals living in different geographic areas. Compared to urban-dwelling Indigenous individuals, rural-dwelling individuals had more than a 2-fold (2.1, 95% CI = 1.4-3.1) increase in diabetes whereas remote-dwelling individuals had a 4-fold (4.1, 95% CI = 2.8-6.0) increase, and more than a 3-fold (3.1, 95% CI = 2.2-4.5) increase in CKD prevalence. Conclusion: Although these results highlight the relative importance of geography in determining the prevalence of diabetes and CKD in Indigenous Canadians, geography is but an important surrogate of other determinants, such as poverty and access to care.",Kidney international reports,2018 Jul,United States,2018,10
27099360,The ethics and politics of mindfulness-based interventions.,"Recently, there has been a lot of enthusiasm for mindfulness practice and its use in healthcare, businesses and schools. An increasing number of studies give us ground for cautious optimism about the potential of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) to improve people's lives across a number of dimensions. This paper identifies and addresses some of the main ethical and political questions for larger-scale MBIs. First, how far are MBIs compatible with liberal neutrality given the great diversity of lifestyles and conceptions of the good characteristic of modern societies? It will be argued that the potential benefits of contemporary secular mindfulness practice are indeed of a sufficiently primary or all-purpose nature to qualify as suitable goals of liberal public policy. Second, what challenges are brought up if mindfulness is used in contexts and applications-such as military settings-whose goals seem incompatible with the ethical and soteriological views of traditional mindfulness practice? It will be argued that, given concerns regarding liberal neutrality and reasonable disagreement about ethics, MBIs should avoid strong ethical commitments. Therefore, it should, in principle, be applicable in contexts of controversial moral value. Finally, drawing on recent discussions within the mindfulness community, it is argued that we should not overstate the case for mindfulness and not crowd out discussion of organisational and social determinants of stress, lowered well-being, and mental illness and the collective measures necessary to address them.",Journal of medical ethics,2016 Jul,England,2016,10
29402495,Effect of inhaled medication on dental caries index in asthmatic children.,"INTRODUCTION: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of airways with a high prevalence among children in pre-school ages. Considering controversial results in different studies about the effect of this disease on the indices of dental caries, the aim of this study was to compare dmft (decay, missing, filling teeth) situation in asthmatic and non-asthmatic 6-12-year-old children. METHODS: This was a case-control study on 46 asthmatic and 47 non-asthmatic children aged 6-12 years. In asthmatic children, the severity of disease, type and dose of the administered inhalational drug, duration of drug consumption, times and technique of drug administration, and washing the mouth after drug consumption was assessed. The index of primary teeth decay or dmft, dental plaque and gingival inflammation were recorded in both groups. Data were analysed by SPSS (ver. 22) using Student's T-test, chi-square test and linear regression. FINDINGS: dmft in case and control groups was 5.25+/-2.25 and 4.15+/-3.27, respectively and the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.062). None of the variables related to asthma affected dmft (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Suffering from asthma does not affect the risk of decay in primary teeth.",Allergologia et immunopathologia,2018 Mar - Apr,Spain,2018,10
27393535,Longitudinal clustering of tuberculosis incidence and predictors for the time profiles: the impact of HIV.,"BACKGROUND: Portugal remains the country with the highest tuberculosis (TB) incidence in Western Europe. OBJECTIVES: To identify longitudinal trends in TB incidence in Portugal from 2002 to 2012 and investigate the longitudinal effect of sociodemographic and health-related predictors among the resident population on the TB incidence rate. METHODS: We used data from the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System and other national institutions. K-means longitudinal clustering algorithm was performed on TB incidence time profiles from districts of Portugal. RESULTS: Three longitudinal profiles for the TB incidence rate of Portugal were identified. In all of them, TB incidence decreased over time. Among all studied sociodemographic and health-related predictors, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) notification rate and unemployment were shown to have (positive) significant effects on TB incidence. In particular, the greatest effects were found for the HIV notification rate. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the view that combined TB-HIV strategies and the improvement of social determinants can contribute to decreases in TB incidence.",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,2016 Aug,France,2016,10
31038652,Trends in tuberculosis mortality in Brazil (1990-2015): joinpoint analysis.,"The objective of this study was to analyze trends in the tuberculosis mortality rate in Brazil (1990-2015) in an ecological time-series analysis. The indicators were obtained from the Brazilian National Ministry of Health. A joinpoint regression model was applied for the temporal analysis, with a level of significance of 5%. During the period in question, there was a trend toward a reduction in mortality in the country as a whole (p < 0.001) and in each of its five regions. The states with the highest tuberculosis mortality rates were Rio de Janeiro (7.0/100,000 population) and Pernambuco (5.0/100,000 population). Eleven states and the Federal District of Brasilia showed downward trends. Only the state of Alagoas showed a significant increase (p < 0.001). The temporal behavior observed indicates that tuberculosis continues to be a major public health problem in Brazil.",Jornal brasileiro de pneumologia : publicacao oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisilogia,2019 Apr 25,Brazil,2019,10
28087854,"A Structural Equation Modeling of the Relationships between Depression, Drug Abuse and Social Support with Suicidal Ideation among Soldiers in Iran in 2015.","BACKGROUND: Military service is a crucial period in the lives of young people and during this period soldier facing with multiple psychosocial problems. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to explore structural analysis of the relationships between depression, drug abuse, social support and the risk of suicidal ideation among Military Medical University soldiers in Iran. METHODS: In the present correlational research, a sample of 176 soldiers, from three units, was selected using randomly stratified sampling. Data were collected through the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) and the Possibility of Drug Abuse Scale (LDAS). Structural equation modeling was used to test the fit of the model, identify direct and indirect effects of the psychosocial correlates. Data were analyzed using the SPSS and AMOS software (Verson22). RESULTS: out of the whole subjects, 28.4% had suicidal ideation and 65.3% had degrees of depression (mild to severe). A significant reverse relationship was observed between social support and suicidal ideation (p<0.05). The strongest relationship was detected between drug abuse and suicidal ideation. The final structural model indicated that 74% of the variance in suicidal ideation was explained by the three examined variables of depression, social support and drug abuse. CONCLUSIONS: The overall results showed that the risk of suicidal ideation, depression and drug abuse are relatively significant in Military Medical University soldiers requiring taking serious actions by the authorities and other relevant organizations in order to improve the psychosocial health status of these soldiers.",Journal of research in health sciences,2016 fall,Iran,2016,10
28689084,Regional variations in frequency of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) monitoring in Korea: A multilevel analysis of nationwide data.,"PURPOSE: Suboptimal frequency of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) monitoring is associated with poor diabetes control. We aimed to analyze compliance to HbA1c testing guidelines and explore associated individual and area-level determinants, focusing on regional variation. METHODS: This cross-sectional study between the period of 2012-2013 was conducted by using the Korean National Health Insurance Research Database, and included 45,634 patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, who were prescribed any anti-diabetic medications, including insulin. We calculated the proportion of each HbA1c testing frequency (>/=1, >/=2, or >/=4 times per year) stratified by 17 administrative regions. Multilevel and multivariate logistic analyses were performed with regional (proportion of farmer population) and individual characteristics (age, sex, income level, duration of diabetes, and most visited medical institution). RESULTS: Overall, 67.3% of the patients received>/=1 HbA1c test per year; 37.8% and 6.1% received >/=2 and >/=4 tests per year, respectively. Those managed in secondary-level hospitals or clinics and those living in rural areas were less likely to receive HbA1c testing. Even after adjusting for individual and regional level characteristics, significant area level variation was observed (variance participant coefficients were 7.91%, 9.58%, and 14.43% for testing frequencies of >/=1, >/=2, and >/=4 times a year, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of HbA1c monitoring is suboptimal in Korea, especially in rural areas. Moreover, significant regional variation was observed, implying a contextual effect. This suggests the need for developing policy actions to improve HbA1c monitoring. In particular, access to HbA1c testing in rural primary care clinics must be improved.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2017 Sep,Ireland,2017,10
25444641,[Quality of life in Latin American immigrant caregivers in Spain].,"OBJECTIVE: To describe perceived quality of life in Latin American caregivers working in Spain and how it varies in relation to certain variables shared by this group. METHODS: We used the SF-36 to measure perceived quality of life in 517 women residing in five Spanish regions: the Balearic Islands, Catalonia, the Basque Country, the Canary Islands, and Madrid. Several variables related to the socio-demographic profile and migration process were studied using Student's t test, ANOVA and linear regression models. RESULTS: The participants scored very low on the dimensions of physical and emotional roles. The factors associated with lower quality of life scores within the group were working as a live-in caregiver, lack of contract, multitasking, irregular status, and younger age. CONCLUSIONS: The vulnerability of these women can be explained by poor working conditions and other factors related to the migratory process.",Gaceta sanitaria,2015 Mar-Apr,Spain,2015,10
22981840,Embedded gender and social changes underpinning inequalities in health: an ethnographic insight into a local Spanish context.,"Despite growing interest in the social determinants of health and contributions from studies focussing on the analysis of explanations to enhance our understanding of the interactions between gender identities, embodied experiences and structural inequalities between men and women, few research papers have devoted attention to this perspective in the Spanish context. This study is an empirical exploration of lay knowledge, for an enhanced understanding of health inequalities in this context, from an ethnographic standpoint based on a phenomenological approach. Specifically, our aim is to study the lay perceptions of men and women regarding their gender identity and living conditions as health determinants within different ""contexts"" of their everyday lives, namely: the personal context; the home context; and the neighbourhood context. Fifty eight in-depth interviews and three focus groups were held between January 2005 and January 2007, and analysed using a hermeneutic method. Our findings show how disease-coping strategies or the perceived loss of social cohesion are linked to the gender system. They also point to how the dynamics of social change have developed around a strong division between the productive and reproductive arenas. Approaching these issues from different ""contexts"" provides insights into the explanations for the gendered patterning of mortality and morbidity, as well as furthering our understanding of the basis for social embodiment of gender differences and health inequalities in the context studied. In the discussion of our findings, we place emphasis on the implications that informal caring has for these processes and also take into account contributions of the ""lay approach"" to study and understand social determinants and health inequalities.",Social science & medicine (1982),2012 Dec,England,2012,10
25690345,The role of perceived barriers and objectively measured physical activity in adults aged 65-100.,"OBJECTIVE: to test the predictive utility of perceived barriers to objectively measured physical activity levels in a stratified sample of older adults when accounting for social-cognitive determinants proposed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), and economic and demographic factors. METHODS: data were analysed from the Physical Activity Cohort Scotland survey, a representative and stratified (65-80 and 80+ years; deprived and affluent) sample of 584 community-dwelling older people, resident in Tayside, Scotland. Physical activity was measured objectively by accelerometry. RESULTS: perceived barriers clustered around the areas of poor health, lack of interest, lack of safety and lack of access. Perceived poor health and lack of interest, but not lack of access or concerns about personal safety, predicted physical activity after controlling for demographic, economic and TPB variables. DISCUSSION: perceived person-related barriers (poor health and lack of interest) seem to be more strongly associated with physical activity levels than perceived environmental barriers (safety and access) in a large sample of older adults. Perceived barriers are modifiable and may be a target for future interventions.",Age and ageing,2015 May,England,2015,10
21505386,Interaction of mathematical modeling and social and behavioral HIV/AIDS research.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: HIV is transmitted within complex biobehavioral systems. Mathematical modeling can provide insight to complex population-level outcomes of various behaviors measured at an individual level. RECENT FINDINGS: HIV models in the social and behavioral sciences can be categorized in a number of ways; here, we consider two classes of applications common in the field generally, and in the past year in particular: those models that explore significant behavioral determinants of HIV disparities within and between populations; and those models that seek to evaluate the potential impact of specific social and behavioral interventions. SUMMARY: We discuss two overarching issues we see in the field: the need to further systematize effectiveness models of behavioral interventions, and the need for increasing investigation of the use of behavioral data in epidemic models. We believe that a recent initiative by the National Institutes of Health will qualitatively change the relationships between epidemic modeling and sociobehavioral prevention research in the coming years.",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,2011 Mar,United States,2011,10
31366292,Employer-Supported Volunteerism in Rural Worksites.,"Employer-supported volunteerism has the potential to benefit employees and ultimately have a positive business impact. Volunteerism has been linked to improved quality of life, reduced morbidity, and higher self-rated health. This study was designed to understand what small, rural worksites are doing with regard to volunteerism, and what their barriers are to such activities. An online survey was distributed to worksites using the social network of a Resource, Conservation, and Development Council, a rural nonprofit entity. Analyses included descriptive statistics, and for qualitative data, review and summary of common themes. Thirty-eight worksites responded, representing a wide range of worksite types. Volunteer activities requiring less time and resources to organize were more commonly employed versus group-based activities. Identified barriers included time, costs, small staffing numbers, perceived employee lack of interest, worksite policies, distance to volunteer sites, language barriers, and lack of awareness of opportunities. Despite a variety of challenges, some forms of employer-supported volunteerism seem feasible even in very small rural worksites. Worksite type, culture, and leadership are likely to be determinants of the extent and nature of employer-supported volunteerism. Strategies to encourage greater volunteerism need to be tailored to the interests and resources of each site. Occupational health nurses should consider incorporating some form of employee volunteerism activities within their health promotion programming, as it is consistent with an overall strategy of enhancing employee well-being. This could lead to positive business impacts such as increased employee engagement, improved recruitment and retention, and improved productivity.",Workplace health & safety,2019 Oct,United States,2019,10
26136082,Spatial social polarisation: using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes jointly for income and race/ethnicity to analyse risk of hypertension.,"BACKGROUND: Growing spatial social and economic polarisation may be an important societal determinant of health, but only a few studies have used the recently developed Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) to analyse the impact of joint concentrations of privilege and privation on health outcomes. We explore use of the ICE to investigate risk of hypertension in an urban, multiracial/ethnic, and predominantly working-class study population of US adults. METHODS: We generated novel ICE measures at the census tract level that jointly assess extreme concentrations of both income and racial/ethnic composition. We then linked the ICE measures to data from two observational, cross-sectional studies conducted in the Boston metropolitan area (2003-2004; 2008-2010; N=2145). RESULTS: The ICE measure for extreme concentrations of white compared with black residents was independently associated with lower odds of hypertension (OR=0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93), controlling for race/ethnicity, age, gender, smoking, body mass index, household income, education and self-reported exposure to racial discrimination. Even stronger associations were observed for the ICE measures that compared concentrations of high-income white residents versus low-income residents of colour (OR=0.61; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.96) and high-income white versus low-income black residents (OR=0.48; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest public health studies should explore the joint impact of racial/ethnic and economic spatial polarisation on population health.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2015 Dec,England,2015,10
28649608,Distribution and impact on quality of life of the pain modalities assessed by the King's Parkinson's disease pain scale.,"In Parkinson's disease, pain is a prevalent and complex symptom of diverse origin. King's Parkinson's disease pain scale, assesses different pain syndromes, thus allowing exploration of its differential prevalence and influence on the health-related quality of life of patients. Post hoc study 178 patients and 83 matched controls participating in the King's Parkinson's disease pain scale validation study were used. For determining the respective distribution, King's Parkinson's disease pain scale items and domains scores = 0 meant absence and >/=1 presence of the symptom. The regular scores were used for the other analyses. Health-related quality of lifewas evaluated with EQ-5D-3L and PDQ-8 questionnaires. Parkinson's disease patients experienced more pain modalities than controls. In patients, Pain around joints (King's Parkinson's disease pain scale item 1) and Pain while turning in bed (item 8) were the most prevalent types of pain, whereas Burning mouth syndrome (item 11) and Pain due to grinding teeth (item 10) showed the lowest frequency. The total number of experienced pain modalities closely correlated with the PDQ-8 index, but not with other variables. For all pain types except Pain around joints (item 1) and pain related to Periodic leg movements/RLS (item 7), patients with pain had significantly worse health-related quality of life. The influence of pain, as a whole, on the health-related quality of life was not remarkable after adjustment by other variables. When the particular types of pain were considered, adjusted by sex, age, and Parkinson's disease duration, pain determinants were different for EQ-5D-3L and PDQ-8. King's Parkinson's disease pain scale allows exploring the distribution of the diverse syndromic pain occurring in Parkinson's disease and its association with health-related quality of life.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2017,United States,2017,10
26231758,"Household antimicrobial self-medication: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the burden, risk factors and outcomes in developing countries.","BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial self-medication is common in most low and middle income countries (LMICs). However there has been no systematic review on non-prescription antimicrobial use in these settings. This review thus intended to establish the burden, risk factors and effects of antimicrobial self-medication in Low and Middle Income Countries. METHODS: In 2012, we registered a systematic review protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42012002508). We searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Embase databases using the following terms; ""self-medication"", ""non-prescription"", 'self-treatment', ""antimicrobial"", ""antimalarial"", ""antibiotic"", ""antibacterial"" ""2002-2012"" and combining them using Boolean operators. We performed independent and duplicate screening and abstraction of study administrative data, prevalence, determinants, type of antimicrobial agent, source, disease conditions, inappropriate use, drug adverse events and clinical outcomes of antibiotic self-medication where possible. We performed a Random Effects Meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of thirty four (34) studies involving 31,340 participants were included in the review. The overall prevalence of antimicrobial self-medication was 38.8 % (95 % CI: 29.5-48.1). Most studies assessed non-prescription use of antibacterial (17/34: 50 %) and antimalarial (5/34: 14.7 %) agents. The common disease symptoms managed were, respiratory (50 %), fever (47 %) and gastrointestinal (45 %). The major sources of antimicrobials included, pharmacies (65.5 %), leftover drugs (50 %) and drug shops (37.5 %). Twelve (12) studies reported inappropriate drug use; not completing dose (6/12) and sharing of medicines (4/12). The main determinants of antimicrobial self-medication include, level of education, age, gender, past successful use, severity of illness and income. Reported negative outcomes of antimicrobial self-medication included, allergies (2/34: 5.9 %), lack of cure (4/34: 11.8 %) and causing death (2/34: 5.9 %). The commonly reported positive outcome was recovery from illness (4/34: 11.8 %). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of antimicrobial self-medication is high and varies in different communities as well as by social determinants of health and is frequently associated with inappropriate drug use.",BMC public health,2015 Aug 1,England,2015,10
30455507,Understanding Generational Differences in Early Fertility: Proximate and Social Determinants.,"Although US rates of early fertility have declined, they remain high relative to other high-income countries, and disparities by population group persist. The share of the US youth population with immigrant parents has expanded greatly, yet relatively little is known about generational variations in early fertility. This study used Add Health data to investigate: (1) differences by generational status in the risk of early childbearing; (2) to what extent observed differences reflected timing of sexual onset versus post-onset proximate determinants like contraceptive use; and (3) the influence of individual-, family-, and neighborhood-level social factors. Foreign-born and second-generation young women initiated both sexual activity and childbearing later than those with US-born parents. Sequential hazard models revealed the importance of later sexual onset in explaining delayed fertility among the foreign-born, and of family attributes for their later sexual onset. Post-onset behaviors were central to the delayed childbearing observed among the second generation.",Journal of marriage and the family,2018 Oct,United States,2018,10

31563833,Reintegrating contexts into quantitative intersectional analyses of health inequalities.,"Quantitative intersectional analyses often overlook the roles of contexts in shaping intersectional experiences and outcomes. This study advances a novel approach for integrating quantitative intersectional methods with models of contextual-level determinants of health inequalities. Building on recent methodological advancements, I propose an adaptation of intersectional MAIHDA (multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy) where respondents are nested hierarchically in social strata defined by gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic classifications interacted with contextual classifications. To demonstrate this approach I examine past-month adolescent cigarette use intersectionally by school- and neighborhood-poverty status in Wave 1 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N=17,234). I conclude by discussing the adaptability of this approach to a variety of research questions, including intersectional effects that vary by contextual exposures over time, positions in social networks, and exposures to social policies.",Health & place,2019 Nov,England,2019,10
31465909,Health literacy and quality of life in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy.,"This exploratory study examined the impact of health literacy on quality of life (QoL) in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy (TRE). Health literacy is a discrete form of literacy in which an individual can readily interpret prose and apply that skill to understand medical, pharmaceutical, and self-management information. From the perspectives of cultural health capital (CHC) and social disability theory, we hypothesized that greater levels of health literacy would be associated with a higher QoL score. The sample (n=79) included adult patients with TRE enrolled in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Cannabidiol Program. The data were analyzed by using nested linear regression. Respondents aged 19-63years (mean, standard deviation [SD]=32.9 [13.65]) and were 92% white; 44% of patients were in Special Education until age 21years, and 29% reported a total annual family income of less than $25,000. Significant bivariate relationships were found between health literacy and QoL (p=.004), age (p=.0001), and income (p=.036). There was a significant difference in health literacy scores for patients who completed high school or less (mean [SD]=0.68 [0.86]) and those with any postsecondary education (mean [SD]=1.59 [1.0]). The regression results showed health literacy to be positively associated with QoL where a 1% increase in health literacy was associated with a 6.61-point increase in QoL (p=.004), and this pattern persisted through each addition of other independent factors and control variables. This is one of the first studies investigating the role of health literacy in QoL among patients with TRE. The results suggest that health literacy is important and may function as a tool through which healthcare participation is expanded. Further research is needed with larger, more diverse, and longitudinal samples to accurately model the development of health literacy and its impact on QoL in this population.",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2019 Oct,United States,2019,10
31320802,"Demographic Determinants of Influenza Vaccination and Infection, Brazos County, Texas, 2017.","Background: Seasonal influenza constitutes an enormous public health burden. The 2017-2018 influenza season was the most severe since the 2009 novel Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. The State of Texas, like other states, experienced unusually high and persistent influenza activity. Methods: Data on confirmed cases of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) in Brazos County during December 2017 were collected by the Brazos County Health Department (BCHD) from medical records. Records of vaccine administered between January 1 and December 31, 2017 were collected from vaccination providers. The total number of influenza cases for 2017 was compiled from regular weekly influenza counts reported to BCHD by healthcare providers. Results: A total of 1651 cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza were reported in Brazos County residents in December 2017, 10 times more than that reported in December 2016. The highest rates of infection were in 2 ZIP codes where vaccination rates were also high. A total of 16 027 influenza vaccinations were given to individuals reporting a residential address in Brazos County in 2017. Vaccination coverage was lowest among adults aged 18 to 49, whereas those aged 65 or older and Hispanics were most likely to be hospitalized. Discussion: Overall, vaccination coverage in Brazos County, Texas is low, less than half of the Healthy People 2020 target. The development of health education materials and an increased use of social media, local television and radio, and communication methods that can reach parents, younger adults, and Hispanic residents are needed.",Infectious diseases,2019,United States,2019,10
22788567,"Quality of life of individuals with schizophrenia living in the community: relationship to socio-demographic, clinical and psychosocial characteristics.","AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the level of quality of life in individuals with schizophrenia and to test its association with socio-demographic, clinical and psychosocial characteristics. BACKGROUND: Quality of life has been a focus of concern in mental health care, yet the level of quality of life and its determinants for individuals with schizophrenia are not well known. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive design. METHODS: A total of 148 individuals with schizophrenia participated in the study. A demographic information sheet, the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Chinese Health Questionnaires, the Mutuality Scale and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale, brief version, were used to collect data. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics, Pearson product-moment correlation and stepwise multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Most of participants were single, unemployed, had a low education level and were supported financially by family. Quality of life was positively correlated with age of mental illness onset, mutuality, employment status and monthly household income, whereas it was negatively associated with the length of mental illness, symptom severity and health status. Health status, mutuality, symptom severity, monthly household income and employment status were found to be key significant predictors with mutuality having the greatest effect on quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The findings increase our understanding of socio-demographic, clinical and psychosocial characteristics influencing the degree of quality of life in individuals with schizophrenia. Incorporation of families and communities into the treatment programmes would enhance patients' capabilities of social integration and satisfaction with their lives. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Health care providers should make use of community-oriented intervention programmes that aim to strengthen psychosocial functioning. Particularly, programmes that enhance health status and mutuality should be identified and developed for both individuals with schizophrenia and their families.",Journal of clinical nursing,2012 Aug,England,2012,10
24999368,Caregiver burden among adults caring for orphaned children in rural South Africa.,"The AIDS epidemic has created an unprecedented number of orphans. While largely absorbed by extended family, this additional responsibility can weigh heavily on their caregivers. The concept of caregiver burden captures multiple dimensions of well-being (e.g., physical, social and psychological). Measuring the extent and determinants of caregiving burden can inform the design of programmes to ease the negative consequences of caregiving. This study uses the baseline data from a study assessing interventions for orphans and vulnerable adolescents in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Orphan caregivers (n = 726) completed an adapted version of the 12-item Zarit Burden Interview. In addition to basic caregiver and household demographics, the survey also collected information on AIDS-related illness and recent deaths. Descriptive data are presented, followed by multivariate Poisson regression models to explore factors associated with caregiver burden. Approximately 40% of caregivers reported high levels of orphan caregiving burden. Feelings of stress and inadequacy concerning their care responsibilities as well as anger towards the child were common. Household food insecurity was the most important predictor of orphan caregiving burden (marginal effect = 7.82; p < 0.001 for those reporting severe hunger); income was also a significant determinant. When other AIDS impacts were added to the model, only the AIDS-related illness of the caregiver was significantly associated with burden (marginal effect = 3.77; p < 0.001). This study suggests that caregivers with economic vulnerability and those struggling with their own AIDS-related illness feel most overburdened. These findings are particularly relevant to service providers who must identify caregivers in need of immediate assistance and allocate limited resources effectively. To alleviate caregiver burden, programmes must foster greater economic security (e.g., by facilitating access to social grants or directly providing cash transfers) and coordinate services with home-based care programmes serving the chronically ill.",Vulnerable children and youth studies,2014 Sep,England,2014,10
29415721,"The associations between malaria, interventions, and the environment: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission is driven by multiple factors, including complex and multifaceted connections between malaria transmission, socioeconomic conditions, climate and interventions. Forecasting models should account for all significant drivers of malaria incidence although it is first necessary to understand the relationship between malaria burden and the various determinants of risk to inform the development of forecasting models. In this study, the associations between malaria risk, environmental factors, and interventions were evaluated through a systematic review. METHODS: Five electronic databases (CAB Abstracts, EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses) were searched for studies that included both the effects of the environment and interventions on malaria within the same statistical model. Studies were restricted to quantitative analyses and health outcomes of malaria mortality or morbidity, outbreaks, or transmission suitability. Meta-analyses were conducted on a subset of results using random-effects models. RESULTS: Eleven studies of 2248 potentially relevant articles that met inclusion criteria were identified for the systematic review and two meta-analyses based upon five results each were performed. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was not found to be statistically significant associated with malaria with a pooled OR of 1.10 (95% CI 0.07, 1.71). Bed net ownership was statistically associated with decreasing risk of malaria, when controlling for the effects of environment with a pooled OR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.60, 0.95). In general, environmental effects on malaria, while controlling for the effect of interventions, were variable and showed no particular pattern. Bed nets ownership, use and distribution, have a significant protective effect while controlling for environmental variables. CONCLUSIONS: There are a limited number of studies which have simultaneously evaluated both environmental and interventional effects on malaria risk. Poor statistical reporting and a lack of common metrics were important challenges for this review, which must be addressed to ensure reproducibility and quality research. A comprehensive or inclusive approach to identifying malaria determinants using standardized indicators would allow for a better understanding of its epidemiology, which is crucial to improve future malaria risk estimations.",Malaria journal,2018 Feb 7,England,2018,10
20427549,Protective roles of home and school environments for the health of young Canadians.,"BACKGROUND: The relationships of home and school environments, health risk behaviours and two sentinel adolescent health outcomes were examined in an aetiological analysis. The analysis focused on determinants of the health of young people and the role of school settings in the optimisation of health. METHODS: Records were examined from the Canadian sample of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Survey. 3402 young people in Ontario, Canada were administered this survey in 2006, of which 1966 were re-administered the survey 1 year later and supplied complete data. Individual items and factor-analytically derived scales were used to examine potential aetiological relationships in a series of structural equation models. Health outcomes examined were serious injury and psychosomatic symptoms. Models developed from cross-sectional data were confirmed longitudinally. RESULTS: Adolescents who reported negative home and school environments reported higher levels of substance use, psychosomatic symptoms and serious injuries (the latter identified in longitudinal analysis only). Engagement in health risk behaviour partially mediated the link between these two environments and the sentinel health outcomes. Positive school environments were protective in that they moderated associations between negative home environments and engagement in health risk behaviours. The effects observed in longitudinal analyses were generally consistent with those observed cross-sectionally. CONCLUSIONS: Negative home environments clearly place adolescents at risk for engagement in health risk behaviours and associated physical health outcomes. Positive school environments can in part moderate these relationships. Optimisation of school social environments therefore remains warranted as a population health strategy.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2011 May,England,2011,10
30247987,What psycho-social factors determine intimate partner violence of men against women? A social cognitive theory-based study.,"Despite the multidimensionality of intimate partner violence (IPV) against women, there is a lack of research on the perspectives of men toward the phenomenon. Our aim in this cross-sectional study was to examine the predictability of social cognitive theory in explaining men's violent behaviors against women. We find among a sample of 576 Iranian married men showed a reciprocal determinism between outcome expectancy, attitude toward IPV, and observational learning in formation of men's IPV against women. Therefore, the interactive associations of cognitive and environmental factors, as a comprehensive approach, should be considered while studying the determinants of IPV against women among men.",Health care for women international,2019 Nov,England,2019,10
25354071,Should MD-PhD programs encourage graduate training in disciplines beyond conventional biomedical or clinical sciences?,"The goal of MD-PhD training programs is to produce physician-scientists with unique capacities to lead the future biomedical research workforce. The current dearth of physician-scientists with expertise outside conventional biomedical or clinical sciences raises the question of whether MD-PhD training programs should allow or even encourage scholars to pursue doctoral studies in disciplines that are deemed nontraditional, yet are intrinsically germane to major influences on health. This question is especially relevant because the central value and ultimate goal of the academic medicine community is to help attain the highest level of health and health equity for all people. Advances in medical science and practice, along with improvements in health care access and delivery, are steps toward health equity, but alone they will not come close to eliminating health inequalities. Addressing the complex health issues in our communities and society as a whole requires a biomedical research workforce with knowledge, practice, and research skills well beyond conventional biomedical or clinical sciences. To make real progress in advancing health equity, educational pathways must prepare physician-scientists to treat both micro and macro determinants of health. The authors argue that MD-PhD programs should allow and encourage their scholars to cross boundaries into less traditional disciplines such as epidemiology, statistics, anthropology, sociology, ethics, public policy, management, economics, education, social work, informatics, communications, and marketing. To fulfill current and coming health care needs, nontraditional MD-PhD students should be welcomed and supported as valuable members of our biomedical research workforce.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2015 Feb,United States,2015,10
26373471,Social cognition in schizophrenia.,"Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit impaired social cognition, which manifests as difficulties in identifying emotions, feeing connected to others, inferring people's thoughts and reacting emotionally to others. These social cognitive impairments interfere with social connections and are strong determinants of the degree of impaired daily functioning in such individuals. Here, we review recent findings from the fields of social cognition and social neuroscience and identify the social processes that are impaired in schizophrenia. We also consider empathy as an example of a complex social cognitive function that integrates several social processes and is impaired in schizophrenia. This information may guide interventions to improve social cognition in patients with this disorder.",Nature reviews. Neuroscience,2015 Oct,England,2015,10

24975297,Prolonged weaning: from the intensive care unit to home.,"Weaning is the process of withdrawing mechanical ventilation which starts with the first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Based on the degree of difficulty and duration, weaning is classified as simple, difficult and prolonged. Prolonged weaning, which includes patients who fail 3 SBTs or are still on mechanical ventilation 7 days after the first SBT, affects a relatively small fraction of mechanically ventilated ICU patients but these, however, requires disproportionate resources. There are several potential causes which can lead to prolonged weaning. It is nonetheless important to understand the problem from the point of view of each individual patient in order to adopt appropriate treatment and define precise prognosis. An otherwise stable patient who remains on mechanical ventilation will be considered for transfer to a specialized weaning unit (SWU). Though there is not a precise definition, SWU can be considered as highly specialized and protected environments for patients requiring mechanical ventilation despite resolution of the acute disorder. Proper staffing, well defined short-term and long-term goals, attention to psychological and social problems represent key determinants of SWU success. Some patients cannot be weaned, either partly or entirely, and may require long-term home mechanical ventilation. In these cases the logistics relating to caregivers and the equipment must be carefully considered and addressed.",Revista portuguesa de pneumologia,2014 Sep-Oct,Spain,2014,10
20550653,"Improvements in access to malaria treatment in Tanzania following community, retail sector and health facility interventions -- a user perspective.","BACKGROUND: The ACCESS programme aims at understanding and improving access to prompt and effective malaria treatment. Between 2004 and 2008 the programme implemented a social marketing campaign for improved treatment-seeking. To improve access to treatment in the private retail sector a new class of outlets known as accredited drug dispensing outlets (ADDO) was created in Tanzania in 2006. Tanzania changed its first-line treatment for malaria from sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) in 2007 and subsidized ALu was made available in both health facilities and ADDOs. The effect of these interventions on understanding and treatment of malaria was studied in rural Tanzania. The data also enabled an investigation of the determinants of access to treatment. METHODS: Three treatment-seeking surveys were conducted in 2004, 2006 and 2008 in the rural areas of the Ifakara demographic surveillance system (DSS) and in Ifakara town. Each survey included approximately 150 people who had suffered a fever case in the previous 14 days. RESULTS: Treatment-seeking and awareness of malaria was already high at baseline, but various improvements were seen between 2004 and 2008, namely: better understanding causes of malaria (from 62% to 84%); an increase in health facility attendance as first treatment option for patients older than five years (27% to 52%); higher treatment coverage with anti-malarials (86% to 96%) and more timely use of anti-malarials (80% to 93-97% treatments taken within 24 hrs). Unfortunately, the change of treatment policy led to a low availability of ALu in the private sector and, therefore, to a drop in the proportion of patients taking a recommended malaria treatment (85% to 53%). The availability of outlets (health facilities or drug shops) is the most important determinant of whether patients receive prompt and effective treatment, whereas affordability and accessibility contribute to a lesser extent. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated approach aimed at improving understanding and treatment of malaria has led to tangible improvements in terms of people's actions for the treatment of malaria. However, progress was hindered by the low availability of the first-line treatment after the switch to ACT.",Malaria journal,2010 Jun 15,England,2010,10

28446253,Promoting medication adherence among patients with bipolar disorder: a multicenter randomized controlled trial of a multifaceted intervention.,"BACKGROUND: The present research aimed to investigate the efficacy of a multifaceted intervention that included motivational interviewing (MI) and psychoeducation in improving medication adherence (MA) among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). METHOD: A multicenter, cluster randomized, observer-blind, controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted in ten academic centers in Iran. Patients with BD were randomly assigned to the experimental group (EXP; n = 136) or the usual care group (UC; n = 134). The EXP group received five sessions of MI and psychoeducation together with their family members. The primary outcome measure was changes in scores on the Medication Adherence Rating Scale from baseline to 6 months post-intervention. Other outcome measures included serum levels of mood stabilizers, clinical symptoms, quality of life, as well as measures of intention, beliefs about medicine, perceived behavioral control, automaticity, action and coping planning, and adverse reactions. RESULTS: Medication adherence improved over time in both groups, but patients in the EXP group improved more (baseline score: 6.03; score at the sixth month: 9.55) than patients in the UC group (baseline score: 6.17; score at the sixth month: 6.67). In addition, patients in the EXP group showed greater improvement than patients in the UC group in almost all secondary outcomes 6 months following the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Multifaceted interventions that include motivational-interviewing and psychoeducation can significantly improve MA and clinical and functional outcomes in patients with BD.

27429629,Policy makers' viewpoints on implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in Iran: A qualitative investigation of program facilitators.,"BACKGROUND: The epidemic of smoking is a great concern of health systems. Moreover, the number of smokers is increasing worldwide and this has led to an escalating trend of morbidity, mortality, and burden of smoking-related diseases. Therefore, monitoring the implementation of tobacco control laws in different countries is of extreme importance. This study aimed to describe policy makers' experiences and perceptions of the facilitating factors of the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in Iran. METHODS: This was a qualitative research in which data were collected through individual interviews. The participants included policy makers who were members of the national assembly for tobacco control. In this study, 13 unstructured interviews of about 45 to 60 minutes duration were conducted in an extrapolative manner. The qualitative content analysis method was applied until extrapolation of basic themes was complete. RESULTS: As a result of the analysis, the themes of performance through training, through research, through intersectoral collaboration, and through setting priorities emerged. The emerged themes connote some critical points that have key roles in promoting the effective implementation of the WHO FCTC. Furthermore, the main role of the health sector becomes predominant. CONCLUSION: The study findings suggested the managed and coordinated work as one of the main facilitating factors of the implementation of the WHO FCTC at a national level.",ARYA atherosclerosis,2016 Mar,Iran,2016,10
21041009,"What does ""occupation"" represent as an indicator of socioeconomic status?: exploring occupational prestige and health.","The association between socioeconomic status (SES) and health has been widely documented. However, the role of occupation in this association is not clear because occupation is less often used than income and education as an indicator of SES, especially in the United States. This may be caused by the ambiguity in what occupation represents: both health-enhancing resources (e.g., self-affirmation) and health-damaging hazards (e.g., job stress). SES has two aspects: resources and status. While income and education represent resources and imply status, occupational prestige is an explicit indicator of the social status afforded by one's occupation. Using data from the US General Social Survey in 2002 and 2006 (n = 3151), we examine whether occupational prestige has a significant association with self-rated health independent from other SES indicators (income, education), occupational categories (e.g., managerial, professional, technical, service), and previously established work-related health determinants (job strain, work place social support, job satisfaction). After all covariates were included in the multiple logistic regression model, higher occupational prestige was associated with lower odds of reporting poor/fair self-rated health. We discuss potential mechanisms through which occupational prestige may impact health. Our findings not only suggest multiple ways that occupation is associated with health, but also highlight the utility of occupational prestige as an SES indicator that explicitly represents social standing.",Social science & medicine (1982),2010 Dec,England,2010,10
31730473,"Randomized controlled trial protocol to evaluate the effect of an educational intervention using information, motivation and behavioral skills model on sexual satisfaction of new couples in Iran.","BACKGROUND: Sexual satisfaction is considered as one of the key factors in assessing a person's quality of life and the quality and continuity of marital relationships. According to the results of reports in Iran, many couples are dissatisfied with their sexual lives. Sexuality education is one of the important strategies to prevent early sexual problems and improve sexual satisfaction. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of sexual and marital enrichment package using information, motivation and behavioral skills model on sexual satisfaction of new couples in Iran to routine sexual care program that provided at governmental health centers. METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, superiority trial with two parallel groups. One hundred new couples (n = 200) will be recruited and randomized with simple randomization method and a 1:1 allocation. Recruitment will be from governmental health centers and calling on social networks. Couples will be randomized to intervention which will receive Sexual and Marital Enrichment package and control group (routine care at health centers). Couples will be followed up for 4 months. Then primary outcomes (mean score of couples' sexual information, motivation and behavior skills) and secondary outcome (mean score of couples' sexual satisfaction) of study will be measured through the online questionnaire. DISCUSSION: This trial will be examined the impact of the sexual and marital skills training package tailored to the values and norms governing the sexual life of Iranian couples on their sexual satisfaction. If the trial is effective, its results will be presented to policy makers for implementation at national level.

19878973,Fatigue is a frequent and clinically relevant problem in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.,"OBJECTIVES: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Fatigue and musculoskeletal pain are associated features but have never been studied systematically. We used a multidimensional assessment method to measure fatigue, its clinical relevance, and possible determinants. METHODS: A questionnaire study was performed among 273 EDS patients. The following dimensions were assessed: fatigue severity, functional impairment in daily life, physical activity, psychological distress, sleep disturbances, concentration problems, social functioning, self-efficacy concerning fatigue, causal attribution of fatigue, pain, and disease-related factors. RESULTS: More than three-quarters of EDS patients suffer from severe fatigue. Patients who are severely fatigued are more impaired than nonseverely fatigued patients and report a higher level of psychological distress. The 5 possible determinants involved in fatigue are sleep disturbances, concentration problems, social functioning, self-efficacy concerning fatigue, and pain severity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of fatigue and its possible determinants in EDS and shows that fatigue is a frequent and clinically significant problem in EDS. The 5 possible determinants of fatigue could form a starting point for the development of an effective cognitive behavioral intervention for fatigue in EDS.",Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,2010 Dec,United States,2010,10

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of serum hs-CRP level with shift work among reproductive age women. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2017 to May 2018 in three cities in Mazandaran Province, North of Iran. Through purposive sampling, 350 women (172 shift workers and 178 day workers) were recruited. The guideline recommended by the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was used to interpret the result of hs-CRP measurement as the following: less than 1 microg/ml: low CVD risk; 1-3 microg/ml: moderate CVD risk; and more than 3 microg/ml: high CVD risk. The data were analyzed using the independent-sample t and the chi-square tests as well as the logistic regression analysis. Results: 11.1% of participants had a serum hs-CRP level of more than 3 microg/ml. This rate among shift workers was significantly greater than day workers (15.6% vs. 7.0%; p=0.012). After adjusting the effects of potential confounders shift work significantly increased the odds of serum hs-CRP level of more than 3 microg/ml by 2.45 times (OR=2.45, 95% CI: 1.01-5.93, p=0.047). Conclusion: Shift work is a significant predictor of high serum hs-CRP level probably due to its association with sleep problems and occupational stress. Improving the knowledge of female shift workers about the importance of quality sleep can reduce their CVD risk and improve their health.",Caspian journal of internal medicine,2019 Fall,Iran,2019,10
27743440,Migrants' Health in Iran from the Perspective of Social Justice: a Systematic Literature Review.,"This paper presents a systematic literature review of studies that shed light on the health of migrants in Iran from the perspective of social justice. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and Iranian databases, including IranMedex, Magiran, and SID, in June 2012. All studies that were published until June 2012 describing the health status of migrants - including refugees - in Iran were included. The search results were categorisoyed according to an adapted version of the six dimensions of well-being in Madison Powers' and Ruth Faden's theory of social justice in health. They consisted of access to health care, health, respect, self-determination and attachment, personal security, and social determinants of health. The majority of papers mentioned issues related to infectious diseases (100 papers, 60.2%). Only a few papers mentioned socioeconomic status and access to health services, education, and work. Infectious diseases and high population growth among migrants and the problematic image of migrants as ""threat"" to the Iranian population's health appear to be the most prominent results in our search. It is imperative to combat the high numbers of infectious diseases among migrants in Iran while simultaneously making efforts to change the public image of migrants as a health and social service threat to Iran. Data concerning social and ethical issues of migrants' health in Iran is scarce, and thus, future research is necessary using other methods and sources.",Archives of Iranian medicine,2016 Oct,Iran,2016,10
27814318,Why the long hours? Job demands and social exchange dynamics.,"BACKGROUND: This study investigates the determinants of long working hours from the perspectives of the demand-control model [Karasek, 1979] and social exchange theory [Blau, 1964; Goulder, 1960]. OBJECTIVE: These two theoretical perspectives are tested to understand why individuals work longer (or shorter) hours. METHODS: The hypotheses are tested with a representative sample of 1,604 employed Canadians. RESULTS: In line with Karasek's model, the results support that high job demands are positively associated with longer work hours. The social exchange perspective would predict a positive association between skill discretion and work hours. This hypothesis was supported for individuals with a higher education degree. Finally, the results support a positive association between active jobs and longer work hours. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that job demands and social exchange dynamics need to be considered together in the explanation of longer (or shorter) work hours.","Work (Reading, Mass.)",2016 Nov 22,Netherlands,2016,10
30922283,"What determines violence among female sex workers in an intimate partner relationship? Findings from North Karnataka, south India.","BACKGROUND: Like other women in India, female sex workers (FSWs) frequently experience violence from their intimate partners (IPs)-a reality that increases their risk of acquiring HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. Less is known about the nature of these intimate relationships or what aspect of the relationship increases the risk of IP violence (IPV). We measured the prevalence and determinants of IPV on FSWs in the context of north Karnataka, India, characterized by high HIV-prevalence and extreme poverty. METHODS: Overall 620 FSWs with an IP participated in a baseline survey conducted for an on-going cluster-randomised controlled trial aiming to evaluate the impact of a multi-level intervention on IPV reduction. We characterize the nature of intimate relationships and explored determinants of severe physical and/or sexual IP violence using univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 35 years with 10 years of duration in an intimate relationship. Though most relationships originated from a sex work encounter, 84% stated that IPs did not know they were currently practicing sex work. In past 6 months, the experience of emotional violence was 49% (95%CI:45.2-53.2), physical 33% (95%CI:29.5-37.1) and sexual violence 7% (95%CI:4.8-8.9), while 24% (95%CI:21.0-27.9) FSWs experienced recent severe physical and/or sexual violence from IPs. Factors associated with recent IPV included experience of physical and/or sexual violence from their clients in last 6 months (AOR 2.20; 95%CI: 1.29-3.75), sexual intercourse in the past 1 month when their IP was under the influence of alcohol (AOR 2.30; 95%CI: 1.47-3.59) and providing financial support to their IP (AOR 2.07; 95%CI: 1.28-3.34). CONCLUSIONS: The association between increased risk of violence and provision of financial support to an IP is indicative of gendered power dynamics as men remain dominant irrespective of their financial dependency on FSWs. Interventions are needed that address inequitable gender norms which makes FSWs tolerate violence even though she is not financially dependent on IP. Higher likelihood of violence in presence of alcohol use and FSWs' previous experience of workplace violence linked to IPV call for strengthening the crisis management systems within community-based organisations that can address all forms of violence and associated risk factors.

24099580,The role of social engagement and identity in community mobility among older adults aging in place.,"UNLABELLED: The purpose of this study was to understand how neighbourhoods - as physical and social environments - influence community mobility. Seeking an insider's perspective, the study employed an ethnographic research design. Immersed within the daily lives of 6 older adults over an 8-month period, auditory, textual, and visual data was collected using the ""go-along"" interview method. During these interviews, the researcher accompanied participants on their natural outings while actively exploring their physical and social practices by asking questions, listening, and observing. Findings highlight a process of community mobility that is complex, dynamic and often difficult as participant's ability and willingness to journey into their neighborhoods were challenged by a myriad of individual and environmental factors that changed from one day to the next. Concerned in particular with the social environment, final analysis reveals how key social factors - social engagement and identity - play a critical role in the community mobility of older adults aging in place. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Identity and social engagement are important social factors that play a role in community mobility. The need for social engagement and the preservation of identity are such strong motivators for community mobility that they can ""trump"" poor health, pain, functional ability and hazardous conditions. To effectively promote community mobility, the social lives and needs of individuals must be addressed.",Disability and rehabilitation,2014,England,2014,10
27568727,Mental health services in the Dominican Republic from the perspective of health care providers.,"This study examines mental health services in five different regions of the Dominican Republic (DR) from the perspectives of health care providers. The purpose of this research was to (1) examine existing mental health care services; (2) identify barriers to treatment and mental health services delivery; and (3) explore potential strategies to improve mental health services delivery. Thirty-seven health care workers including physicians, nurses, psychologists, governmental administrators, and non-governmental community health workers were part of five focus groups and subsequent follow-up interviews. Transcripts were coded and analysed to obtain the most parsimonious categories of themes. Results indicated that there is insufficient funding allocated to mental health. The unreliable distribution of psychiatric medications precludes care for patients with severe chronic mental illness. Stigmatising attitudes among health care providers influences the quality of care. The prevalence of domestic violence is a significant public health problem contributing to mental illness. In conclusion, our study findings call for a re-examination of priority public health foci, with special attention to mental health and domestic violence in the DR. From a policy perspective, mental health care should be integrated into primary care and coupled with provider and patient education to reduce stigma. A social determinants approach could ameliorate systemic factors contributing to mental illness.",Global public health,2018 Jul,England,2018,10
21805483,Psychosocial determinants and family background in anorexia nervosa--results from the Stockholm Birth Cohort Study.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the associations between psychosocial factors and family background and incidence of anorexia nervosa (AN) in a Swedish cohort. METHOD: The Stockholm Birth Cohort, SBC (N = 14,294) contains information on social background and general health in males and females, born in Stockholm 1953. Hospitalizations for AN, based on diagnoses from the ICD-8 through ICD-10, were recorded from 1969 to 2002. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to measure the association between psychosocial characteristics and family background and the risk of AN. RESULTS: Higher maternal education was associated with a higher risk for hospitalization for AN. An increased risk for AN was also found among females who stated that they ""often compare their future prospects with others."" DISCUSSION: Although the study is based on a low number of cases, it confirms earlier findings of higher maternal education among individuals with eating disorders in similar cohorts.",The International journal of eating disorders,2012 Apr,United States,2012,10
20933194,Decline in the United States black preterm/low birth weight rate in the 1990s: can the economic boom explain it?,"PURPOSE: Macroeconomic improvements have been posited as an explanation of the decline in the Black preterm birth rate during the 1990s. This study assessed whether decreasing unemployment explained the decline in preterm, low birth weight births (PT-LBW) for Black women. METHODS: United States singleton births to non-Hispanic Black women ages 18 and over, conceived between 1990 and 2001, were pooled to examine PT-LBW trends by level of social advantage (approximated by education and marital status). The impact of the state-level unemployment rate in the first and second trimester of pregnancy was evaluated in multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: During the 1990s, PT-LBW declined 11% among disadvantaged (unmarried, less than high school educated) Black women. Although the unemployment rate and PT-LBW were positively related, decreases in unemployment did not explain the decline in PT-LBW. Instead, improvements in prenatal care utilization and smoking behavior largely accounted for the temporal trend. CONCLUSIONS: Macroeconomic improvements, measured by unemployment, only marginally contributed to the Black PT-LBW trend in the 1990s. To effect further reductions, future studies should investigate other possible determinants of the proximate behavioral changes that did explain the trend (e.g., Earned Income Tax Credit expansions, increased, cigarette taxes/smoking legislation).",Annals of epidemiology,2010 Nov,United States,2010,10
23736365,Food environment and socioeconomic status influence obesity rates in Seattle and in Paris.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the associations between food environment at the individual level, socioeconomic status (SES) and obesity rates in two cities: Seattle and Paris. METHODS: Analyses of the SOS (Seattle Obesity Study) were based on a representative sample of 1340 adults in metropolitan Seattle and King County. The RECORD (Residential Environment and Coronary Heart Disease) cohort analyses were based on 7131 adults in central Paris and suburbs. Data on sociodemographics, health and weight were obtained from a telephone survey (SOS) and from in-person interviews (RECORD). Both studies collected data on and geocoded home addresses and food shopping locations. Both studies calculated GIS (Geographic Information System) network distances between home and the supermarket that study respondents listed as their primary food source. Supermarkets were further stratified into three categories by price. Modified Poisson regression models were used to test the associations among food environment variables, SES and obesity. RESULTS: Physical distance to supermarkets was unrelated to obesity risk. By contrast, lower education and incomes, lower surrounding property values and shopping at lower-cost stores were consistently associated with higher obesity risk. CONCLUSION: Lower SES was linked to higher obesity risk in both Paris and Seattle, despite differences in urban form, the food environments and in the respective systems of health care. Cross-country comparisons can provide new insights into the social determinants of weight and health.",International journal of obesity (2005),2014 Feb,England,2014,10
23026889,From perception to functional outcome in schizophrenia: modeling the role of ability and motivation.,"CONTEXT Schizophrenia remains a highly disabling disorder, but the specific determinants and pathways that lead to functional impairment are not well understood. It is not known whether these key determinants of outcome lie on 1 or multiple pathways. OBJECTIVE To evaluate theoretically based models of pathways to functional outcome starting with early visual perception. The intervening variables were previously established determinants of outcome drawn from 2 general categories: ability (ie, social cognition and functional capacity) and beliefs/motivation (ie, defeatist beliefs, expressive and experiential negative symptoms). We evaluated an integrative model in which these intervening variables formed a single pathway to poor outcome. DESIGN This was a cross-sectional study that applied structural equation modeling to evaluate the relationships among determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia. SETTING Assessments were conducted at a Veterans Administration Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS One hundred ninety-one clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were recruited from the community. RESULTS A measurement model showed that the latent variables of perception, social cognition, and functional outcome were well reflected by their indicators. An initial untrimmed structural model with functional capacity, defeatist beliefs, and expressive and experiential negative symptoms had good model fit. A final trimmed model was a single path running from perception to ability to motivational variables to outcome. It was more parsimonious and had better fit indices than the untrimmed model. Further, it could not be improved by adding or dropping connections that would change the single path to multiple paths. The indirect effect from perception to outcome was significant. CONCLUSIONS The final structural model was a single pathway running from perception to ability to beliefs/motivation to outcome. Hence, both ability and motivation appear to be needed for community functioning and can be modeled effectively on the same pathway.",Archives of general psychiatry,2012 Dec,United States,2012,10
31523209,Community-Engaged Lifestyle Medicine as a Framework for Health Equity: Principles for Lifestyle Medicine in Low-Resource Settings.,"Lifestyle risk factors, including tobacco and alcohol use, poor nutrition, and inactivity, comprise the leading actual causes of death and disproportionately affect diverse, lower-income and vulnerable populations. Fundamentally influenced by social determinants of health (including poverty, social linkages, food access, and built environment), these ""unhealthy lifestyle"" exposures perpetuate and sustain disparities in health outcomes, stealing years of healthy and productive life for minority, vulnerable groups. The authors call for implementation of a health equity framework within lifestyle medicine (LM). Community-engaged lifestyle medicine (CELM) is an evidence-based, participatory framework capable of addressing health disparities through LM, targeting health equity in addition to better health. CELM was developed in 2015 by the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) Preventive Medicine Residency program to address lifestyle-related health disparities within marginalized border communities. The framework includes the following evidence-based principles: community engagement, cultural competency, and application of multilevel and intersectoral approaches. The rationale for each of these components and the growth of CELM within the American College of Lifestyle Medicine is described. Finally, illustrative examples are provided for how CELM can be instituted at micro and macro levels by LM practitioners.",American journal of lifestyle medicine,2019 Sep-Oct,United States,2019,10
24524962,Poverty and mental health in Indonesia.,"Community and facility studies in developing countries have generally demonstrated an inverse relationship between poverty and mental health. However, recent population-based studies contradict this. In India and Indonesia the poor and non-poor show no difference in mental health. We revisit the relationship between poverty and mental health using a validated measure of depressive symptoms (CES-D) and a new national sample from Indonesia - a country where widespread poverty and deep inequality meet with a neglected mental health service sector. Results from three-level overdispersed Poisson models show that a 1% decrease in per capita household expenditure was associated with a 0.05% increase in CES-D score (depressive symptoms), while using a different indicator (living on less than $2 a day) it was estimated that the poor had a 5% higher CES-D score than the better off. Individual social capital and religiosity were found to be positively associated with mental health while adverse events were negatively associated. These findings provide support for the established view regarding the deleterious association between poverty and mental health in developed and developing countries.",Social science & medicine (1982),2014 Apr,England,2014,10
30921393,More miles on the clock: Neighbourhood stressors are associated with telomere length in a longitudinal study.,"BACKGROUND: There is a substantial gap in health and longevity between more affluent and more deprived areas, and more knowledge of the determinants of this health divide is required. Experience of the local residential environment is important for health although few studies have examined this in relation to biological markers of age such as telomere length. We sought to examine if residents' perceptions of neighbourhood stressors over time were associated with telomere length in a community study. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a prospective cohort study of 2186 adults in the West of Scotland, we measured neighbourhood stressors at three time points over a 12-year period and telomere length at the end of the study. Using linear regression models, we found that a higher accumulation of neighbourhood stressors over time was associated with shorter telomere length, even after taking cohort, social class, health behaviours (smoking status, diet, physical activity), BMI and depression into account among females only (Beta = 0.007; 95%CI [0.001, 0.012]; P<0.014). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Neighborhood environments are potentially modifiable, and future efforts directed towards improving deleterious local environments may be useful to lessen telomere attrition.",PloS one,2019,United States,2019,10
30970576,No Man is an Island: The Impact of Neighborhood Disadvantage on Mortality.,"This study's purpose is to determine if neighborhood disadvantage, air quality, economic distress, and violent crime are associated with mortality among term life insurance policyholders, after adjusting for individual demographics, health, and socioeconomic characteristics. We used a sample of approximately 38,000 term life policyholders, from a large national life insurance company, who purchased a policy from 2002 to 2010. We linked this data to area-level data on neighborhood disadvantage, economic distress, violent crime, and air pollution. The hazard of dying for policyholders increased by 9.8% (CI: 6.0-13.7%) as neighborhood disadvantage increased by one standard deviation. Area-level poverty and mortgage delinquency were important predictors of mortality, even after controlling for individual personal income and occupational status. County level pollution and violent crime rates were positively, but not statistically significantly, associated with the hazard of dying. Our study provides evidence that neighborhood disadvantage and economic stress impact individual mortality independently from individual socioeconomic characteristics. Future studies should investigate pathways by which these area-level factors influence mortality. Public policies that reduce poverty rates and address economic distress can benefit everyone's health.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 Apr 9,Switzerland,2019,10
24447371,"Social determinants of maternal self-rated health in South Western Sydney, Australia.","BACKGROUND: From 2000 a routine survey of mothers with newborn infants was commenced in South Western Sydney. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship of maternal self-rated health, as a measure of well-being, to various socio-demographic factors including measures of social capital, country of birth, financial status and employment. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 23,534 mothers who delivered in South Western Sydney between 2004 and 2006. The data were collected as part of a routine post-partum assessment at 2-4 weeks postpartum. We examined the relationship of self-rated health with socio-demographic variables using binary logistic regression. Worse self-rated health was reported in 4% of women. Variables which were found to be significantly associated with worse self-rated health were: poor financial situation, public housing accommodation, fathers employment, no car access, unplanned pregnancy, maternal smoking, poor emotional and social support, and motherhood being more difficult than expected. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the importance of social disadvantage and social isolation as independent risk factors for poor self-reported health. The findings reported here provide further justification for public health interventions which increase support for socially excluded mothers and strengthen their connection to their community.",BMC research notes,2014 Jan 21,England,2014,10
30928112,Immigration as a social determinant of troubled sleep in Canada: some evidence from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health.,"BACKGROUND: The literature pays very little attention to immigrants' sleep in Canada, although sleep is essential to individual health and well-being. ANALYSIS: Drawing data from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health, we aim to address this void by comparing troubled sleep among recent immigrants, established immigrants, and the native-born Canadians. RESULTS: Despite immigrants' declining health over time in Canada, our findings reveal that both recent and established immigrants report fewer cases of troubled sleep than their native-born counterparts. Recent (odds ratio [OR]=0.70, 95% confidence intervals [CIs]=0.62-0.79) and established immigrants (OR=0.86, 95% CIs=0.79-0.92) were less likely to report troubled sleep than the native-born at the bivariate level, although its significant impact for recent immigrants was completely attenuated when health status was controlled for (OR=0.88, 95% CIs=0.76-1.02). Established immigrants were still less likely to report fewer cases of troubled sleep than the native-born even after controlling for all control variables (OR=0.88, 95% CIs=0.81-0.96). CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we discuss that fewer troubled sleep cases reported by immigrants may be explained by their initial health advantage, resilience trajectory, and cultural interpretation of sleep. We also provide several suggestions for future research.",Sleep health,2019 Apr,United States,2019,10
31165665,Social Determinants of Racial Disparities in Cognitive Functioning in Later Life in Canada.,"OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were (a) to assess the nature and extent of racial disparities in cognitive functioning among older adults in Canada, and (b) to assess the role of socioeconomic factors and patterned health behaviors as social determinants of racial disparities in cognitive functioning. METHOD: Data were drawn from the 2009-2010 Canadian Community Health Survey. The study sample included 20,646 people aged 60 years or older. Ordered logistic regression analyses were carried out to test hypotheses linking race, socioeconomic factors, and patterned health behaviors, and cognitive functioning. RESULTS: Our findings revealed a racial gap in cognitive functioning among older adults in Canada. This gap was, in part, mediated by socioeconomic inequalities (in income and food security) and socially patterned behaviors (i.e., drinking, physical activity levels). However, socioeconomic status (SES) and behavioral factors appeared to operate independently of one another. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest a need to focus on the direct effects of race as well as its indirect effects, through socioeconomic factors and patterned health behaviors, for an understanding of racial disparities in cognitive functioning.",Journal of aging and health,2019 Jun 5,United States,2019,10
24985779,Decrease in sexual risk behaviours after early initiation of antiretroviral therapy: a 24-month prospective study in Cote d'Ivoire.,"INTRODUCTION: Whether early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation could impact sexual risk behaviours remains to be documented. We aimed to investigate changes in sexual behaviours within the 24 months following an early versus standard ART initiation in HIV-positive adults with high CD4 counts. METHODS: We used data from a prospective behavioural study nested in a randomized controlled trial of early ART (Temprano-ANRS12136). Time trends in sexual behaviours from enrolment in the trial (M0) to 12-month (M12) and 24-month (M24) visits were measured and compared, using Generalized Estimating Equations models, between participants randomly assigned either to initiate ART immediately (early ART) or to defer ART initiation until on-going WHO starting criteria are met (standard ART). Indicators of sexual behaviours included 1) sexual activity in the past year, 2) multiple partnership in the past year, 3) unprotected sex at last intercourse and 4) risky sex (i.e. unprotected sex with a partner of HIV negative/unknown status) at last intercourse. RESULTS: Analyses included 1952 participants (975 with early ART and 977 with standard ART; overall median baseline CD4 count: 469/mm(3)). Among participants with early ART, significant decreases were found between M0 and M24 in sexual activity (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.72, 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI] 0.57-0.92), multiple partnership (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41-0.79), unprotected sex (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.75) and risky sex (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.76). Among participants with standard ART, sexual behaviours showed similar trends over time. These decreases mostly occurred within the 12 months following enrolment in the trial in both groups and prior to ART initiation in participants with standard ART. For unprotected sex and risky sex, decreases were or tended to be more pronounced among patients reporting that their last sexual partner was non-cohabiting. CONCLUSIONS: In these sub-Saharan adults with high CD4 counts, entry into HIV care, rather than ART initiation, resulted in decreased sexual activity and risky sexual behaviours. We did not observe any evidence of a risk compensation phenomenon associated with early ART initiation. These results illustrate the potential behavioural preventive effect of early entry into care, which goes hand in hand with early ART initiation.",Journal of the International AIDS Society,2014,Switzerland,2014,10
23961487,Effect of low glycemic load diet with and without wheat bran on glucose control in gestational diabetes mellitus: A randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: A low-glycemic index diet is effective in blood glucose control of diabetic subjects, reduces insulin requirement in women with gestation diabetes mellitus (GDM) and improves pregnancy outcomes when used from beginning of the second trimester. However there are limited reports to examine the effect of low glycemic load (LGL) diet and fiber on blood glucose control and insulin requirement of women with GDM. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of low glycemic load diet with and without fiber on reducing the number of women with GDM requiring insulin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All GDM women (n = 31) were randomly allocated to consume either a LGL diet with Fiber or LGL diet. RESULTS: We found that 7 (38.9%) of 18 women with GDM in Fiber group and 10 (76.9%) in ""Without Fiber"" group required insulin treatment. CONCLUSION: The LGL diet with added fiber for women with GDM dramatically reduced the number needing for insulin treatment.",Indian journal of endocrinology and metabolism,2013 Jul,India,2013,10
22978078,Meeting the training needs of those who meet the needs of victims: assessing service providers.,"Despite growing awareness of crime victims' needs for support and services, few studies have examined the training needs of those who provide such services. This research presents the results of statewide needs assessment of victims services providers (VSPs) conducted in preparation for designing a state victim assistance training academy. Respondents were asked to indicate their needs for training on various topics pertaining to victims services. Results indicate that extent of formal education and years of experience in the field are the primary determinants of reported needs for training. Respondents with less formal education and less experience in the field, regardless of the nature of their organizational position (client services vs. management), report greater needs for training. Implications for designing training programs for VSPs are discussed.",Violence and victims,2012,United States,2012,10
29658438,A Systematic Review of First Trimester Biochemical and Molecular Predictive Tests for Preeclampsia.,"BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder affecting 5%-8% of pregnant women. Considering the ongoing debate over the predicting value of some commercial first trimester tests, the aim of this study was to compare the existing first-trimester screening tests for preeclampsia. METHODS: In this systematic review, relevant articles published during 2000-2017 were extracted from PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, and ProQuest databases. After a thorough evaluation of the 412 potentially eligible papers, only 28 papers were selected based on the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: From a total of 412 retrieved studies, 28 papers were found eligible. Most studies had casecontrol or nested case-control designs. A total of 15164 pregnant women were evaluated in the reviewed studies. Various tests were applied in the first trimester of pregnancy to predict the development of preeclampsia. The most commonly used biomarkers were uterine artery pulsatility index, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), adiponectin, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone and inhibin-A. Other tests were used in only one or two studies. CONCLUSION: Based on this review, a combination of markers should be evaluated for the identification of high-risk women. Novel methods measuring multiple markers will hopefully facilitate the development of clinically effective screening programs in the future.",Current hypertension reviews,2018,United Arab Emirates,2018,10
29408192,"Sociodemographic and lifestyle determinants of non-attendance for cervical cancer screening in Lithuania, 2006-2014.","OBJECTIVES: In 2004, Lithuania started the Nationwide Cervical Cancer Screening Programme. The aim of the study was to estimate the trend in the uptake of cervical cancer (CC) screening in Lithuania during 2006-2014 and to identify sociodemographic and lifestyle factors associated with non-attendance for screening. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional studies. METHODS: The data of 4248 women aged 25-60 years who participated in population-based cross-sectional surveys of Lithuanian Health Behaviour Monitoring were analysed. The postal surveys of independent random samples were conducted every second year. Participation in screening was determined by asking women whether they have had a Pap smear test within the last 3 years. Associations of non-attendance with sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle factors were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The proportion of women who reported taking a test for CC within 3 years was continuously increasing from 60.0% in 2006 to 74.2% in 2014. The likelihood of not being screened was lower among older as compared to younger women (odds ratio=0.70; 95% confidence interval = 0.61-0.82). Non-attendance was associated with lower education, being single, having rare contacts with a doctor, low physical activity, and obesity. In addition, older women who smoked and consumed alcohol at least once a week were more likely to have never been screened. CONCLUSIONS: Established social and behavioural determinants of non-attendance for CC screening should be used for optimising CC prevention in Lithuania. The implementation of organised screening programme using innovative screening methods might increase attendance and reduce inequalities.",Public health,2018 Mar,Netherlands,2018,10

The aim of this study was to assess the health-related consequences of landmine explosions in Kurdistan Province during the past 4 decades. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in Kurdistan Province of Iran in 2016-2017. The data gathering process was questionnaire based. Survivors, or a member of the deceased's family, were interviewed, and 410 questionnaires were completed. Data analysis was performed by using descriptive or analytical tests in SPSS software V.22. RESULTS: Antipersonnel landmines caused death immediately after the explosion 32.1% of the time, and 67.9% survived with various disabilities, such as blindness, deafness, and limb amputation. Sixty-three percent of the injuries were related to limb amputation, which was the most prevalent injury among survivors. The adjusted regression test revealed a significant relationship between severity of injury and variables such as living in the villages, education, and occupation (P-value < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing the mined areas and intensifying clearance measures are crucial for Kurdistan Province. Providing landmine awareness programs is likely to yield useful results in reducing casualties. Also, landmine survivors should have access to physical and social rehabilitation programs.",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,2019 Aug 19,United States,2019,10

The ""guild mentality"" of the health professions, the existing university/academic health center structure, regulation and accreditation, and misaligned incentives in the health care system all inhibit the development of this movement. In this article, we propose a new model for how the academic health center community might better address the social determinants of health.",Medical teacher,2011,England,2011,10
30269371,Effects of cigarette smoke condensate on proliferation and pluripotency gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells.,"BACKGROUND: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts. They can be used as valuable experimental models to test the effects of drugs, chemicals, and environmental contaminants such as cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) on preimplantation embryo development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CSC on ESCs derived from mice with different genetic backgrounds and maternal ages. METHODS: The study groups consisted of mouse ESCs (mESCs) obtained from three sources: blastocysts developed from fertilized oocytes of two-month-old (2-C57) and six-month-old (6-C57) C57BL/6 inbred mice and those developed from fertilized oocytes of two-month-old (2-NMRI) NMRI outbred mice. The groups of mESCs were exposed to 0.04, 4, and 40 mug/mL CSC. After exposure, we measured cell viability by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction for changes in expressions of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Ahr, Bax, Bcl2, TFAM, and POLG. The cell doubling time (DT) of these populations was also determined. RESULTS: We observed that CSC changed proliferation and DT in the 2-C57 and 6-C57 cells. There was no change in 2-NMRI cells. Exposure to CSC caused changes in the gene expressions and induced apoptosis in all three cell lines. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that CSC has an effect on the viability, DT and gene expression patterns in mouse ESCs and its effects vary based on the genetic background and maternal age of isolated mouse ESCs.",Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 Mar,United States,2019,10
27261490,Behavioral and neuronal determinants of negative reciprocity in the ultimatum game.,"The rejection of unfair offers in the ultimatum game (UG) indicates negative reciprocity. The model of strong reciprocity claims that negative reciprocity reflects prosociality because the rejecting individual is sacrificing resources in order to punish unfair behavior. However, a recent study found that the rejection rate of unfair offers is linked to assertiveness (status defense model). To pursue the question what drives negative reciprocity, the present study investigated individual differences in the rejection of unfair offers along with their behavioral and neuronal determinants. We measured fairness preferences and event-related potentials (ERP) in 200 healthy participants playing a computerized version of the UG with pictures of unfair and fair proposers. Structural equation modeling (SEM) on the behavioral data corroborated both the strong reciprocity and the status defense models of human cooperation: Not only more prosocial but also more assertive individuals were more likely to show negative reciprocity by rejecting unfair offers. Experimental ERP results confirmed the feedback negativity (FN) as a neural signature of fairness processing. Multilevel SEM of brain-behavior relationships revealed that negative reciprocity was significantly associated with individual differences in FN amplitudes in response to proposers. Our results confirm stable individual differences in fairness processing at the behavioral and neuronal level.",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,2016 Oct,England,2016,10
31701083,Social and Structural Determinants of HIV Treatment and Care Among Hispanic Women and Latinas Living with HIV Infection in the United States: A Qualitative Review: 2008-2018.,"Purpose: In 2017, among all women in the United States, Hispanic women and Latinas (Hispanics/Latinas) accounted for 16% of women with HIV. Populations with high HIV disparities, including Hispanics/Latinas, experience treatment and care outcomes that are well below the national goals. The objective of this qualitative review was to identify social and structural barriers to HIV care from the perspective of Hispanics/Latinas. Methods: Our qualitative review was conducted in six stages: (1) searched and reviewed studies with a focus on Hispanics/Latinas with diagnosed HIV in the United States, published between January 2008 and August 2018; (2) removed unpublished reports and dissertations; (3) limited the search to keywords linked to social and structural HIV outcomes; (4) limited our search to studies that included samples of >/=30% Hispanics/Latinos and >/=30% female; (5) extracted and summarized the data; and (6) conducted a contextual review to identify common themes. Results: We identified 1796 articles; 84 titles and abstracts were screened for full-text review; 16 were selected for full review; and 6 articles met our inclusion criteria for final analysis. Barrier themes to HIV care for Hispanics/Latinas included HIV-related stigma from health professionals, legal consequences of seeking HIV services (including fear of deportation), and language barriers while utilizing HIV services and medications. Conclusion: Although the evidence addressing facilitators and barriers to care among HIV-positive women is sparse, interventions, resources, and enhanced training for health professionals to decrease social and structural barriers to HIV services for Hispanics/Latinas are warranted.",Health equity,2019,United States,2019,10
21734434,Genome-based health literacy: a new challenge for public health genomics.,"So far health literacy has not been sufficiently discussed in the context of public health genomics. Primarily, not genomic but rather genome-based health information needs to be addressed taking into account genome-environment interactions and integrating all health determinants including genomics into a systemic and holistic approach. Translating findings from epigenomics and systems biomedicine will help to understand that individual biological pathways or networks are permanently interacting with environmental networks such as social networks. Thus, in the end also health literacy will become personalized. Genome-based health literacy is challenged by the question of which information is relevant for the individual, for what purpose, and at what time during the lifespan. Public health tools and expertise already in place can and should be used to tackle these huge challenges.",Public health genomics,2011,Switzerland,2011,10
29200329,Medical-Legal Partnerships At Veterans Affairs Medical Centers Improved Housing And Psychosocial Outcomes For Vets.,"Medical-legal partnerships-collaborations between legal professionals and health care providers that help patients address civil legal problems that can affect health and well-being-have been implemented at several Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers to serve homeless and low-income veterans with mental illness. We describe the outcomes of veterans who accessed legal services at four partnership sites in Connecticut and New York in the period 2014-16. The partnerships served 950 veterans, who collectively had 1,384 legal issues; on average, the issues took 5.4 hours' worth of legal services to resolve. The most common problems were related to VA benefits, housing, family issues, and consumer issues. Among a subsample of 148 veterans who were followed for one year, we observed significant improvements in housing, income, and mental health. Veterans who received more partnership services showed greater improvements in housing and mental health than those who received fewer services, and those who achieved their predefined legal goals showed greater improvements in housing status and community integration than those who did not. Medical-legal partnerships represent an opportunity to expand cross-sector, community-based partnerships in the VA health care system to address social determinants of mental health.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2017 Dec,United States,2017,10
31046210,Transnational corporations and oral health inequalities; an introduction.,"In an increasingly globalised world, Trans-National Corporations (TNCs) wield considerable social, economic and political influence, both in the international market economy and within individual countries. The practices of TNCs can have positive or adverse effects on population health through production methods and products, shaping social determinants of health, or influencing the regulatory structures governing their activities. TNCs can contribute to health inequities if the health consequences arising from their practices have disproportionate adverse impacts on vulnerable populations or positive benefits for less vulnerable groups. Despite growing recognition of the implications for health, including oral health, arising from TNC practices, little research has sought to systematically assess the oral health and/or oral health equity impacts of TNCs. In the four papers that follow, we contribute to the discourse around oral health-related inequalities through the lens of power, human agency and TNCs. The papers formed the basis of a symposium entitled 'Transnational Corporations and oral health inequalities' at the 97th General Session of the International Association of Dental Research held June 2019 in Vancouver, British Columbia. The authors responded to the 2014 Lancet-University of Oslo Commission on Global Governance for Health call for greater attention to the health effects of TNC practices and the regulatory regimes in which they operate. The papers overview the role of TNCs in oral health inequalities at an international level, with a specific focus on illuminating their far-reaching influence on our everyday lives, from both epidemiological and sociological perspectives, and the multi-faceted positive or adverse effects on oral health this might have. Key TNC examples are provided by way of the sugar and the tobacco industries, with their impact on dental caries, periodontal diseases and head and neck cancers.",Community dental health,2019 May 30,England,2019,10
24643674,Grim up North or Northern grit? Recessions and the English spatial health divide (1991-2010).,"BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that the health effects of recessions are mixed and vary spatially between countries. Using the North-South English health divide as an example, this paper examines whether there are also spatial variations within countries. METHODS: Cross-sectional data on self-reported 'not good health' was obtained from the British Household Panel Survey and the Health Survey for England from 1991 to 2010. Age-adjusted generalized linear models were used to examine the effects of recessions (1990/91 and 2008/09) on self-reported health in the four English NHS Commissioning Regions (North, South, Midlands and London) with stratification by gender. RESULTS: Over the 20-year study period, the North had consistently higher rates of 'not good health' than the South [OR 1.50 (1.46-1.55) outside recessions and OR 1.29 (1.19-1.39) during recessions]. However, during periods of recession, this health divide narrowed slightly with a 2% decrease in the prevalence of 'not good health' in the North [OR 0.91 (0.86, 0.96)]. CONCLUSION: This study is evidence of spatial variations in the health effects of recessions within England and the North-South divide appears to slightly reduce during recessions. Health in the North remains worse than the South.","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2015 Mar,England,2015,10
26322677,Service Delivery and Patient Outcomes in Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program-Funded and -Nonfunded Health Care Facilities in the United States.,"IMPORTANCE: Outpatient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) health care facilities receive funding from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) to provide medical care and essential support services that help patients remain in care and adhere to treatment. Increased access to Medicaid and private insurance for HIV-infected persons may provide coverage for medical care but not all needed support services and may not supplant the need for RWHAP funding. OBJECTIVE: To examine differences between RWHAP-funded and non-RWHAP-funded facilities and in patient outcomes between the 2 systems. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted from June 1, 2009, to May 31, 2012, using data from the 2009 and 2011 cycles of the Medical Monitoring Project, a national probability sample of 8038 HIV-infected adults receiving medical care at 989 outpatient health care facilities providing HIV medical care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Data were used to compare patient characteristics, service needs, and access to services at RWHAP-funded vs non-RWHAP-funded facilities. Differences in prescribed antiretroviral treatment and viral suppression were assessed. Data analysis was performed between February 2012 and June 2015. RESULTS: Overall, 34.4% of facilities received RWHAP funding and 72.8% of patients received care at RWHAP-funded facilities. With results reported as percentage (95% CI), patients attending RWHAP-funded facilities were more likely to be aged 18 to 29 years (8.5% [7.4%-9.5%] vs 5.0% [3.9%-6.2%]), female (29.2% [27.2%-31.2%] vs 20.1% [17.0%-23.1%]), black (47.5% [41.5%-53.5%] vs 25.8% [20.6%-31.0%]) or Hispanic (22.5% [16.4%-28.6%] vs 12.9% [10.6%-15.2%]), have less than a high school education (26.1% [24.0%-28.3%] vs 10.9% [8.7%-13.1%]), income at or below the poverty level (53.6% [50.3%-56.9%] vs 23.9% [19.7%-28.0%]), and lack health care coverage (25.0% [21.9%-28.1%] vs 6.1% [4.1%-8.0%]). The RWHAP-funded facilities were more likely to provide case management (76.1% [69.9%-82.2%] vs 15.4% [10.4%-20.4%]) as well as mental health (64.0% [57.0%-71.0%] vs 18.0% [14.0%-21.9%]), substance abuse (33.6% [27.0%-40.2%] vs 12.0% [8.0%-16.0%]), and other support services; patients attending RWHAP-funded facilities were more likely to receive these services. After adjusting for patient characteristics, the percentage prescribed ART antiretroviral therapy, reported as adjusted prevalence ratio (95% CI), was similar between RWHAP-funded and non-RWHAP-funded facilities (1.01 [0.99-1.03]), but among poor patients, those attending RWHAP-funded facilities were more likely to be virally suppressed (1.09 [1.02-1.16]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A total of 72.8% of HIV-positive patients received care at RWHAP-funded facilities. Many had multiple social determinants of poor health and used services at RWHAP-funded facilities associated with improved outcomes. Without facilities supported by the RWHAP, these patients may have had reduced access to services elsewhere. Poor patients were more likely to achieve viral suppression if they received care at a RWHAP-funded facility.",JAMA internal medicine,2015 Oct,United States,2015,10
19954494,"Egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric environmental concerns: a path analytic investigation of their determinants.","Previous studies have shown that environmental concerns (ECs) can be reduced to a three-factor model - comprising altruistic, biospheric, and egoistic concerns - but there have been few studies examining individual difference predictors of ECs. In this study with 203 individuals from a British community sample, we show that biospheric concern was significantly associated with participants' age, political orientation, Machiavellianism, and the Big Five personality traits of Agreeableness, Emotional Stability, and Conscientiousness. Altruistic concern was significantly associated with sex, age, political orientation, and Machiavellianism, but not the Big Five traits, whereas egoistic concern was not significantly associated with any of these predictors except sex.

21719876,The four dimensions: a model for the social aetiology of psychosis.,"Recently, there has been increasing focus on prevention of mental illness, early intervention and the promotion of mental health. The social determinants of health and public health approaches are considered key. Early intervention has focused on psychotic disorders but prevention has not. This may in part reflect the fact that public health planners do not have a clear model for how social determinants influence the risk of developing a psychotic illness. Drawing on biological, genetic and epidemiologic evidence regarding the relationship between social risk factors and psychosis, this paper outlines a conceptual framework for understanding how individual and ecological factors contribute and interact to modulate the risk of developing psychotic illness. The framework asserts that there are four dimensions: individual factors; ecological factors; the interaction between individual and ecological factors; and time. It may help those considering interventions to understand the multilevel and multifactorial effects of social factors on the aetiology of psychotic illness, to develop targeted strategies for the prevention of psychotic illness and serve as a template for the assessment of initiatives.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,2011 Jul,England,2011,10
24596836,Assessment of trend and seasonality in road accident data: an Iranian case study.,"BACKGROUND: Road traffic accidents and their related deaths have become a major concern, particularly in developing countries. Iran has adopted a series of policies and interventions to control the high number of accidents occurring over the past few years. In this study we used a time series model to understand the trend of accidents, and ascertain the viability of applying ARIMA models on data from Taybad city. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study. We used data from accidents occurring in Taybad between 2007 and 2011. We obtained the data from the Ministry of Health (MOH) and used the time series method with a time lag of one month. After plotting the trend, non-stationary data in mean and variance were removed using Box-Cox transformation and a differencing method respectively. The ACF and PACF plots were used to control the stationary situation. RESULTS: The traffic accidents in our study had an increasing trend over the five years of study. Based on ACF and PACF plots gained after applying Box-Cox transformation and differencing, data did not fit to a time series model. Therefore, neither ARIMA model nor seasonality were observed. CONCLUSION: Traffic accidents in Taybad have an upward trend. In addition, we expected either the AR model, MA model or ARIMA model to have a seasonal trend, yet this was not observed in this analysis. Several reasons may have contributed to this situation, such as uncertainty of the quality of data, weather changes, and behavioural factors that are not taken into account by time series analysis.",International journal of health policy and management,2013 Jun,Iran,2013,10

31162864,Exploring women's health care experiences through an equity lens: Findings from a community clinic serving marginalised women.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore how marginalised women perceive and rate equity-oriented health care at a primary care clinic using items that evaluate patients' experiences of care. BACKGROUND: Despite an increased recognition of the importance of health care that is equity-oriented, and that understands the patient within the context of the broader social determinants of health, inequities in health remain prevalent around the world. DESIGN: Items from the ""EQUIP Primary Health Care"" research programme were used to explore patients' experiences of equity-oriented health care. Women were invited to complete the questionnaire with the explicit aim of gaining their input to improve quality of care at the clinic. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Statement was followed for the study. METHODS: Sixty-seven women who experienced significant health and social inequities, and were seeking care at a women's only nurse practitioner primary health care clinic in Canada, were invited to complete the questionnaire. For quality improvement purposes, correlational analyses were used to explore women's experiences of care. RESULTS: Women's responses showed that Promote Emotional Safety and Trust and Overall Quality of Care were the most highly correlated domains, indicating the importance of the health care team in establishing trusting relationships, particularly for women who experience stigma and negative judgement when seeking care. CONCLUSION: Seeking feedback from patients on their experiences of care using items developed to explicitly tap into equity issues is useful in understanding how patients experience equity-oriented health care. Responses from the women highlight the importance of understanding not only the what of equity-oriented care but also the how. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The results of this study illustrate the importance of establishing trusting relationships, tailoring care, and using a nondiscriminatory approach when working with women who experience negative judgements when seeking care.",Journal of clinical nursing,2019 Oct,England,2019,10
30105898,"The Intersection of Residence, Community Vulnerability, and Premature Mortality.","PURPOSE: Rural communities often experience higher rates of mortality than their urban counterparts, with gaps widening in the foreseeable future. However, the underlying level of socioeconomic vulnerability (area deprivation) among rural communities can vary widely. This study examines rural-urban differences in mortality-related outcomes within comparable levels of deprivation. METHODS: Rural-urban differences in Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL), derived from the County Health Rankings, were examined across comparable levels of area deprivation using a quantile regression approach. Rural-urban differences in YPLL were estimated at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles across levels of deprivation. FINDINGS: Compared to the reference population (urban counties/least deprived) a clear increase in YPLL among both rural and urban counties was noted across levels of deprivation, with the highest level of YPLL occurring in counties with the most deprivation. While YPLL increased across levels of deprivation, the magnitude of these differences was markedly higher in rural counties compared to urban, particularly among the most deprived counties. Rural counties experienced an advantage at the lowest percentiles and levels of deprivation. However, this advantage quickly deteriorated, revealing significant rural disparities at the highest level of deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: This study noted a differential effect in mortality-related outcomes among rural counties within comparable levels of community deprivation. Findings contribute to evidence that many, but not all rural communities face a double disadvantage. This underscores the need for a continued focus on the development and implementation of multiple policies aimed at reducing differences in poverty, education, and access to care.",The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,2019 Sep,England,2019,10
29516879,Patients at high risk of tuberculosis recurrence.,"Recurrent tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a significant problem and is an important indicator of the effectiveness of TB control. Recurrence can occur by relapse or exogenous reinfection. Recurrence of TB is still a major problem in high-burden countries, where there is lack of resources and no special attention is being given to this issue. The rate of recurrence is highly variable and has been estimated to range from 4.9% to 47%. This variability is related to differences in regional epidemiology of recurrence and differences in the definitions used by the TB control programs. In addition to treatment failure from noncompliance, there are several key host factors that are associated with high rates of recurrence. The widely recognized host factors independent of treatment program that predispose to TB recurrence include gender differences, malnutrition; comorbidities such as diabetes, renal failure, and systemic diseases, especially immunosuppressive states such as human immunodeficiency virus; substance abuse; and environmental exposures such as silicosis. With improved understanding of the human genome, proteome, and metabolome, additional host-specific factors that predispose to recurrence are being identified. Information on temporal and geographical trends of TB cases as well as studies with whole-genome sequencing might provide further information to enable us to fully understand TB recurrence and discriminate between reactivation and new infection. The recently launched World Health Organization End TB Strategy emphasizes the importance of integrated, patient-centered TB care. Continued improvement in diagnosis, treatment approaches, and an understanding of host-specific factors are needed to fully understand the clinical epidemiological and social determinants of TB recurrence.",International journal of mycobacteriology,2018 Jan-Mar,Netherlands,2018,10
26762151,Sociocultural determinants of anticipated oral cholera vaccine acceptance in three African settings: a meta-analytic approach.,"BACKGROUND: Controlling cholera remains a significant challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. In areas where access to safe water and sanitation are limited, oral cholera vaccine (OCV) can save lives. Establishment of a global stockpile for OCV reflects increasing priority for use of cholera vaccines in endemic settings. Community acceptance of vaccines, however, is critical and sociocultural features of acceptance require attention for effective implementation. This study identifies and compares sociocultural determinants of anticipated OCV acceptance across populations in Southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Western Kenya and Zanzibar. METHODS: Cross-sectional studies were conducted using similar but locally-adapted semistructured interviews among 1095 respondents in three African settings. Logistic regression models identified sociocultural determinants of OCV acceptance from these studies in endemic areas of Southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (SE-DRC), Western Kenya (W-Kenya) and Zanzibar. Meta-analytic techniques highlighted common and distinctive determinants in the three settings. RESULTS: Anticipated OCV acceptance was high in all settings. More than 93% of community respondents overall indicated interest in a no-cost vaccine. Higher anticipated acceptance was observed in areas with less access to public health facilities. In all settings awareness of cholera prevention methods (safe food consumption and garbage disposal) and relating ingestion to cholera causation were associated with greater acceptance. Higher age, larger households, lack of education, social vulnerability and knowledge of oral rehydration solution for self-treatment were negatively associated with anticipated OCV acceptance. Setting-specific determinants of acceptance included reporting a reliable income (W-Kenya and Zanzibar, not SE-DRC). In SE-DRC, intention to purchase an OCV appeared unrelated to ability to pay. Rural residents were less likely than urban counterparts to accept an OCV in W-Kenya, but more likely in Zanzibar. Prayer as a form of self-treatment was associated with vaccine acceptance in SE-DRC and W-Kenya, but not in Zanzibar. CONCLUSIONS: These cholera-endemic African communities are especially interested in no-cost OCVs. Health education and attention to local social and cultural features of cholera and vaccines would likely increase vaccine coverage. High demand and absence of insurmountable sociocultural barriers to vaccination with OCVs indicate potential for mass vaccination in planning for comprehensive control or elimination.",BMC public health,2016 Jan 14,England,2016,10
30457955,"The ""No Wrong Door"" Approach to HIV Testing: Results From a Statewide Retail Pharmacy-Based HIV Testing Program in Virginia, 2014-2016.","OBJECTIVE: As part of the Care and Prevention in the United States Demonstration Project (2012-2016), which aimed to reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality among racial/ethnic minority groups in 8 states, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) funded Walgreens to provide HIV testing in retail pharmacies in areas with large racial/ethnic minority communities and high rates of poverty. We describe this program and summarize its outcomes. We hypothesized that (1) offering walk-in HIV testing outside of traditional business hours and alongside other point-of-care tests in retail pharmacies would increase rates of first-time testers and (2) using data on social determinants of health associated with higher rates of HIV infection to locate test sites would increase the identification of people who were previously undiagnosed. METHODS: Using 2010 US Census data and 2007-2011 five-year population estimates from the American Community Survey, VDH selected 32 Walgreens stores located in census tracts where at least 30% of the population was black and/or Hispanic/Latino and/or where at least 20% of the population was living at or below the federal poverty level. Pharmacists administered the INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Antibody Test. Clients with a reactive test result were linked to confirmatory testing and medical care. RESULTS: Between June 1, 2014, and September 29, 2016, Walgreens pharmacists performed HIV tests on 3630 clients, of whom 1668 (46.0%) had either never been tested or were unsure if they had been tested. Of all clients tested, 30 (0.8%) had a reactive test result. Of 26 clients who also had positive confirmatory testing, 22 (84.6%) were linked to care. The mean cost per person tested was $41.79, and the mean cost per reactive result was $5057. CONCLUSIONS: Retail pharmacies may be an effective venue for those who have never been tested for HIV to access HIV testing, particularly if the pharmacies are located in priority areas or where community-based organizations are unable to operate.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2018 Nov/Dec,United States,2018,10
29776898,Implementing Internet-Based Self-Care Programs in Primary Care: Qualitative Analysis of Determinants of Practice for Patients and Providers.,"BACKGROUND: Access to evidence-based interventions for common mental health conditions is limited due to geographic distance, scheduling, stigma, and provider availability. Internet-based self-care programs may mitigate these barriers. However, little is known about internet-based self-care program implementation in US health care systems. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify determinants of practice for internet-based self-care program use in primary care by eliciting provider and administrator perspectives on internet-based self-care program implementation. METHODS: The objective was explored through qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews with primary care providers and administrators from the Veterans Health Administration. Participants were identified using a reputation-based snowball design. Interviews focused on identifying determinants of practice for the use of internet-based self-care programs at the point of care in Veterans Health Administration primary care. Qualitative analysis of transcripts was performed using thematic coding. RESULTS: A total of 20 physicians, psychologists, social workers, and nurses participated in interviews. Among this group, internet-based self-care program use was relatively low, but support for the platform was assessed as relatively high. Themes were organized into determinants active at patient and provider levels. Perceived patient-level determinants included literacy, age, internet access, patient expectations, internet-based self-care program fit with patient experiences, interest and motivation, and face-to-face human contact. Perceived provider-level determinants included familiarity with internet-based self-care programs, changes to traditional care delivery, face-to-face human contact, competing demands, and age. CONCLUSIONS: This exploration of perspectives on internet-based self-care program implementation among Veterans Health Administration providers and administrators revealed key determinants of practice, which can be used to develop comprehensive strategies for the implementation of internet-based self-care programs in primary care settings.",JMIR mental health,2018 May 18,Canada,2018,10
31236573,Treatment failure in inflammatory arthritis: time to think about syndemics?,"Social determinants of health play a crucial role in health and disease. In current times, it has become increasingly known that biological and non-biological factors are potentially linked and help to drive disease. For example, links between various comorbidities, both physical and mental illnesses, are known to be driven by social, environmental and economic determinants. This contributes to worse disease outcomes. This article discusses the concept of syndemics, which although well-described in some conditions, represents a novel concept in the context of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. Written in the form of a viewpoint, the article focuses on a novel theoretical framework for studying inflammatory arthritis, based on a syndemic approach that takes into account the social context, biocultural disease interaction, and socio-economic characteristics of the setting. Syndemics involving inflammatory arthritis may be most likely in a social context involving limited access to health care, lack of physical activity and obesogenic diets, high rates of alcohol consumption, and high exposure to stressful life events.","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",2019 Sep 1,England,2019,10
31303157,The evolution of infanticide by females in mammals.,"In most mammalian species, females regularly interact with kin, which is expected to reduce aggressive competitive behaviour among females. It may thus be difficult to understand why infanticide by females has been reported in numerous species and is sometimes perpetrated by groupmates. Here, we investigate the evolutionary determinants of infanticide by females by combining a quantitative analysis of the taxonomic distribution of infanticide with a qualitative synthesis of the circumstances of infanticidal attacks in published reports. Our results show that female infanticide is widespread across mammals and varies in relation to social organization and life history, being more frequent where females breed in groups and have intense bouts of high reproductive output. Specifically, female infanticide occurs where the proximity of conspecific offspring directly threatens the killer's reproductive success by limiting access to critical resources for her dependent progeny, including food, shelters, care or a social position. By contrast, infanticide is not immediately modulated by the degree of kinship among females, and females occasionally sacrifice closely related infants. Our findings suggest that the potential direct fitness rewards of gaining access to reproductive resources have a stronger influence on the expression of female aggression than the indirect fitness costs of competing against kin. This article is part of the theme issue 'The evolution of female-biased kinship in humans and other mammals'.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

24209299,Intersectoral action for health equity: a rapid systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Action on the social determinants of health is considered a necessary approach to improving health equity. Most of the social determinants of health lie outside the sphere of the health sector and thus collaboration with governmental and non-governmental sectors outside of health are required to develop policies and programs to improve health equity. Case studies of intersectoral action are available, however there is limited information about the impact of intersectoral action on the social determinants of health and health equity. METHODS: Search and retrieval of literature published between 2001 and 2011 was conducted in 6 databases. A staged screening of titles and abstracts, and later full-text, was conducted by two independent reviewers. Reviewers independently assessed the quality of the articles deemed relevant for inclusion. Data were extracted and synthesized in narrative format for all included studies, conducted by one reviewer and checked by another. RESULTS: 17 articles of varied methodological quality met the inclusion criteria. One systematic review investigating partnership interventions found mixed and limited impacts on health outcomes. Primary studies evaluating the impact of upstream and midstream interventions showed mixed effects. Downstream interventions were generally moderately effective in increasing the availability and use of services by marginalized communities. CONCLUSIONS: The literature evaluating the impact of intersectoral action on health equity is limited. The included studies identified reveal a moderate to no effect on the social determinants of health. The evidence on the impact of intersectoral action on health equity is even more limited. The lack of evidence should not be interpreted as a lack of effect. Rigorous evaluations of intersectoral action are needed to strengthen the evidence base of this public health practice.",BMC public health,2013 Nov 9,England,2013,10
26463577,Primary healthcare needs and barriers to care among Calgary's homeless populations.,"BACKGROUND: Despite Canada's universal healthcare system, significant barriers impede individuals experiencing homelessness from accessing health services. Furthermore, there is a paucity in the qualitative literature describing how Canadians experiencing homelessness access health care services. Our objective was to qualitatively explore perceived healthcare needs and barriers among individuals experiencing homelessness in one large Canadian city - Calgary, Alberta. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study that included open-ended interviews and focus groups with a variety of stakeholders who are involved in healthcare among Calgary's homeless populations. These included individuals experiencing homelessness (n = 11) as well as employees from several healthcare service providers for those experiencing homelessness (n = 11). Transcripts from these interviews were thematically analyzed by two analysts. RESULTS: Stakeholder interviews yielded several pervasive themes surrounding the health care needs of the homeless and barriers to accessing care. Some of the primary health care needs which were identified included mental health, addictions, and allied health as well as care that addresses the social determinants of health. Notably, it was difficult for many stakeholders to pinpoint specific health care priorities, as they identified that the health care needs among Calgary's homeless populations are diverse and complex, often even describing the needs as overwhelming. Types of barriers to primary care that were identified by stakeholders included: emotional, educational, geographical, financial and structural barriers, as well as discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the diverse primary health care needs of Calgary's homeless populations. Despite the fact that Canada has a universal publicly funded health care system, individuals experiencing homelessness face significant barriers in accessing primary care.",BMC family practice,2015 Oct 13,England,2015,10
30255517,A pedagogy of social justice for resilient/vulnerable populations: Structural competency and bio-power.,"BACKGROUND: Nursing schools frequently assert the importance of social justice curriculum, but little information is available about specifics for such a class. PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe a class that builds a foundation for the understanding of social justice and the pedagogical frameworks on which it rests. METHODS: The authors develop a class grounded in bio-power and structural competency. DISCUSSION: Described are topics presented to students, the rationale for their selection along with class activities and implementation challenges. Highlighted is the use of praxis as students incorporate the components of structural competency and bio-power. The focus is on the potential for public health and advanced practice registered nurses to recognize and evaluate structural factors in patient and population-based care. CONCLUSION: Faculty meet substantive challenges in teaching social justice, including lack of recognition of societal forces which affect student's ability to provide care. Focused effort incorporating newer structural and philosophical frameworks in a social justice class may improve the provision of health services. The frameworks of structural competency and bio-power provide a critical paradigm salient in social justice pedagogy.","Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)",2018 Nov,United States,2018,10

30471547,Education and knowledge determine preference for bark beetle control measures in El Salvador.,"Extensive outbreaks of bark beetles have affected not only large parts of coniferous forests in the Northern Hemisphere, but also - largely absent from global attention - native pine forests of Central America. As such outbreaks frequently spark management debates among residents, land managers, forest owners and the public, the social acceptance of bark beetle control measures has become crucial for modern land management. However, the sociological and psychological determinants of the preference for specific bark beetle control measures outside protected areas remain unclear. To determine the acceptability of bark beetle control measures in El Salvador, we assessed how demographic variables, attitude towards the bark beetle, education, and self-reported knowledge affected the preference for different bark beetle control measures in a survey of government employees and local forest owners using a quantitative questionnaire survey. Cumulative link mixed models revealed that the general preference for control measures increased with increasing self-reported knowledge about the bark beetle but decreased with increasing level of respondent education and an increasing positive attitude towards the bark beetle. Respondents generally preferred beetle control measures on small areas than on large areas. Preferences for control measures did not differ between government employees and forest owners, with controlled burning and chemical control significantly less accepted than stand thinning or salvage logging. We discuss the most preferred control measures considering recent scientific evidence of their efficacy and conclude that the current bark beetle outbreak should be controlled through logging of pines weakened by fire in the short-term and by stand thinning in the medium-term to prevent further outbreaks.",Journal of environmental management,2019 Feb 15,England,2019,10
26526484,[Emerging and reemerging diseases].,"Emerging and reemerging diseases are the result of the interaction of multiple factors, such as social determinants of health, climate change, and conditions that prevail and are identifiable in some populations. As a consequence, there may be situations that by their nature are defined as a health emergency, impacting directly on the health of a population, either because they are not known or due to their rapid spread, resulting in a health security problem. Examples of these diseases are described in this article, starting with their origin, their impact on the population, and the response necessary in order to contain or prevent damage of a greater magnitude. The presence of these agents and their consequent damage to the population should lead efforts towards comprehensive prevention and appropriate containment strategies to ensure the protection of public health. Endeavors should be directed not only to a specific agent, but rather to factors that determine their reemergence, such as Ebola, or their permanence, such as the binomial infection of tuberculosis-AIDS. In order to correctly implement strategies, training and availability of supplies play a crucial role in facing the challenges that lie ahead.",Gaceta medica de Mexico,2015 Sep-Oct,Mexico,2015,10
24399143,"Childbearing across partnerships in Australia, the United States, Norway, and Sweden.","This article compares mothers' experience of having children with more than one partner in two liberal welfare regimes (the United States and Australia) and two social democratic regimes (Sweden and Norway). We use survey-based union and birth histories in Australia and the United States and data from national population registers in Norway and Sweden to estimate the likelihood of experiencing childbearing across partnerships at any point in the childbearing career. We find that births with new partners constitute a substantial proportion of all births in each country we study. Despite quite different arrangements for social welfare, the determinants of childbearing across partnerships are very similar. Women who had their first birth at a very young age or who are less well-educated are most likely to have children with different partners. The educational gradient in childbearing across partnerships is also consistently negative across countries, particularly in contrast to educational gradients in childbearing with the same partner. The risk of childbearing across partnerships increased dramatically in all countries from the 1980s to the 2000s, and educational differences also increased, again, in both liberal and social democratic welfare regimes.",Demography,2014 Apr,United States,2014,10
23201214,Health in South Africa: changes and challenges since 2009.,"Since the 2009 Lancet Health in South Africa Series, important changes have occurred in the country, resulting in an increase in life expectancy to 60 years. Historical injustices together with the disastrous health policies of the previous administration are being transformed. The change in leadership of the Ministry of Health has been key, but new momentum is inhibited by stasis within the health management bureaucracy. Specific policy and programme changes are evident for all four of the so-called colliding epidemics: HIV and tuberculosis; chronic illness and mental health; injury and violence; and maternal, neonatal, and child health. South Africa now has the world's largest programme of antiretroviral therapy, and some advances have been made in implementation of new tuberculosis diagnostics and treatment scale-up and integration. HIV prevention has received increased attention. Child mortality has benefited from progress in addressing HIV. However, more attention to postnatal feeding support is needed. Many risk factors for non-communicable diseases have increased substantially during the past two decades, but an ambitious government policy to address lifestyle risks such as consumption of salt and alcohol provide real potential for change. Although mortality due to injuries seems to be decreasing, high levels of interpersonal violence and accidents persist. An integrated strategic framework for prevention of injury and violence is in progress but its successful implementation will need high-level commitment, support for evidence-led prevention interventions, investment in surveillance systems and research, and improved human-resources and management capacities. A radical system of national health insurance and re-engineering of primary health care will be phased in for 14 years to enable universal, equitable, and affordable health-care coverage. Finally, national consensus has been reached about seven priorities for health research with a commitment to increase the health research budget to 2.0% of national health spending. However, large racial differentials exist in social determinants of health, especially housing and sanitation for the poor and inequity between the sexes, although progress has been made in access to basic education, electricity, piped water, and social protection. Integration of the private and public sectors and of services for HIV, tuberculosis, and non-communicable diseases needs to improve, as do surveillance and information systems. Additionally, successful interventions need to be delivered widely. Transformation of the health system into a national institution that is based on equity and merit and is built on an effective human-resources system could still place South Africa on track to achieve Millennium Development Goals 4, 5, and 6 and would enhance the lives of its citizens.","Lancet (London, England)",2012 Dec 8,England,2012,10
30868415,"""I feel safe just coming here because there are other Native brothers and sisters"": findings from a community-based evaluation of the Niiwin Wendaanimak Four Winds Wellness Program.","BACKGROUND: Urban Indigenous populations in Canada are steadily growing and represent diverse and culturally vibrant communities. Disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples' experiences of the social determinants of health are a growing concern. Under the guidance of the West End Aboriginal Advisory Council (WEAAC), Parkdale Queen West Community Health Centre (PQWCHC) launched the Niiwin Wendaanimak Four Winds Wellness Program that seeks to enhance health and community services for homeless and at-risk Indigenous populations in Toronto. OBJECTIVES: A process evaluation was carried out to (1) assess the collaborative service delivery model; (2) identify service gaps and issues for homeless and at-risk Indigenous populations; and (3) develop recommendations for how non-Indigenous organizations can provide culturally responsive services for Indigenous populations. METHODS: In consultation with the WEAAC, a thematic analysis of qualitative data collected from 2 focus groups with community members who access the Niiwin Wendaanimak program and 17 key informant interviews with staff and peers was conducted. RESULTS: The Niiwin Wendaanimak program bridges teachings of inclusivity and the practice of harm reduction to create a non-judgemental space where community members' dignity and autonomy is respected. Strengths of the program include Indigenous leadership and access to activities that promote wellness and community building. CONCLUSIONS: As a non-Indigenous service provider, PQWCHC is meeting the needs of homeless and at-risk Indigenous populations in Toronto. Program strengths, system gaps, and challenges including policy recommendations were identified.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2019 Aug,Switzerland,2019,10
27855697,"Regional health-care inequity in children's survival in Zhejiang Province, China.","BACKGROUND: China is now under a period of social transition, and inequity is evident in the field of health care. We aimed to investigate regional health-care inequalities in children's survival in Zhejiang Province, China. METHODS: In our study, monitoring data of Zhejiang Province from 2005 to 2014 was collected. The flow of data collection of community-district-city for urban areas or village-township-county rural areas was followed. The factors affecting equity was analyzed including regional economical level and household registry. We adopted standard measures of concentration curve and concentration index to evaluate degree of income-related inequity and the trend of mortality changes. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2014, overall mortality rate in children under five decreased, and regional disparity reduced markedly, and with a reduced disparity of mortality rate among children from urban and rural areas. In 2014, the mortality rate in children from urban and rural areas was similar. In contrast, the mortality rate in the children from migrant population was more than two folds of that in the children from native residency (7.82 per thousand vs. 3.89 per thousand). The mortality rates of newborns (rs = -0.396, P < 0.001), infants (rs = -0.553, P < 0.001) and children under five (rs = -0.568, P < 0.001) were all negatively correlated with per capita GDP in different regions. CI in the newborns, infants and children under 5 years was -0.105, -0.107 and -0.118, respectively. The concentration curve was near to equity curve. The concentration curve was near to equity curve. The mortality rate of children was negatively related with economical level in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The survival status was near to equity. Regional economical development can improve children's survival but it was not the only social determinant. Migrant population will be the future monitor focus for reducing disparity on healthcare and increase equity in children's survival.",International journal for equity in health,2016 Nov 17,England,2016,10
31307408,"Obstetric determinants of preterm delivery in a regional hospital, Accra, Ghana 2016.","BACKGROUND: Globally, prematurity is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality contributing 30-40% of neonatal mortality. The consequences of preterm deliveries are enormous with developmental and childhood complications as well as high economic and psycho-social burden on the parents (family) and society. Some risk factors include ever having preterm delivery, multiple births and some medical conditions like sexually transmitted infection and urinary tract infections but these have not been ascertained in our study area. Much research into these risk factors is needed in Ghana. We assessed the obstetric determinants of preterm delivery. METHODS: We conducted a 1:2 unmatched case-control study in Greater Accra Regional Hospital (GARH) -Ridge, a secondary referral facility in Accra, Ghana (from October, 2015 -May, 2016). A case was a mother who delivered between 28 and 36 weeks of gestation (preterm) and a control was a mother who delivered after 37 to 42 completed weeks (term). We used structured questionnaire to collect data, reviewed maternal and foetal records using a checklist. Categorical variables were analysed and expressed as frequencies and proportions. We determined the association between obstetric factors and preterm delivery with multiple logistic regression. Significance level of the strength of association was determined at 95% CI and p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: We recruited 390 mothers, 130 had preterm deliveries (cases) and 260 had term deliveries (controls). Experiencing premature rupture of membrane (aOR: 2.3; 95% CI:1.0-5.5), pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (aOR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.0-11.9) were found to be associated with preterm delivery. However, four or more ANC visit was protective factor for preterm delivery (aOR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1-0.4). CONCLUSION: Premature rupture of membrane, hypertensive complications and antepartum haemorrhage were found to be risk factors associated with preterm delivery in Ridge Hospital. Health workforce providing ANC services need to identify risk factors and refer these mothers to the doctor for early management and improved outcome decreasing preterm delivery.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,2019 Jul 15,England,2019,10
27657505,A Tool for Assessing a Community's Capacity for Substance Abuse Care.,"Evidence-based programs for prevention and intervention in substance abuse are increasing. Community needs assessments and health rankings provide descriptions of local behavioral health needs but do not provide public health practitioners and policy makers with guidelines on the number of programs, health care practitioners, or interventions needed in the local substance abuse care system. This article presents a new framework for measuring and assessing the substance abuse care system in a community. The assessment can inform resource allocation across the continuum of care to more equitably and efficiently distribute interventions and care. We conducted 2 literature reviews and synthesized our findings to create a community assessment methodology and needs calculator, CAST (calculating for an adequate system tool). We reviewed 212 articles to produce an inventory of community and social correlates of behavioral health, components of a substance abuse care system, and numerical values for guidelines for estimating community needs. CAST produces community-specific assessments of the capacity of the components of a community substance abuse care system. CAST generates recommendations by the application of social and community determinants of health as risk coefficients to each estimate of component need. CAST can assist public health practitioners in evaluation and improvement of the capacity of community-based, substance abuse care systems. By using recommendations for component needs across the continuum of care, community leaders can use CAST to prioritize resource allocation more effectively and efficiently.",Preventing chronic disease,2016 Sep 22,United States,2016,10
27272681,Socio-Behavioral Factors Associated with Overweight and Central Obesity in Tehranian Adults: a Structural Equation Model.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to test a conceptual model of associations between socio-demographic and behavioral factors and obesity in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). METHODS: Data from 2747 TLGS adult participants (58.3 % female) were analyzed. Socio-demographic and behavioral factors in the conceptual model were tested for their direct and indirect associations with overweight and central obesity, using structural equation modeling (SEM), conducted by IBM SPSS AMOS software. RESULTS: Overweight and central obesity were found in 61.6 and 48.1 % of respondents, respectively. Fit indices were acceptable for the conceptual model. Daily energy intake had a direct association with overweight and central obesity in both genders; however, poor dietary pattern had direct associations with overweight and central obesity only in men. In women, age, marital status, and level of education had direct associations with overweight and central obesity. In men, only age and marital status had direct associations with overweight and central obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Age and marital status in both genders and level of education only in women were among the socio-demographic factors which were directly associated with both overweight and central obesity. Among behavioral factors, daily energy intake was the most important factor that was directly associated with both overweight and central obesity in both genders. Adherence to poor diet directly was associated with overweight and central obesity only in men. The current findings provide beneficial information for designing culturally relevant and effective interventions/strategies for prevention of overweight among Tehranian adults.",International journal of behavioral medicine,2017 Feb,England,2017,10
30607452,India's response to adolescent mental health: a policy review and stakeholder analysis.,"PURPOSE: Mental health problems and suicide are the leading cause of mortality in young people globally. India is home to the largest number of adolescents in the world. This study was undertaken to assess the policy environment for addressing adolescent mental health in India. METHODS: We conducted a review of 6 policies and programs and 11 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. The findings were analyzed using the policy triangle analysis framework (i.e., context, content, actors and process). RESULTS: There is no conformity of the age ranges addressed by these documents nor are vulnerable groups explicitly recognized. Stress, anxiety and depression were commonly identified as mental health concerns and diverse platforms such as community, family, school, digital and health facility were recommended to deliver preventive and treatment interventions. Some interventions specifically targeted some social determinants (like safe and supportive schools) but many others (like social norms) were not addressed. Preventive interventions were recommended for delivery through peers and other non-specialist providers while treatment interventions were recommended for delivery in healthcare facilities by specialist health professionals. There was very little engagement of young people in the development of these policies or in their implementation, except for peer educators mentioned in one policy. Stakeholders identified several major challenges in implementing these policies, notably the lack of inter-sectoral coordination and fragmentation of governance; budgetary constraints; and scanty human resources. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are now several policy instruments testifying to a comprehensive approach on adolescent mental health, there are gaps in the extent of engagement of young people and how these will be operationalized that may limit their impact on addressing the burden of mental health problems in young people in India.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2019 Apr,Germany,2019,10
25311783,New evidence of the effects of education on health in the US: compulsory schooling laws revisited.,"Estimating the effects of education on health and mortality has been the subject of intense debate and competing findings and summaries. The original Lleras-Muney (2005) methods utilizing state compulsory schooling laws as instrumental variables for completed education and US data to establish effects of education on mortality have been extended to several countries, with mixed and often null findings. However, additional US studies have lagged behind due to small samples and/or lack of mortality information in many available datasets. This paper uses a large, novel survey from the AARP on several hundred thousand respondents to present new evidence of the effects of education on a variety of health outcomes. Results suggest that education may have a role in improving several dimensions of health, such as self reports, cardiovascular outcomes, and weight outcomes. Other results appear underpowered, suggesting that further use of this methodology may require even larger, and potentially unattainable, sample sizes in the US.",Social science & medicine (1982),2015 Feb,England,2015,10
24846934,Comorbidity and treatment decision-making in elderly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients: a survey among haematologists.,"BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are often not treated with standard immunochemotherapy and this might have a negative impact on their survival. Little is known about the determinants that play a role in treatment decision-making of clinicians regarding elderly patients with NHL. The objective of this study was to gain more insight into these determinants. METHODS: A survey was conducted amongst haematologists in the Netherlands. The survey contained questions about comorbidity, polypharmacy, social setting, nutritional status, depression, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in relation to treatment decisions in elderly NHL patients. RESULTS: Of all comorbidities, respondents designated cognitive disorders and cardiovascular comorbidity as the most important factors when assessing whether an older patient with NHL is eligible for curative treatment. Also in decreasing degree of importance ADL, IADL and depressive disorder are frequently included in treatment decision-making. Almost half of the respondents feel that treatment of the elderly person is complicated as a result of a lack of scientific evidence. CONCLUSION: Haematologists are aware of coexisting problems in elderly patients and they frequently take comorbidities, cognitive disorders and functional status into consideration in treatment decision-making. Future studies are needed to determine the exact role that these factors should play in the treatment of elderly patients. Furthermore, haematologists feel that treatment of the elderly is complicated and there is a lack of scientific evidence, and therefore older adults should be better represented in clinical trials.",The Netherlands journal of medicine,2014 Apr,Netherlands,2014,10
26905463,Maize diversity associated with social origin and environmental variation in Southern Mexico.,"While prevailing theories of crop evolution suggest that crop diversity and cultural diversity should be linked, empirical evidence for such a link remains inconclusive. In particular, few studies have investigated such patterns on a local scale. Here, we address this issue by examining the determinants of maize diversity in a local region of high cultural and biological richness in Southern Mexico. We collected maize samples from villages at low and middle elevations in two adjacent municipalities of differing ethnicity: Mixtec or Chatino. Although morphological traits show few patterns of population structure, we see clear genetic differentiation among villages, with municipality explaining a larger proportion of the differentiation than altitude. Consistent with an important role of social origin in patterning seed exchange, metapopulation model-based estimates of differentiation match the genetic data within village and ethnically distinct municipalities, but underestimate differentiation when all four villages are taken together. Our research provides insights about the importance of social origin in structuring maize diversity at the local scale.",Heredity,2016 May,England,2016,10
23994154,Can health equity survive epidemiology? Standards of proof and social determinants of health.,"OBJECTIVE: This article examines how epidemiological evidence is and should be used in the context of increasing concern for health equity and for social determinants of health. METHOD: A research literature on use of scientific evidence of ""environmental risks"" is outlined, and key issues compared with those that arise with respect to social determinants of health. RESULTS: The issue sets are very similar. Both involve the choice of a standard of proof, and the corollary need to make value judgments about how to address uncertainty in the context of ""the inevitability of being wrong,"" at least some of the time, and to consider evidence from multiple kinds of research design. The nature of such value judgments and the need for methodological pluralism are incompletely understood. CONCLUSION: Responsible policy analysis and interpretation of scientific evidence require explicit consideration of the ethical issues involved in choosing a standard of proof. Because of the stakes involved, such choices often become contested political terrain. Comparative research on how those choices are made will be valuable.",Preventive medicine,2013 Dec,United States,2013,10
29983601,Designing and developing a continuing interprofessional education model.,"Background: Interprofessional education is considered as one of the approaches in educating learners in the health system that increases interprofessional collaboration and improves the quality of patient care. Purpose: This study sought to design an interprofessional continuing education model. Methods: This study was conducted in three stages. In the first stage, a systematic review of literature and search of databases were conducted to identify the common models of interprofessional continuing education and to extract the elements used in these models. In the second stage, specialists in interprofessional continuing education were interviewed in relation to the features of elements derived from the first stage. In the third stage, the model of interprofessional continuing education was designed using the results of the first and second stages. Results: Seven models were obtained. Five themes, including the subject of interprofessional continuing education, objectives, content, learning strategy, and evaluation strategies, were extracted from them. Specialists stated interprofessional collaboration, needs of community and learners, focus on patient, using interactive teaching methods, and feedback as the main features of these five themes. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that providing a framework and model regulated in interprofessional continuing education programs can help design these programs.",Advances in medical education and practice,2018,New Zealand,2018,10
22350644,"Experiences and consequences of altered taste, flavour and food hedonics during chemotherapy treatment.","PURPOSE: Self-reported taste alterations are common in people receiving chemotherapy; however, it is usually unclear whether these reports refer to changes to the sense of taste itself or to problems related to the broader phenomenon of flavour, or the hedonic experience of eating and drinking. The purpose of this study was to explore patient and carer descriptions, experiences and consequences of taste and flavour changes associated with oxaliplatin treatment. METHODS: This study utilised a grounded theory research design. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit eligible patients who had self-reported taste changes in relation to oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. Content analysis of interview data was performed using an analysis framework derived from previous sensory and nutritional sciences and supportive care research. RESULTS: Ten patients and four carers participated in semi-structured interviews. The overarching theme identified from the data was reduced food enjoyment. In addition to changes to taste, participants described sensory and hedonic changes which influence overall flavour perception and food enjoyment. Reduced food enjoyment had dietary, social and emotional consequences for patients and carers. CONCLUSIONS: 'Taste' problems during oxaliplatin treatment mostly relate to the broader phenomena of flavour. This study has helped to unravel the major sensory determinants of the eating and drinking experience in the chemotherapy setting and has provided guidance regarding relevant and measurable endpoints of chemotherapy-related flavour changes. There remains a gap in knowledge between the pattern of flavour changes associated with chemotherapy treatment and how this influences dietary intake and nutritional status.",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2012 Nov,Germany,2012,10
29865086,Participation and the Role of Neuropsychological Functioning in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.,"BACKGROUND: Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is primarily a neuromuscular disease but can also have neuropsychological consequences (i.e.cognitive, emotional and behavioural) which can influence daily living and societal participation. Not much is known about the level of participation of DM1 patients and their relatives and the factors influencing participation. This information can guide the development of rehabilitation programs and identify those at risk of long-term participation problems. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the level of participation of DM1 patients and their partners and the determinants. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation. Determinants were demographic, disease related, and neuropsychological characteristics. Spearman correlations and backward multiple regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 66 DM1 participants, 54% reported severe fatigue and 47% apathy. Experienced participation restrictions were most prevalent in housekeeping (74%), sports (68%) and outdoor activities (55%). Participants were relatively satisfied with their level of participation, but dissatisfaction occurred mostly in housekeeping (58%), outdoor activities (55%), and sports (54%). Age and apathy were significant predictors of frequency of (R2 = 10.4) and restrictions in participation in the multivariate model (R2 = 14.4). Emotional functioning was the only significant predictor of satisfaction with participation (R2 = 23.8). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of DM1 patients have Central Nervous System-related problems such as fatigue and apathy in addition to neuromuscular restrictions. Risk factors for lower participation are age, apathy, and emotional problems. Physical as well as neuropsychological rehabilitation programs are recommended.",Journal of neuromuscular diseases,2018,Netherlands,2018,10
22995854,Prevention and self-management interventions are top priorities for osteoarthritis systematic reviews.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify high-priority research questions for osteoarthritis systematic reviews with consideration of health equity and the social determinants of health (SDH). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We consulted with experts and conducted a literature search to identify a priority-setting method that could be adapted to address the health equity and SDH. We selected the Global Evidence Mapping priority-setting method, and through consultations and consensus, we adapted the method to meet our objectives. This involves developing an evidence map of the existing systematic reviews on osteoarthritis; conducting one face-to-face workshop with patients and another one with clinicians, researchers, and patients; and conducting an online survey of patients to rank the top 10 research questions. We piloted the adapted method with the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group to set research priorities for osteoarthritis. RESULTS: Our focus was on systematic reviews: we identified 34 high-priority research questions for osteoarthritis systematic reviews. Prevention and self-management interventions, mainly diet and exercise, are top priorities for osteoarthritis systematic reviews. Evaluation against our predefined objectives showed that this method did prioritize SDH (50% of the research questions considered SDH). There were marked gaps: no high-priority topics were identified for access to care until patients had advanced disease-lifestyle changes once the disease was diagnosed. This method was felt feasible if conducted annually. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the utility of an adapted priority-setting method that is feasible and considers SDH. Further testing of this method is needed to assess whether considerations of health equity are prioritized and involve disadvantaged groups of the population.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,2013 May,United States,2013,10
27559311,Disentangling Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients' Implicit and Explicit Attitudes toward Methotrexate.,"Medication non-adherence is a major public health problem that has been termed an 'invisible epidemic.' Non-adherence is not only associated with negative clinical consequences but can also result in substantial healthcare costs. Up to now, effective adherence interventions are scarce and a more comprehensive model of adherence determinants is required to target the determinants for not taking the medication as prescribed. Current approaches only included explicit attitudes such as self-reported evaluations of medication as determinants, neglecting the role of associative processes that shape implicit attitudes. Implicit processes can predict daily behavior more accurately than explicit attitudes. Our aim is to assess explicit and implicit attitudes toward medication and explore the relation with beliefs, adherence and clinical (laboratory) outcomes in chronically ill patients. Fifty two Rheumatic Arthritis (RA) patients' attitudes toward Methotrexate (MTX) were explicitly (self-reported) and implicitly (Single-Category Implicit Association Test) assessed and related to the Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire, the Compliance Questionnaire on Rheumatology and laboratory parameters [Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP)]. Results show that explicit attitudes were positive and health-related. Implicit attitudes were, however, negative and sickness-related. Half of the patients displayed explicitly positive but implicitly negative attitudes. Explicit attitudes were positively related to ESR. A positive relationship between implicit attitudes and disease duration was observed. In this study, we have obtained evidence suggesting that the measurement of implicit attitudes and associations provides different information than explicit, self-reported attitudes toward medication. Since patients' implicit attitudes deviated from explicit attitudes, we can conclude that the relationship between implicit attitudes and medication adherence is worthwhile to be further explored. With this information we can improve our understanding of the subconscious, automatic processes underlying adherence and we can develop interventions that target these implicit attitudes.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2016,Switzerland,2016,10
21784693,A multilevel analysis of the association between social networks and support on leisure time physical activity: evidence from 40 disadvantaged areas in London.,"There has been extensive conceptual and empirical work on the associations between social relations and health in recent years. However, the specific pathways through which social interactions impact on health have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this paper is to estimate associations between Leisure Time Physical Activity (LTPA) and social networks and support. Using data from a cross-sectional household survey in 40 disadvantaged lower super-output areas in London, we applied a multilevel model to investigate psychosocial and environmental determinants of physical activity in these populations. Our findings present a strong case for the influence of individual-level social networks on the level of LTPA, although the associations between the types of social support and LTPA were insignificant. We also found that crime rate was an important area-level correlates of LTPA.",Health & place,2011 Sep,England,2011,10
31775689,Developing a critical realist informed framework to explain how the human rights and social determinants of health relationship works.,"BACKGROUND: That there is a relationship between human rights and health is well established and frequently discussed. However, actions intended to take account of the relationship between human rights and social determinants of health have often been limited by lack of clarity and ambiguity concerning how these rights and determinants may interact and affect each other. It is difficult to know what to do when you do not understand how things work. As our own understanding of this consideration is founded on perspectives provided by the critical realist paradigm, we present an account of and commentary on our application of these perspectives in an investigation of this relationship. FINDINGS: We define the concept of paradigm and review critical realism and related implications for construction of knowledge concerning this relationship. Those implications include the need to theorise possible entities involved in the relationship together with their distinctive properties and consequential power to affect one another through exercise of their respective mechanisms (ways of working). This theorising work enabled us identify a complex, multi-layered assembly of entities involved in the relationship and some of the array of causal mechanisms that may be in play. These are presented in a summary framework. CONCLUSION: Researchers' views about the nature of knowledge and its construction inevitably influence their research aims, approaches and outcomes. We demonstrate that by attending to these views, which are founded in their paradigm positioning, researchers can make more progress in understanding the relationship between human rights and the social determinants of health, in particular when engaged in theorizing work. The same approaches could be drawn on when other significant relationships in health environments are investigated.",BMC public health,2019 Nov 27,England,2019,10
23049992,Individual and county-level factors associated with use of multiple prescribers and multiple pharmacies to obtain opioid prescriptions in California.,"Use of multiple prescribers and pharmacies is a means by which some individuals misuse opioids. Community characteristics may be important determinants of the likelihood of this phenomenon independent of individual-level factors. This was a retrospective cohort study with individual-level data derived from California's statewide prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) and county-level socioeconomic status (SES) data derived from the United States Census. Zero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) regression was used to model the association of individual factors (age, gender, drug schedule and drug dose type) and county SES factors (ethnicity, adult educational attainment, median household income, and physician availability) with the number of prescribers and the number of pharmacies that an individual used during a single year (2006). The incidence rates of new prescriber use and new pharmacy use for opioid prescriptions declined across increasing age groups. Males had a lower incidence rate of new prescriber use and new pharmacy use than females. The total number of licensed physicians and surgeons in a county was positively, linearly, and independently associated with the number of prescribers and pharmacies that individuals used for prescription opioids. In summary, younger age, female gender, and living in counties with more licensed physicians and surgeons were associated with use of more prescribers and/or more pharmacies for obtaining prescription opioids.",PloS one,2012,United States,2012,10
26270944,Prescription contraception use: a cross-sectional population study of psychosocial determinants.,"OBJECTIVE: Many forms of contraception are available on prescription only for example, the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) and long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). In this analysis we aim to identify key determinants of prescription contraceptive use. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population survey. Data on sociodemographic indices, concerns about the OCP and perceived barriers to access were collected. SETTING: Data set constructed from a representative population-based telephone survey of community dwelling adults in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) PARTICIPANTS: 1515 women aged between 18 and 45 years MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-reported user of the OCP or LARCs (intrauterine contraception, contraceptive injections or subdermal contraceptive implants) in the previous 12 months. RESULTS: For at least some of the previous year, 35% had used the OCP and 14% had used LARCs, while 3% had used two or more of these methods. OCP users were significantly younger, more likely to be unmarried and had higher income than non-users. Overall, 68% agreed with the statement 'that taking a break from long-term use of the contraceptive pill is a good idea' and 37% agreed with the statement that 'the OCP has dangerous side effects' and this was the strongest predictor variable of non-use of the OCP. Intrauterine contraception users were significantly older, more likely to be married and had lower income than non-users. Injections or subdermal contraceptive implant users were significantly younger, less likely to be married, had lower income and were less likely to agree that taking a break from long-term use of the pill is a good idea than non-users. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription contraceptive use is sociodemographically patterned, with LARCs in particular being associated with lower incomes in the RoI. Concerns about the safety of the OCP remain prevalent and are important and modifiable determinants of contraceptive-related behaviour.",BMJ open,2015 Aug 12,England,2015,10
24390164,Factors associated with quality of life and mood in adults with strabismus.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: To explore the factors associated with the mood and quality of life (QoL) of patients with strabismus due to undergo realignment surgery. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken with adult patients. Along with demographic, clinical and psychosocial process variables, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and AS-20 QoL measures were administered. Regression models were used to identify the factors associated with QoL and mood. RESULTS: Of the 220 participants, 11% were experiencing clinical levels of depression, and 24% clinical anxiety. This is in line with other forms of facial disfigurement but higher than other chronic diseases. Although mood and QoL were associated with age and diplopia, it was beliefs and cognitions which were more consistently associated with well-being. This included feelings of social anxiety and avoidance, a belief that strabismus has negative consequences, poor understanding of strabismus, social support, fear of negative evaluation and the perceived visibility of their condition. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial rather than clinical characteristics were identified as determinants of well-being in this population. It is important for clinicians planning surgery to be aware of these factors which could influence outcomes. Longitudinal studies need to be conducted to explore the direction of causality before interventions to improve well-being are developed and evaluated.",The British journal of ophthalmology,2014 Apr,England,2014,10
21443544,Holism in nursing and health promotion: distinct or related perspectives?--A literature review.,"BACKGROUND: The concept of holism is central in health promotion as well as in nursing. Holism or a holistic view on health was identified as one of the key principles of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion and is linked to social ecology and the determinants of health. AIMS: To explore how the term holism was defined and/or described in Nordic articles with a health-promotion approach, and how holism aspects were related to nursing and health promotion, and to the other key principles of the Ottawa Charter. METHODS: Abstracts were first identified by the search word 'health promotion' as a keyword. The search was limited to 1986-2008 and abstracts written in English by authors with a Nordic affiliation. Abstracts/articles for this study were subsequently selected from these abstracts using the search words 'holism' and 'holistic' and analysed by quantitative and manifest qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: The sample included 23 articles: one theoretical, two reviews and 20 empirical studies. Sixteen articles included a hospital setting or nursing perspective. A holistic perspective could be extracted from most articles. No larger but several minor differences were identified in the way holism aspects were related to nursing and health promotion respectively. CONCLUSION: There is a risk that the individual patient perspective of holism in nursing may result in less chance of reaching larger groups of patients with chronic diseases and mental health problems, not least the most vulnerable ones.",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,2011 Dec,Sweden,2011,10
26886930,Stigma and Knowledge as Determinants of Recommendation and Referral Behavior of General Practitioners and Internists.,"BACKGROUND: Despite reported effectiveness, weight loss surgery (WLS) still remains one of the least preferred options for outpatient providers, especially in Germany. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of stigma and knowledge on recommendation of WLS and referral to a surgeon by general practitioners (GPs) and internists. METHOD: The sample consists of 201 GPs and internists from Germany. The questionnaire included questions on the perceived effectiveness of WLS, the frequency of recommendations of WLS, and the frequency of referral to WLS. Stigma, as well as knowledge was also assessed in this context. Linear and logistic regression models were conducted. A mediation analysis was carried out within post hoc analysis. RESULTS: Knowledge (b = 0.258, p < 0.001) and stigma towards surgery (b = -0.129, p = 0.013) were related to the frequency of recommendation of WLS. Additionally, respondents, who were more likely to express negative attitudes towards WLS, were less likely to recommend WLS and thus refer patients to WLS (b = -0.107, p < 0.05). Furthermore, respondents with more expertise on WLS were more likely to recommend and thus refer patients to WLS (b = 0.026, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study showed that stigma plays a role when it comes to defining treatment pathways for patients with obesity. The question remains how this might influence the patients and their decision regarding their treatment selection. Interventions are required to make treatment decisions by physicians or patients independent of social pressure due to stigma.",Obesity surgery,2016 Oct,United States,2016,10
29773663,Factors associated with condom use and HIV testing among young men who have sex with men: a cross-sectional survey in a random online sample in Sweden.,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives are to analyse social determinants of sexual health behaviour (condom use and HIV testing) among young, internet-active, cis men who have sex with men (MSM) in a high-income country. The aspects of sexual health behaviour analysed here are condomless anal intercourse with one or more new or casual partner(s), condomless anal intercourse during the most recent sex with a man and HIV testing. METHODS: A randomised sample of men active on Sweden's main online community for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans people responded to an online survey (response rate 19%). A subsample of young people, aged 15-29, was analysed (effective sample 597-669) using multivariable logistic regression with respect to factors associated with condomless anal intercourse with one or more new or casual partner(s), condomless anal intercourse at most recent sex and not having had a test for HIV. RESULTS: Low education, being single and living in a metropolitan area were found to be independently associated with condomless anal intercourse with new or casual partner(s). Sex with a steady partner was associated with condomless anal intercourse during the most recent sex. Knowledge of where to get tested, high education, being born outside Sweden and condomless anal intercourse with new or casual sex partner(s) were independently associated with having been tested for HIV. CONCLUSIONS: The factors associated with sexual health behaviour among young MSM are complex, and preventive messages need to be tailored accordingly.",Sexually transmitted infections,2018 Sep,England,2018,10
26905932,"""The sun has set even though it is morning"": Experiences and explanations of perinatal depression in an urban township, Cape Town.","This study examined experiences and explanations of depression amongst Xhosa-speaking pregnant women, mothers, and health workers in an urban township in Cape Town, South Africa. The study was conducted as part of formative research for a randomised controlled trial to develop and evaluate a task-sharing counselling intervention for maternal depression in this setting. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 12 depressed and 9 nondepressed pregnant women and mothers of young babies, and 13 health care providers. We employed an in-depth framework analysis approach to explore the idioms, descriptions, and perceived causes of depression particular to these women, and compared these with the ICD-10 and DSM-5 criteria for major depression. We found that symptoms of major depression are similar in this township to those described in international criteria (withdrawal, sadness, and poor concentration), but that local descriptions of these symptoms vary. In addition, all the symptoms described by participants were directly related to stressors occurring in the women's lives. These stressors included poverty, unemployment, lack of support from partners, abuse, and death of loved ones, and were exacerbated by unwanted or unplanned pregnancies and the discovery of HIV positive status at antenatal appointments. The study calls attention to the need for specifically designed counselling interventions for perinatal depression that are responsive to the lived experiences of these women and grounded in the broader context of poor socioeconomic conditions and living environments in South Africa, all of which have a direct impact on mental health.",Transcultural psychiatry,2016 Jun,England,2016,10
23274294,Psychosocial predictors of impulsivity in alcohol-dependent patients.,"Impulsivity is an important risk factor of severe course of alcohol dependence. However, the significance of environmental determinants of impulsivity has been underestimated. The aim of this study was to identify psychosocial factors increasing the level of impulsivity in alcoholics. Levels of impulsivity were measured in 304 alcohol-dependent patients. The stop-signal task was used to assess behavioral impulsivity, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, to measure global and cognitive impulsivity. Correlations between impulsivity and psychosocial variables were examined. A significant association between level of impulsivity and severity of psychopathological symptoms was observed. Patients who reported childhood sexual or physical abuse, lower social support, and more severe course of alcohol dependence were more impulsive, especially in the cognitive domain. When entered into a linear regression analysis model, severity of alcohol dependence, psychopathology, and childhood physical abuse remained significant. These results suggest that psychosocial variables are important factors associated with high levels of impulsivity in alcohol-dependent patients.",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,2013 Jan,United States,2013,10
31723372,"Assessing implementation modalities of mhealth intervention on pregnant women in Dschang health district, West region of Cameroon.","Introduction: Every 90 seconds, a woman dies of complications related to pregnancy and childbirth, resulting in more than 340,000 maternal deaths a year. Antenatal care (ANC) and postnatal care (PNC) are significant determinants of maternal health and, particularly, safe motherhood. Antenatal care is an important predictor of safe delivery and provides health information and services that can improve the health of women and infants. mHealth broadly encompasses the use of mobile telecommunication and multimedia technologies as they are integrated within increasingly mobile and wireless health care delivery systems. This study aimed at assessing the acceptable implementation modalities of mHealth intervention on pregnant Women in Dschang health district, West Region of Cameroon.ng ba. Methods: This was a cross sectional descriptive study in the Dschang health district, West region of Cameroon. Key informants were all pregnant women from 18 years and above and a total of 372 pregnant women were included. This study was carried out from March to July 2017. Results: Majority of the women, that is, 252(67.74%) were married, 117(31.45%) declaredtheir status as being single, while 3(0.81%) were devorced. Out of the 335 women that declared wanting an mHealth intervention, 41.79% of this number preferred SMS texts in the afternoon, 111(33.13%) in the evening, 46(13.73%) anytime and 38(11.34%) in the morning hours. A total of 83.33% women confirmed using telephone services. Conclusion: This study reveals that cell phones would be the acceptable medium of providing pregnancy and postpartum support to women in the Dschang health district. This is justified by the fact that a vast majority of women interviewed had access to a cell phone and referred to it as their desired and accepted means of communication.",The Pan African medical journal,2019,Uganda,2019,10
30218915,Safe sex norm questionnaire for female sex workers: development and validation study in Iran.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a safe sex norm questionnaire as an appropriate instrument which would be adaptable to the female sex worker (FSW) population. STUDY DESIGN: A mixed method study. METHODS: Appropriate content was prepared through a literature review. Content validation indices were assessed using interviews with content experts and lay experts. A conservative approach was used to assess the inter-rater agreement among the participants about the instrument relevance and clarity. The scale content validity index was computed using the average method. Non-parametric Mokken scale analysis was used for assessing scalability and unidimensionality of the questionnaire in a sample of 170 FSWs in Tehran. To evaluate the reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaire intra-class correlation and Cronbach's alpha were employed. RESULTS: A list of 34 items was finalized, with subscales for actual behavioral norms and for perceived norms. The relevance of the actual and perceived norms subscales in the final questionnaire was higher than 96%; clarity of the subtests was 99% and higher. The comprehensiveness of the actual and perceived norms subscales was 85% for both. Mokken scale analysis showed that the two subscales were distinct constructs, and all items are good indicators for the constructs. CONCLUSION: Our findings support that the safe sex norm questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure that would be useful to harm reduction programs and help effective HIV prevention among female sex workers.",Public health,2018 Nov,Netherlands,2018,10
27998700,Adolescence Is a Sensitive Period for Housing Mobility to Influence Risky Behaviors: An Experimental Design.,"PURPOSE: Test whether neighborhood mobility effects on adolescent risky behaviors varies at different developmental ages and gender. METHODS: The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study randomly assigned volunteer families (1994-1997) to receive a Section 8 voucher to move to lower poverty neighborhoods versus a public housing control group. We tested three-way treatment, gender, and age-at-randomization interactions using intent-to-treat linear regression predicting a risky behavior index (RBI; measured in 2002, N = 2,829), defined as the fraction of 10 behaviors the youth reported (six measuring risky substance use [RSU], four measuring risky sexual behavior), and the RSU and risky sexual behavior subscales. RESULTS: The treatment main effect on RBI was nonsignificant for girls (B = -.01, 95% confidence interval -.024 to .014) and harmful for boys (B = .03, 95% confidence interval .009 to .059; treatment-gender interaction p = .01). The treatment, gender, and age interaction was significant for RBI (p = .02) and RSU (p </= .001). Treatment boys 10 years or older at randomization were more likely (p < .05) than controls to exhibit RBI and RSU, whereas there was no effect of treatment for boys <10 years. There were no treatment control differences by age for girls' RBI, but girls 9+ years were less likely than girls </=8 years to exhibit RSU (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Moving families of boys aged 10 years or older with rental vouchers may have adverse consequences on risky behaviors but may be beneficial for girls' substance use. Developmental windows are different by gender for the effects of improving neighborhood contexts on adolescent risky behavior.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,2017 Apr,United States,2017,10
29769034,"Demand-side determinants of timely vaccination of oral polio vaccine in social mobilization network areas of CORE Group polio project in Uttar Pradesh, India.","BACKGROUND: Children who receive all doses of scheduled vaccines reduce their susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases. In India, full immunization coverage has increased significantly. However, only a small proportion of children are immunized on time. Globally, studies on factors affecting coverage of childhood immunization have found a significant impact by demand and supply-side determinants. This paper explores the demand-side determinants of timely immunization of the third dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV3) among children aged 6-11 months in the catchment areas of CORE Group Polio Project India. METHODS: We analyzed secondary de-identified data from a household level 'Doers and Non-doers survey' conducted in 2015. Determinants of timely OPV3 immunization were identified by modeling the characteristics of index children and survey respondents, surveyed households, respondents' media habits, their exposure to immunization services and perceptions towards child immunization, through a multinomial regression analysis. RESULTS: The eight demand-side predictors based on the background characteristics and perceptions of caregivers determined timely vaccination of OPV3. The strongest predictor of timely OPV3 immunization was found to be the fathers' educational level. Children of uneducated or lesser educated fathers had increased odds of not receiving the OPV1 vaccination, as compared to children of more educated fathers (OR > 10). Respondents who strongly perceived other (non-health) benefits of child immunization were three times more likely to timely vaccinate their children than those who do not. Furthermore, mothers who disagreed with the positive attributes of child immunization were 25 times more likely to delay or not to take their children for OPV immunization on time. CONCLUSIONS: This study found eight essential factors that are responsible for timely OPV3. Despite limitations in data collection and analysis, immunization programs in India could use the eight identified demand-side determinants of timeliness and tailor communication strategies accordingly. We suggest that program communication efforts be directed at male community members; such messaging should address parents' perceptions of non-health benefits and stress the positive attributes of child immunization. Further investigation would be helpful to assess the various risk factors of under-vaccination as well as vaccinators' understating about timely immunization.",BMC infectious diseases,2018 May 16,England,2018,10

The present study aimed to assess the incidence and intensity of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) relating to type 2 diabetes mellitus care, and to explore its determinants in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1,948 type 2 diabetes patients were included in the analysis. CHE for type 2 diabetes mellitus was defined as out-of-pocket payments for diabetes care that were >/=40% of the non-food expenditure of a household. The Chi-square-test was used to identify the factors associated with CHE. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effects of explanatory analysis variables. RESULTS: The incidence of CHE for type 2 diabetes mellitus care was 13.8%. An association was observed between CHE incidence and household income level, and the poorest group was more likely to experience CHE as a result of diabetes mellitus care. The type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with complications were found to be more likely to experience CHE. Diabetes patients who experienced outpatient or inpatient services increased the likelihood of CHE, and those who experienced inpatient services were more likely to incur CHE. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus has a significantly catastrophic effect on patients and their households in China. Early screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients among the high-risk groups and effective management of the detected cases should be priorities to reduce the overall healthcare expenditure for type 2 diabetes mellitus.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2019 Mar,Japan,2019,10

25216714,Parents' views on care of their very premature babies in neonatal intensive care units: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: The admission of a very premature infant to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is often a difficult time for parents. This paper explores parents' views and experiences of the care for their very premature baby on NICU. METHODS: Parents were eligible if they had a baby born before 32 weeks gestation and cared for in a NICU, and spoke English well. 32 mothers and 7 fathers were interviewed to explore their experiences of preterm birth. Although parents' evaluation of care in the NICU was not the aim of these interviews, all parents spoke spontaneously and at length on this topic. Results were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Overall, parents were satisfied with the care on the neonatal unit. Three major themes determining satisfaction with neonatal care emerged: 1) parents' involvement; including looking after their own baby, the challenges of expressing breast milk, and easy access to their baby; 2) staff competence and efficiency; including communication, experience and confidence, information and explanation; and 3) interpersonal relationships with staff; including sensitive and emotional support, reassurance and encouragement, feeling like an individual. CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of positive experiences of care were generally consistent with previous research. Specifically, provision of information, support for parents and increasing their involvement in the care of their baby were highlighted by parents as important in their experience of care.",BMC pediatrics,2014 Sep 13,England,2014,10

29764296,'Medicine doesn't cure my worries': Understanding the drivers of mental distress in older Nepalese women living in the UK.,"The mental health of migrant communities is an important public health concern. A growing body of literature suggests that social and cultural determinants of health significantly contribute to the mental health and wellbeing of older migrants in their host countries. Despite the increasing population of older Nepalese migrants in the UK, there is little research exploring the mental health needs of this community. This article explores older Nepalese women's experiences of drivers of mental distress in London. Data was collected using in-depth interviews with 20 older Nepalese women living in the London Borough of Greenwich. Grounded thematic analysis of women's narratives identified six overarching factors contributing to their emotional distress that pose potential risks to their mental health: absence of family, language barriers, housing problems, physical illness, lack of appropriate support, fears of death, and inadequate financial resources. In many cases, the impact of these factors was experienced in combination rather than isolation, often influenced by cultural dynamics. Findings highlight that re-settlement in the absence of family is at the heart of emotional challenges for older Nepalese women. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for supporting processes of settlement to mitigate this risk among older Nepalese women in the UK.",Global public health,2019 Jan,England,2019,10
30629661,A performance assessment of web-based respondent driven sampling among workers with precarious employment in Sweden.,"OBJECTIVES: Precarious employment (PE) is a social determinant of poor health of workers. However, this population usually lack a sampling frame, making it challenging to identify the characteristics of this group. Web-based respondent driven sampling (webRDS) recruits individuals online through the social network and can provide population estimates. This study aims to assess the performance of webRDS in a population of workers with PE. METHOD: WebRDS was used for recruitment and data collection in the PRecarious EMployment In Stockholm (PREMIS) study. Cross-sectional questionnaire data was collected between November 2016 and May 2017. Eligible participants were living and/or working in Stockholm County, 18-65 years old, had a personal identification number and were currently employed. WebRDS performance was assessed by the total sample size, length of recruitment chains, sample composition, sample proportions and estimated RDSII population proportions with confidence intervals. RESULTS: The webRDS process resulted in a sample of 358 recruits and a total sample of 415 participants, recruited over 1-15 waves. Of the participating seeds and recruits, 60% and 48%, respectively, successfully recruited at least one peer. The sample composition stabilized for all variables assessed. The sample proportions and RDSII estimates differed by 1-8% and the confidence intervals included the sample proportions for all variables except one. CONCLUSIONS: WebRDS successfully recruited a sufficient sample of workers with precarious employment from which population estimates could be made. Future studies should consider implementing webRDS on a national level in order to further study this population.",PloS one,2019,United States,2019,10
24411023,REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY IN NIGERIA: A MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS.,"There are substantial regional disparities in under-five mortality in Nigeria, and evidence suggests that both individual- and community-level characteristics have an influence on health outcomes. Using 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey data, this study (1) examines the effects of individual- and community-level characteristics on infant/child mortality in Nigeria and (2) determines the extent to which characteristics at these levels influence regional variations in infant/child mortality in the country. Multilevel Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed on a nationally representative sample of 28,647 children nested within 18,028 mothers of reproductive age, who were also nested within 886 communities. The results indicate that community-level variables (such as region, place of residence, community infrastructure, community hospital delivery and community poverty level) and individual-level factors (including child's sex, birth order, birth interval, maternal education, maternal age and wealth index) are important determinants of infant/child mortality in Nigeria. For instance, the results show a lower risk of death in infancy for children of mothers residing in communities with a high proportion of hospital delivery (HR: 0.70, p < 0.05) and for children whose mothers had secondary or higher education (HR: 0.84, p < 0.05). Although community factors appear to influence the association between individual-level factors and death during infancy and childhood, the findings consistently indicate that community-level characteristics are more important in explaining regional variations in child mortality, while individual-level factors are more important for regional variations in infant mortality. The results of this study underscore the need to look beyond the influence of individual-level factors in addressing regional variations in infant and child mortality in Nigeria.",Journal of biosocial science,2015 Mar,England,2015,10
26026894,Subjective pain perception mediated by alpha rhythms.,"Suppression of spontaneous alpha oscillatory activities, interpreted as cortical excitability, was observed in response to both transient and tonic painful stimuli. The changes of alpha rhythms induced by pain could be modulated by painful sensory inputs, experimental tasks, and top-down cognitive regulations such as attention. The temporal and spatial characteristics, as well as neural functions of pain induced alpha responses, depend much on how these factors contribute to the observed alpha event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS). How sensory-, task-, and cognitive-related changes of alpha oscillatory activities interact in pain perception process is reviewed in the current study, and the following conclusions are made: (1) the functional inhibition hypothesis that has been proposed in auditory and visual modalities could be applied also in pain modality; (2) the neural functions of pain induced alpha ERD/ERS were highly dependent on the cortical regions where it is observed, e.g., somatosensory cortex alpha ERD/ERS in pain perception for painful stimulus processing; (3) the attention modulation of pain perception, i.e., influences on the sensory and affective dimensions of pain experience, could be mediated by changes of alpha rhythms. Finally, we propose a model regarding the determinants of pain related alpha oscillatory activity, i.e., sensory-discriminative, affective-motivational, and cognitive-modulative aspects of pain experience, would affect and determine pain related alpha oscillatory activities in an integrated way within the distributed alpha system.",Biological psychology,2015 Jul,Netherlands,2015,10
28768495,Exploring the determinants of health and wellbeing in communities living in proximity to coal seam gas developments in regional Queensland.,"BACKGROUND: There is some concern that coal seam gas mining may affect health and wellbeing through changes in social determinants such as living and working conditions, local economy and the environment. The onward impact of these conditions on health and wellbeing is often not monitored to the same degree as direct environmental health impacts in the mining context, but merits attention. This study reports on the findings from a recurrent theme that emerged from analysis of the qualitative component of a comprehensive Health Needs Assessment (HNA) conducted in regional Queensland: that health and wellbeing of communities was reportedly affected by nearby coal seam gas (CSG) development beyond direct environmental impacts. METHODS: Qualitative analysis was initially completed using the Framework Method to explore key themes from 11 focus group discussions, 19 in-depth interviews, and 45 key informant interviews with health and wellbeing service providers and community members. A key theme emerged from the analysis that forms the basis of this paper. This study is part of a larger comprehensive HNA involving qualitative and quantitative data collection to explore the health and wellbeing needs of three communities living in proximity to CSG development in regional Queensland, Australia. RESULTS: Communities faced social, economic and environmental impacts from the rapid growth of CSG development, which were perceived to have direct and indirect effects on individual lifestyle factors such as alcohol and drug abuse, family relationships, social capital and mental health; and community-level factors including social connectedness, civic engagement and trust. CONCLUSIONS: Outer regional communities discussed the effects of mining activity on the fabric of their town and community, whereas the inner regional community that had a longer history of industrial activity discussed the impacts on families and individual health and wellbeing. The findings from this study may inform future health service planning in regions affected by CSG in the development /construction phase and provide the mining sector in regional areas with evidence from which to develop social responsibility programs that encompass health, social, economic and environmental assessments that more accurately reflect the needs of the affected communities.",BMC public health,2017 Aug 3,England,2017,10

This study compared the sexual self-esteem and its components in mothers with normal and mentally-retarded children in Qaen city, in 2014. A total of 120 mothers were selected and assigned into two groups of 60 samples based on convenient sampling method and randomized multiple stage sampling. Both groups completed sexual self-esteem questionnaire. The data were analyzed employing t-test through SPSS software version15. The results showed that the rate of sexual self-esteem in mothers of mentally-retarded children decreased significantly compared with that of mothers with normal children (p<0.05). Moreover, the mean scores of all components of sexual self-esteem including skill and experience, attractiveness, control, moral judgment, and adaptiveness in mothers of mentally-retarded children were significantly less than those of mothers with normal children (p <0.05). Therefore, it is recommended that self-esteem, especially the sexual one, be taught to mothers of mentally-retarded children by specialists.",JPMA.

This study determined dynamic changes in quality of life (QoL) for patients using these therapies after controlling for potential confounders. Methods: From 2011 to 2016, we prospectively assessed the utility values and QoL scores of patients using the EuroQol five-dimension and World Health Organization Quality-of-Life - Brief questionnaires. QoL functions after initiation of treatment were estimated using a kernel-smoothing method. Dynamic changes in major determinants were repeatedly assessed for constructing mixed models. Results: A total of 344 patients were enrolled, with 934 repeated assessments. After controlling for performance status, disease progression, EGFR mutation subtype and other confounders, the mixed models showed significantly lower QoL scores for afatinib versus gefitinib in the physical, psychological and social domains, and 10 facets. The differences seemed to appear 10 months after initiation of treatment. In contrast, there was no significant difference between erlotinib and gefitinib in the scores of all domains and facets. Conclusion: QoL in patients receiving afatinib seemed to be lower than in those receiving gefitinib. Since the sample sizes in this study were relatively small, more studies are warranted to corroborate these results.",Therapeutic advances in medical oncology,2018,England,2018,10

Yet, it is felt that the quality, costs, and equity of medicine and public health have not improved correspondingly and, both inside and outside the USA, may even have changed for the worse. An initiative for improving this situation is value-based healthcare, in which value is defined as health outcomes relative to the cost of achieving them. Value-based healthcare was advocated in order to stimulate competition among healthcare providers and thereby reduce costs. The approach may be well grounded economically, but in the care of patients, ""value"" has ethical and philosophical connotations. The restriction of value to an economic meaning ignores the importance of health and, thus, leads to misunderstandings. We postulate that a new understanding of the nature of health is necessary. We present the Meikirch model, a conceptual framework for health and disease that views health as a complex adaptive system. We describe this model and analyze some important consequences of its application to healthcare. The resources each person needs to meet the demands of life are both biological and personal, and both function together. While scientific advances in healthcare are hailed, these advances focus mainly on the biologically given potential (BGP) and tend to neglect the personally acquired potential (PAP) of an individual person. Personal growth to improve the PAP strongly contributes to meeting the demands of life. Therefore, in individual and public health care, personal growth deserves as much attention as the BGP. The conceptual framework of the Meikirch model supports a unified understanding of healthcare and serves to develop common goals, thereby rendering interprofessional and intersectoral cooperation more successful. The Meikirch model can be used as an effective tool to stimulate health literacy and improve health-supporting behavior. If individuals and groups of people involved in healthcare interact based on the model, mutual understanding of and adherence to treatments and preventive measures will improve. In healthcare, the Meikirch model also makes it plain that neither pay-for-performance nor value-based payment is an adequate response to improve person-centered healthcare. The Meikirch model is not only a unifying theoretical framework for health and disease but also a scaffold for the practice of medicine and public health. It is fully in line with the theory and practice of evidence-based medicine, person-centered healthcare, and integrative medicine. The model offers opportunities to self-motivate people to improve their health-supporting behavior, thereby making preventive approaches and overall healthcare more effective. We believe that the Meikirch model could induce a paradigm shift in healthcare. The healthcare community is hereby invited to acquaint themselves with this model and to consider its potential ramifications.",Cureus,2017 Mar 6,United States,2017,10
22451142,Outcomes and long-term quality of life of patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify determinants of long-term results after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) in group of Iranian patients with systolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. METHODS: Reduced LV function was defined as an LV ejection fraction of <30%. Using our surgery database, we randomly selected 110 patients with EF < 30% and the same number of patients with EF >/= 30% for whom demographic and clinical characteristics as well as in-hospital postoperative outcomes were available. Followup data were completed for 94 patients with EF < 30% (85.5%) and 101 patients with EF >/= 30% (91.8%). Longterm results of the operation and the patients' quality of life were assessed for a mean follow-up period of 29.4 +/- 11.0 months. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality and follow-up survival rates had no statistically differences in the low and normal EF groups (2.2% vs. 1.1% and 86.0% vs. 93.6%, respectively). Long-term surgical morbidity occurred in 43.6% of patients with severe LV dysfunction and in 38.6% of normal EF patients; it was considered similar for the two groups. Family history of coronary artery disease, New York Heart Association class IV, and moderate mitral insufficiency were the main predictors of long-term morbidity. Regarding the quality-of-life assessment, patients with severe LV dysfunction attained significantly lower levels of social activities. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe LV dysfunction in comparison with those with normal LV function had similar 3-year survival rates and long-term complications. To improve survival following CABG in patients with severe LV dysfunction, mitral valve repair/replacement at the time of the initial operation should be considered.",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2012 Apr,Japan,2012,10
31163050,"Trends, patterns and determinants of long-acting reversible methods of contraception among women in sub-Saharan Africa.","BACKGROUND: Method-specific contraceptive prevalence varies widely globally, as huge variations exist in the use of different types of contraception, with short-term methods being the most common methods in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Evidence is scanty on the trends, patterns and determinants of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods in SSA. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap. METHODS: Using a pseudo longitudinal research design and descriptive and inferential statistics, we analysed Demographic and Health Survey data of eight countries selected on the basis of contraceptive prevalence rates across SSA. Multinomial logistic regression modelling was used to tease out the predictors of the uptake of LARC methods in the selected countries. RESULTS: Findings exhibit a steady but slow upward trend in LARC methods across selected countries, as a marginal increase was recorded in LARC uptake over a 10-year period in many of the selected countries. Results established significant predictors of LARC methods uptake, including fertility-related characteristics, age, level of education, work status, wealth index and exposure to mass media. This study underscored the need to address various barriers to the uptake of LARC methods in SSA. It is recommended that governments at different levels undertake to cover the costs of LARC methods in order to increase access and uptake.",PloS one,2019,United States,2019,10
24406381,"""Injustice! That is the cause"": a qualitative study of the social, economic, and structural determinants of late diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in Egypt.","BACKGROUND: In developing countries, breast cancer is generally diagnosed late. Two companion quantitative studies found that health system shortages were a major cause of delayed diagnosis together with poor health literacy. Yet, patients' perceptions regarding the delays were missing. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a qualitative study to deepen our understanding of women's experiences with diagnosis and treatment delays and highlight nuances not identifiable in the quantitative studies. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: Fifteen women recruited from the quantitative study were interviewed. Information on diagnosis/treatment delays collected in the quantitative study constituted the basis for the selection of participants, the aim being to ensure a maximum of variability in the types of delays. RESULTS: In addition to women's health literacy challenges, which likely resulted from the interactions of individual, interpersonal, and systemic factors, barriers attributable to healthcare system weaknesses and financial constraints were revealed to be key factors. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce late-stage diagnosis, tackling women's ""lack of breast cancer awareness"" is far from sufficient. Although the majority of health professionals are not in a position to address structural and policy barriers, it is nonetheless important for them to be cognizant of these barriers so that they can better advise and guide their patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our study aimed to provide a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and structural barriers patients face in Egypt. Such knowledge should help nurses and other health professionals develop a nonjudgmental, compassionate, and perceptive approach to care.",Cancer nursing,2014 Nov-Dec,United States,2014,10
24656990,[Health promotion and prevention in the economic crisis: the role of the health sector. SESPAS report 2014].,"This article reviews trends in lifestyle factors and identifies priorities in the fields of prevention and health promotion in the current economic recession. Several information sources were used, including a survey of 30 public health and primary care experts. Between 2006 and 2012, no significant changes in lifestyle factors were detected except for a decrease in habitual alcohol drinking. There was a slight decrease in the use of illegal drugs and a significant increase in the use of psychoactive drugs. Most experts believe that decision-making about new mass screening programs and changes in vaccination schedules needs to be improved by including opportunity cost analysis and increasing the transparency and independence of the professionals involved. Preventive health services are contributing to medicalization, but experts' opinions are divided on the need for some preventive activities. Priorities in preventive services are mental health and HIV infection in vulnerable populations. Most experts trust in the potential of health promotion to mitigate the health effects of the economic crisis. Priority groups are children, unemployed people and other vulnerable groups. Priority interventions are community health activities (working in partnership with local governments and other sectors), advocacy, and mental health promotion. Effective tools for health promotion that are currently underused are legislation and mass media. There is a need to clarify the role of the healthcare sector in intersectorial activities, as well as to acknowledge that social determinants of health depend on other sectors. Experts also warn of the consequences of austerity and of policies that negatively impact on living conditions.",Gaceta sanitaria,2014 Jun,Spain,2014,10
22528046,Demographic and behavioral correlates of HIV risk among men and transgender women recruited from gay entertainment venues and community-based organizations in Thailand: implications for HIV prevention.,"High HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women in Thailand suggest a vital need for targeted interventions. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to examine and compare sexual risk behaviors, and demographic and behavioral correlates of risk, among MSM and transgender women recruited from gay entertainment venue staff and community-based organization (CBO) participants. We used venue-based sampling across nine sites in Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Among 260 participants (57.3% gay-identified, 26.9% heterosexual/bisexual-identified, 15.8% transgender; mean age = 26.7 years), nearly one-fifth (18.5%) reported unprotected anal sex (UAS), half (50.4%) sex in exchange for money, and one-fifth (20.0%) STI diagnosis (past year). Nearly one-fourth (23.1%) reported oral erectile dysfunction medication use and nearly one-fifth (19.2%) illicit drug use (past 3 months). Overall, 43.1% indicated that healthcare providers exhibited hostility towards them. Gay entertainment venue staff were significantly more likely to self-identify as heterosexual/bisexual (versus gay or transgender female), and to have less than high school degree education, higher monthly income, to have engaged in sex in exchange for money, sex with women and unprotected vaginal sex, but were significantly less likely to have engaged in UAS than CBO participants. Targeted interventions for younger MSM and transgender women, for non gay-identified men, and strategies to address structural determinants of risk, including low education and discrimination from healthcare providers, may support HIV prevention among MSM and transgender women, and serve broader national HIV prevention efforts in Thailand.",Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,2012 Oct,United States,2012,10
21740661,"Modeling social, environmental and biological determinants of tuberculosis.","Mathematical models have facilitated our understanding of infectious diseases dynamics and proved useful tools to compare control scenarios when interventional studies are not feasible or ethical. Here, we summarize evidence linking social, economic and biologic determinants to tuberculosis (TB) and review modeling approaches that have been used to understand their contribution to the epidemic dynamics of TB. Specifically, we find evidence for associations between smoking, indoor air pollution, diabetes mellitus, alcohol, nutritional status, crowding, migration, aging and economic trends, and the occurrence of TB infection and/or disease. We outline some methodological problems inherent to the study of these associations; these include study design issues, reverse causality and misclassification of both exposure and outcomes. We then go on to review two existing approaches to modeling the impact of determinants and the effect of interventions: the population attributable fraction model, which estimates the proportion of the TB burden that would be averted if exposure to a risk factor were eliminated from the population, and deterministic epidemic models that capture transmission dynamics and the indirect effects of interventions. We conclude by defining research priorities in both the study of specific determinants and the development of appropriate models to assess the impact of addressing these determinants.",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,2011 Jun,France,2011,10
24919167,Why are the outcomes in patients with schizophrenia so poor?,"Despite many advances in the treatment of schizophrenia over the past 50 years, the outcomes for many patients with schizophrenia remain poor. While the majority of patients with a first episode of schizophrenia may be able to achieve and maintain a remission of symptoms, only 1 in 7 patients are likely to meet criteria for recovery. These findings could be easily reconciled if schizophrenia could be established to be a progressive brain disease. Results from longitudinal studies of brain structure, cognitive functioning, and clinical outcomes, however, do not support this view. The poor outcomes so commonly observed are likely best explained by poor access to treatment, poor engagement in ongoing care, poor treatment response, and poor adherence together with the cumulative negative impact of substance abuse, comorbid psychiatric disorders, cognitive deficits, and multiple social determinants of health.",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,2014,United States,2014,10
30687462,Influence of Smoking on Bone Mineral Density in Elderly Men.,"Background: Smoking has deleterious effects on bone mass and is associated with the subsequent development of osteoporosis, particularly in elderly participants. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of smoking in the elderly male smokers. Methods: All male participants aged 60 years and older of the Amirkola cohort who performed bone densitometry entered the study. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) using the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry method. In statistical analysis, the smokers and nonsmokers were compared according to BMD, frequency of low bone mass defined as BMD T-score <-1 at either LS or FN, and the number of bone fractures. SPSS software version 18 was used for analysis. Results: A total of 203 smokers with mean smoking duration of 21.67 +/- 17.7 years and the mean number of 36.4 + 15.8 cigarettes per day were compared with 408 nonsmokers. The mean BMD values in LS (0.90 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.19) and FN section (0.87 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.15) and also the frequency of bone fractures were significantly lower, and the frequency of low bone mass at either LS and FN was significantly higher in smokers (P = 0.014, 0.038, 0.003, and 0.004, respectively). In multiple logistic regression analysis, smoking was independently associated with low bone mass by odds ratio of = 2.27 (95% confidence interval: 1.49-3.44). Conclusions: These findings indicate a significant association between low bone mass and bone fracture at either LS or FN in the elderly male smokers.",International journal of preventive medicine,2018,Iran,2018,10
21619689,Applying psychological theories to evidence-based clinical practice: identifying factors predictive of lumbar spine x-ray for low back pain in UK primary care practice.,"BACKGROUND: Psychological models predict behaviour in a wide range of settings. The aim of this study was to explore the usefulness of a range of psychological models to predict the health professional behaviour 'referral for lumbar spine x-ray in patients presenting with low back pain' by UK primary care physicians. METHODS: Psychological measures were collected by postal questionnaire survey from a random sample of primary care physicians in Scotland and north England. The outcome measures were clinical behaviour (referral rates for lumbar spine x-rays), behavioural simulation (lumbar spine x-ray referral decisions based upon scenarios), and behavioural intention (general intention to refer for lumbar spine x-rays in patients with low back pain). Explanatory variables were the constructs within the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CS-SRM), Operant Learning Theory (OLT), Implementation Intention (II), Weinstein's Stage Model termed the Precaution Adoption Process (PAP), and knowledge. For each of the outcome measures, a generalised linear model was used to examine the predictive value of each theory individually. Linear regression was used for the intention and simulation outcomes, and negative binomial regression was used for the behaviour outcome. Following this 'theory level' analysis, a 'cross-theoretical construct' analysis was conducted to investigate the combined predictive value of all individual constructs across theories. RESULTS: Constructs from TPB, SCT, CS-SRM, and OLT predicted behaviour; however, the theoretical models did not fit the data well. When predicting behavioural simulation, the proportion of variance explained by individual theories was TPB 11.6%, SCT 12.1%, OLT 8.1%, and II 1.5% of the variance, and in the cross-theory analysis constructs from TPB, CS-SRM and II explained 16.5% of the variance in simulated behaviours. When predicting intention, the proportion of variance explained by individual theories was TPB 25.0%, SCT 21.5%, CS-SRM 11.3%, OLT 26.3%, PAP 2.6%, and knowledge 2.3%, and in the cross-theory analysis constructs from TPB, SCT, CS-SRM, and OLT explained 33.5% variance in intention. Together these results suggest that physicians' beliefs about consequences and beliefs about capabilities are likely determinants of lumbar spine x-ray referrals. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence that taking a theory-based approach enables the creation of a replicable methodology for identifying factors that predict clinical behaviour. However, a number of conceptual and methodological challenges remain.",Implementation science : IS,2011 May 28,England,2011,10
28076535,[Femicides in ethnic and racialized groups: syntheses].,"The text entitled ""Femicides in ethnic and racialized groups: syntheses"" presents some of the discussions that took place during a seminar on this topic in Buenaventura. Buenaventura is the main Colombian port on the Pacific, a region rich in minerals and a corridor for the movement of goods, which makes it a strategic territory and a center for disputes. At the seminar, the social and political determinants of femicide were discussed, understanding it as a tactic of waging war against women. The forum provided a space for academic discussion, but also for grievances over inter-personal violence, the manifestation of feelings and the elaboration of pain and grief through the medium of art. We believe that the dissemination of this experience to the Brazilian public, in a country with ethnic, social and racial vulnerability similar to that in Colombia, will be of value to social and health workers. The scope of this paper is therefore to provide the opinion of its authors on the determinants of femicides and on actions to tackle them, in addition to a synthesis of the discussions and debates that permeated the event.",Ciencia & saude coletiva,2017 Jan,Brazil,2017,10
25924692,"A multinomial model for comorbidity in England of long-standing cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity.","Comorbidity has been found to be significantly related to increased levels of mortality, decreased functional status and quality of life, increasing dependence on health services and an increased risk of mental and social problems. Previous research into comorbidity has mainly focused on identifying the most common groupings of illnesses found among elderly healthcare users. In contrast, this paper pools data from the Health Survey for England from 2008 to 2012 to form a representative sample of individuals in private households in England to explore the risk of comorbidity among the general population; and to take account of not only the demographic but also the socioeconomic and area-level determinants of comorbidity. Using a multinomial logistic model, this research confirms that age and gender are significant predictors of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity, whether examined singly or in any comorbidity combination. Across the seven possible disease combinations, the odds ratios are lowest for those individuals with a high income (6 of 7), home-owning (5 of 7), degree educated (7 of 7) and living in the least deprived area (6 of 7), when controlling for demographic and smoking characteristics. The important influence of socioeconomic factors associated with comorbidity risk indicates that healthcare policy needs to move from a focus on age profiles to take better account of individual and local area socioeconomic circumstances.",Health & social care in the community,2016 Nov,England,2016,10

METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted on 96 newlywed women presenting to health centers in Zanjan, Iran, in 2016. The participants were assigned to an intervention and a control group using randomized blocking. The intervention group received six 90-minute sessions of sexual counseling based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory held once every week over six weeks. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire were completed by the participants before and eight weeks after the intervention. The ANCOVA and independent t-test were used for data analysis. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of sexual function (p=0.169) and sexual satisfaction (p=0.190) scores before the intervention. Eight weeks after the intervention and after adjusting for the baseline scores, the ANCOVA showed that the sexual function score was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (mean difference=1.8; 95% Confidence Interval=0.2 to 3.4; p=0.021); however, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of sexual satisfaction (5.6; -0.1 to 11.4; p=0.058). CONCLUSION: The results suggest the positive effects of sexual counseling on sexual function but not on sexual satisfaction, which may be due to the duration of the follow-ups and the limited number of the counseling sessions held.",Applied nursing research : ANR,2018 Aug,United States,2018,10

This qualitative rapid assessment study was undertaken to explore community perceptions and experiences related to health, health inequality and other MNCH themes. METHODS: We conducted 12 focus group discussions and 24 in-depth interviews with community stakeholder groups (female and male community members, Health Extension Workers, members of the Women Development Army and Male Development Army, and religious leaders) across six rural sites in Jimma Zone. Data were analyzed through thematic coding and the preparation of content summaries by theme. RESULTS: Participants described being healthy as being disease free, being able to perform daily activities and being able to pursue broad aspirations. Health inequalities were viewed as community issues, primarily emanating from a lack of knowledge or social exclusion. Poverty was raised as a possible contributor to poor health, however, participants felt this could be overcome through community-level responses. Participants described formal and informal mechanisms for supporting the disadvantaged, which served as a type of safety net, providing information as well as emotional, financial and social support. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding community perceptions of health and health inequality can serve as an evidence base for community-level initiatives, including MNCH promotion. The findings of this study enable the development of audience-centered MNCH promotion activities that closely align with community priorities and experiences. This research demonstrates the application of rapid qualitative assessment methods to explore the context for MNCH promotion activities.",International journal for equity in health,2018 Jun 18,England,2018,10

25518855,"Prevalence, distribution, and social determinants of tobacco use in 30 sub-Saharan African countries.","BACKGROUND: Although the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control prioritizes monitoring of tobacco use by population-based surveys, information about the prevalence and patterns of tobacco use in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. We provide country-level prevalence estimates for smoking and smokeless tobacco (SLT) use and assess their social determinants. METHODS: We analyzed population-based data of the most recent Demographic Health Surveys performed between 2006 and 2013 involving men and women in 30 sub-Saharan African countries. Weighted country-level prevalence rates were estimated for 'current smoking' (cigarettes, pipe, cigars, etc.) and 'current SLT use' (chewing, snuff, etc.). From the pooled datasets for men and women, social determinants of smoking and SLT use were assessed through multivariate analyses using a dummy country variable as a control and by including a within-country sample weight for each country. RESULTS: Among men, smoking prevalence rates were high in Sierra Leone (37.7%), Lesotho (34.1%), and Madagascar (28.5%); low (<10%) in Ethiopia, Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, and Sao Tome & Principe; the prevalence of SLT use was <10% in all countries except for Madagascar (24.7%) and Mozambique (10.9%). Among women, smoking and SLT prevalence rates were <5% in most countries except for Burundi (9.9%), Sierra Leone (6%), and Namibia (5.9%) (smoking), and Madagascar (19.6%) and Lesotho (9.1%) (SLT use). The proportion of females who smoked was lower than SLT users in most countries. Older age was strongly associated with both smoking and SLT use among men and women. Smoking among both men and women was weakly associated, but SLT use was strongly associated, with education. Similarly, smoking among men and women was weakly associated, but SLT use was strongly associated, with the wealth index. Smoking and SLT use were also associated with marital status among both men and women, as well as with occupation (agriculturists and unskilled workers). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of smoking among women was much lower than in men, although the social patterns of tobacco use were similar to those in men. Tobacco control strategies should target the poor, not/least educated, and agricultural and unskilled workers, who are the most vulnerable social groups in sub-Saharan Africa.",BMC medicine,2014 Dec 18,England,2014,10

A better understanding of the multifaceted predictive factors of attrition is needed to inform targeted interventions to promote program progression and maintain an adequate nursing workforce. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify demographic, academic, and social determinant factors associated with attrition at the end of the first semester in an upper-division baccalaureate nursing program. METHOD: Students' demographic and academic data from an administrative database were combined with social determinants data collected via a web-based survey. RESULTS: Among this cohort (n=164), social determinants were significantly associated with attrition. A significantly greater percentage of students who failed were born outside the United States (U.S.), had one or both parents born outside the U.S., reported English was not the primary language spoken in the home, and were racially/ethnically diverse. CONCLUSIONS: Attrition was primarily among students with diverse racial, ethnic, and/or cultural backgrounds, which has implications for achieving a diverse nursing workforce. Proactive strategies to support success should be especially targeted on diverse students.",Journal of professional nursing : official journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing,2018 Sep - Oct,United States,2018,10
30800989,Social Determinants of Health Curriculum Integrated Into a Core Emergency Medicine Clerkship.,"Introduction: Demand that health centers address health inequities has led medical schools to emphasize social determinants of health (SDH). The Emergency Department often serves as first (or sole) point of health care access, making it an ideal environment in which to identify/explore SDH. Yet there are few SDH curricula targeting core emergency medicine (EM) clerkships. We describe implementation and outcomes of a three-part SDH curriculum instituted in a 4-week EM clerkship. Methods: We created a longitudinal curriculum aimed at fourth-year medical students in their EM clerkship. Students interviewed patients to discuss social and other influences on their health care and wrote reflections. After this, they discussed their individual cases in small groups, selected one patient, and found literature and strategies/systems to fit the patient's needs. Finally, groups presented their work to student-peers and faculty for discussion. Students were assessed for each activity and surveyed for impact of the curriculum. Results: We evaluated the curriculum, with preliminary data showing a wide range of topics covered. On a 5-point scale (1 = Hardly at All, 5 = To a Very High Degree), students responded with means of 4.4 to ""I am able to recognize barriers to health that patients and families face from diverse socio-economic backgrounds"" and 4.6 to ""I feel it is important to recognize and address the social determinants of health as part of whole patient care."" Discussion: This curriculum introduces SDH, uses metacognitive skills across multiple domains, and is feasible and has been well received in an EM clerkship.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2019 Jan 4,United States,2019,10

25064475,Service quality assessment of a referral hospital in southern Iran with SERVQUAL technique: patients' perspective.,"BACKGROUND: Providing services to patients according to their expectations and needs is necessary for the success of an organization in order to remain in the competitive market. Recognizing these needs and expectations is an important step in offering high quality services. This study was designed to determine the service quality gap of the main hospital of Hormozgan province. METHODS: This cross sectional study was conducted in 2013 in Bandar Abbas ShahidMohammadi Hospital in the south of Iran. All 96 participants of this study were provided by SERVQUAL questionnaire. Data was analyzed by Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: Service quality gaps were seen in all five service quality dimensions and the overall quality of service. The mean of quality perception score and quality expectation score was 3.44 +/- 0.693 and 4.736 +/- 0.34, respectively. The highest perception was in assurance dimension and the highest expectation was in Responsiveness and assurance dimensions. Also, the lowest perception was in responsiveness dimension and the lowest expectation was about empathy. In this study, 56.1% of participants defined the quality of services as average. CONCLUSION: According to the results, this hospital was not able to meet patients' expectations completely. Therefore, action must be taken to decrease the gap between the perception and expectation of the patients.",BMC health services research,2014 Jul 27,England,2014,10
22573725,Understanding smokers' motivations to use evidence-based smoking cessation aids.,"INTRODUCTION: Use of evidence-based smoking cessation aids (SCA) is an efficacious way to improve smoking cessation relapse rates. However, use of SCA in the Netherlands is particularly low. This study examined determinants of intention to use SCA in smokers willing to quit. METHODS: The Dutch Continuous Survey of Smoking Habits, a cross-sectional population survey, was used. Respondents were smokers (n = 594) wanting to quit sometime in the future and who made at least one quit attempt in the past, categorized as past users of evidence-based SCA, past users of nonevidence-based SCA, and smokers who had never used SCA before (nonusers). Respondents were asked about past SCA use, motivational determinants regarding smoking cessation and SCA use, and intention to use SCA during a future quit attempt. RESULTS: Older and more addicted smokers were more likely to have used evidence-based SCA. Evidence-based and nonevidence-based users reported stronger attitudes and perceived social norm as well as lower self-efficacy expectations regarding smoking cessation and SCA use than nonusers. Having positive outcome expectations and perceived social norm regarding SCA use were strong predictors of intention to use SCA. Self-efficacy regarding smoking cessation was negatively related with intention to use SCA. CONCLUSIONS: Nonusers, nonevidence-based users, and evidence-based users have different motivations for using evidence-based SCA and should not be treated as a homogenous group in smoking cessation programs. Additionally, it is unclear whether nonusers should be encouraged to use SCA, given that this group is less addicted and more confident about quitting.",Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,2013 Jan,England,2013,10
20529346,The impact of health system governance and policy processes on health services in Iraqi Kurdistan.,"BACKGROUND: Relative to the amount of global attention and media coverage since the first and second Gulf Wars, very little has been published in the health services research literature regarding the state of health services in Iraq, and particularly on the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan. Building on findings from a field visit, this paper describes the state of health services in Kurdistan, analyzes their underlying governance structures and policy processes, and their overall impact on the quality, accessibility and cost of the health system, while stressing the importance of reinvesting in public health and community-based primary care. DISCUSSION: Very little validated, research-based data exists relating to the state of population health and health services in Kurdistan. What little evidence exists, points to a region experiencing an epidemiological polarization, with different segments of the population experiencing rapidly-diverging rates of morbidity and mortality related to different etiological patterns of communicable, non-communicable, acute and chronic illness and disease. Simply put, the rural poor suffer from malnutrition and cholera, while the urban middle and upper classes deal with issues of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The inequity is exacerbated by a poorly governed, fragmented, unregulated, specialized and heavily privatized system, that not only leads to poor quality of care and catastrophic health expenditures, but also threatens the economic and political stability of the region. There is an urgent need to revisit and clearly define the core values and goals of a future health system, and to develop an inclusive governance and policy framework for change, towards a more equitable and effective primary care-based health system, with attention to broader social determinants of health and salutogenesis. SUMMARY: This paper not only frames the situation in Kurdistan in terms of a human rights or special political issue of a minority population, but provides important generalizable lessons for other constituencies, highlighting the need for political action before effective public health policies can be implemented - as embodied by Rudolf Virchow, the father of European public health and pathology, in his famous quote ""politics is nothing but medicine at a larger scale"".",BMC international health and human rights,2010 Jun 8,England,2010,10
26432012,Missouri K-12 school disaster and biological event preparedness and seasonal influenza vaccination among school nurses.,"BACKGROUND: School preparedness for bioevents, such as emerging infectious diseases, bioterrorism, and pandemics, is imperative, but historically has been low. METHODS: The Missouri Association of School Nurses members were sent an online survey during the 2013-2014 school year to assess current bioevent readiness. There were 15 and 35 indicators of school disaster and bioevent preparedness, respectively. Multivariate linear regressions were conducted to delineate factors associated with higher school disaster and bioevent preparedness scores. RESULTS: In total, 133 school nurses participated, with a 33.6% response rate. On average, schools had fewer than half of the disaster or bioevent indicators. Disaster and bioevent preparedness scores ranged from 1-12.5 (mean, 6.0) and 5-25 (mean, 13.8), respectively. The least frequently reported plan components included bioterrorism-specific psychological needs addressed (1.5%, n = 2), having a foodservice biosecurity plan (8.3%, n = 11), and having a liberal sick leave policy for bioevents (22.6%, n = 30). Determinants of better bioevent preparedness include perception that the school is well prepared for a pandemic (P = .001) or natural disaster (P < .05), nurse being on the disaster planning committee (P = .001), and school being a closed point of dispensing (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Schools are underprepared for biological events and are not on track to meet state and national biological preparedness goals.",American journal of infection control,2015 Oct 1,United States,2015,10
24444062,"Application of spatio-temporal model to estimate burden of diseases, injuries and risk factors in Iran 1990 - 2013.","BACKGROUND: Identifying the burden of disease and its inequality between geographical regions is an important issue to study health priorities. Estimating burden of diseases using statistical models is inevitable especially in the context of rare data availability. To this purpose, the spatio-temporal model can provide a statistically sound approach for explaining the response variable observed over a region and various times. However, there are some methodological challenges in analysis of these complex data. Our primary objective is to provide some remedies to overcome these challenges. METHOD: Data from nationally representative surveys and systematic reviews have been gathered across contiguous areal units over a period of more than 20 years (1990 - 2013). Generally, observations of areal units are spatially and temporally correlated in such a way that observations closer in space and time tend to be more correlated than observations farther away. It is critical to determine the correlation structure in space-time process which has been observed over a set of irregular regions. Moreover, these data sets are subject to high percentage of missing, including misaligned areal units, areas with small sample size, and may have nonlinear trends over space and time. Furthermore, the Gaussian assumption might be overly restrictive to represent the data. In this setting, the traditional statistical techniques are not appropriate and more flexible and comprehensive methodology is required. Particularly, we focus on approaches that allow extending spatio-temporal models proposed previously in the literature.Since statistical models include both continuous and categorical outcomes, we assume a latent variable framework for describing the underlying structure in mixed outcomes and use a conditionally autoregressive (CAR) prior for the random effects. In addition, we will employ misalignment modeling to combine incompatible areal units between data sources and/or over the years to obtain a unified clear picture of population health status over this period. In order to take parameter uncertainties into account, we pursue a Bayesian sampling-based inference. Hence, a hierarchical Bayes approach is constructed to model the data. The hierarchical structure enables us to ""borrow information"" from neighboring areal units to improve estimates for areas with missing values and small number of observations. For their general applicability and ease of implementation, the MCMC methods are the most adapted tool to perform Bayesian inference. CONCLUSION: This study aims to combine different available data sources and produce precise and reliable evidences for Iranian burden of diseases and risk factors and their disparities among geographical regions over time. Providing appropriate statistical methods and models for analyzing the data is undoubtedly crucial to circumvent the problems and obtain satisfactory estimates of model parameters and reach accurate assessment.",Archives of Iranian medicine,2014 Jan,Iran,2014,10

Ranging from sexual inequality and underdevelopment to homophobia impeding health care access for men who have sex with men, imbalanced resource allocations, and social biases have potentiated the spread of the epidemic. However, recognition of culturally specific aspects of each microepidemic has yielded development of community-based organizations, which have resulted in locally effective responses to AIDS. This effective approach to HIV prevention, care, and treatment is illustrated through examples of community-based responses in Haiti, the United States, Africa, and other impoverished settings.",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),2012 Aug 1,United States,2012,10
30700062,A General Pathway Model for Improving Health Disparities: Lessons from Community and Cultural Involvement in Improving Cervical Cancer Screening in Vietnamese Women.,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic diseases have become dominant in the global health landscape. Despite remarkable advances in basic science, pharmacology, surgery, and technology, progress in lifestyle improvements, now considered essential, has been disappointing. Patient adherence to medications and other instructions play the greatest role in individual outcome shortfalls. Classically medicine has approached management using a high-risk model, targeting clinical manifestations of disease with progressively intensive therapies, in contrast with population-based models. In an effort to identify effectiveness among the many models available, the ""pathways model"" is reevaluated. METHODS: Relying upon secondary data from prior studies in which Papanicolaou (Pap) test utilization was successfully improved, a ""pathway model"" is qualitatively reexamined in which characteristics of patients, providers, and the health system-as impacted by culture, beliefs, values, and habits-are acknowledged and incorporated by community resources into treatment plans. In so doing, health disparities are also addressed. OBSERVATIONS: The culturally inclusive pathways model using immersion community-based participation was successful in modifying behaviors when applied to a high-risk population in great need of improving Pap test adherence. CONCLUSIONS: In populations characterized by recognized cultural barriers contributing to low adherence, the pathways model may improve chronic disease outcomes. This model emphasizes a high degree of immersion within a culture and community as vehicles to improve patient behavior and address inequities. Central features are concordant with current concepts in guidelines, scientific statements, manuals, and advisories concerning the conduct of community-based research and social determinants of health. The pathways model deserves consideration for use in other chronic illnesses, such as cardiometabolic disease.",Journal of clinical medicine,2019 Jan 29,Switzerland,2019,10

In this context, the increased risks of chronic diseases of specific sub-groups of vulnerable populations should be further investigated. The objective of this qualitative study is to examine the interaction between socioeconomic status (SES) and body weight in order to understand underprivileged women's increased vulnerability to chronic diseases after menopause. By drawing specifically on Pierre Bourdieu's sociocultural theory of practice, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted from May to December of 2013 to investigate the health practices of clinically overweight, postmenopausal women living an underprivileged life in Canada. Findings emphasise that poor life conditions undermine personal investment in preventive health and weight loss, showing the importance for policy makers to bring stronger consideration on upstream determinants of health.",Sociology of health & illness,2017 Nov,England,2017,10
28804065,The Importance of Recognizing Social Vulnerability in Patients during Clinical Practice.,"Enrolled patients at the free clinic in Dunedin, New Zealand were not just financially poor, but also vulnerable. Large social inequalities are present in the United States and New Zealand. The literature on vulnerability originates predominantly from sociology and public health. This commentary discusses the concept of vulnerability within clinical practice, and makes a case for the improved recognition of patient vulnerability. Vulnerability arises from an individual's susceptibility to harm and their exposure to risks and negative events. Biographical factors commonly regarded as social vulnerability characteristics such as homelessness, teenage parenthood, and childhood abuse do not necessarily lead to negative health and other outcomes because of a direct, causal effect, but because they are indicative of more upstream adversities. Health professionals should address vulnerability not just during clinical encounters, but also at an institutional and policy level.",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,2017,United States,2017,10
30226003,Associations of Maternal Diabetes During Pregnancy with Overweight in Offspring: Results from the Prospective TEDDY Study.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the relationship between different forms of, and potential pathways between, maternal diabetes and childhood obesity at different ages. METHODS: Prospective cohort data from The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, which was composed of 5,324 children examined from 0.25 to 6 years of age, were analyzed. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses taking into account potential confounders and effect modifiers such as maternal prepregnancy BMI and birth weight z scores were performed. RESULTS: Offspring of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) showed a higher BMI standard deviation score and increased risk for overweight and obesity at 5.5 years of age than offspring of mothers without diabetes. While these associations could be substantially explained by maternal prepregnancy BMI in offspring of mothers with GDM, significant associations disappeared after adjustment for birth weight z scores in offspring of T1DM mothers. Furthermore, overweight risk became stronger with increasing age in offspring of mothers with diabetes compared with offspring of mothers without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal diabetes is associated with increased risk of offspring overweight, and the association appears to get stronger as children grow older. Indeed, intrauterine exposure to maternal T1DM may predispose children to later obesity through increased birth weight, while maternal BMI is more important in children exposed to GDM.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",2018 Sep,United States,2018,10
27531436,[The use of psychoactive substances among street teenagers in Ouagadougou].,"Objectives: To study the determinants of psychoactive substance use among street teenagers living in Ouagadougou.Methods: Qualitative and quantitative cross-sectional study with street teenagers living on the Zogona campus in Ouagadougou, in September 2012. A focus group was then formed with eight members of the group.Results: The median age was 16 years (range: 12 to 20 years). The various psychotropic agents were tobacco, alcohol, gasoline, glue sniffing and cannabis. Seventeen of the 31 teenagers had already been admitted to a rehabilitation centre and none of them attended school at the time of data collection. However, 12 street teenagers had previously attended school. The main reasons for the presence of these teenagers in the street were ""poverty in the family"", ""death of the parents"", ""Koranic school"". The main reasons reported by the teenagers for substance use were ""to give oneself courage"", ""to relieve hunger"", ""to be like the others"", ""to be accepted by the group"", ""to protect oneself from the cold"". The main determinants of substance abuse were social exclusion, group membership, and group identification.Conclusion: Psychoactive substance use is an integral part of the life of street teenagers and is a major obstacle to social integration.","Sante publique (Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France)",2016 May-Jun,France,2016,10
28747180,Self-reported oral and general health in relation to socioeconomic position.,"BACKGROUND: During the past two decades, several scientific publications from different countries have shown how oral health in the population varies with social determinants. The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between self-reported oral and general health in relation to different measures of socioeconomic position. METHODS: Data were collected from a randomly selected sample of the adult population in Sweden (n = 3500, mean age 53.4 years, 53.1% women). The response rate was 49.7%. Subjects were interviewed by telephone, using a questionnaire including items on self-reported oral and general health, socioeconomic position and lifestyle. RESULTS: A significant gradient was found for both oral and general health: the lower the socioeconomic position, the poorer the health. Socioeconomic position and, above all, economic measures were strongly associated with general health (OR 3.95) and with oral health (OR 1.76) if having an income below SEK 200,000 per year. Similar results were found in multivariate analyses controlling for age, gender and lifestyle variables. CONCLUSIONS: For adults, there are clear socioeconomic gradients in self-reported oral and general health, irrespective of different socioeconomic measures.

Thus, we measured patterns and determinants of CAM use among a representative sample of the general population in the Czech Republic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. A sex-, age- and region-stratified sample of citizens aged 15 and older were randomly selected from voter registration lists (n = 8,639,375). RESULTS: Overall, 76.0% (n = 1,365) of the respondents reported use of one or more CAM modalities during the past 30 days. The top five CAM modalities used were vitamins/minerals (54.6%), herbal remedies (47.8%), massage (19.9%), relaxation techniques (9.5%), and dietary supplements excluding vitamins/minerals (9.2%). Prevention (82.0%) was the primary reason for CAM use. Only 15.9% of CAM users employed it for therapeutic purposes. The most commonly treated ailments were respiratory (35.0%) and musculoskeletal (33.6%) disorders. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CAM use in the Czech Republic is high, especially among people who apply CAM for self-treatment prior to seeing a doctor. Half of the study population combined CAM with conventional medical treatment, which may result in potential harm to the patient.

In this paper the authors describe socio-cultural factors affecting intimate partner violence against pregnant women in suburban Hamadan.The PEN-3 model was utilized by semi-structured interviews with 18 pregnant women. According to women, cultural perceptions (patience in case of facing violence, faith in fate and normalization of violence), enablers (communication skills, economic status, and availability of legal support), and nurturers (family support and social expectation of obedience to men) were found to be important factors that influence violence.A better understanding of the cultural perceptions can help decision-makers in identifying the cultural appropriateness of interventions.",Health care for women international,2019 Nov,England,2019,10
22729242,The influence of migratory background and parental education on health care utilisation of children.,"UNLABELLED: School-entry screening data from North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany from 2007 were used to investigate child health care utilisation. We focussed on the influence of migratory background and parental education on children's (1) participation in regularly scheduled early recognition examinations, (2) immunisation uptake and (3) referrals due to a school-entry screen-detected complaint. The study sample consisted of 52,171 children out of 17 NRW districts. Bivariable, stratified and multivariable analyses were performed to identify relevant associations between social determinants and health care utilisation outcome parameters. Multivariable logistic regression showed that children belonging to families with a migratory background or low parental education were more likely to have an incomplete documentation of early recognition examinations and to be referred due to a new diagnosis. Children with migratory background were more likely to be sufficiently immunised than children with parents of German ethnicity. For all studied health care utilisation outcomes, kindergarten visit had a supportive effect. CONCLUSION: In general, the results of our regional study were in line with the results from national population-based studies. Additionally, a larger likelihood of referrals due to school-screen-detected deficits in children with migratory background or low parental education was detected.",European journal of pediatrics,2012 Oct,Germany,2012,10

Data were obtained from 833 young adults, selected using stratified random sampling in a South African university in 2018. Adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression models were employed to examine determinants of HIV testing uptake. The majority of students (69.9%) had previously tested for HIV, but only 58.4% tested for HIV in the last year. Being highly concerned about contracting HIV/STIs was positively associated with having tested for HIV (adjusted OR [AOR]: 4.28; CI: 2.50 to 7.34) and getting an HIV test in the past year (AOR: 1.83; CI: 1.20 to 2.80). Knowing one's partner's status was associated with a higher probability of ever having been tested for HIV (AOR: 3.07; CI: 1.89 to 4.97) or having received an HIV test in the previous year (AOR: 2.66; CI: 1.77 to 3.99). Discussion of HIV/STIs was associated with higher odds of having ever been tested for HIV (AOR: 3.81; CI: 2.44 to 5.96) and recent HIV testing (AOR: 3.22; CI: 2.17 to 4.77). HIV testing was below the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS UNAIDS 90-90-90 target.

Gender-based violence (GBV) and lack of economic opportunity are important structural determinants of HIV risk. We piloted a microfinance and health promotion intervention among social networks of primarily young men in Dar es Salaam. Twenty-two individuals participated in the microfinance component and 30 peer leaders were recruited and trained in the peer health leadership component. We collected and analysed observational data from trainings, monitoring data on loan repayment, and reports of peer conversations to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Eighteen of the loan recipients (82%) paid back their loans, and of these 15 (83%) received a second, larger loan. Among the loan defaulters, one died, one had chronic health problems, and two disappeared, one of whom was imprisoned for theft. The majority of conversations reported by peer health leaders focused on condoms, sexual partner selection, and HIV testing. Few peer leaders reported conversations about GBV. We demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of this innovative HIV and GBV prevention intervention. The lessons learned from this pilot have informed the implementation of a cluster-randomised trial of the microfinance and peer health leadership intervention.",Global public health,2016 Dec,England,2016,10
26450127,Predictors of Condom Use Among Iranian Women at Risk of HIV.,"Sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS is increasing in Iran and is the main route of infection among women. In order to foster the development of future HIV prevention interventions for women, researchers need to understand the factors that influence sexual risk reduction behaviors in this group. The aim of this study was to explore the predictors of condom use among women at risk of HIV and develop a model of condom use in a sample of women at risk of HIV. We cross-sectionally examined predictors of condom use among 200 women at risk of HIV. Women were recruited from drop-in centers and voluntary counseling and testing centers in Tehran. Condom use among women at risk of HIV was examined using path analysis, and fit indices showed a good fit for the model. Condom use self-efficacy, social support, and less stereotypic gender roles influenced sexually protective behaviors of women at risk of HIV. Our results can provide a basis for future gender-specific intervention programs among women at risk of HIV. Researchers, practitioners, and organizations that play a central role in protecting the health of this population can make use of these results for the benefit of sexual and reproductive health programs.",Archives of sexual behavior,2016 Feb,United States,2016,10
30080487,Examining macroeconomic determinants of trust in parliament: A dynamic multilevel framework.,"The extensive literature on political trust has long suggested a link between macroeconomic conditions and public trust in political institutions. However, empirical evidence regarding this relationship remains ambiguous. Conflicting results appear to be related to differences in research design: while cross-sectional studies tend not to find evidence of a link between macroeconomic variables and trust in political institutions, most longitudinal studies do. In this paper, using recent advances in multilevel methodology, we examine both cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of macroeconomic variables on trust in national parliament within a single dynamic multilevel framework. By analyzing all seven waves of the European Social Survey (2002-2014), we demonstrate that declining macroeconomic performance has a negative within-country effect on trust in national parliament. At the same time, we find limited evidence in support of this association at the between-country level. This discrepancy suggests the presence of confounding factors that are unaccounted for in cross-sectional designs. We therefore argue for the importance of examining within-country effects as they provide a more stringent test of causality.",Social science research,2018 Sep,United States,2018,10
31673349,Drivers of the progress achieved by Peru in reducing childhood diarrhoea mortality: a country case study.,"Background: Childhood diarrhoea mortality has declined substantially in Peru in recent decades. We documented trends in childhood diarrhoea mortality from 1980 to 2015, along with trends in coverage of diarrhoea-related interventions and risk factors, to identify the main drivers of mortality reduction. Methods: We conducted desk reviews on social determinants, policies and programmes, and diarrhoea-related interventions implemented during the study period. We reviewed different datasets on child mortality, and on coverage of diarrhoea-related interventions. We received input from individuals familiar with implementation of diarrhoea-related policies and programmes. We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to help explain the reasons for the decline in diarrhoea mortality from 1980 to 2015 and to predict additional reduction with further scale up of diarrhoea-related interventions by 2030. Results: In Peru under-five diarrhoea mortality declined from 23.3 in 1980 to 0.8 per 1000 livebirths in 2015. The percentage of under-five diarrhoea deaths as related to total under-five deaths was reduced from 17.8% in 1980 to 4.9% in 2015. Gross domestic product increased and poverty declined from 1990 to 2015. Access to improved water increased from 56% in 1986 to 79.3% in 2015. Oral rehydrating salts (ORS) use during an episode of diarrhoea increased from 3.6% in 1986 to 32% in 2015. Vertical programmes focused on diarrhoea management with ORS were implemented successfully in the 1980s and 1990s, and were replaced by integrated crosscutting interventions since the early 2000s. LiST analyses showed that about half (53.9%) of the reduction in diarrhoea mortality could be attributed to improved water, sanitation and hygiene, 25.0% to direct diarrhoea interventions and 21.1% to nutrition. The remaining mortality could be reduced by three-quarters by 2030 with improved diarrhoea treatment and further with enhanced breastfeeding practices and reduction in stunting. LiST does not take into account the role of social determinants. Conclusions: The reduction of diarrhoeal under-five mortality in Peru can be explained by a combination of factors, including improvement of social determinants, child nutrition, diarrhoea treatment with ORS and prevention with rotavirus vaccine and increased access to water and sanitation. The already low rate of diarrhoea mortality could be further reduced by a number of interventions, especially additional use of ORS and zinc for diarrhoea treatment. Peru is a remarkable example of a country that was able to reduce childhood diarrhoea mortality by implementing interventions through vertical programmes initially, and afterwards through implementation of integrated multisectoral packages targeting prevalent illnesses and multi-causal problems like stunting.",Journal of global health,2019 Dec,Scotland,2019,10
23845204,"Neighborhood environments, mobility, and health: towards a new generation of studies in environmental health research.","While public policies seek to promote active transportation, there is a lack of information on the social and environmental factors associated with the adoption of active transportation modes. Moreover, despite the consensus on the importance of identifying obesogenic environmental factors, most published studies only take into account residential neighborhoods in the definition of exposures. There are at least three major reasons for incorporating daily mobility in public health research: (i) to identify specific population groups, including socially disadvantaged populations, who experience mobility or spatial accessibility deficits; (ii) to study the environmental determinants of transportation habits and investigate the complex relationships between transportation (as a source of physical activity, pollutants, and accidents) and physical activity and health; and (iii) to improve the assessment of spatial accessibility to resources and exposure to environmental hazards by accounting for daily trajectories for a better understanding of their health effects. There is urgent need to develop novel methods to better assess daily mobility. The RECORD Study relies on (i) an electronic survey of regular mobility to assess the chronic exposure to environmental conditions over a relatively long period, and (ii) Global Positioning System tracking to evaluate precisely acute environmental exposures over a much shorter period. The present article argues that future research should combine these two approaches. Gathering scientific evidence on the relationships between the environments, mobility/transportation, and health should allow public health and urban planning decision makers to better take into account the individual and environmental barriers to the adoption of active transportation and to define innovative intervention strategies addressing obesogenic environments to reduce disparities in excess weight.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,2013 Aug,France,2013,10
30343739,Exploring waste prevention behaviour through empirical research.,"Waste prevention is currently a critical issue, and our research aims to provide a more nuanced view by examining the determinants of individual behaviour when deciding to either purchase a certain item or to extend the life of an owned item through repair or reuse activities. Our research has two main aims: (1) to examine the importance that being aware of consequences and personal norms have in shaping positive attitudes towards waste prevention behaviour; and (2) to explore the relationship between attitudes and perceived behavioural control on waste prevention by testing the mediation effects of perceived behavioural control and waste prevention behaviour. The research is based on 375 questionnaires collected in Pietra Ligure, a municipality located in Northwest Italy. Data were modelled using a structural equation model to test the hypotheses. The findings show that awareness of the consequences is a fundamental driver of waste prevention attitudes while personal norms are not. The findings also confirm a positive relationship between attitudes and perceived behavioural control. Finally, a positive significant relationship was found between perceived behavioural control and waste prevention behaviour, and between social norms and waste prevention behaviour. The results of our investigation are contextualised in theoretical, political and managerial frameworks and suggest several avenues for further research.","Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",2018 Sep,United States,2018,10

The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (WHO) is designed to qualify functional, social and environmental aspects of health. This survey aimed to reach a consensual description of adult oral health, derived from the ICF using international professional opinion. METHODS: The Global Oral Health Survey involved a two-round, online survey concerning factors related to oral health including functioning, participation and social environment. Four hundred eighty-six oral health professionals from 74 countries registered online. Professionals were pooled into 18 groups of six WHO world regions and three professional groups. In a randomised stratification process, eight professionals from each pool (n=144) completed the survey. The first round consisted of eight open-ended questions. Open expression replies were analysed for meaningful concepts and linked using established rules to the ICF. In Round 2, items were rated for their relevance to oral health (88% response rate). RESULTS: Eighty-nine ICF items and 30 other factors were considered relevant by at least 80% of participants. International professionals reached consensus on a holistic description of oral health, which could be qualified and quantified using the ICF. CONCLUSIONS: These results represent the first step towards developing an ICF Core Set in Oral Health, which would provide a practical tool for reporting outcome measures in clinical practice, for research and epidemiology, and for the improvement of interdisciplinary communication regarding oral health. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Professional consensus reached in this survey is the foundation stone for developing an ICF Core Set in Oral Health, allowing the holistic aspects of oral health to be qualified and quantified. This tool is necessary to widen our approach to clinical decision making, measurement of clinical outcomes, research and epidemiology.",Journal of dentistry,2015 Jun,England,2015,10
29947251,Racial/ethnic minority segregation and low birth weight in five North American cities.,"Comparisons of communities across cities are rare in social epidemiology. Our prior work exploring racial/ethnic segregation and the prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) in communities from two large urban cities showed a strong relationship in Chicago and a very weak relationship in Toronto. This study extends that work by examining the association between racial/ethnic minority segregation and LBW in total of 307 communities in five North American cities: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Toronto. We used Pearson correlation coefficients and OLS regression models to examine potential variability in the association between racial/ethnic minority segregation and LBW, controlling for community-level unemployment. In a combined model with community-level data from all cities, a 10% increase in minority composition is associated with a 0.7% increase in LBW. While racial/ethnic minority segregation and unemployment are not associated with LBW in Toronto, these social determinants have strong and significant associations with LBW across communities in the four US cities in the analysis. Subsequent models revealed opposite effects for percentage non-Hispanic Black and percentage Hispanic. Across communities in the US cities in this analysis, there is considerable similarity in the strength of the effect of racial/ethnic segregation on LBW.

28888348,Nursing Across the Lifespan: Implications of Lifecourse Theory for Nursing Research.,"Despite the lifecourse focus of nursing clinical care, nursing research largely remains cross-sectional or process-oriented within silos determined by patient characteristics such as age, acuity, or disease process. Incorporating interdisciplinary lifecourse theory into pediatric nursing research provides the opportunity to expand nursing theories and research beyond practice, age, and disease silos. One such theory is the Lifecourse Health Development (LCHD) framework. LCHD takes a more expansive view of health development from preconception through old age based on the premise that health is a consequence of transactions between genetic, biological, behavioral, social, and economic contexts that change as a child develops over time (Halfon & Hochstein, 2002). LCHD also explains how intergenerational influences and prevention during early life help predict health development and disease over the lifespan. The preventive and lifecourse focus of LCHD is well-aligned with the lifespan wellness foci of pediatric nurses. The purpose of this article is to introduce pediatric nurse researchers to LCHD and discuss proposed augmentations and implications related to expanding LCHD into pediatric nursing research.",Journal of pediatric health care : official publication of National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates & Practitioners,2018 Jan - Feb,United States,2018,10
19243678,Gender differences in determinants of weight-control behaviours among adolescents in Beirut.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between self-esteem, physical activity, engaging in risky behaviours, social and cultural capital, attitudes towards thinness, parental and personal characteristics with weight-control behaviours among adolescents in Beirut, Lebanon. DESIGN: A community-based cross-sectional study. A stratified cluster sampling design was used and information gathered by means of a questionnaire. Associations were investigated using multinomial logistic regression, accounting for the survey design. Odds ratios were calculated for trying to lose weight, or trying to gain weight, compared with no weight-control behaviour. SETTING: The study was conducted in three underprivileged urban areas of Beirut in 2003. SUBJECTS: The sample size was 1294 adolescents aged 13-19 years. RESULTS: Determinants of weight-control behaviour among girls included their attitudes towards thinness (OR(loss) = 4.29, OR(gain) = 0.38), dissatisfaction with weight (OR(loss) = 10.9, OR(gain) = 9.63), engaging in physical activity (OR(loss) = 2.22), smoking (OR(loss) approximately 3) and the mother working (OR(loss) = 2.77). Determinants of weight-control behaviour in boys included their attitudes towards thinness (OR(loss) = 14.7, OR(gain) = 0.35), dissatisfaction with weight (OR(loss) = 15.6, OR(gain) = 17.7), being involved in a cultural activity (OR(gain) = 2.51), engaging in a fight (OR(loss) = 5.25, OR(gain) = 1.64) and engaging in physical activity (OR(loss) = 2.56, OR(gain) = 2.17). CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes towards thinness, weight dissatisfaction and physical activity are common determinants for weight-control among boys and girls, although to varying degrees of influence. Self-esteem, social capital, cultural capital and parental characteristics were not significant predictors when accounting for the other variables.",Public health nutrition,2010 Jan,England,2010,10
25414952,A rural local health department-hospital collaborative for a countywide community health assessment.,"In mid-2012, the Polk County Health Department initiated a community health needs assessment process with the 3 medical centers serving this rural Wisconsin county of 45 000 residents. The collaborative process drew on primary and secondary data, including clinical data pooled from health care organizations, to assess population health. Community health assessment ultimately engaged more than 1800 county residents through coordinated surveys and community forums. Although the Polk County Health Department has a long history of collaboration with the local health care community, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, coupled with meaningful use requirements for health care providers, sharply increased engagement, contributed to shared priorities, and brought this relationship to a new level. Partners have now convened community-based workgroups around the top 3 health focus areas selected from the assessment process. Community health assessment emphasized the social determinants of health as a step toward a more ""upstream"" orientation to population health goals.",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,2015 Jan-Feb,United States,2015,10

24607705,"From a conservative to a liberal welfare state: decomposing changes in income-related health inequalities in Germany, 1994-2011.","Individual socio-economic status and the respective socio-economic and political contexts are both important determinants of health. Welfare regimes may be linked with health and health inequalities through two potential pathways: first, they may influence the associations between socio-economic status and health. Second, they may influence the income-related distributions of socio-economic determinants of health within a society. Using the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for the years 1994-2011, we analyze how income-related health inequalities evolved in the context of the transformation from a conservative to a liberal welfare system in Germany. We use the concentration index to measure health inequalities, and the annual concentration indices are decomposed to reveal how the contributions of the explanatory variables age, sex, income, education, and occupation changed over time. The changes in the contributions are further decomposed to distinguish whether changes in health inequalities stem from redistributions of the explanatory variables, from changes in their associations with health, or from changes in their means. Income-related health inequalities to the disadvantage of the economically deprived roughly doubled over time, which can largely be explained by changes in the contributions of individual characteristics representing weaker labor market positions, particularly income and unemployment. The social and labor market reforms coincide with the observed changes in the distributions of these characteristics and, to a lesser extent, with changes of their associations with health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2014 May,England,2014,10

Both behavior and social circumstance are closely linked to transportation. The connection between health and transportation is both direct (pedestrian injury, for example) and indirect (commuting access to work leading to employer-based health insurance, for example). Thus, transportation policy and health policy are interrelated.

28096222,First Infant Formula Type and Risk of Islet Autoimmunity in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) Study.,"OBJECTIVE: Studies on the introduction of infant formulas and its effect on the risk of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes (T1D) have yielded inconsistent results. We investigated whether the introduction of formula based on hydrolyzed cow's milk as the first formula is associated with reduced islet autoimmunity risk in a large prospective cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study prospectively monitors 8,676 children at increased genetic risk for T1D. Autoantibodies to insulin, GAD65, and IA2 were measured regularly to define islet autoimmunity. Information on formula feeding was collected by questionnaires at 3 months of age. RESULTS: In survival analyses, after adjustment for family history with T1D, HLA genotype, sex, country, delivery mode, breast-feeding >/=3 months, and seasonality of birth, we observed no significant association with islet autoimmunity in infants who received extensively hydrolyzed compared with nonhydrolyzed cow's milk-based formula as the first formula during the first 3 months (adjusted hazard ratio 1.38 [95% CI 0.95; 2.01]), and a significantly increased risk for extensively hydrolyzed formula introduced during the first 7 days (adjusted hazard ratio 1.57 [1.04; 2.38]). Using a partially hydrolyzed or other formula as the first formula, or no formula, was not associated with islet autoimmunity risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results add to the existing evidence that islet autoimmunity risk is not reduced, and may be increased, by using hydrolyzed compared with nonhydrolyzed cow's milk-based infant formula as the first formula in infants at increased genetic risk for T1D.",Diabetes care,2017 Mar,United States,2017,10
22105067,Depression over the adult life course for African American men: toward a framework for research and practice.,"Rarely are within-group differences among African American men explored in the context of mental health and well-being. Though current conceptual and empirical studies on depression among African American men exists, these studies do not offer a framework that considers how this disorder manifests over the adult life course for African American men. The purpose of this article is to examine the use of an adult life course perspective in understanding the complexity of depression for African American men. The proposed framework underscores six social determinants of depression (socioeconomic status, stressors, racial and masculine identity, kinship and social support, self-esteem and mastery, and access to quality health care) to initiate dialogue about the risk and protective factors that initiate, prolong, and exacerbate depression for African American men. The framework presented here is meant to stimulate discussion about the social determinants that influence depression for African American men to and through adulthood. Implications for the utility and applicability of the framework for researchers and health professionals who work with African American men are discussed.",American journal of men's health,2012 May,United States,2012,10
28687973,Effect of exercise therapy on quality of life of patients with multiple sclerosis in Iran: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and progressive disease charachterized by disabilities which adversely affect individuals' quality of life (QOL). In the present study, the effect size of exercise therapy on patients' QOL in both physical and mental dimensions were investigated and the moderator effect of a number of selected theoretical and significant practical variables were assessed. Relevant studies, published before July 2015, were identified by searching PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, and Persian medical databases including IranMedex, Irandoc, Magiran, Scientific Information Database (SID), and Medlib. Supplementary searches were also performed manually by reviewing the reference lists of the relevant articles. Next, using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, English and/or Persian-language articles conducted in Iran and evaluating the effect of exercise therapy on physical and/or mental aspects of QOL of MS patients were pooled. Afterwards, two competent reviewers in the field extracted the required data and rated the quality of the studies. Twenty-one journal articles were identified and reviewed, but only 13 of them contained the as much data as required to serve the purpose of the study. The mean effect size of exercise therapy on mental, physical, and overall QOL of the patients were 1.021 (95%CI 0.712-1.331, P < .001), 1.040 (95%CI 0.730-1.349, P < .001), and 0.846 (95%CI 0.508-1.184, P < .001), respectively. Based on the investigated Iranian studies, there is strong evidence confirming the effect of exercise therapy on QOL of patients with MS; there, however, exists a need for more studies to identify and establish effective exercise programs due to the heterogeneity of the studies conducted in this area.",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2017 Nov,Italy,2017,10
29397777,"Impact of intimate partner violence on clinic attendance, viral suppression and CD4 cell count of women living with HIV in an urban clinic setting.","The substance abuse, violence and HIV/AIDS (SAVA) syndemic represents a complex set of social determinants of health that impacts the lives of women. Specifically, there is growing evidence that intimate partner violence (IPV) places women at risk for both HIV acquisition and poorer HIV-related outcomes. This study assessed prevalence of IPV in an HIV clinic setting, as well as the associations between IPV, symptoms of depression and PTSD on three HIV-related outcomes-CD4 count, viral load, and missed clinic visits. In total, 239 adult women attending an HIV-specialty clinic were included. Fifty-one percent (95% CI: 45%-58%) reported past year psychological, physical, or sexual intimate partner abuse. In unadjusted models, IPV was associated with having a CD4 count <200 (OR: 3.284, 95% CI: 1.251-8.619, p = 0.016) and having a detectable viral load (OR: 1.842, 95% CI: 1.006-3.371, p = 0.048). IPV was not associated with missing >33% of past year all type clinic visits (OR: 1.535, 95% CI: 0.920-2.560, p = 0.101) or HIV specialty clinic visits (OR: 1.251, 95% CI: 0.732-2.140). In multivariable regression, controlling for substance use, mental health symptoms and demographic covariates, IPV remained associated with CD4 count <200 (OR: 3.536, 95% CI: 1.114-11.224, p = 0.032), but not viral suppression. The association between IPV and lower CD4 counts, but not adherence markers such as viral suppression and missed visits, indicates a need to examine potential physiologic impacts of trauma that may alter the immune functioning of women living with HIV. Incorporating trauma-informed approaches into current HIV care settings is one opportunity that begins to address IPV in this patient population.",AIDS care,2018 Apr,England,2018,10
30486854,Qualitative research investigating the mental health care service gap in Chinese burn injury patients.,"BACKGROUND: Psychological disturbances are prevalent in people with burn injuries; however, psychological services are rarely accessiblepost-burn injury in China. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore and conceptualize the obstacles to delivering mental health care in burn injury patients. METHODS: The researchers used a grounded theory research approach to interview sixteen burn injury patients, five nurses, four rehabilitation therapists, five medical doctors, and eight caregivers regarding their experiences with current health care services and barriers. RESULTS: An explorative model was generated from the data, and the relationships among the categories were identified. People's beliefs, knowledge, socioeconomic status, cultural understanding of mental health, and social stigma appear to play key roles in the public health approach to post-burn health promotion and post-burn psychosocial interventions. CONCLUSION: The model proposed in our research highlights the need to focus on the underlying social, economic, and cultural determinants of mental health care. The underlying social determinants of the mental health care gap that is responsible for the ill-prepared health care must be addressed.",BMC health services research,2018 Nov 28,England,2018,10
30614592,Factors contributing to voluntariness of incident reporting among hospital nurses.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to (a) test the hypothesized model for hospital nurses' voluntariness of incident reporting (VIR) and (b) determine the extent to which reporting culture factors, nursing safety practices and perceptions of work predict VIR. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was applied to 1,380 frontline nurses recruited from six teaching hospitals in Taiwan. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Correlation analyses and path analyses using structured equation modelling were used. FINDINGS: More than half of the nurses did not display a voluntary attitude towards reporting. VIR was correlated with factors of reporting culture, nursing safety practices and perceptions of work. Through path analyses, the safety practices mediated on the relationship between the reporting culture and VIR. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses still have modest willingness of reporting. The factors of reporting culture and nursing safety practices are critical determinants of VIR. Within more behavioural involvement in the safety practices, the reporting culture can support nurses to report voluntarily. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Strengthening nurses' engagement in safety practices can advance the reporting voluntariness and agreement with reporting culture concurrently. Nurse leaders should continue to optimize workload management and job satisfaction, which is advantageous to the safety practices enacted.",Journal of nursing management,2019 May,England,2019,10

31187687,What socio-economic factors determine place of death for people with life-limiting illness? A systematic review and appraisal of methodological rigour.,"BACKGROUND: Socio-economic factors play important roles in place of death. However, up-to-date knowledge on socio-economic determinants for place of death is warranted including analysis of collinearity between socio-economic determinants. AIM: To examine associations between socio-economic determinants (social class, deprivation level in area of residence, income, education, occupation, urbanisation) and place of death among adult patients with life-limiting illnesses. Furthermore, to describe how these factors are operationalised and examined for collinearity. DESIGN: A systematic review was performed (PROSPERO, record: CRD42018091218) and quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and PsycINFO was conducted for studies published from 1 January 2008 until the date of the search (23 March 2018) in English or Scandinavian languages. RESULTS: Of the 1599 unique citations identified, 34 studies were eligible. Dying at home was to a high degree associated with better financial situation and living in rural areas. Furthermore, hospital death was associated with a high level of deprivation in the area of residence and being employed. Regarding educational level, we found mixed and inconclusive results. CONCLUSION: Inequalities concerning place of death were found, and attention towards socio-economic inequality concerning place of death is necessary, especially in patients with a poor financial status, patients living in deprived and metropolitan areas and patients who are employed. Furthermore, we found a low degree of assessment for collinearity and adjustment of socio-economic variables. These issues should be considered in planning of future studies of socio-economic determinants for place of death.",Palliative medicine,2019 Sep,England,2019,10
31975982,Effects of an educational intervention based on the multi-theory model on promoting the quality of life in postmenopausal women: a protocol.,"Introduction: Menopause is associated with symptoms and complications that can affect women's quality of life. Therefore, acceptance of the symptoms and complications can improve quality of life during this period. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to design an educational program based on the multi-theory model (MTM) to deal with complications of the menopausal period and improve the women's quality of life. Material and methods: In designing this study, four phases are considered. In the first phase, the questionnaire of menopausal symptom acceptance behaviors will be designed based on the MTM using literature review and a panel of experts' viewpoints. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire will be confirmed at this stage. In the second phase, a descriptive study will be conducted by administering the questionnaire designed in the first phase along with the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire. The third phase includes the curriculum design based on the findings of the descriptive study, investigations of various studies, and viewpoints of the experts' panel. Therefore, the main components of the intervention will be identified. These components will determine the influential constructs of the MTM according to the descriptive research. Later, the related interventions and messages will be produced and designed from different sources. Intervention strategies will include group discussion, lectures, confidence-building skills, movie screenings, role play, preparation of daily activities booklets for postmenopausal women, and training classes for husbands and children to improve social support for women. The interventions, contents, and messages designed with the presence of health professionals and members of the target community will be pre-tested by examining factors such as audience perception of the message, appropriateness of the education to the audience's literacy and culture, as well as attractiveness, credibility, and acceptance of the materials. Finally, the fourth phase will be the implementation of the pre-test/post-test educational intervention using the intervention and control groups. Results and conclusions: The present study provides good information about the needs and strategies to enhance the quality of life in postmenopausal women by utilizing a menopausal acceptance training program. Therefore, designing a program to increase the menopausal acceptance in postmenopausal women can be effective in improving the quality of life and reducing the treatment and medical care costs.",Przeglad menopauzalny = Menopause review,2019 Dec,Poland,2019,10

24274804,A comparison of correlates associated with adult physical activity behavior in major cities and regional settings.,"OBJECTIVE: People living outside of urban areas are at higher risk for physical inactivity. Understanding physical activity correlates in different settings is important for understanding this risk. This study compared psychological, demographic, and health-related correlates of activity among adults living in major cities (urban areas) and regional (low-population density) towns and whether there were significant differences in how these potential determinants related to physical activity. METHODS: Participants (n = 756) were male and female adults who were members of the Australian Health and Social Science panel. Participant characteristics and physical activity were assessed using standardized measures via an online survey. Differences in the strength of the relation between the physical activity correlates were tested using equality of regression coefficient tests. RESULTS: Few differences in physical activity determinants between major cities and regional settings were observed. For major city and regional areas, self-efficacy and outcome expectations were the most strongly related correlates to physical activity. The strength of associations between the correlates and physical activity did not differ between areas, with the exception of working status. Not working was associated with lower odds of meeting physical activity guidelines for major city residents but not for regional residents. CONCLUSION: Physical activity correlates were generally similar for people living in major city and regional areas. This suggests that physical activity interventions targeting personal factors do not need to tailor to a person's level of urbanization. Studies examining the interaction between psychological correlates of physical activity and environmental factors are needed.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",2014 Nov,United States,2014,10
30489339,Variation of hospital-based adoption of care coordination services by community-level social determinants of health.,"BACKGROUND: Hospital investments in care coordination services and innovative delivery models represent an important source for improving care efficiency and population health. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore variation of hospital-initiated care coordination services and participation in Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) by community characteristics within an organizational theory framework. METHODS: Our main data sets included the 2015 American Hospital Association Annual Survey, Survey of Care Systems and Payment, American Community Survey, and Area Health Resource File. Two main outcomes were (a) hospital-reported initiation of care coordination practices (such as chronic disease management, post-hospital discharge continuity of care, and predictive analytics) and (b) participation in ACO models. State fixed-effects models were used to test the association between the adoption of care coordination practices and hospital characteristics, community-level sociodemographic characteristics, and health policies. RESULTS: Hospitals with large bed size, located in urban areas, and/or with high volume of operations were more likely to adopt care coordination practices and participate in the ACO models. Hospitals serving communities with high uninsurance rates and/or poverty rates were significantly less likely to provide care coordination practices. More stringent Community Benefit Laws (CBLs) were positively associated with the implementation of care coordination practices suggesting strong normative impacts of CBLs. CONCLUSION: Greater hospital-initiated care coordination practices and innovative ACO models were available in well-resourced areas. Policymakers may consider increasing resources for care coordination practices in rural, underserved, and high-poverty-high-uninsured areas to ensure that vulnerable populations can benefit from these services.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

27298061,Empirically testing some factors affecting HMS usage.,"Purpose - Without use the expected benefits from healthcare management systems (HMS) cannot be derived. Thus, while use alone may not guarantee success, one can safely assume that the more use the better. HMS has been instrumental in facilitating care providers' work. However, many hospitals have encountered usage problems and some user-related factors have been recognized in the literature as potentially important to make HMS more successful. The purpose of this paper is to test the importance of the factors proposed in the literature as important determinants of HMS usage measured by the number of hours used and the frequency of use. Design/methodology/approach - Several user-related variables such as user participation, user expertise, and user training previously studied separately by different authors are brought together into an integrated model to be tested empirically. Data from 213 nurses using their hospital HMS have been used to test proposed relationships between the independent variables and HMS usage results. Findings - The results confirm the importance of these factors and provide the basis for managerial recommendations. Hospital managers can use the resources validated by this study to improve their own operations and improve the likelihood of success implementing HMS. Future research projects may identify other possible factors important for HMS implementation success to improve the model proposed here. Originality/value - HMS is a very widely used and an important system for hospitals, but has been neglected in research. This is one of the first rigorous studies of HMS, and the results provide new practical insights for hospital administrators.",International journal of health care quality assurance,2016 Jul 11,England,2016,10

25462417,"Sick-leave measures, socio-demographic factors and health care as risk indicators for suicidal behavior in patients with depressive disorders--a nationwide prospective cohort study in Sweden.","BACKGROUND: Studies based on large data sets investigating a wide range of risk indicators on suicidal behavior in patients with depressive disorders are sparse. This study aimed to examine the association of sick-leave measured in different ways on one hand and socio-demographics, medication, and health care on the other hand with suicide attempt and suicide among patients with depressive disorders. METHODS: This is a population-based prospective cohort study using nationwide register data. All individuals who lived in Sweden 31.12.2004, then aged 16-64 years, and had psychiatric in- or out-patient care due to depressive disorders in 2005 were included (N = 21,096). Univariate and multivariate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) with regard to suicide attempt and suicide during 2006-2010 were estimated by Cox regression. RESULTS: Those with new sick-leave spells, full-time spells, spells due to mental diagnoses and exceeding one year and those having >/= 1 sick-leave spells had a higher risk of suicide attempt. Female sex, young age, lower education, living alone, prescription of antidepressants and anxiolytics, inpatient health care, and suicide attempts resulted in higher HRs of suicide attempt in the multivariate analyses (range of HRs 1.17-3.28). Male sex, combined antidepressant and anxiolytic prescription, mental inpatient health care, and suicide attempts predicted subsequent suicide (range of HRs 1.84-3.33). LIMITATIONS: Focus on specialized health care limited generalization. CONCLUSIONS: Sickness absence, social-demographics, and medical determinants were associated with suicidal behavior. These risk indicators should be considered when monitoring individuals with depressive disorders and assessing suicide risk.",Journal of affective disorders,2015 Mar 1,Netherlands,2015,10
27105065,The Role of Climatic and Density Dependent Factors in Shaping Mosquito Population Dynamics: The Case of Culex pipiens in Northwestern Italy.,"Culex pipiens mosquito is a species widely spread across Europe and represents a competent vector for many arboviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV), which has been recently circulating in many European countries, causing hundreds of human cases. In order to identify the main determinants of the high heterogeneity in Cx. pipiens abundance observed in Piedmont region (Northwestern Italy) among different seasons, we developed a density-dependent stochastic model that takes explicitly into account the role played by temperature, which affects both developmental and mortality rates of different life stages. The model was calibrated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach exploring the likelihood of recorded capture data gathered in the study area from 2000 to 2011; in this way, we disentangled the role played by different seasonal eco-climatic factors in shaping the vector abundance. Illustrative simulations have been performed to forecast likely changes if temperature or density-dependent inputs would change. Our analysis suggests that inter-seasonal differences in the mosquito dynamics are largely driven by different temporal patterns of temperature and seasonal-specific larval carrying capacities. Specifically, high temperatures during early spring hasten the onset of the breeding season and increase population abundance in that period, while, high temperatures during the summer can decrease population size by increasing adult mortality. Higher densities of adult mosquitoes are associated with higher larval carrying capacities, which are positively correlated with spring precipitations. Finally, an increase in larval carrying capacity is expected to proportionally increase adult mosquito abundance.",PloS one,2016,United States,2016,10

Thus, achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 3.5 to 'Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse' is important for Canada's overall realization of the SDGs, including SDG 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing). Since 2008, Vancouver's Downtown Community Court (DCC) has pioneered an innovative partnership among the justice, health and social service systems to address individuals' needs and circumstances leading to criminal behaviour. While researchers have examined the DCC's impact on reducing recidivism, with Canada's SDG health commitments in mind, we set out to examine the ways health and the social determinants of health (SDH) are engaged and framed externally with regard to DCC functioning, as well as internally by DCC actors. We employed a multi-pronged approach analyzing (1) publicly available DCC documents, (2) print media coverage, and (3) health-related discourse and references in DCC hearings. RESULTS: The documentary analysis showed that health and the SDH are framed by the DCC as instrumental for reducing drug-related offences and improving public safety. The observation data indicate that judges use health and SDH in providing context, understanding triggers for offences and offering rationale for sentencing and management plans that connect individuals to healthcare, social and cultural services. CONCLUSIONS: Our study contributes new insights on the effectiveness of the DCC as a means to integrate justice, health and social services for improved health and community safety. The development of such community court interventions, and their impact on health and the SDH, should be reported on by Canada and other countries as a key contribution to SDG 3 achievement, as well as the fulfillment of other targets under the SDG framework that contain the SDH. Consideration should be given by Canada as to how to capture and integrate the important data generated by the DCC and other problem-solving courts into SDG reporting metrics. Certainly, the DCC advances the SDGs' underlying Leave No One Behind principle in a high-income country context.",Globalization and health,2019 Dec 18,England,2019,10
24385668,Transitioning from health disparities to a health equity research agenda: the time is now.,"Health disparities are real. The evidence base is large and irrefutable. As such, the time is now to shift the research emphasis away from solely documenting the pervasiveness of the health disparities problem and begin focusing on health equity, the highest level of health possible. The focus on health equity research will require investigators to propose projects that develop and evaluate evidence-based solutions to health differences that are driven largely by social, economic, and environmental factors. This article highlights ongoing research and programmatic efforts underway at the National Institutes of Health that hold promise for advancing population health and improving health equity.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2014 Jan-Feb,United States,2014,10
29065810,"Teaching health-care trainees empathy and homelessness IQ through service learning, reflective practice, and altruistic attribution.","This article describes a novel inter-professional curriculum designed to address the needs of homeless patients in a Midwestern region of the United States which has high rates of poverty. The curriculum is intended for healthcare trainees coming from undergraduate pre-medical programs, nursing, pharmacy, social work, clinical psychology, medical school and post-graduate medical training in family medicine, medicine-pediatrics, and psychiatry. The clinical component is specifically designed to reach destitute patients and the curriculum is structured to reverse commonly held myths about homelessness among the trainees, thereby improving their Homelessness Information Quotient, the ability to more fully understand homelessness. Participants across all disciplines and specialties have shown greater empathy and helper behavior as determined by qualitative measures. Learners have also developed a greater understanding of health-care systems allowing them to more consistently address social determinants of health identified by the authors as their Disparity Information Quotient. This article outlines the process of initiating a homeless service program, a curriculum for addressing common myths about homelessness and the effective use of narrative methods, relational connections, and reflective practice to enable trainees to process their experience and decrease burnout by focusing on the value of altruism and finding meaning in their work.",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,2017 May,United States,2017,10
30099259,"""Anywhere but here"": Querying spatial stigma as a social determinant of health among youth of color accessing LGBTQ services in Chicago's Boystown.","The link between stigma and negative health outcomes is established, yet available research infrequently considers the complex intersection of place, race, and class-based stigma and how this stigma shapes opportunities and health among marginalized groups. Furthermore, scholarship on the relationship between stigma and health often fails to include the voices of the stigmatized themselves. This exclusion renders their lived-experiences hidden and their insight devalued, producing findings with limited validity to promote health equity and social change. In this article, we explore intersecting place, race, and class-based stigmas, or spatial stigma, as a social determinant of health among youth of color (YoC) accessing LGBTQ-specific services in the Chicago's White, middle-class gay enclave, Boystown. Qualitative data were collected within the context of a youth participatory action research study with 11 youth researchers (ages 18-24). Data sources included critical autoethnography, focus groups with current and former LGBTQ service patrons, and individual interviews with LGBTQ service providers. Emergent thematic patterns illuminate how the stigmatization of YoC based on place, race, and class (i.e., being from poor and low-income, racialized South and West sides communities) impacts their opportunities in the neighborhood and access to health-supporting resources. These findings may be useful for practitioners and policy makers who aim to promote health equity among marginalized young people and add to the growing body of literature on health effects of spatial stigma among marginalized communities.",Social science & medicine (1982),2018 Sep,England,2018,10
28007333,[Social determinants of contraceptive use in Tunisia].,"BACKGROUND: In Tunisia, the ""Revolution"" of January 2011 highlighted significant regional disparities and social inequalities in access to health care, including reproductive health services. The purpose of this study was to analyze the social determinants of the use of contraception in Tunisia. METHODS: A cross-sectional national study conducted in 2012; on a sample of 15 to 49-year married women (n=4374) drawn by a two levels random sampling. Prevalence of contraception and its association factors were assessed. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the variation of contraception prevalence with area of residence, age, level of education, number of children and household income. RESULTS: The prevalence of contraception was 66.4 %. Eighty-two percent of women used a modern contraceptive method. The use of contraceptive methods was significantly dependent on the age (P<0.001), area of residence (P=0.008), education (P<0.001). The prevalence of contraception was higher in North West (OR=1.1 [0.81-1.5]; P<0.001), among multiparous women (OR=4.49 [3.57-5.66]; P<0.001), among the youngest women (OR=1.4 [0.9-2,19]; P<0.001) and among those with higher levels of education (OR=1.62 [1.19-2.21]; P=0.008). CONCLUSION: Tunisia, precursor Arab country in family planning, is recording a slowdown in the use of contraception in comparison with other countries of North Africa.

21382855,Health information for migrants: the role of educational level in prevention of overweight.,"AIMS: Modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease include overweight, which is prevented by healthy diet and physical activity. Recently settled migrants may have varying levels of exposure to health information. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to explore the associations between self-reported information on healthy diet and on physical activity and overweight and the possible modification of this association by educational level among recently settled Iraqi migrants in Sweden. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected through a postal questionnaire in Arabic and analysed by means of logistic regression. Dummy variables were created in order to assess the possible modification by educational level on the association between health information and overweight. RESULTS: After adjustments for potential confounders, associations were found between overweight and not having received information on healthy diet (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.07-2.27) and physical exercise (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.07-2.32). Educational level modified these associations, so that the impact on overweight by information was much more evident among those with a high level of education. CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that overweight was associated to perceived lack of health information among recently settled Iraqi migrants. It may be easier for migrants with high education to seek, receive, and understand health-related information. Migrants with low education may be more traditional in, for example, their diet and therefore less likely to be overweight. Culturally adapted information may therefore not be relevant for them. The broader context of the social determinants of health needs to be considered when planning interventions for migrants.",Scandinavian journal of public health,2011 Mar,Sweden,2011,10
31696797,Electrochemical-Based Biosensors: New diagnosis Platforms for Cardiovascular Disease.,"One of the major reasons for mortality throughout the world is cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, bio-markers of cardiovascular disease are of high importance to diagnose and manage procedure. Detecting biomarkers provided a promising procedure in developing bio-sensors. Fast, selective, portable, accurate, inexpensive, and sensitive biomarker sensing instruments will be necessary for detecting and predicting diseases. One of the cardiac biomarkers may be ordered as C-reactive proteins, lipoprotein-linked phospho-lipase, troponin I or T, myoglobin, interleukin-6, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, LDL, and myeloperoxidase. The biomarkers are applied to anticipate cardio-vascular illnesses. Initial diagnoses of these diseases are possible by several techniques; however, they are laborious and need costly apparatus. Current researches designed various bio-sensors for resolving the respective issues. Electrochemical instruments and the proposed bio-sensors are preferred over other methods due to its inexpensiveness, mobility, reliability, repeatability.

An Evaluation Framework.,"Community-engaged health informatics (CEHI) integrates informatics with community-based participatory public health. Addressing social determinants and population health requires mobilization of health-related resources in communities. We present a framework for evaluating the process and outcomes of a CEHI platform designed to improve connectivity among community health resources. The GetHealthyHeights.org CEHI platform was implemented in an urban low-income community. It was designed to facilitate connectivity among health-related community-based organizations (CBOs). To evaluate the process towards and the achievement of connectivity, a conceptual framework, methodology, and operational measures were defined. A system-level approach, such as social network analysis, is required to capture the community as one dynamic unit. The evaluation framework specifies network connectivity metrics based on a social network survey. A network survey of CBOs (n=35) at baseline demonstrates utility of social network data for characterizing connectivity among community resources. The evaluation framework models how informatics and community resources improve population health.",AMIA ... Annual Symposium proceedings. AMIA Symposium,2017,United States,2017,10
30764887,"Associations of dietary intake with cardiometabolic risk in a multi-ethnic cohort: a longitudinal analysis of the Determinants of Adolescence, now young Adults, Social well-being and Health (DASH) study.","Unfavourable dietary habits, such as skipping breakfast, are common among ethnic minority children and may contribute to inequalities in cardiometabolic disease. We conducted a longitudinal follow-up of a subsample of the UK multi-ethnic Determinants of Adolescent Social well-being and Health cohort, which represents the main UK ethnic groups and is now aged 21-23 years. We aimed to describe longitudinal patterns of dietary intake and investigate their impact on cardiometabolic risk in young adulthood. Participants completed a dietary behaviour questionnaire and a 24 h dietary intake recall; anthropometry, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol and HbA1c were measured. The cohort consisted of 107 White British, 102 Black Caribbean, 132 Black African, 98 Indian, 111 Bangladeshi/Pakistani and 115 other/mixed ethnicity. Unhealthful dietary behaviours such as skipping breakfast and low intake of fruits and vegetables were common (56, 57 and 63 %, respectively). Rates of skipping breakfast and low fruit and vegetable consumption were highest among Black African and Black Caribbean participants. BMI and cholesterol levels at 21-23 years were higher among those who regularly skipped breakfast at 11-13 years (BMI 1.41 (95 % CI 0.57, 2.26), P=0.001; cholesterol 0.15 (95 % CI -0.01, 0.31), P=0.063) and at 21-23 years (BMI 1.05 (95 % CI 0.22, 1.89), P=0.014; cholesterol 0.22 (95 % CI 0.06, 0.37), P=0.007). Childhood breakfast skipping is more common in certain ethnic groups and is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in young adulthood. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting interventions to improve dietary behaviours such as breakfast consumption at specific population groups.",The British journal of nutrition,2019 May,England,2019,10
30377047,Independent urban effect on hypertension of older Indians: identification of a knowledge gap from a Study on Global AGEing and Health.,"Among older Indians, more cardiovascular diseases and risk factors are observed in the city dwellers than in the rural population. Clustering of socioeconomic privileges and consequent obesity in the Indian cities are known to underlie this phenomenon. But, it is unclear whether an independent urban effect exists on age-related ailments, unexplained by concentration of privileges and excess weight in the Indian cities. Hence, we aimed to estimate the independent urban effect on hypertension among older Indians after controlling for these factors. Nationally representative data of Indians aged 50 years and older (n = 7273) were collected by Study on global AGEing and health. Hypertension was defined as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure >139 and > 89 mm Hg, respectively, and/or someone receiving antihypertensive medications. Permanent place of residence (urban/rural) during interview was recorded. Socioeconomic determinants included caste, occupation, assets, and education. Body mass index, abdominal circumference, smoking, alcohol, and physical activity were also controlled. The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio of hypertension for urban residents was 1.64 (146-1.83), which partially attenuated to 1.22 (1.07-1.38) after controlling for all the covariates. This study highlights 22% excess odds of hypertension among the older Indian city dwellers, unexplained by the greater urban concentration of socioeconomic privileges and obesity. Future research should explore the constituents of this urban effect.",Journal of the American Society of Hypertension : JASH,2018 Nov,United States,2018,10
23318663,Does cognitive remediation for schizophrenia improve functional outcomes?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cognitive deficits are recognized as key determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation for schizophrenia, which is intended to improve both cognition and functional outcome, has been shown to impact cognition regardless of quality of trial methodology used. However, the impact of cognitive remediation on functional outcomes is more variable. A number of recently published articles specifically address the issues impacting the effectiveness of cognitive remediation at improving psychosocial outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, studies published since 2011 have been summarized, with a particular focus on psychosocial outcomes. Cognitive remediation may include a focus on neurocognition and/or social cognition, but is increasingly integrative, targeting a range of cognitive skills. Psychosocial outcomes include quality of life, employment outcomes, academic functioning, and social functioning. SUMMARY: The reviewed literature indicates that cognitive remediation is most likely to impact functional outcome when individuals are given opportunities to practice the cognitive skills in real-world settings. By integrating a cognitive remediation program with psychosocial rehabilitation programs, functional outcomes are enhanced. Cognitive remediation programs that do not solely rely on drill and practice, but instead incorporate strategy teaching and methods to address beliefs and motivation, are associated with better psychosocial outcomes.",Current opinion in psychiatry,2013 Mar,United States,2013,10
28541384,Hispanic Segregation and Poor Health: It's Not Just Black and White.,"Despite the importance of understanding the fundamental determinants of Hispanic health, few studies have investigated how metropolitan segregation shapes the health of the fastest-growing population in the United States. Using 2006-2013 data from the National Health Interview Survey, we 1) examined the relationship between Hispanic metropolitan segregation and respondent-rated health for US-born and foreign-born Hispanics and 2) assessed whether neighborhood poverty mediated this relationship. Results indicated that segregation has a consistent, detrimental effect on the health of US-born Hispanics, comparable to findings for blacks and black-white segregation. In contrast, segregation was salutary (though not always significant) for foreign-born Hispanics. We also found that neighborhood poverty mediates some, but not all, of the associations between segregation and poor health. Our finding of divergent associations between health and segregation by nativity points to the wide range of experiences within the diverse Hispanic population and suggests that socioeconomic status and structural factors, such as residential segregation, come into play in determining Hispanic health for the US-born in a way that does not occur among the foreign-born.",American journal of epidemiology,2017 Oct 15,United States,2017,10

This study analysed determinants for participation in different levels of the breast cancer screening process in Indian females. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An intervention group of 52,011 women was interviewed in a breast cancer screening trial in Trivandrum district, India. In order to assess demographic, socio-economic, reproductive, and cancer-related determinants of participation in BSE, CBE, and referral, uni- and multi-variate logistic regression was employed. RESULTS: Of the interviewed women, 23.2% reported practicing BSE, 96.8% had attended CBE, and 49.1% of 2,880 screen-positives attended referral. Results showed an influence of various determinants on participation; women who were currently not married or who had no family history of cancer were significantly less likely to attend the screening process at any level. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing awareness about breast cancer, early detection methods, and the advantages of early diagnoses among women, and their families, as well as health care workers offering social support, could help to increase participation over the entire screening process in India.",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2013,Thailand,2013,10
31863786,Hypertension in African Americans: Advances in community outreach and public health approaches.,"While there have been significant advances made towards controlling cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality in recent decades, African- Americans continue to experience a markedly elevated burden of CVD. Multiple factors have contributed to this major public health crisis, including medication adherence, racial inequities in diagnosis and treatment, lack of culturally competent care, and disparities in healthcare access. Historical approaches to reduce this burden are targeted towards community outreach by recruiting community partners and healthcare providers to disseminate health information on CVD awareness and prevention. Current community-based approaches, such as the barbershop and faith-based programs, have built upon previous approaches and incorporated novel ideas to increase community engagement in risk factor and disease reduction. Based on these models, future directions point to an increased usage of community partners, alongside health information technology and healthy behavior patient education, to reduce risk factors and prevalence of CVD in an ethnically vulnerable community.",Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2019 Dec 19,United States,2019,10
29580263,Post-millennial trends of socioeconomic inequalities in chronic illness among adults in Germany.,"OBJECTIVE: Time trends in health inequalities have scarcely been studied in Germany as only few national data have been available. In this paper, we explore trends in socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of chronic illness using Germany-wide data from four cross-sectional health surveys conducted between 2003 and 2012 (n = 54,197; ages 25-69 years). We thereby expand a prior analysis on post-millennial inequality trends in behavioural risk factors by turning the focus to chronic illness as the outcome measure. The regression-based slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII) were calculated to estimate the extent of absolute and relative socioeconomic inequalities in chronic illness, respectively. RESULTS: The results for men revealed a significant increase in the extent of socioeconomic inequalities in chronic illness between 2003 and 2012 on both the absolute and relative scales (SII2003 = 0.06, SII2012 = 0.17, p-trend = 0.013; RII2003 = 1.18, RII2012 = 1.57, p-trend = 0.013). In women, similar increases in socioeconomic inequalities in chronic illness were found (SII2003 = 0.05, SII2012 = 0.14, p-trend = 0.022; RII2003 = 1.14, RII2012 = 1.40, p-trend = 0.021). Whereas in men this trend was driven by an increasing prevalence of chronic illness in the low socioeconomic group, the trend in women was predominantly the result of a declining prevalence in the high socioeconomic group.",BMC research notes,2018 Mar 27,England,2018,10
30654680,Applying a psychosocial pathways model to improving mental health and reducing health inequalities: Practical approaches.,"BACKGROUND: Mental health can help explain how social inequalities impact on health. Many current public health challenges are shaped by social, economic and environmental conditions that take a mental toll on society. PURPOSE: This article describes a conceptual framework illustrating the psychosocial pathways that link the wider conditions to health behaviours and outcomes. It draws out implications of this framework for mental health practice that aim to support policy and decision-making on future action to reduce health inequalities and presents practical examples of what can be done. METHODS: This article expands on a report commissioned by Public Health England. A narrative review and synthesis of relevant evidence built on existing research by the Institute of Health Equity. A conceptual framework was developed and a consultation exercise with stakeholders helped to revise and illustrate it with practice examples. CONCLUSIONS: The field of mental health has much to contribute to prevention, not just of mental illness but also of physical health conditions and reduction of inequalities in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy, especially through collaborative public health action.",The International journal of social psychiatry,2019 Mar,England,2019,10
27855086,Educational disparities in the intention to quit smoking among male smokers in China: a cross-sectional survey on the explanations provided by the theory of planned behaviour.,"OBJECTIVES: We aim to describe the intention to quit smoking among Chinese male smokers from different educational backgrounds and to explain this intention from their attitude, perceived social norms and self-efficacy regarding smoking cessation. SETTING: Participants were recruited from workplaces and communities to reflect the occupational distribution in three cities (Shanghai, Nanning and Mudanjiang) in China. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: In 2013 interviews were conducted with 3676 male smokers aged 18 years and older. OUTCOME MEASURES: Multivariate logistic regression analyses calculated educational differences in the intention to quit smoking as well as the association between the intention to quit smoking and attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy. Bootstrapping estimated to what extent the educational disparities in the intention to quit smoking were mediated by these three determinants. RESULTS: No educational disparities in the intention to quit smoking within 1 or 6 months were observed among male Chinese smokers (p=0.623 and p=0.153, respectively). A less negative attitude, a higher perceived subjective norm towards smoking cessation, and a higher perceived self-efficacy to quit smoking were all associated with intention to quit (all p values <0.001). Perceived subjective norms were the only component of the theory of planned behaviour that statistically significantly mediated the differences in the intention to quit smoking (within 1 or 6 months) between the lowest educated Chinese men and the groups with lower (beta=0.039, 95% CI 0.017 to 0.071 and beta=0.043, 95% CI 0.019 to 0.073), higher (beta=0.041, 95% CI 0.017 to 0.075 and beta=0.045, 95% CI 0.019 to 0.077) and the highest education (beta=0.045, 95% CI 0.019 to 0.080 and beta=0.050, 95% CI 0.023 to 0.083). CONCLUSIONS: In order to prevent future socioeconomic disparities in smoking cessation, investment in a more stimulating social environment and norms towards smoking cessation among particularly the lowest educated Chinese men is warranted.",BMJ open,2016 Oct 7,England,2016,10
22440549,Disparities in premature mortality between high- and low-income US counties.,"INTRODUCTION: Several well-established determinants of health are associated with premature mortality. Using data from the 2010 County Health Rankings, we describe the association of selected determinants of health with premature mortality among counties with broadly differing levels of income. METHODS: County-level data on 3,139 US counties from the 2010 County Health Rankings were linked to county mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Compressed Mortality database. We divided counties into 3 groups, defined by sample median household income levels: low-income (</=25th percentile, $29,631), mid-income (25th-75th percentile, $29,631-$39,401), and high-income (>/=75th percentile, >/=$39,401). We analyzed group differences in geographic, sociodemographic, racial/ethnic, health care, social, and behavioral factors. Stratified multivariable linear regression explored the associations of these health determinants with premature mortality for high- and low-income groups. RESULTS: The association between income and premature mortality was stronger among low-income counties than high-income counties. We found differences in the pattern of risk factors between high- and low-income groups. Significant geographic, sociodemographic, racial/ethnic, health care, social, and behavioral disparities exist among income groups. CONCLUSION: Geographic location and the percentages of adult smokers and adults with a college education were associated with premature mortality rates in US counties. These relationships varied in magnitude and significance across income groups. Our findings suggest that population health policies aimed at reducing mortality disparities require an understanding of the socioeconomic context within which modifiable variables exist.",Preventing chronic disease,2012,United States,2012,10
29299816,"Housing and Food Insecurity, Care Access, and Health Status Among the Chronically Ill: An Analysis of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.","BACKGROUND: The proportion of the United States population with chronic illness continues to rise. Understanding the determinants of quality of care-particularly social determinants-is critical to the provision of care in this population. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of housing and food insecurity among persons with common chronic conditions and to assess the independent effects of chronic illness and sociodemographic characteristics on (1) housing and food insecurity, and (2) health care access hardship and health status. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: We used data from the 11 states and one territory that completed the social context module of the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). MAIN MEASURES: We estimated the prevalence of housing and food insecurity among patients with cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease. Logistic regression models were used to assess the independent effects of housing and food insecurity, chronic conditions, and demographics on health care access and health status. KEY RESULTS: Among the chronically ill, 36.71% (95% CI: 35.54-37.88) experienced housing insecurity and 30.60% (95% CI: 29.49-31.71) experienced food insecurity. Cardiovascular and lung disease increased the likelihood of housing (OR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.07-2.66 and OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.12-2.60, respectively) and food insecurity (OR 1.75, 95% CI: 1.12-2.73 and OR 1.78, 95% CI: 1.20-2.63, respectively). Housing and food insecurity significantly increased the risk of health care access hardship. Being insured or having an income level above 200% of the federal poverty level significantly reduced the likelihood of access hardship, while female gender significantly increased the likelihood. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic illness independently affects housing and food insecurity. In turn, food and housing anxiety leads to reduced access to care, likely due to cost concerns, and correlates with poorer health. A more complete understanding of the pathways by which chronic illness influences social determinants and clinical outcomes is needed.",Journal of general internal medicine,2018 May,United States,2018,10
24569972,[Social exclusion and health inequity: a case study based on a cash distribution program (Bolsa Familia) in Brazil].,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of Bolsa Familia (PBF), a federal cash transfer program, and to analyze its effects on social inclusion and exclusion processes experienced by low-income families in Brazil, with a focus on the program's potential to help overcome health inequity. METHODS: This qualitative investigation used a case study methodology including observant participation, review of documents, and semi-structured interviews with current and former PBF beneficiaries, as well as with the program's local managers. The study was conducted in a small city in the state of Rio de Janeiro with a high social exclusion index and 100% coverage by the Family Health Strategy (Estrategia Saude da Familia, ESF) program. The economic, political, social, and cultural dimensions of social exclusion and inclusion processes were used to guide data collection and analysis. RESULTS: The program facilitated social inclusion of low-income families, especially in the economic and social dimensions. Nevertheless, it did not produce the changes desired by the beneficiaries in the work dimension. The effects on the political dimension were limited by the insufficient social engagement of the PBF. The interviewees underscored the positive effects of the ESF, which allowed them to exercise their right to health by granting them wider access to primary health care services. However, these effects appeared to be unrelated to the PBF. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal effects, limitations, and challenges of the PBF towards modifying the social determinants of health inequity, in order to promote more effective changes in the social exclusion/inclusion dynamics affecting low-income families.",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,2013 Dec,United States,2013,10
21734308,Environmental determinants of children's physical activity in residential children's homes.,"BACKGROUND: Children in residential children's homes (RCH) may be at increased risk for physical inactivity due to decreased access to opportunities for activity. Little is known about environmental determinants of physical activity for children in RCH. METHODS: Thirty-minute blocks of MVPA and Total METs were measured using the 3-Day Physical Activity Recall (3DPAR). A staff interview, based on the Structural Ecologic Model of Health Behavior, assessed physical activity opportunities, structures, characteristics, policies, and social environment. Wilcoxon 2-sample tests were used to examine differences in environment by location and presence of a recreation director. Mixed model ANOVAs assessed the differences in child level activity by environmental variables. RESULTS: There were significant correlations between opportunities and characteristics of physical activity, facilities, and equipment with total METS for children. Children in homes with a recreation director and homes in rural locations reported more physical activity. Only rural location had a significant effect on physical activity. Presence of a recreation director was significant in several models. CONCLUSIONS: Rural location may be conducive for increased physical activity in children at RCH. Employing a recreation director or other trained personnel may be an important policy determinant of physical activity for children.",Journal of physical activity & health,2011 Jul,United States,2011,10
24269879,A spatial analysis of social and economic determinants of tuberculosis in Brazil.,"We investigated the spatial distribution, and social and economic correlates, of tuberculosis in Brazil between 2002 and 2009 using municipality-level age/sex-standardized tuberculosis notification data. Rates were very strongly spatially autocorrelated, being notably high in urban areas on the eastern seaboard and in the west of the country. Non-spatial ecological regression analyses found higher rates associated with urbanicity, population density, poor economic conditions, household crowding, non-white population and worse health and healthcare indicators. These associations remained in spatial conditional autoregressive models, although the effect of poverty appeared partially confounded by urbanicity, race and spatial autocorrelation, and partially mediated by household crowding.

Main indicators of social environment and children's health, general demographics, and socioeconomic factors of Russia are described. The Russian health care system has preserved positive elements of the former Soviet model of pediatric care. However, beginning in 1991, it has been altered greatly in its funding and management. The child health care system is composed of a special network of outpatient and inpatient facilities. The key element of pediatric community care is the pediatric polyclinic, staffed by district pediatricians and nurses. Undergraduate pediatric training is separate from adult medical training. From day one onward, future pediatricians are trained at separate pediatric faculties of universities. Thus, they qualify as general pediatricians after only 2 years of postgraduate training. It should be emphasized that the gap between the health status of children in developed countries and the Russian Federation is largely due to the influence of socioeconomic determinants, such as traffic accidents, poverty, pollution, and hazardous life styles, including binge drinking. Further improvements of children's health require protective measures by the state to address the underlying socioeconomic determinants.",The Journal of pediatrics,2016 Oct,United States,2016,10
28752739,Trends in Health Behaviour in Czech School-aged Children: HBSC Study. Preface.,"The Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study is now in its 34th year. It continues to grow not only as a source of reliable and valid data on the health behaviours of 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds, but also regarding its membership - 46 countries and regions across Europe and North America are now included. The HBSC study is a cohort cross-sectional questionnaire-based study focusing on health and health-related behaviours in adolescents in the context of their social environment. This age was selected because of the significant cognitive, psychological, and biological processes taking place in this period of the lifespan, as well as because of the fact that health-related behaviours adopted at this age are known to persist into adulthood. The findings from the HBSC study are used to monitor health, well-being, and health-related behaviours in school-aged children; deepen the understanding of the social determinants of health; and provide evidence-based data for policy makers and practitioners aiming to improve the lives of young people.",Central European journal of public health,2017 Jul,Czech Republic,2017,10
23061163,Peer influences within the campus environment on help seeking related to violence.,"While partner violence and sexual assault are public health concerns affecting college women, most young women do not seek help after the experience. Limited research explores the interpersonal context of help seeking related to violence in young women. The overall purpose of this research was to understand peer factors within a campus culture associated with seeking help in response to violence within a campus environment. Eight focus groups were held with 64 participants representing a broad spectrum of diversity in race and ethnicity. Narrative analysis was the primary method of analysis. Three themes emerged from the data: victim blaming, fear of direct response, and the alcohol factor. The young women's stories demonstrate the effects of friends and campus culture on perceptions of violence and abuse and help seeking. Findings suggest that peers and the social norms of the campus environment influence help-seeking behavior. An understanding of interpersonal level determinants of help seeking is essential for clinically relevant and effective prevention efforts. Nurse practitioners in campus health settings can use this research to guide assessment, intervention, and prevention strategies.",Journal of National Black Nurses' Association : JNBNA,2012 Jul,United States,2012,10
30589321,Who is meeting the Healthy People 2020 objectives?: Comparisons between racially/ethnically diverse and immigrant children and adults.,"INTRODUCTION: To determine the prevalence of reaching multiple Healthy People 2020 (HP 2020) objectives including nutrition and weight status, sleep health, physical activity, health-related quality of life, social determinants of health, and education among low-income, diverse children and adults. METHODS: Children ages 5- to 7-years-old (n = 150; 47% female) and their parents (mean age = 35; 91% mothers) from 6 racial/ethnic and immigrant/refugee groups (n = 25 from each; African American, Native American, Hispanic, Hmong, Somali, White) participated in this cross-sectional mixed-methods study. RESULTS: Overall, the majority of HP 2020 objectives were not being met across this low-income, racially/ethnically diverse, and immigrant/refugee sample of children and adults. In particular, African American children and parents consistently fell below the majority of the HP 2020 targets, with only 5 of the 24 HP 2020 objectives being met. Additionally, immigrant children and parents met less than 2/3 of the HP 2020 objectives. DISCUSSION: Concerted public health efforts are needed to address the disparities in reaching the HP 2020 objectives and informing the development of the future HP 2030 objectives among low-income, racially/ethnically diverse, and immigrant children and parents. In order to achieve and assess the current and future HP objectives in these diverse populations, changes may be needed in both interventions and assessment tools.

30854873,The Prevalence and Social Determinants of Fruit and Vegetable Consumption and Its Associations With Noncommunicable Diseases Risk Factors Among Adults in Laos.,"The study aimed to assess the prevalence and correlates of fruit and vegetable (FAV) consumption and its associations with noncommunicable diseases risk factors among adults in Laos. In a national cross-sectional survey in 2013, 2527 individuals (18-64 years old) responded to a questionnaire, and anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, and biochemistry tests were conducted. On average, participants had 0.99 servings of fruits a day and 1.33 servings of vegetables a day, a combined total of 2.32 servings of FAVs per day. Almost 1 in 5 respondents (18.9%) had 2 or more servings of fruit a day, 8.7% had 3 or more servings of vegetables a day, and 94.7% had less than 5 servings of FAV a day. In adjusted logistic analysis, being a Lao-Tai increased the odds of consuming 2 or more servings of fruits daily. Past month binge drinking decreased the odds of having 3 or more servings of vegetables daily. Higher education and urban residence decreased the odds of inadequate (<5 servings) FAV consumption. In adjusted linear regression analysis, increased FAV consumption was associated with higher body mass index scores. A high prevalence of inadequate FAV consumption was found. Interventions targeting identified modifiable risk factors, including lower education, general obesity, and binge drinking, may potentially increase FAV consumption in Laos.",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,2019 Mar,China,2019,10

METHODS: The sample consisted of 119 individuals. Data collection was performed in stages: calibration and pilot study; Application of questionnaires; Exam of caries, periodontal and need for dental prostheses, in accordance with the World Health Organization criteria. The data were subjected to both bivariate and multivariate analyses to test the association of independent variables with the dependent variable (QoL). RESULTS: Worse QoL was associated with the presence of periodontal pocket (p = 0.03; OR = 2.50; 95% CI 1.06 to 5.90), treatment need (p = 0.01; OR = 5.00; 95% CI 1.37 to 18.31), and need for dental prostheses (p = 0.03; OR = 2.89; 95% CI 1.13 to 7.37). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that clinical determinants had the greatest influence on OHRQoL of individuals with ID.","Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",2016 Nov,United States,2016,10
30378098,"Pregnancy outcomes for women with pre-pregnancy diabetes mellitus in Australian populations, rural and metropolitan: A review.","BACKGROUND: Historically, pre-pregnancy diabetes (PPDM) is a recognised risk factor for poor pregnancy outcome. Co-existing pathology and adverse social determinants including rural-metropolitan inequities in health and healthcare access may confer additional risks. Multidisciplinary care before, during and after pregnancy can improve outcomes for women with PPDM and their infants. The extent to which rural Australian women and their families share in improved outcomes is unknown. We aimed to summarise maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes for women with PPDM, including women in rural settings and examine applications of existing clinical guidelines to rural Australian practice. METHODS: We sought English language population and cohort studies about PPDM using Medline, Embase, PubMed, Australian epidemiological and international clinical practice guidelines. RESULTS: Women with PPDM are changing: older, more obese, of lower parity, less likely to smoke, more likely to have type 2 rather than type 1 diabetes and shorter duration of PPDM. Women with PPDM continue to experience excess adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal morbidity, complicated birth, perinatal loss, congenital anomalies and mother-infant separation. On face value, clinical guidelines appear relevant to women living in rural settings but there are only a few, conflicting outcome studies for rural women with PPDM. CONCLUSIONS: PPDM is changing. A significant minority live in rural locations, and although perinatal mortality/morbidity seems to be improving, it is unclear if this is also true for rural women due to a lack of recent Australian studies. Further research is necessary to achieve excellence everywhere for women with PPDM and their babies.",The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,2019 Apr,Australia,2019,10
31746649,Commentary: Challenges and Opportunities for Women in Dental Research.,"This commentary integrates and expands on the preceding articles in this issue that document and celebrate a century of women's achievements in the International Association for Dental Research (IADR). The increasing participation and leadership of women in dental and craniofacial research and within the IADR were viewed from the perspective of a changing culture of science. The steps that have been taken by the IADR to develop greater inclusiveness are acknowledged, and some of the challenges that remain are discussed in terms of obstacles that are most often social or cultural in origin. Comparisons are made across countries, and the social determinants that lead to differences in women's participation are described. Recommendations are made for developing strategies to change elements of our institutional cultures that have provided advantages to some groups of researchers more than to others. The unconscious biases and a lack of commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion that limit the participation of members of some groups limit the progress and achievements of science in general.",Advances in dental research,2019 Dec,United States,2019,10
30287114,Diverse socioeconomic processes influencing health and wellbeing across generations in deprived neighbourhoods in Malta.,"This study contributes to the geography of health by emphasising intergenerational differences in health determinants in a Mediterranean context. Using a grounded theory approach, it aims to explore the intergenerational processes between parents and children and their impact on determinants of health and wellbeing by focusing on the neighbourhood processes, including human, social and cultural capital in their neighbourhood. Through structured in-depth interviews with parents and children coming from two deprived neighbourhoods in Malta, it was shown that what may be considered valuable and beneficial for the adults' wellbeing may be detrimental for their children. In other cases, the neighbourhood processes that are being experienced negatively by adults seem to be beneficial for the health and wellbeing of young people. Thus the neighbourhood does not influence the inhabitants of different age groups in a homogenous and consistent manner. Indeed, the experiences of adults and children, even though they belong to the same family and neighbourhood, may differ from each other. It also emerged that it is not only the parents who can influence determinants of a young person's wellbeing; children and adolescents are able to negotiate and contradict their parents' wishes and decisions in order to enjoy conditions that they find beneficial. This study therefore demonstrates how the processes related to the social determinants of health are not static but highly dynamic, even across generations.",Social science & medicine (1982),2019 Jul,England,2019,10
24281310,Views of parents in four European countries about the effect of food on the mental performance of primary school children.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Several factors affect the mental performance of children. The importance that parents attribute to food-related determinants, compared with genetic, socio-economic and school environment, was investigated. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Parents of school children (aged 4-11) were recruited through state primary schools in four European countries. Interviews were conducted in which participants were asked to sort 18 cards representing possible determinants of four elements of mental performance (attention, learning, mood and behaviour) according to perceived strength of effect. Determinants were identified from the literature and grouped in six categories: food-related, school environment, physical, social, psychological and biological. Effects were scored: 0=none; 1=moderate; and 2=strong. Views were compared between and within countries. RESULTS: Two hundred parents took part (England: 53; Germany: 45; Hungary: 52; Spain: 50). Differences existed between countries in the proportions reporting university education and being in employment. Taking all countries together, parents consider the food category (mean 1.33) to have a lower impact on a child's mental performance than physical (activity and sleep, 1.77), psychological (mood and behaviour, 1.69) and school environment (1.57). Social (1.12) and biological (0.91) determinants were ranked lower than food. Of determinants in the food category, parents thought regularity of meals had more influence on mental performance (1.58) than what a child eats now (1.36), food at school (1.35), nutrition as a baby/infant (1.02). CONCLUSION: Scope exists to improve parental awareness of the repercussions of their dietary choices for the mental performance of their children.",European journal of clinical nutrition,2014 Jan,England,2014,10
28325146,Hypersexuality As a Neuropsychiatric Disorder: The Neurobiology and Treatment Options.,"Hypersexuality refers to abnormally increased or extreme involvement in any sexual activity. It is clinically challenging, presents trans-diagnostically and there is extensive medical literature addressing the nosology, pathogenesis and neuropsychiatric aspects in this clinical syndrome. Classification includes deviant behaviours, diagnosable entities related to impulsivity, and obsessional phenomena. Some clinicians view an increase in sexual desire as 'normal' i.e. psychodynamic theorists consider it as egodefensive at times alleviating unconscious anxiety rooted in intrapsychic conflicts. We highlight hypersexuality as multi-dimensional involving an increase in sexual activity that is associated with distress and functional impairment. The aetiology of hypersexuality is multi-factorial with differential diagnoses that include major psychiatric disorders (e.g. bipolar disorder), adverse effects of treatments (e.g. levodopatreatment), substance-induced disorders (e.g. amphetamine substance use), neuropathological disorders (e.g. frontal lobe syndrome), among others. Numerous neurotransmitters are implicated in its pathogenesis, with dopamine and noradrenaline playing a crucial role in the neural reward pathways and emotionally- regulated limbic system neural circuits. The management of hypersexuality is determined by the principle of de causa effectu evanescent, if the causes are treated, the effect may disappear. We aim to review the role of pharmacological agents causing hypersexuality and centrally acting agents treating the associated underlying medical conditions. Bio-psycho-social determinants are pivotal in embracing the understanding and guiding management of this complex and multi-determined clinical syndrome.",Current drug targets,2018,United Arab Emirates,2018,10
29254913,"Influence of Social Determinants, Lifestyle, Emotional Well-Being and the Use of Unconventional Therapies in Breast Cancer Progression in a Cohort of Women in Barcelona: Protocol for the DAMA Cohort.","BACKGROUND: Breast cancer continues to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. Breast cancer survivors face numerous problems, especially after completing the first year of intense treatment. We present the protocol for an ongoing study to analyze the impact of a series of factors on breast cancer survival related to lifestyle, emotional well-being, and use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). OBJECTIVE: We aim to analyze the influence of social determinants, lifestyle changes, emotional well-being, and use of CAM in the progression of breast cancer in women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2003 and 2013 in Barcelona, Spain. METHODS: We will perform a mixed cohort study (prospective and retrospective) of women diagnosed with breast cancer, created using a convenience sample in which we study the evolution of the disease (relapse, death, or remaining disease-free). Once identified, we sent the women information about the study and an informed consent form that they are required to sign in order to participate; a total of 2235 women were recruited. We obtained the following information from all participants: sociodemographic profile via a phone interview, and a self-administered survey of information about the study's objectives (lifestyles, emotional well-being, health care services, and the use of CAM). Lastly, we examined clinical records to obtain data on the tumor at the time of diagnosis, the treatment received, the occurrence of relapses (if any), and the tumor typology. We present data on the women's social profile based on descriptive data obtained from the telephone interview (welcome survey). RESULTS: Based on the welcome survey, which was completed by 2712 women, 14.42% (391/2712) of respondents were <50 years of age, 45.50% (1234/2712) were between 50 and 65 years of age, and 40.08% (1087/2712) were >65 years of age. A total of 43.69% (1185/2712) belonged to the highest social classes (I and II), 31.27% (848/2712) to the middle class (III), and 23.49% (637/2712) to the working classes (IV and V). Approximately 22.71% (616/2712) lived alone, 38.31% (1039/2712) lived with one person, and 38.97% (1057/2712) lived with two or more people. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained information from a large cohort of women, but this study has limitations related to the convenience sampling strategy, one of which is reduced representativeness. Conversely, being a self-administered survey, the study introduces biases, especially from respondents that answered on paper. However, the information that the study provides will serve as the basis for designing future interventions aimed at improving the knowledge gaps indicated for women with breast cancer.",JMIR research protocols,2017 Dec 18,Canada,2017,10
26879973,Connecting the dots on health inequalities--a systematic review on the social determinants of health in Portugal.,"INTRODUCTION: Health inequalities are recognised as a public health issue worldwide, but only a few countries have developed national strategies to monitor and reduce them. Despite its considerable health inequalities, Portugal seems to lack a systematic strategy to tackle them, possibly due to the absence of organised evidence on the issue. We performed a systematic review that aimed to describe the available evidence on social inequalities in health in Portugal, in order to contribute towards a comprehensive and focused strategy to tackle them. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed for studies that looked at the association between a measure of socioeconomic status and a health outcome in the Portuguese resident population since the year 2000. We excluded health behaviours and healthcare use from our search. We performed a qualitative description of the results. RESULTS: Seventy-one publications were selected, all reporting observational analyses, most of them using cross-sectional data. These publications showed strong evidence for health inequalities related to education and gender, chiefly for obesity, self-rated health and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the eligible publications showed that current research does not seem to have consistently covered the link between health and key Portuguese social problems. A strategy focusing on the monitoring of most prevalent diseases, most determining socioeconomic factors and vulnerable populations would be crucial to guide academic research in a country in which health inequalities are so ubiquitous and deeply rooted. REGISTRATION: This systematic review is not registered.",International journal for equity in health,2016 Feb 16,England,2016,10

These behaviors are greatly affected by social environment and individual factors. However, few studies explored the social determinants of schoolchildren's health behaviors. In this cross-sectional study, the social determinants of health behaviors were examined among both migrant and resident students in Beijing, China. Data of 967 children from six urban and suburban primary schools were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. The results showed that less than 60% of children performed some healthy behaviors, although their health knowledge was generally good. Children's health behavior scores were greatly determined by school characteristics, health knowledge, demographic characteristics, and family context. Therefore, improving health education and conditions in primary schools is the priority to promote children's healthy behaviors, especially for disadvantaged children.",Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
