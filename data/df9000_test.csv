10686574,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the individual and social determinants of rural nurses' willingness to care for people with AIDS (PWAs). Willingness to care was viewed as a function of nurses' personal attitudes about AIDS care and PWAs; the influence of normative (significant others), comparative (the nursing profession), and generalized (the rural community) reference group norms on these attitudes; and how much importance respondents placed on membership in these reference groups. Responses to a mailed questionnaire from 615 rural nurses were analyzed. Individual determinants were nurses' feelings of preparedness and favorable attitudes about their personal safety when administering care. Social determinants were the degree of upset of respondents' significant others about their caring for AIDS patients and favorable attitudes of the respondents about professional and social concerns related to AIDS."
9130411,"OBJECTIVE: To assess determinants of happiness and life satisfaction in elderly Zimbabweans. DESIGN: Community based cross sectional survey. SETTING: Randomly selected villages and two urban areas in north eastern Zimbabwe. SUBJECTS: 278 subjects aged 60 to 92 years (124 male, 154 female). METHOD: One subject per randomly selected household was interviewed, at home, by a trained interviewer to complete a questionnaire. RESULTS: Independent determinants of happiness were: rural residence, whether children gave material support and satisfaction with financial circumstances. [Adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals 0.25 (0.13 to 0.49), 0.45 (0.22 to 0.94) and 0.11 (0.01 to 0.87) respectively]. Independent determinants of life satisfaction were: feeling better off than their neighbours, receiving adequate respect from their children and satisfaction with financial circumstances. [Adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals 0.73 (0.59 to 0.91), 0.13 (0.03 to 0.59) and 0.24 (0.1 to 0.61) respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that, despite physical hardship, the majority of Zimbabwean elders are happy and 50% are satisfied with their lives and we have identified independent determinants of happiness and life satisfaction in this group. Characterization of these determinants allows us to predict that social changes such as rural/urban migration, declining family support and diminishing respect from children will have a negative effect on happiness and life satisfaction in our elders. It is important that, when planning intervention programmes for the elderly, these facets of wellbeing are not neglected."
9148317,"A four-factor control model was used to test the contextual determinants in adolescents' sense of control on a coping scale. Outpatients, matched for age and gender, completed the Tiffany Control Scales. Analyses confirmed the hypotheses that 52 who scored as externalizing compared to those 40 scoring as internalizing showed greater coping in response to different contextual determinants defined as situations."
20198904,"Drug use is a complex behavior with multidimensional determinants, including social, psychological, cultural, economic, and biological factors. Blood borne viral infections including hepatitis C virus are transmitted when an uninfected intravenous drug user (IVDU) uses injection equipment, especially syringes, that have previously been used by an infected person. The transmission can also result from sharing other injection equipment such as 'cookers' and 'cottons'. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse have declined substantially since the introduction of needle exchange. Infection with hepatitis C may spontaneously resolve during the acute stage and never progress to chronic infection, or the infection may become chronic without medical complications, or the infection may become chronic with progressive medical complications. Regular testing for infection is an important strategy for secondary prevention of chronic hepatitis C infection. Care for hepatitis C is a vital component of a comprehensive health program for persons using illicit drugs. Such care includes screening for transmission risk behavior, prevention counseling and education, testing for HCV antibody and RNA. IDUs found to have chronic HCV infection should be assessed for the presence and degree of liver disease and evaluated for treatment for HCV Hepatitis C care also requires providing access to treatment for substance use and abuse. Therapy with opioid agonists, including methadone maintenance treatment, has been shown to diminish and often eliminate opioid use and reduce transmission of infection. Approval of buprenorphine makes office-based pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction possible. When considering treatment for hepatitis C, particular attention must be paid to mental health conditions. As a group, IDUs exhibit higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders than the general population. IFN-based regimens for hepatitis C are often complicated by neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including depression, insomnia, and irritability. Strong linkages with mental health services, whether on-site or within the community, are a vital component of comprehensive health programs for IDUs and are particularly important during treatment for hepatitis C. Past episodes of depression or other psychiatric disorders are not absolute contraindications for the treatment for HCV infection. Some authors recommend prophylactic antidepressant therapy before initiating treatment for HCV in patients thought to be at a high risk of depression."
8227095,"The associations of social and behavioural factors on preterm birth in Singapore were studied using hospital maternity records of 20,723 consecutive singleton births between January 1986 and November 1991. The overall proportion of preterm births was 3.6%, the rates for the Chinese, Malay and Indian groups being 3.2%, 3.8% and 4.9% respectively. Teenage mothers were at a higher risk of preterm labour compared to women aged 20-29 years. The incidence of preterm labour decreased with increasing educational status. Preterm births were six times more likely in women who had no antenatal care. Women who had three or more previous births were at a higher risk, while those who had one or two previous births were at a lower risk compared to women who had none."
9017281,"Two recent developments have thrown into bold relief the importance of environmental forces in determining the prevalence of human obesity. The first is genetic studies that estimate the heritability of human obesity at no more than 33%. The second is the 33% increase in the prevalence of obesity in the USA during the past decade. The importance of the environment in influencing obesity is matched only by the extent of our ignorance of how it exerts its effects and of how we may favourably alter them. The most thoroughly studied measure of environmental influences is socioeconomic status. Among women in developed societies socioeconomic status is strongly (negatively) correlated with the prevalence of obesity: the lower the social class the more the obesity. Prospective studies have shown that this correlation reflects, in part, causation: socioeconomic status helps to determine the prevalence of obesity and thinness. Likewise, the presence of obesity helps to determine socioeconomic status. In developing societies there is also a strong relationship between socioeconomic status and obesity, but it is a positive one: the higher the socioeconomic status the more the obesity. Unfortunately, we know of few other social determinants of obesity and studies on the social determinants of this disorder are desperately needed."
8171295,"Quality of Life (QOL) is a composite descriptor applied to an unlimited spectrum of tangible and intangible parameters of life satisfaction and capacity. Because of the breadth of determinants of QOL, most researchers prefer to focus on a specific segment of it, such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Generally, HRQOL indices incorporate physical, emotional and social aspects of both health perception and function. Most instruments are also subjective and quantitative. As in clinical trials, several elements are critical to the development of a HRQOL measure. Most importantly, the putative application of the instrument should be determined beforehand. The clinical setting and disease-specific population of interest must be identified. The questionnaire must be as simple as possible and easy to administer. The final instrument must be shown to be a valid measure of HRQOL, which is reproducible, with limited variability and observer bias on repeated administrations, when no clinical change has occurred. If applicable, the instrument should demonstrate responsiveness to important changes in clinical status. Finally, the value of the instrument in relevant clinical studies should be demonstrated. The critical phases of development of the McMaster IBDQ are outlined. The IBDQ is a quantitative index of HRQOL intended as a measure of therapeutic outcome for clinical trials in patients with inflammatory bowel disease."
10607798,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that, in addition to genetic liability and environment in early childhood, intrauterine life also influences the risk for asthma beyond childhood. Low birth weight, prematurity, young maternal age, and maternal smoking have all shown an association with asthma. The effect of perinatal factors on the risk for asthma in relation to familial and social risk factors was studied in a nationwide population-based sample of adolescent twins. In addition to a distribution of birth characteristics among twins which differs from that of singletons, data on twins enable a distinction to be made between genetic and environmental sources of variation. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to five consecutive birth cohorts of Finnish 16 year old twins born in 1975-9 and to their parents (3065 families). The outcome measure was life time prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma in these adolescents. The association between asthma and potential risk factors was assessed by multiple logistic regression and discordant twin pair analysis. RESULTS: Risk for asthma increased with increasing ponderal index (p for trend <0.01) and decreasing maternal age (p for trend <0.05). Among the 25% of twins with the highest ponderal index, the odds ratio for asthma was 1.82 (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.79) compared with those in the lowest 25%. Neither birth weight, gestational age, nor Apgar score was associated with asthma. When perinatal risk factors were combined with familial and social risk factors, ponderal index, maternal smoking, parental asthma, and sibship size were all significant independent determinants of asthma in these adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The risk for asthma in adolescent twins increases with increasing ponderal index when adjusted for familial and social factors."
7959400,"The main determinants of rehospitalization of elderly people were studied with a longitudinal sample of 264 persons older than 60 years at a midwestern, urban, university-affiliated hospital. Path analysis was applied to survey data collected for this study. Seventeen percent of subjects were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Controlling for health and socioeconomic factors, the main determinant of readmission was the discharge placement; those placed back into the community for care in the home were more likely to be rehospitalized than those discharged to institutions. Contrary to predictions in the literature and the authors' expectations, patient involvement in discharge planning had no discernible effect on placement decisions and subsequent hospitalization. The implications of these findings for discharge planning by social workers are discussed."
19811603,"CONTEXT: India has rudimentary and fragmented primary health care (PHC) and family medicine systems, yet it also has the policy expectation that PHC should meet the needs of extremely large populations with slums and difficult to reach groups, rapid social and epidemiological transition from developing to developed nation profiles. Historically, the system has lacked impetus to achieve PHC. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of PHC approaches and the current state of PHC and family medicine in India in order to assess the opportunities for their revitalization. METHODS: A narrative review of the published and grey literature on PHC, family medicine, Web2.0 and health informatics key papers and policy documents, pertinent to India. OUTCOMES: A conceptual framework and recommendations for policy makers and practitioner audiences. FINDINGS: PHC is constructed through systems of local providers who address individual, family and local community basic health needs with strong community participation. Successful PHC is a pre-eminent strategy for India to address the determinants of health and the almost chaotic of massive social transition in its institutions and health care sector. There is a lack of an articulated comprehensive framework for the publicly stated goals of improving health and implementing PHC. Also, there exists a very limited education and organization of a medical and PHC workforce who are trained and resourced to address individual, family and local community health and who have become increasingly specialized. However, emerging technology, Health2.0 and user generated health care informatics, which are largely conducted through mobile phones, are co-evolving patient-driven health systems, and potentially enhance PHC and family medicine workforce development. CONCLUSIONS: In order to improve health outcomes in an equitable manner in India, there is a pressing need for a framework for implementing PHC. The co-emergence of information technologies accessible to the mass population and user-driven health care provide a potential catalyst or innovation for this transition."
2033940,"The pattern of use of alcoholic beverages and factors influencing it among Barcelona schoolchildren were studied; 2,255 fifth and eighth grade students from 71 schools completed a self-administered questionnaire. Between fifth-eighth grades, important changes take place in attitudes--strongly opposed to alcohol among the younger, much more moderate among the older. Family celebrations such as Christmas or birthdays are the earliest source of exposure to alcohol, at which one-third of fifth grade students and two-thirds of eighth grade students drink. In eighth grade, though daily consumption is relatively rare (4.4% for boys), a considerable proportion have been drunk at least once (16% of girls and 19% of boys) or have had four or more drinks in a row, while a small but significant proportion (2.5%) have been drunk two or more times in the last six months. A discriminant analysis uncovered some features predicting this ""higher risk"" use of alcohol: age and gender (being a boy in eighth grade), lower socioeconomic status, higher weekly allowance available for personal expenses, a pattern of usual consumption by both the father and friends, smoking regularly, and having a moderate or high physical activity level, as well as holding opinions in favor of drinking."
1525438,"Resident and staff activity was observed in two hospital-based staffed houses for adults with severe or profound mental handicap, and seriously challenging behaviours. The results indicated that: (1) staffing resources were inefficiently deployed, leading to low levels of support being provided to service users; (2) staff attention was inequitably distributed across users, individuals showing the highest levels of seriously challenging behaviours received disproportionately more staff attention; (3) users spent little of the time they were observed engaged in constructive activities. Comparisons with data collected previously on four of the users in institutional settings indicated that: (4) no overall changes occurred in either user participation in constructive activities or (5) duration of challenging behaviours; and (6) overall, more staff contact was provided in the specialized housing projects compared to previous institutional settings. The results are discussed in terms of the determinants of quality in residential provision for people with seriously challenging behaviour."
8738549,"Using data from the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (1988), this study investigates the factors that determine the nutritional status of children under five years of age. Several sociocultural, economic, and demographic variables were selected for the study. These independent variables were regressed against three proxy measures of malnutrition: height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height. The results show that the nutritional status of a child is determined by a variety of factors that are biological, social, cultural, and economic in nature, namely, birth status, birth weight, diarrhoeal status, duration of breastfeeding, and residence. The study concludes that most of the factors that account for malnutrition in children in Zimbabwe are preventable."
9004368,"The aim was to study the associations of childhood living conditions, together with past and present socioeconomic status, with adult health among Finnish men and women. The data were derived from a nationwide interview Survey on Living Conditions collected by Statistics Finland in 1986. The sample represents the non-institutional Finnish population aged 15 years or older. The number of respondents was 12,057 and the response rate 87%. In this study we analysed 30-year-old and older subjects. Two health indicators were analysed: first, limiting long-standing illness; and second, self-assessed health as ""below good"". Four different indicators of childhood living conditions were included: one concerning economic problems, and three concerning family related social problems during childhood. Additionally, the degree of urbanisation of the childhood living area was examined. Past and present socioeconomic status were measured by the status of origin, i.e. the respondent's father's and mother's education, and the status of destination, i.e. the respondent's own current education. Economic problems during childhood were associated with current health. The association of childhood social problems with health was somewhat weaker and less consistent than that of economic problems. A comparison of the mutual impacts of economic and social problems, respectively, shows that economic problems are stronger and more independent determinants of adult health than social problems. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, past and, particularly, present socioeconomic status are both important determinants of adult health. Current socioeconomic status showed strongest associations with adult health, but living conditions during upbringing, particularly economic problems and status of origin, were also significant predictors."
17029939,"BACKGROUND: Although social disparities in survival for patients with cancer are documented in an increasing number of papers, knowledge on the underlying mechanisms concerning screening, diagnosis, treatment or follow-up, is relatively poor. Our study was aimed at investigating the social determinants of access to reference cancer care centres for surgery for colorectal cancer in France. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted on population-based data from a specialised cancer registry (County of Calvados, France). The population consisted of 5156 patients with surgical treatment for colorectal cancer recorded between January 1st 1981 and December 31st 2000. RESULTS: The probability of being cared for in a reference care centre was 1.3-fold lower for people living in a deprived district (mean income < 15000 euros) and 3-fold lower for people living in a district where more than 7% of houses were devoid of bath and shower in comparison with districts where this rate was under 2%. After adjustment for distance from reference care centre, the probability of being cared for in a reference care centre was still over one third lower for people living in a district with more than 7% of houses devoid of bath and shower. Social disparities in management of patients with colorectal cancer have increased in the last decade. The reduction of access to reference care with distance was stronger in elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a social and geographical determination of type of treatment centre for care management of colorectal cancer in France. Special attention needs to be paid to the high quality of care management in non-specialised care centres in order to avoid an increased social gradient in cancer mortality in France."
19957596,"OBJECTIVE: To understand emotional, behavioral problems and related determinants among rural stranded children and to provide evidence for further psychological support. METHODS: A total of 3944 caregivers of children in the rural areas and aged 4 to 7 years but without parents around, were randomly selected. Data were collected through Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (the edition for parents, SDQ). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of children with behavioral/emotional problems was 43.6% among those stranded children including 8.3% having experienced emotional symptoms, 9.5% reported to be displaying 'conduct' problems, 8.7% exhibited significant hyperactivity/inattention, 18.9% experienced peer relationship problems and 16.8% having prosocial behaviors. The prevalence of behavioral/emotional problems was significantly higher in boys than those in girls and in lower age groups. Significant differences were also found in conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and prosocial behaviors (P<0.01). The result from logistic regression analysis showed that factors as education level and motivation of the caregivers as well as financial support from the parents were related to emotional/ behavioral problems among the stranded children. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems was high among children living the rural areas but without their parents around which should call for psychological intervention."
10094291,"To document the levels and the determinants of dichloro-dyphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) metabolites in maternal milk, we conducted a cohort study of 50 adult females who lived in Mexico City. We measured social and dietary characteristics via interview. Levels of DDT metabolites were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The mean values (lipid milk basis) were 0.162 ppm p,p'-DDT; 0.138 ppm o,p'-DDT; and 0.594 ppm 2,2(bis)p-chlorophyenyl-1-1-dichloroethylene (DDE). The main determinants of DDT metabolites were maternal age, lifetime lactation, history of living in an agricultural area, and consumption of salted meat and fish. We estimated that 6.0% of the breast-fed babies had daily intakes of DDT above the level of 0.005 mg/kg d recommended by the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (WHO/FAO). Health-outcomes research among children is needed, and investigators should design or adjust current surveillance programs."
19276334,"Globally, research on social determinants of health has built a considerable knowledge base over the last decade. Still, not much of this research has been carried out in the extremely poor areas of the world, like for instance Africa south of the Sahara. In very poor ruralities, classic indicators of socioeconomic status are not well suited. Few people have any education, monetary income is not a good measure of material standing and people cannot be classified by occupation as they make their livelihood from a variety of activities. For efforts towards health equity to benefit the poorest of the poor, more suitable indicators of social health determinants must be identified. Health research might benefit from knowledge developed in neighbouring fields like development research, anthropology and sociology."
15544638,"BACKGROUND: In the past decade, the countries that emerged from the Soviet Union have experienced major changes in the inherited Soviet model of health care, which was centrally planned and provided universal, free access to basic care. The underlying principle of universality remains, but coexists with new funding and delivery systems and growing out-of-pocket payments. OBJECTIVE: To examine patterns and determinants of health care utilization, the extent of payment for health care, and the settings in which care is obtained in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine. METHODS: Data were derived from cross-sectional surveys, representative of adults aged 18 and over in each country, conducted in 2001. Multistage random sample of 18,428 individuals, stratified by region and area, was obtained. Instrument contained extensive data on demographic, economic, and social characteristics, administered face-to-face. The analysis explored the health seeking behavior of users and nonusers (those reporting an episode of illness but not consulting). RESULTS: In the preceding year, over half of all respondents visited a medical professional, ranging from 65.7 percent in Belarus to 24.4 percent in Georgia, mostly at local primary care facilities. Of those reporting an illness, 20.7 percent of all did not consult although they felt they should have done so, varying from 9.4 percent in Belarus to 42.4 percent in Armenia and 49 percent in Georgia. The main reason for not seeking care was lack of money to pay for treatment (45.2 percent), self-treatment with home-produced remedies (32.9 percent), and purchase of nonprescribed medicine (21.8 percent). There are marked differences between countries; unaffordability was a particularly common factor in Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova (78 percent, 70 percent, 54 percent), and much lower in Belarus and Russia. In Georgia and Armenia, 65 percent and 56 percent of those who had consulted paid out-of-pocket, in the form of money, gifts, or both; these figures were 8 percent and 19 percent in Belarus and Russia respectively and 31.2 percent overall. The probability of not consulting a health professional when seriously ill was significantly higher among those over age 65, and with lower education. Use of health care was markedly lower among those with fewer household assets or a shortage of money, and those dissatisfied with their material resources, factors that explained some of the effects of age. A lack of social support (formal and informal) decreases further the probability of not consulting, adding to the consequences of poor financial status. The probability of seeking care for common conditions varies widely among countries (persistent fever: 56 percent in Belarus; 16 percent in Armenia) and home remedies, alcohol, and direct purchase of pharmaceuticals are commonly used. Informal coping strategies, such as use of connections (36.7 percent) or offering money to health professionals (28.5 percent) are seen as acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: This article provides the first comparative assessment of inequalities in access to health care in multiple countries of the former Soviet Union, using rigorous methodology. The emerging model across the region is extremely diverse. Some countries (Belarus, Russia) have managed to maintain access for most people, while in others the situation is near collapse (Armenia, Georgia). Access is most problematic in health systems characterized by high levels of payment for care and a breakdown of gate-keeping, although these are seen in countries facing major problems such as economic collapse and, in some, a legacy of civil war. There are substantial inequalities within each country and even where access remains adequate there are concerns about its sustainability."
9612838,"BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated that physical activity serves an important preventive function against the development of cardiovascular disease. The recognition that U.S. children are often sedentary, coupled with the observation that physical activity habits tend to persist into adulthood, has prompted the investigation of exercise determinants consistent with social learning theory. The purposes of the present study were to identify social learning variables relevant to children's exercise and to explore the longitudinal predictive value of the determinants. METHODS: Data were collected from 111 families (N = 54 girls, N = 57 boys) who were interviewed in both Phase 1 (fifth and sixth grades) and Phase 2 (eight and ninth grades) of this study. Data from mothers (N = 111) were collected during both phases; data from 80 fathers were collected at Phase 2 only. RESULTS: The results of simultaneous stepwise regression analyses indicated that child's enjoyment of physical activity was the only consistent predictor of physical activity during Phase 1. At Phase 2, child's exercise knowledge, mother's physical activity, and child's and mother's friend modeling/support emerged as predictors for girls. For boys, child's self-efficacy for physical activity, exercise knowledge, parental modeling, and interest in sports media were important. Longitudinally, mother's self-efficacy, barriers to exercise, enjoyment of physical activity, and child's self-efficacy for physical activity were important for girls. Only child's exercise knowledge predicted boys' physical activity. The addition of information from fathers nearly doubled the explanatory power of the predictors for both genders. CONCLUSIONS: Socialization in the family unit exerts a tremendous influence on health-related behaviors such as exercise. The relative importance of determinants seems to differ for girls and boys and the pattern of these determinants appears to change over time."
17905053,"OBJECTIVES: Sickness absence is a major occupational health problem, but evidence for associations between potentially modifiable psychosocial work factors and sickness absence is still scarce. We studied the impact of relational justice and effort-reward imbalance on subsequent rates of sickness absence. METHODS: The Whitehall II prospective cohort study of British civil servants, 10,308 men and women, was established between 1985 and 1988. Indicators of effort-reward imbalance and the relational component of organizational justice were constructed from questions included at baseline. Participants were classified into three groups (low, intermediate, and high) for both effort-reward imbalance and relational justice. Short (< or =7 days) and long (>7 days) spells of sickness absence during 1985-1989 and 1991-1995 were used to study immediate and longer term effects of work characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, employment grade, and baseline health, men and women with low relational justice had increased risks of long spells of sickness absence of 14% and 28% in comparison to men and women experiencing high levels of justice. Similar effect sizes (25% and 21%) were found for high vs. low effort-reward imbalance. Both work measures also predicted short spells of sickness absence. Effort-reward imbalance (men and women) and relational justice (women only) each predicted long spells of sickness absence independently of the other. CONCLUSIONS: Both relational justice and effort-reward imbalance are important determinants of sickness absence. Workplace interventions to improve these aspects of working conditions have the potential to reduce levels of sickness absence."
10079398,"Wilkinson's ""income inequality and social cohesion"" model has emerged as a leading research program in social epidemiology. Public health scholars and activists working toward the elimination of social inequalities in health can find several appealing features in Wilkinson's research. In particular, it provides a sociological alternative to former models that emphasize poverty, health behaviors, or the cultural aspects of social relations as determinants of population health. Wilkinson's model calls for social explanations, avoids the subjectivist legacy of U.S. functionalist sociology that is evident in ""status"" approaches to understanding social inequalities in health, and calls for broad policies of income redistribution. Nevertheless, Wilkinson's research program has characteristics that limit its explanatory power and its ability to inform social policies directed toward reducing social inequalities in health. The model ignores class relations, an approach that might help explain how income inequalities are generated and account for both relative and absolute deprivation. Furthermore, Wilkinson's model implies that social cohesion rather than political change is the major determinant of population health. Historical evidence suggests that class formation could determine both reductions in social inequalities and increases in social cohesion. Drawing on recent examples, the authors argue that an emphasis on social cohesion can be used to render communities responsible for their mortality and morbidity rates: a community-level version of ""blaming the victim."" Such use of social cohesion is related to current policy initiatives in the United States and Britain under the New Democrat and New Labor governments."
17307954,"Women and men are different as regards their biology, the roles and responsibilities that society assigns to them and their position in the family and community. These factors have a great influence on causes, consequences and management of diseases and ill-health and on the efficacy of health promotion policies and programmes. This is confirmed by evidence on male-female differences in cause-specific mortality and morbidity and exposure to risk factors. Health promoting interventions aimed at ensuring safe and supportive environments, healthy living conditions and lifestyles, community involvement and participation, access to essential facilities and to social and health services need to address these differences between women and men, boys and girls in an equitable manner in order to be effective. The aim of this paper is to (i) demonstrate that health promotion policies that take women's and men's differential biological and social vulnerability to health risks and the unequal power relationships between the sexes into account are more likely to be successful and effective compared to policies that are not concerned with such differences, and (ii) discuss what is required to build a multisectoral policy response to gender inequities in health through health promotion and disease prevention. The requirements discussed in the paper include i) the establishment of joint commitment for policy within society through setting objectives related to gender equality and equity in health as well as health promotion, ii) an assessment and analysis of gender inequalities affecting health and determinants of health, iii) the actions needed to tackle the main determinants of those inequalities and iv) documentation and dissemination of effective and gender sensitive policy interventions to promote health. In the discussion of these key policy elements, we use illustrative examples of good practices from different countries around the world."

12287173,"""Ecological demography arises from two facts: that the reproductive behavior of humans, like that of other species, is influenced by natural selection and that current fitness is the product of both genotype and environment. Here I review classic atheoretical and recent theoretical studies that contribute to this emerging field, exploring the extent to which human reproductive responses to ecological conditions, considered in their broadest context, follow the same selective rules as other species."""
9683377,"This paper contributes to debates on the broad determinants of health and on the policy shift from curative to preventive and protective interventions. It addresses empirically the relative importance of influences on health with a multiple regression analysis of ecologic data from the 49 counties of Ontario. One model achieved high predictive power (that is, Adj R2 > 75%, p < 0.0001). Educational levels were a strong predictor of population health, showing a consistent inverse relationship with premature mortality ratios for both sexes and it was the strongest predictor for females. A low income variable supplied the strongest prediction for male mortality. This variable displayed a positive association with male mortality. Municipal expenditures on environmental protection exerted a negative effect on male mortality. These findings raise questions about the current directions of health policy in Ontario where the provincial government has reduced funding to social and environmental programs, while promising to maintain health care funding."
11048582,"Aiming to analyze the mild to moderate growth retardation associate factors in children at school age, a case control study was conducted with 153 pairs of seven and eight years old children from public schools of the outskirts of the city. The cases were defined as children with a height for age(H/A) between -1 and -2 Z score, according to NCHS/WHO standards, and matched with a H/A +/- 0.5 Z-score children of same age, gender, school, classroom and class time, as controls. The height was measured at school according to WHO rules by trained professionals, and household visits were carried out to obtain environmental and socio-economic data. Initially the data was analyzed by the univariate conditional method and then, the statistically significant variables were included in a model of multivariate logistic regression analysis. As a result, the risk factors remaining at the end of the multivariate analyses, by Odds Ratio and it's 95% Confidence Interval were respectively:--mother's height: for each decrease of one standard deviation the OR increased 1.84(CI: 1.35 to 2.49); inadequate feeding pattern: OR = 2.12; CI: 1.17 to 3.83, very low socio-economic level: OR = 9.2; CI: 3.35 to 25.13, low birth weight: OR = 2.59; CI: 1.44 to 4.63 and smoking during pregnancy: OR = 1.75; CI: 0.98 to 3.12. These results highlight the environment as a determinant factor for growth performance during the first years of the child's life. Despite this, the significant OR for Mother's height allows the assumption that besides the environment, the parent's height has to be considered as one of the determinants of height deficit, even for the low socioeconomic level."
17261528,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the preferences of French elderly inpatients concerning medical information and surrogate designation in life-threatening situations. METHODS: Intention-to-act questionnaire was completed by two geriatricians during a patient interview in the week following admission in three geriatric units in France. The participants were elderly patients (> or =70 years) with adequate cognitive performance for decision making as assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination. The impact of socio-demographic factors, level of confidence in medical care, cognitive or physical disability on surrogate designation and amount of medical information expected were measured. MEASUREMENTS: Impact of socio-demographic factors, level of confidence in medical care, cognitive or physical disability on surrogate designation and amount of medical information expected. RESULTS: 426 consecutive elderly patients were recruited. 32.6% wanted to receive complete information about their care and 77% declared they would want to be informed if they were in a life-threatening situation. 4.5% reported they would not want any medical information. A family member was designated as surrogate by 73% of the patients. In 28%, a second surrogate was also designated, usually the family physician (22%) or a member of the hospital medical staff (10%). Polytomous logistic regression analysis was used to assess determinants of the amount of information expected and social and medical parameters. MMSE score, the presence of physical disability, a low level of confidence in medicine and the presence of children were identified as independent determinants of a high level of information expectation. CONCLUSION: Elderly hospitalised patients expressed a strong desire to receive extensive information and were willing to designate a surrogate in a life-threatening situation. The surrogate was usually a family member alone or with another person, usually a practitioner."
12191540,"An explanatory framework, referred to as the attitude/social influence/self-efficacy-model (ASE-model), was utilised to explain future self-reported adherence of adolescents to daily inhaled prophylactic asthma medication. The objective was to investigate the long-term influence of these earlier reported cognitive variables and other psychological and medical determinants on self-reported adherence 1 year later. Data were collected, via a questionnaire, from 86 adolescents with asthma (aged 11 through 18 years) recruited from outpatient clinics. Adherence was assessed by asking the patients to give themselves a report mark for adherence. The results of the multiple regression analyses showed that the three major ASE-variables were predictors of self-reported adherence to a moderate degree (R(2)=0.21). Previous self-reported adherence was found to be the best predictor of self-reported adherence to prophylactic asthma medication 1 year later (R(2)=0.45). The results of this study could be useful in the development of interventions to enhance adherence to asthma medication. In future, such interventions should focus on feelings of shame about having asthma and promoting healthy habits, such as adherence to medication."
18226218,"BACKGROUND: Europe has experienced warmer summers in the past two decades and there is a need to describe the determinants of heat-related mortality to better inform public health activities during hot weather. We investigated the effect of high temperatures on daily mortality in three cities in Europe (Budapest, London, and Milan), using a standard approach. METHODS: An ecological time-series study of daily mortality was conducted in three cities using Poisson generalized linear models allowing for over-dispersion. Secular trends in mortality and seasonal confounding factors were controlled for using cubic smoothing splines of time. Heat exposure was modelled using average values of the temperature measure on the same day as death (lag 0) and the day before (lag 1). The heat effect was quantified assuming a linear increase in risk above a cut-point for each city. Socio-economic status indicators and census data were linked with mortality data for stratified analyses. RESULTS: The risk of heat-related death increased with age, and females had a greater risk than males in age groups > or =65 years in London and Milan. The relative risks of mortality (per degrees C) above the heat cut-point by gender and age were: (i) Male 1.10 (95%CI: 1.07-1.12) and Female 1.07 (1.05-1.10) for 75-84 years, (ii) M 1.10 (1.06-1.14) and F 1.08 (1.06-1.11) for > or = or =85 years in Budapest (> or =24 degrees C); (i) M 1.03 (1.01-1.04) and F 1.07 (1.05-1.09), (ii) M 1.05 (1.03-1.07) and F 1.08 (1.07-1.10) in London (> or =20 degrees C); and (i) M 1.08 (1.03-1.14) and F 1.20 (1.15-1.26), (ii) M 1.18 (1.11-1.26) and F 1.19 (1.15-1.24) in Milan (> or =26 degrees C). Mortality from external causes increases at higher temperatures as well as that from respiratory and cardiovascular disease. There was no clear evidence of effect modification by socio-economic status in either Budapest or London, but there was a seemingly higher risk for affluent non-elderly adults in Milan. CONCLUSION: We found broadly consistent determinants (age, gender, and cause of death) of heat related mortality in three European cities using a standard approach. Our results are consistent with previous evidence for individual determinants, and also confirm the lack of a strong socio-economic gradient in heat health effects currently in Europe."
9801018,"There are no recent population-based data on the prevalence of hearing loss in older adults using standard audiometric testing. The population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study was designed to measure the prevalence of hearing loss in adults aged 48-92 years, residing in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. Hearing thresholds were measured with standardized protocols using pure-tone air- and bone-conduction audiometry in sound-treated booths. The examination also included an otoscopic evaluation, screening tympanogram, and a questionnaire on hearing-related medical history, noise exposure, other potential risk factors, and self-perceived hearing handicap. Of the 4,541 eligible people, 3,753 (82.6%) participated in the hearing study (1993-1995). The average age of participants was 65.8 years, and 57.7% were women. The prevalence of hearing loss was 45.9%. The odds of hearing loss increased with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.88 for 5 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80-1.97) and were greater for men than women (OR = 4.42, 95% CI 3.73-5.24). The male excess of hearing loss remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, education, noise exposure, and occupation (OR = 3.65). These results demonstrate that hearing loss is a very common problem affecting older adults. Epidemiologic studies are needed to understand the genetic, environmental, and sex-related determinants of age-related hearing loss and to identify potential intervention strategies."
9245679,"BACKGROUND: Within the CINDI framework, a European ""Quit and Win"" contest was organized in 1994. In Finland the number of participants was 5,879 (0.6% of smokers). In the CINDI demonstration area, North Karelia (NK), the participants numbered 618 (2.0% of smokers). This study compared abstinence maintenance among the participants in NK with the rates found elsewhere in Finland and analyzed determinants for successful quitting. METHODS: A follow-up study was conducted 12 months after the quit date with a sample of 2,114 participants. Response rates of 67-68% were achieved (n = 1,419). The abstinence was assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months. Two estimates are presented: (1) the proportion of abstainers among the respondents and (2) the proportion of abstainers among the sample, considering all nonrespondents smokers. The determinants for maintenance of smoking cessation were analyzed with logistic regression. RESULTS: Using the first estimate, the rates at 1/6/12 months were 75/36/28% in NK and 70/28/21% elsewhere (P < 0.01). Using the second estimate, the corresponding rates were 50/24/19% in NK and 46/19/14% elsewhere. The most significant determinants for successful quitting were sex, age, marital status, level of withdrawal symptoms, previous quitting attempts, and support received. CONCLUSIONS: The recruitment of smokers and the maintained cessation were more successful in the demonstration area. The difference between areas was explained by differences in the combined professional and lay support and by the sex and age distributions."
1634431,"Many individuals who exhibit self-injurious behavior (SIB) also exhibit self-restraint. Three hypotheses about the determinants of self-restraint have been suggested: (a) Self-restraint is maintained by escape from or avoidance of aversive aspects of SIB, (b) self-restraint and SIB are members of the same functional class, and (c) self-restraint and SIB are functionally independent. This study examined a method by which the relationship between self-restraint and SIB may be investigated using functional analysis. Data were collected on the self-restraint and SIB exhibited by 5 mentally retarded males, while conditions suspected to maintain SIB were manipulated. Results suggested that self-restraint, like SIB, may be maintained by idiosyncratic contingencies. Implications of an understanding of self-restraint for the analysis and treatment of SIB are discussed, as are some general possibilities for future research."
7664129,"Following two previous articles which described changes that are occurring in suicide rates and trends in factors known to be associated with suicides, this article examines in greater depth the effect of occupation and geography on suicide mortality. For both men and women the highest risk occupations are mostly in Social Class I or II. The occupations at highest risk, which include several medical-related professions, and the method of suicide they choose, suggest that easy access to means of suicide is an important factor. Suicide rates for men aged 15-44 are generally higher in Inner London, rural areas, resort and retirement areas, and urban manufacturing areas."
8683633,"BACKGROUND: We and others have previously described a number of characteristics that are associated with delays in diagnosis and increased risk for inadequate treatment of older women and men with cancer. These characteristics include poor social support, limited access to transportation, and impaired cognition. However, there is little information on how these factors influence survival of older cancer patients. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine which patient characteristics predicted survival up to 10 years after the diagnosis of cancer. METHODS: In 1984, we initiated a population-based study of men and women who were 65 years of age or older, living in a six-county area of New Mexico, and newly diagnosed with cancer. For 646 individuals with cancer of the breast (n = 188), prostate (n = 247), or colon or rectum (n = 211), we assessed patient baseline characteristics, disease stage at diagnosis, and adequacy of treatment (definitive or nondefinitive) as determinants of survival for up to 10 years following diagnosis. Multivariate survival models were used to analyze the data; all P values were two-sided. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, we first included all patient characteristics, except the stage at diagnosis and the adequacy of treatment. In this initial analysis, the following were among variables that were significantly associated with patient survival: age, education, cancer knowledge, ethnic group, and cognitive status. When stage at diagnosis and adequacy of treatment were added to the model, both advanced stage at diagnosis (hazard ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval inverted question markCI inverted question mark = 1.3-2.1] for diagnosis at regional stage versus local stage; hazard ratio = 3.0 [95% CI = 2.0-4.7] for distant stage versus local stage) and inadequate treatment (hazard ratio = 1.6 [95% CI = 1.1-2.3]) were associated with poor survival. However, adding stage at diagnosis and adequacy of treatment to the analysis had little influence on the magnitude of the effect of patient characteristics on survival. In separate analyses of patient data by cancer site, receipt of nondefinitive therapy was associated with increased mortality among patients with colon/rectal cancer (hazard ratio = 7.8 [95% CI = 2.8-21.4]) and breast cancer (hazard ratio = 2.2 [95% CI = 1.1-4.3]) but not among patients with prostate cancer (hazard ratio = 1.0 [95% CI = 0.6-1.9]). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced stage at diagnosis and inadequate treatment of older cancer patients are associated with poor survival. Impaired cognition and inadequate education in elderly patients are also associated with poor survival. This decreased survival does not appear to be a consequence of known barriers to health care that are responsible for delays in diagnosis and for inadequate treatment. IMPLICATIONS: Efforts to facilitate early diagnosis and receipt of definitive treatment for cancer in older individuals may improve their survival."

12197201,"Spain has been a crossroads, for confrontation and peaceful living-together. The problems arising from immigration as a mass phenomenon are characteristic of the present times. Variables which define the immigration phenomenon are the attraction to the economically developed countries with an active labour market, while it is inversely related to the distance from the departure countries. The phenomenon is also modified by positive influences as the common language, and by negative factors as the political or social instability. The aging of the populations in developed countries, and the need of labour market, stimulate the immigration phenomenon, which may affect to 2.3% of the population. The reproductive capacity of the population depends not only on biological determinants but also on the heterogeneous culture of immigration, because immigrants are candidates to become stable members of society. There is a logic of discrimination of those which are different. Thus, we need a legislation to establish their rights and duties, as well as an integration policy to favour the cultural diversity."
12282988,"The authors examine the determinants of the personal distribution of income and wealth using an overlapping generations model in which all individuals are assumed to be identical except for their inherited wealth. ""It is shown that, in general, higher tax rates reduce distributive inequality as long as the rate of interest is exogenously given. In steady state, however, where the rate of interest is determined endogenously, increasing taxation and higher social security payments both diminish the capital labor ratio so that the rate of interest rises. If this interest effect is strong enough then it may outbalance the tendency toward more equality because higher interest rates enhance initial differences in the distribution of both income and wealth and, eventually, the inequality in the distribution of income and wealth in the society."" The geographical focus is on developed countries."
7882876,"Research on unemployment has paid only little attention to drinking and drinking problems. From the 1970s onwards the association of drinking and unemployment has come under systematic study. Contrasting tendencies emerge from this research. This paper distinguishes three instances of drinking and drinking problems and examines their association with employment status, i.e., (i) frequency of drinking, (ii) frequency of intoxication, and (iii) frequency of health problems due to drinking. A panel survey was conducted in 1983-1984, consisting of a sample of Finnish men and women, originally jobseekers in industry. Prevalence data and results of logistic regression analyses on the association of the three instances of drinking and drinking problems with employment status are presented. The frequency of drinking was unassociated with employment status for men and women at either of the two measurement points. Neither did the frequency of intoxication show any clear association with employment status. In contrast, the frequency of health problems due to drinking was associated in a statistically significant way with unemployment among men. Among women the association was rather the opposite, but it was not statistically significant. The paper concludes that it is important to distinguish between overall drinking and drinking problems, and between the determinants of male and female drinking problems. It is likely that selective processes at the labour market as well as social causation during unemployment lie behind the observed association of male unemployment and drinking problems."
9353675,"With a tenth of the labour force involuntarily out of work, unemployment has become an important element among the socioeconomic determinants of health in the rich countries. Unemployed men have an excess cancer mortality of close to 25% compared with that of all men in the labour force. The available data from various countries indicate that this excess risk is found both in periods when the unemployment rate is about 1% and in periods when it is about 10%. Furthermore, it persists long after the start of unemployment and it does not disappear when social class, smoking, alcohol intake, and previous sick days are controlled for. The excess cancer mortality comes mainly from lung cancer, and the increased risk of lung cancer does not disappear when social class and number of previous sick days are controlled for. Unemployment does not increase smoking, but unemployed men have a slightly higher smoking prevalence before unemployment. However, as the excess lung cancer risk among unemployed men remains after controlling for social class, it seems unlikely that it can be explained only by differences in smoking prior to unemployment."
9332807,"This study aimed to assess the clinical oral health outcome effects among schoolchildren participating in a school-based oral health education (OHE) programme. Local social, cultural and environmental conditions were determinants of the school-based OHE programme, which was compiled on the basis of prevailing beliefs and on what teachers and educational authorities considered to be important for the oral health of schoolchildren. Consequently, the practical aspects of oral hygiene and information on the cause and prevention of caries and gingivitis were the components of oral health education. The teachers were prepared to carry out weekly supervised toothbrushing sessions and monthly lessons on aspects of oral health for the school year in grade 4. Eight participating schools were selected for the clinical effect evaluation and four non-participating schools served as the control. In total, 309 children from the participating schools and 122 children from the non-participating schools were available for the evaluation. Their ages varied between 9 and 14 years. The mean plaque score, calculus score and gingival bleeding score at baseline and at follow-up examinations 3, 8, 15 and 36 months later were not significantly different for participating schools and controls. The mean DMFT value at baseline was 0.4 and 3 years later 0.9 in both the participating and control schools. In conclusion, the present study shows that the implemented school-based OHE programme did not result in significant reductions of the clinical parameters measured."
9068572,"In this issue (page 639) Dr. Ellen L. Lipman and colleagues show that single motherhood is associated with an increased risk of affective disorder and poverty and with increased rates of mental health services utilization. These findings have important implications for primary prevention interventions that focus on the social determinants of family health. Studies have shown that higher levels of psychological distress among single mothers are more closely related to their exposure to stressors than to their personal vulnerability to stress. Research has also shown that the stresses that affect single-parent families are greater in degree but not in kind than those that affect other families. Therefore, intervention programs that address the needs of all families are preferable to those that target specific types of families. Community-based primary prevention programs can promote the well-being of all families by improving the social and economic conditions in which they live."
1789165,"A modified form of Nathanson and Becker's (1983) Health Belief Model Questionnaire and other measures designed to assess cognitive processing were administered to low-income black adolescent female clients of an inner-city comprehensive health care clinic. The purpose of the study was to explore determinants of sexual activity and contraceptive use. Subjects were classified as not sexually active (n = 50), sexually active/noncontracepting (n = 20), or sexually active/contracepting (n = 72). Not sexually active subjects tended to be younger, more career motivated, to have a father at home, to be more influenced by family values, and to have more conservative attitudes regarding adolescent sexuality than did sexually active subjects. Sexually active/noncontracepting subjects tended to report fewer benefits and more barriers to the use of contraception. Level of cognitive processing did not differ among the three groups, but was at a lower-than-expected level for age. Finally, inconsistent contraceptive use was common to both sexually active groups."
17435436,"There are important disparities in health outcomes between racial/ethnic minorities and majorities in all countries where minority health has been investigated. This holds true for the largest minority population of Europe, the Roma, although research data related to Roma are scarcer and more contested than for other minorities. We discuss major obstacles that hinder or prevent the collection of reliable data in Roma and other minorities. The definitions and classification systems on race/ethnicity vary widely, pointing to the social construction of both race and ethnicity. Imprecision in taxonomy and definition of target groups is compounded by challenges in data collection, analysis, and interpretation, along with ethnocentricity that shapes the perspectives and approaches of the researchers. However, administrative data collection on race/ethnicity serves legitimate purposes although such data must comply with less-stringent quality requirements as opposed to data meant for scientific analysis. Research on minorities should consider race/ethnicity as proxy indicators of complex health determinants, and should aim at dissecting these determinants into separate items. Careful documentation of methodology and active involvement of the minorities themselves can increase trust between the investigators and the research subjects, which can in turn improve research on minority health."
18442310,"Understanding the impact of socio-economic status (SES) on physical development in children is important, especially in developing countries where considerable inequalities persist. This is the first study to examine the association between SES on bone development at the whole body, femoral neck, and lumbar spine in black children living in Soweto and Johannesburg, South Africa. Linear regression models were used to study associations between SES during infancy and current SES, anthropometric, and DXA-derived bone mass in 9/10-yr-old children (n = 309). Findings suggest that current SES measures, rather than SES during infancy, are stronger predictors of current whole body bone area (BA) and whole body BMC after adjusting for body size, pubertal development, physical activity, habitual dietary calcium intake, and body composition. SES had no significant effect on either hip or spine bone mass. Caregiver's marital/cohabiting status (indicator of social support) and whether there was a television in the home (indicator of greater income) at age 9/10 yr were the most important socio-economic determinants of whole body BA and BMC. SES has a significant independent effect on whole body BMC through its impact on BA. This suggests that poverty alleviation policies in South Africa could have a positive effect on bone health."
10924032,"The future of social medicine is based on 150 years of history and the rapidly evolving context within which medicine functions in modern societies. There are two views of social medicine. One is based on the vision of Guerin and, particularly, Virchow 150 years ago that: ""Doctors are the natural advocates of the poor, and social problems are largely within their jurisdiction."" The New York Academy of Medicine's Institute on Social Medicine 50 years ago reflected this broad view. Medicine, however, enamored of the biomedical paradigm and the advances in knowledge through biomedical research, largely abandoned this broad perspective, even as the knowledge about the social, behavioral, and environmental determinants of health was advancing rapidly. A second view of social medicine, and one that has influenced many in the past 30 years, was defined by McKeown and Lowe: ""Social medicine is concerned with a body of knowledge and methods of obtaining knowledge appropriate to a discipline. This discipline may be said to comprise (a) epidemiology, and (b) the study of the medical needs of society, or in the contemporary short hand medical care."" Social medicine, in my view, includes not only the definition of McKeown and Lowe, but the broader context within which medicine fits in society. The context is changing. The social contract as defined by Bismarck and Beveridge has to be redefined. Just as the New York Academy of Medicine provided the vision of social medicine 50 years ago, the Academy has given us a new vision with the publication of Medicine and Public Health: the Power of Collaboration in 1997. Authored by Dr. Roz Lasker, director of the Academy's Division of Public Health, the book identifies the key changes required by medicine and public health to advance the goals of medicine and public health for the benefit of both individual patients and the population as a whole. The book points the way for the future of social medicine by identifying not only what needs to be done, but also how to do it."
16539960,"Foreign migration in Spain is at present a priority in the social and demographic context the country. At a worldwide level, trends in the evolution of population and social, political and economical indicators, appear to maintain for the coming years, the present trends on migrations from poor countries to the rich ones. In the health area, considering migration as a relatively recent phenomena in Spain, and considering that is mainly constituted by young and healthy population, there are not still data available on the main health needs of migrants related to aging. Data from other countries with a longer migrant tradition, shows mental health disorders and social and cultural barriers for adaptation, as basic health determinants for older migrants. Related to the effects in the health system, the inclusion of the aging factor in general population and migrant needs, offer an optimistic panorama for future planning. Migrant aging in Spain, despite of its middle and long term perspective, do require a progressive adaptation of knowledge and resources to cover future needs. Considering this coming future, health professionals do need to be trained in intercultural skills and knowledge."
11564854,"Seattle Partners, an Urban Research Center (URC) funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is a partnership of community agency representatives, community activists, public health professionals, academics, and health care providers whose mission is to improve the health of urban Seattle, Washington, communities by conducting community-based participatory research. This article describes the development and characteristics of Seattle Partners. Using primarily qualitative methods, including periodic in-depth interviews, evaluators identified the components necessary for Seattle Partners to maintain a collaborative and establish a research center driven by community interests. Seattle Partners is run by an unrestricted and inclusive board that has spent 5 years developing both an operating structure and various research interventions. Operating under Community Collaboration Principles, the board identified social determinants of health as the priority area in which to work. Collaboration, ""small and concrete"" accomplishments, skilled individuals, and funder support directly influence the success of the center. Decision making, project selection, and board composition have all been challenges to work through. Learning how to do and sustain the work are lessons being learned as Seattle Partners matures."
19346046,"Several significant developmental and socialisation processes in the life of children and adolescents take place in the area where they live. The extent to which they can feel and be safe in this environment is an important component of the success of those processes. This study highlights the independent contribution of neighbourhood and individual-level demographic and socioeconomic attributes to child and adolescent injuries. All individuals between the ages of 7 and 16 years living in Stockholm County in January 1998 (n=184 545) were followed up for their injuries during a five-year period considering injuries sustained as a pedestrian/cyclist/motor-vehicle rider and intentional injuries (violence-related and self-inflicted). A series of two-level logistic regressions were conducted to examine the association between the occurrence of injuries and individual (compositional) characteristics nested into parish of residence as well as contextual characteristics. For children and adolescents living in Stockholm County, contextual socioeconomic and social attributes of their place of residence were significant for injuries sustained as motor-vehicle riders but not for those sustained as pedestrians/cyclists or those inflicted intentionally. In the latter case, only the highest concentration of social benefit recipients was associated with significantly higher odds ratios. This emphasises that each injury mechanism has its own socioeconomic and social pathway, where contextual and compositional factors come into play to varying degrees."
2068599,"A study of subject compliance within an experimental anti-HIV drug protocol was conducted with 40 asymptomatic HIV seropositive persons participating in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of the effectiveness of ZDV. Subject compliance was assessed through the use of study nurse independent ratings. The 20 most compliant and 20 least compliant subjects were surveyed at a 6-month interval using a self-report instrument designed to assess perceived social support and other psychosocial factors thought to effect compliance. Results indicated that more adherent subjects lived further from their treatment site, did not live alone, saw their study nurse as supportive, and were more likely to depend on a significant other for a wide range of social, economic, and emotional support. Implications for the practical use of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are proposed."
8193249,"In the developed world, deferment of marriage and postponement of child-bearing in marriage are resulting in unprecedented numbers of couples who desire pregnancy relatively late in life. These factors combine with a decline in fertility and an increase in pregnancy wastage with advancing age to present new challenges for the clinician treating infertility. Experience with young oocytes donated to older women indicates that the major responsibility for the decline in fertility with age can be attributed to aging oocytes. Oocyte donation offers new hope for infertile older woman, but important moral and social questions remain unanswered."
8888156,"This paper explores barriers to the use of standard screening and breast cancer treatment that result in systematic differences in health outcomes. We review available data on individual, socioeconomic, and health system determinants of access to standard breast cancer care, including screening, diagnostic, and treatment services. Based on this review, we discuss the combination of factors which result in underservice. We argue that a broad framework which considers health system and social class as well as individual factors is useful for analyzing how structures of health care delivery tend to provide less than standard care to women who are older, have less income, or are less educated, black, or Hispanic. Data collection efforts which do not include structural and socioeconomic variables may result in an incomplete or misleading understanding of the determinants of underservice. These factors also need to be considered in the design and evaluation of public health policies and interventions meant to ameliorate the effects of underservice."
10573234,"Living conditions in eastern Germany have changed rapidly since unification in 1990 and little is known about how these changes affect the prevalence of atopic diseases. This study describes methods and prevalences of a large epidemiological project investigating determinants of childhood asthma and allergies in eastern (Dresden and Leipzig) and western (Munich) Germany in 1995/1996. Community based random samples of 9-11 yr old children in Dresden (n=3,017) and Munich (n=2,612), and of 5-7 yr old children in Dresden (n=3,300), Leipzig (n=3,167) and Munich (n=2,165) were studied by parental questionnaires, bronchial challenges with hypertonic saline, skin examination, skin-prick tests, and measurements of specific and total serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E using Phase II modules of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). In 9-11 yr old children, the prevalence of physician diagnosed asthma (7.9% versus 10.3%; p<0.01) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (15.7% versus 19.9%; p<0.05) was lower in Dresden than in Munich. No difference between Munich and Dresden was observed in the prevalence of diagnosed hay fever, skin test reactivity to > or = 1 allergen, and increased levels (>0.35 kU x L(-1)) of specific IgE against inhalant and food allergens. Symptoms and visible signs of atopic eczema tended to be more prevalent in Dresden. Similar East-West differences between the three study areas were seen in the younger age group. These findings are in line with recently observed increases in the prevalence of hay fever and atopic sensitization, but not of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, among 9-11 yr old children in Leipzig."
8219465,"In this paper, details are given of a community based follow up study of four areas: a village, a periurban slum, an urban slum and an upper middle class control group living in and around Lahore, Pakistan. The aim was to characterize the determinants of child health in a rapidly urbanizing community. The study was undertaken in two steps. An initial cross-sectional survey collecting socio-economic and demographic background information was carried out between March to August 1984. This was followed by a longitudinal study of 1476 infants representing the outcome of the pregnancies registered continuously between September 1984 to March 1987 among the 3242 families in the study. These infants were followed monthly from birth to 3 years of age and thereafter less frequently. In this communication we describe the study design, the study population, the organization and the research methodology used, including the reasons for drop outs from birth to 24 months of age. The internal consistency of the data is also presented. After the initial examination of the newborns within between 0-7 days of birth, the infants were visited monthly for 24 months making a total of 20911 examinations. At 24 months of age 70% of the infants were still in the study, 11% had died before reaching this age, 13% had moved from the area and 6% had refused to participate in the study. The economic, conditions, social structure, and the quality of life were found, not surprisingly, to vary significantly among the four areas. This community-based project provides new, critical and reliable information for local health planners. The study highlights the importance of the development of a useful model for research collaboration between institutions in developed and developing countries."
10741579,"To identify the determinants of self-medication and antibiotics abuse by parents treating their children aged between 2 and 18 over the previous year, an investigation was conducted in Hefei City, China in April, 1995. A total of 1596 students from a kindergarten, a primary school and a high school were included in the study, and 1459 completed questionnaires were collected (the response rate: 91.4%). The results showed the rate of parental self-medication for their children in the sample was 59.4%. It increased with children's age; about 51% of children had received parental self-medication on six or more occasions during the 1-year period and 32.8% on four to five occasions; there were associations between parental self-prescribers and sources of medicine and severity of disease. The rate of antibiotics abuse was 35.7%. Logistic regression analysis showed that there were significant associations between self-medication and payment of the mother's medical fees by employers, severity of diseases as well as the mother's educational level."
9455171,"The abilities to attribute an action to its proper agent and to understand its meaning when it is produced by someone else are basic aspects of human social communication. Several psychiatric syndromes, such as schizophrenia, seem to lead to a dysfunction of the awareness of one's own action as well as of recognition of actions performed by others. Such syndromes offer a framework for studying the determinants of agency, the ability to correctly attribute actions to their veridical source. Thirty normal subjects and 30 schizophrenic patients with and without hallucinations and/or delusional experiences were required to execute simple finger and wrist movements, without direct visual control of their hand. The image of either their own hand or an alien hand executing the same or a different movement was presented on a TV-screen in real time. The task for the subjects was to discriminate whether the hand presented on the screen was their own or not. Hallucinating and deluded schizophrenic patients were more impaired in discriminating their own hand from the alien one than the non-hallucinating ones, and tended to misattribute the alien hand to themselves. Results are discussed according to a model of action control. A tentative description of the mechanisms leading to action consciousness is proposed."
12287567,"""This report has given some idea of the wide-ranging discussions at the Second National Immigration Outlook Conference [held in Sydney, Australia, in 1993], and of the way they reflect vital political, economic, and social issues in a country built upon mass immigration. The strains of globalization, geopolitical reorientation, and economic restructuring are having decisive effects on policies of immigration and multiculturalism. The consequences of such changes are difficult to predict, but in the authors' opinion they could lead to the breakdown of the 'Australian model' which has been remarkably successful in incorporating very large numbers of newcomers from varied backgrounds. The result might be considerable hardship and social tension."""
19265552,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the patterns and influences of physical activity change in mid-aged adults. This study describes the design, sampling, data collection, and analytical plan of HABITAT, an innovative study of (i) physical activity change over five years (2007-2011) in adults aged 40-65 years at baseline, and (ii) the relative contribution of psychological variables, social support, neighborhood perceptions, area-level factors, and sociodemographic characteristics to physical activity change. METHODS/DESIGN: HABITAT is a longitudinal multi-level study. 1625 Census Collection Districts (CCDs) in Brisbane, Australia were ranked by their index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage score, categorized into deciles, and 20 CCDs from each decile were selected to provide 200 local areas for study inclusion. From each of the 200 CCDs, dwellings with individuals aged between 40-65 years (in 2007) were identified using electoral roll data, and approximately 85 people per CCD were selected to participate (N = 17,000). A comprehensive Geographic Information System (GIS) database has been compiled with area-level information on public transport networks, footpaths, topography, traffic volume, street lights, tree coverage, parks, public services, and recreational facilities Participants are mailed a questionnaire every two years (2007, 2009, 2011), with items assessing physical activity (general walking, moderate activity, vigorous activity, walking for transport, cycling for transport, recreational activities), sitting time, perceptions of neighborhood characteristics (traffic, pleasant surroundings, streets, footpaths, crime and safety, distance to recreational and business facilities), social support, social cohesion, activity-related cognitions (attitudes, efficacy, barriers, motivation), health, and sociodemographic characteristics. Analyses will use binary and multinomial logit regression models, as well as generalized linear latent growth models. DISCUSSION: HABITAT will provide unique information to improve our understanding of the determinants of physical activity, and to help identify ""people"" and ""place"" priority targets for public policy and health promotion aimed at increasing physical activity participation among mid-aged men and women."

8172115,"The study assessed mortality and morbidity risks as related to nutritional status of moderate and strict vegetarians in Germany. The total cohort of 1904 self-identified persons was followed up for 11 y. Compared with national mortality rates for Federal Republic of Germany, the observed deaths for all causes were below expectation by a factor of 0.44 for men and 0.53 for women. The mortality for colon cancer was reduced [standardized mortality ration (SMR 44.1 for men and 77.9 for women]. No deaths were observed from rectal cancer. A vegetarian lifestyle of long duration (> or = 20 y) was associated with decreased overall and cancer mortality. Other determinants of decreased cause-specific mortality were physical activity, body weight, and strictness of adherence to the life-style. The relationship between a vegetarian and fiber-rich diet and a decreased risk for colon cancer has been reported in many studies. In this study, the influence of other factors such as health-conscious behavior and a healthy lifestyle seem to indicate partly stronger effects than nutrition itself. This may explain the generally better health of moderate vegetarians."
10641825,"A review of U.S. and European clinical trials and cardiovascular prevention studies indicates a strong relation among cardiovascular disease risk factors and between metabolic factors and health behaviors established in youth. Social and behavioral determinants of risk are best modified by strategies applied in schools, families, and whole communities to provide a firm base for primordial prevention of risk factor development. This is illustrated with results from a European intervention trial and from observational studies in the young."
19771953,"This study addresses recent public health policies in Norway, asking how policies on health inequalities have developed over the past 20 years. The authors focus on how the problem has been defined, what goals have been set, and what means have been put forward to achieve them. The data consist of official documents and interviews of key actors in research and the health bureaucracy. The results indicate that the theme of health inequalities has developed from a non-topic to a high-priority topic in Norway's public health policy. This change has been accompanied by formulation of clear goals and an overarching and long-term strategy, including concrete means to reduce health inequalities. Over the past five years, the problem definition has changed from one of individualization with a focus on health behaviors to a structural understanding that emphasizes the problem of the gradient and social determinants of health. Norway is on the move from a state of political indifference toward action in developing comprehensive, coordinating policy."
17062544,"A variety of cognitive and behavioral self-management skills have been posited as protective in terms of adolescent substance use. This study examined whether these skills measured in the 7th grade served a protective function in 9th grade substance use across ethnically diverse samples of adolescents. Participants consisted of Black (n = 461) and Hispanic (n = 320) urban youth and White suburban youth (n = 757). Structural equation modeling indicated that a second order Self-Management Skills latent factor consisting of first order latent factors of Decision-Making, Self-Regulation, and Self-Reinforcement skills was protective for adolescent substance use across racial/ethnic subgroups. However, Self-Management Skills were more strongly protective for suburban White youth and less protective for urban minority youth. These findings are consistent with previous research showing that predictive power of risk and protective factors derived from psychosocial theories varies widely across racial/ethnic subgroups of youth and is weaker among racial/ethnic minority youth compared to White youth. An important next step is to broaden the focus of etiology research from individual-level determinants to studying adolescent substance use behavior in the context of the cultural background and primary social settings of young people, such as family, school, and community environments."
1311941,"Risk behaviors related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and transmission were studied in a sample of 167 male cocaine users admitted during a 5-month period to an inpatient drug treatment program. Data obtained included drug history and related behaviors, sexual behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes regarding HIV infection and AIDS. Approximately 20% of the sample had used IV drugs in the year prior to the interview and 94% of these reported sharing needles; 20% of the IV drug users (IVDUs) reported always using bleach to clean needles. With regard to sexual practices, 7% of the total sample reported sex with other males in the year prior to the interview; 86% of the total sample reported having sex with females and 80% of these noted they never or rarely used condoms during vaginal sex. Respondents generally did not believe they themselves were at high risk for HIV infection, yet they continued to engage in acknowledged high-risk behaviors. These findings suggest that IVDUs and non-IV cocaine users are likely to contribute to the spread of HIV in several populations."
1948148,"Little information exists on health discrepancies within rural areas. Our research proposes to analyse the Quebec Health Survey--a population health survey carried out in Quebec in 1987--using a geographic grid which defines three different rural areas: that area bordering urban centers, a more remote area and the very remote hinterland. The analysis brings to light major, statistically significant, discrepancies between these areas in three sectors: health status determinants (physical activity and social support), the actual state of health (perceived health, a global health index and various pathologies) and the consequences that may be attributed to this state of health (disability and medication). It shows the difficult situation of inhabitants of the very remote hinterland."

11217704,"MEGA is the chemical workplace exposure database of the Institute for Occupational Safety (BIA) of the German Berufsgenossenschaften (BG) (statutory accident institutions for insurance and prevention). On the legal basis of the social insurance law the inspectorates of the BGs conduct workplace measurements of chemical and biological agents. The BGs have cooperated with BIA within the Berufsgenossenschaftliches Messsystem Gefahrstoffe--BGMG since 1972: measurements are done by the BGs, analyses and data processing are the tasks of BIA. In 1999 31,000 measurements with 68,000 analyses were taken in 4,000 enterprises. All data are stored in the MEGA-database with up to 150 pieces of information (describing type of workplace, working conditions, measured substances, sampling strategy, sampling duration, sampling and analytical method etc.), for each result. MEGA contains today about 1,000,000 measurements of more than 400 substances starting in 1972. MEGA is used by BIA and the BGs for the following purposes: prevention (e.g., identification of hazards, efficiency of exposure reducing measures, determination of technical criteria for exposure limit values), epidemiological questions, and investigations of occupational diseases. In the framework of the measuring and inspection activities and tasks of the inspectorates of the BGs the locations for measurements are not randomly selected, but are based on criteria such as supposed critical exposure situations or testing the efficiency of exposure reducing measures. Nevertheless, a statistical appraisal of the data is possible for different purposes considering the specific determinants of the results, as, for example, classification of enterprises (sectors), workplaces (activities, tasks), used materials, and products. The MEGA-database will be further developed into a multifactorial exposure database with additional data on biological exposure to bacteria and funghi, but also noise and other data."
7664962,"This paper attempts to explain the differences in birthweight observed between blacks, white Anglos, Chicanos, and other racial and ethnic groups. The analysis focuses on the role of income and financial assistance from relatives and public programs. Using data from the NLS Youth Panel, I construct a casual model of birthweight containing exogenous social and demographic risk factors and intervening proximate determinants of birthweight. A substantial part of the gap in birthweight between white Anglos and other ethnic groups (especially blacks) can be explained by the unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the latter. On the other hand, blacks and other minorities smoke less and have other favorable proximate characteristics that depress differences in birthweight. When these proximate determinants are controlled, large ethic differences in birthweight remain unexplained by income and other sociodemographic factors."
9773761,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of educational attainment with an array of risk factors for poor health among high-functioning older men and women. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of psychosocial, behavioral, and biological factors and educational attainment were conducted using data from a population-based cohort study of older men and women. Participants consisted of 70- to 79-year-old residents of communities of East Boston, MA; New Haven, CT; and Durham County, NC (N = 1192) participating in the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly programs, a three-site longitudinal study of community-dwelling men and women. Participants were selected on the basis of high physical and cognitive function, representing approximately the top third of their peers in terms of functional ability in 1988. In-home interviews were conducted. Associations among education and behavioral (e.g., cigarette smoking and physical activity), biological (e.g., pulmonary function, serum cholesterol), psychological (e.g., self-efficacy, anxiety), and social (e.g., networks and support) factors were examined. RESULTS: Low levels of education were associated with poorer psychological function (less mastery, efficacy, happiness), less optimal health behaviors (increased tobacco consumption and decreased levels of physical activity), poorer biological conditions (decreased pulmonary function, increased body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio), and larger social networks (increased number of contacts, decreased negative support). Several factors (alcohol consumption, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were nonlinearly related to educational attainment. CONCLUSIONS: Educational attainment is associated with a broad array of psychosocial and biological conditions among the elderly. That an education gradient functions over an array of factors that structure daily life, even in later life in a healthy population, may suggest how socioeconomic status influences health."
11297008,"BACKGROUND: With the introduction of the new consensus on 30 minutes of moderate physical activity preferably on all days of the week, exercise implemented into daily activities is promoted whereas structured activity programs lose importance. Activity levels of most older people don't come up with current recommendations. Therefore strategies to enhance attendance of older adults in physical activities should be developed. Group programs may be more effective in changing exercise behaviour of older adults than non-supervised physical activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in level of activity and psychosocial determinants of physical activity between seniors involved in an exercise class and seniors not engaged in any organised physical activity. METHODS: Seventy-five elderly who were currently involved in structured exercise classes and 75 elderly who did not participate in any organised physical activity during the previous year were recruited in senior citizens' centres and were asked to fill out a questionnaire. RESULTS: Subjects involved in an exercise program had higher levels of activity and reported more social influences and higher self-efficacy compared to the respondents practising on an individual basis. No differences were found in perceived barriers or benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Exercising in a group program gives the opportunity to accumulate some extra physical activity and positively affects the level of activity outside the program. Stimulating older adults to join a structured activity program in the company of family or friends in order to enhance supporting social influences and perceived competence could be an important intervention strategy."
15885866,"Time preferences for health has a role in informing discounting practice in economic evaluation of health care interventions. Yet virtually no empirical evidence on time preferences for health are available for sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of this paper are therefore to estimate time preferences for health in Tanzania, and to explore the relationship between time preferences for one's own private health and for others health. Determinants of time preference rates are also explored. A sample of the general population participated, and each person was asked to indicate the maximum duration of more distant ill-health they would be willing to accept in return for a specified delay in the onset of the condition. People were randomised to answer either questions in the context of their own health or in the context of others health. Estimations were done using clustered least squares regression with robust standard errors. The implied mean and median discount rates were 0.07 and 0.058, respectively. Time preferences for one's own and others' health--conceptualised as social health--seem to be roughly the same in this sample, but people seem to discount the most severe health condition at a significantly lower rate than the least severe condition."
11525391,"The present article reviews research about the psychological determinants of human eating behavior. A hypothetical model of food choice and intake is introduced, presenting various factors influencing eating behavior. Internal factors include sensory food aspects. Among the external factors are information, the social context and the physical environment. Processes such as mere exposure, Pavlovian conditioning and social learning shape the relationships between these factors, food liking and eating behavior. The relative contribution of the various determinants is discussed. In spite of a scarcity of studies, liking for the sensory aspects of food seems to be at the center of the development, maintenance and change of dietary patterns. Consequently, efforts for promoting healthy eating behavior might benefit from an increased attention towards learning principles and food likes in the development of interventions. Existing intervention strategies are criticized and preliminary suggestions are formulated to enhance their effectiveness."
9740341,"BACKGROUND: The MONICA (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases) project in Augsburg provides the first population-based cohort study in Germany to quantify the associations of the risk factors hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking with incident non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality, and to assess their impact at the population level. METHODS: The cohort comprises 1074 men and 1013 women aged 45-64 years; they were followed over 8 years from 1984-1992. In the men, there were 61 non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarctions and 92 all-cause mortality events over this period; in the women the number of deaths from all causes was 45. Incidence rates, hazard rate ratios, population attributable fractions and rate advancement periods were calculated. RESULTS: Adjusting for confounders, the myocardial infarction hazard rate ratios for men with hypertension, or a total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio > or =5.5, or smoking > or =20 cigarettes/day, were 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-3.5), 2.9 (95%, CI 1.7-5.0), and 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1 4-5.0), respectively. The risk factor combination total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio > or = 5.5 and cigarette smoking was particularly hazardous. The three risk factors contributed 65% of the burden of myocardial infarction in the population. The rate advancement period for myocardial infarction associated with hypertension, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio > or =5.5 or smoking > or =20 cigarettes/day was 8.3, 12.4 and 11.5 years, respectively. In women, these risk factors were similarly predictive of all-cause mortality. Comparing the cohort data from Augsburg with those of two occupational cohorts from Germany reveals higher absolute myocardial infarction risks in the Augsburg population; however, the relative risk estimates in the Augsburg and the two occupational cohorts were very similar. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the important contribution of the classical risk factors to the risk of myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality in Germany. The results pertaining to the concept of rate advancement periods particularly demonstrate the great potential for prevention."
10174382,"Using a conceptual model that integrates social and biomedical models of causation, this paper delineates the pathways through which social factors ultimately influence infant mortality in the African-American community. Two social factors, maternal education and marital status, are shown to influence the risk of infant death through the following intermediate variables: bio-demographic (maternal age, birth order, birth interval and outcome of last pregnancy), health care (prenatal care utilization) and proximate infant health status at birth (preterm delivery and low birth weight). While the impact of maternal education is largely explained by the intermediate variables, marital status remains a significant, albeit a weak, predictor net of all other variables."
17315529,"BACKGROUND: There are conflicting findings regarding the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and bone mineral density. We aimed to investigate bone status and its possible determinants by comparing students from two schools, located in a high and a low SES district. METHODS: Data were gathered by using anthropometric measurements and a questionnaire for both families and the students from the two schools chosen by the Ministry of Education. Quantitative ultrasound measurements were done with Omnisense 700P. For normally distributed variables t-test and for others Mann-Whitney U test was utilized. We used the chi-squared test for nominal variables. RESULTS: Forty-two girls and 35 boys from a low SES school, and 41 girls and 38 boys from a high SES school were included in the study. Students in the high SES school had significantly higher calcium scores and more physical activity compared to those in the low SES school. Boys in the high SES school had higher z-scores for quantitative ultrasound; however, they had higher Tanner stages when compared to boys from the low SES school. Speed of sound (SOS) and z-scores of the girls were similar between the two schools. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the notion that certain environmental factors, such as calcium intake and physical activity, might reflect socioeconomic trends in adolescents, similar to adults; however, genetic influences may dominate in terms of bone status."
19821997,"BACKGROUND: With African health-care systems facing exploding demand for HIV care, reliable methods for assessing adherence and its influencing factors are needed to guide effective public-health measures. This study evaluated individual patient characteristics determining antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and the predictive values of different measures of adherence on virological treatment failure in a cohort of patients in a routine-care setting in Cameroon. METHODS: Longitudinal study over 6-months following ART introduction, using patients questionnaires and hospital and pharmacy records. RESULTS: At the end of the 6 months study period, 219 of 312 patients (70%) returned to the pharmacy to refill their medication, 17% (51) were lost to follow-up, 9% (28) were dead and 4% (14) were transferred to other care centres. Virological treatment failure at 6 months was experienced by 26 patients, representing 13% of patients with available viral load value. Pharmacy refill irregularity was the most powerful predictor (odds ratio 12.4; P < 0.001) of virological treatment failure, compared with CD4 cell count increase at 6 months (odds ratio 7.8; P = 0.002) or self-reported adherence at one month (odds ratio 1.1; P = 0.85). Low intensity of ART side-effects after one month was strongly associated with survival (odds ratio 0.11; P = 0.001). Patients starting ART with CD4 cell count <100 cells/mm3 had a greater risk of dying during the follow-up period (odds ratio 2.69; P = 0.02). Compared with asymptomatic CDC stage A patients, CDC stage B (odds ratio 5.72) and CDC stage C patients (odds ratio 16.9) had higher risk of becoming lost to follow-up (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analyses, pharmacy non-adherence was less frequent in women (adjusted odds ratio 0.56; P = 0.05) but more frequent in patients with high monthly income (odds ratio 3.24; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Pharmacy-refill adherence might be considered as an alternative to CD4 count monitoring for identification of patients at risk of virological failure, especially in resources-scarce countries. The study confirmed the difficulty in demonstrating clear associations of individual patient factors and treatment outcomes. The substantial loss to follow-up and deaths occurring within 6 months after initiating ART emphasise the need to understand the best timing of ART initiation and further elucidate and educate on the underlying reasons for delaying initiation of ART in resource-limited countries."
10130406,"Hospitals face a paradigm shift: from planning service delivery to population-based community health planning. Comprehensive community health planning is a two-step process: assessment and action, in that order. Assessment identifies community problems and resources; action follows planning, which determines which of those problems should be addressed with which resources. This paper provides an overview of the community assessment process. The first challenge in launching a community health initiative is to identify and recruit partners drawn from the ranks of prominent community organizations, such as school boards, public health agencies, and elected officials. The best enlistment strategies are those that empower persons outside the hospital to take visible control. Defining the community is the first step in analyzing the community. It is important that everyone involved in the assessment process agree on the definition, which should take in those characteristics that make the community unique, including its social systems, environmental factors, and demographics. The next step in the process is developing a community health profile, a set of key community indicators or measures that will help you set priorities, document successes and failures, and monitor trends. There are a number of models available to consult in developing indicators, whether traditional, medically oriented determinants of health or broader parameters, such as housing and public safety. Criteria for selecting indicators include validity, stability and reliability, and responsiveness. Most indicators will be developed using secondary, or already existing, sources of data, such as census data, Medicare and Medicaid files, police records, and hospital admission and exit records. Conducting the community assessment involves putting together a list of problems to be solved and a list of available resources, both of which can be compiled using the same four-step process of gathering and analyzing data: obtaining community input, identifying problems already being addressed, consulting with professional experts, and analyzing existing data. Demographics are one way of analyzing data; another is using a ""community scoreboard"" that groups causal factors into four categories: lifestyle, environment, human biology, and health services. Once the community assessment is complete, planning and implementation of programs can begin. At the same time, it is essential to mobilize the community to support your initiative. Again, you must look beyond the hospital walls to build a constituency for change, to community leaders in education, employment, transportation and recreation, housing, and the physical environment, as well as health education and preventive services.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
9759686,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies suggest underuse of beta-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease, but these studies have been based on selected populations of recently hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe national patterns and determinants of beta-blocker use in the ambulatory setting. METHODS: We analyzed 11745 visits by patients with coronary artery disease to randomly selected, office-based physicians in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys for 1980, 1981, 1985, and 1989 through 1996. We used multiple logistic regression to determine the independent effect of sociodemographic and clinical factors on beta-blocker use. OUTCOME MEASURE: Beta-blocker use at patient visits. RESULTS: Beta-blocker use was reported in only 20.9% of office visits by patients with coronary artery disease and no strong contraindications between 1993 and 1996. In multivariate analyses, age younger than 75 years, residence in the Northeast, and visits to cardiologists and internists compared with family and general practitioners predicted greater use of beta-blocker therapy. White race and private insurance also were significant predictors of beta-blocker use between 1980 and 1996. Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant decline in beta-blocker use from 1980 to 1990, followed by a gradual increase in recent years. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-blockers appear to be underused in ambulatory patients with coronary artery disease. Our data suggest that nonclinical factors may influence rates of use, indicating the need for closer scrutiny of variations in physician prescribing practices."
10960532,"BACKGROUND: Health policymakers are concerned about the proportion of people who say they are unwilling to receive a blood transfusion. This article examines how social, cultural, and political factors affect the perceived risk of transfusions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected as part of a large national telephone survey of 1204 people conducted in the United States in 1997 and 1998. The survey elicited images associated with blood transfusions and contained questions about the perceived risk of the blood supply, sensitivity to stigma, world views, trust, and demographics. RESULTS: The results showed that a substantial proportion of people do not consider the US blood supply to be safe and say they would not accept blood if hospitalized. The images evoked most frequently by the stimulus phrase ""blood transfusions"" were related to AIDS or HIV. The people who tend to perceive the greatest personal and public risk from blood transfusions are female, nonwhite, and less educated, and they have not previously received a transfusion. Sensitivity to stigma, mistrust, one's perceived inability to control hazardous activities and technologies, and fatalistic and egalitarian world views tend to be associated with heightened concern about the risk of blood transfusions. CONCLUSION: Risk perceptions need to be monitored to anticipate and deal with problems of public acceptance. Risk management strategies should be tailored to the specific characteristics of individuals that are important determinants of the perceived risk of transfusions."
8847202,"Psychosocial factors determining the choice of health facility in 30 cases of epilepsy attending the psychiatric outpatient department (OPD) of a teaching (referral) hospital in India were studied. The majority of those who chose indigenous healers as their first contact treatment facility did so on the decision of the family. A belief in the supernatural causation of epilepsy combined with family decision was associated with the choice of indigenous health facility. Belief in the physical cause of epilepsy and the participation of social network in decision making were, on the other hand, closely associated with the choice of practitioners of modern medicine. The time-lag between onset of illness and first contact for treatment was short when indigenous healers were consulted first, however these patients usually took a long time to reach the referral centre when they passed through the indigenous healers."
9408702,"In a joint pilot study by Family Health International (FHI), AVSC International, and the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), information was gathered on the determinants of azoospermia following vasectomy on 38 healthy men who chose vasectomy for contraception. The time and number of ejaculations associated with loss of sperm motility and loss of sperm eosin vital staining were also evaluated. ""Azoospermia"" was defined on the basis of two consecutive azoospermic semen samples collected at least 3 days apart. The single decrement life table method was used to calculate weekly gross cumulative life table rates for the time to azoospermia, zero motility, and zero viability. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the product-limit estimates of the cumulative rates for the total number of ejaculations to azoospermia, 0% motility and 0% viability. The median time to azoospermia was 10 weeks and at the end of week 20, the life table rate (+/- standard error) was 93.0 (+/- 6.30) weeks/100 men. The median number of ejaculations to azoospermia was between 25 and 30, and the cumulative rate (+/- standard error) at 60 ejaculations reached 94.5 (+/- 5.16)/100 men."
18631388,"BACKGROUND: Health professionals, policy-makers and researchers need to be able to explore potential associations between prevalence rates and quality of care with a range of possible determinants including socio-economic deprivation and morbidity levels to determine the impact of commissioning and service delivery. In the UK, data in England are only available nationally at practice postcode level. In Scotland, such data are available based on an aggregate of the practices population's postcodes. The use of data assigned to the practice postcode may underestimate the association between ill health and income deprivation. Here, we report on the impact of using data assigned to the practice population by comparing analyses using English and Scottish data. RESULTS: Income deprivation based on data assigned to the practice postcode under-estimated deprivation compared to using income deprivation data assigned to the practice population for the five least deprived deciles, and over-estimated deprivation for the five most deprived deciles. The biggest differences were found for the most deprived decile. A similar trend was found for limiting long-term illness (LLTI). Differences between the QOF prevalence rates of the least and most deprived deciles using practice postcode data were similar (0.2% points or less) in England and Scotland for 8 out of 10 clinical domains. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences in the prevalence rate between the least and most deprived deciles increase for all clinical domains. A similar trend was again found for LLTI. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences for population achievement increase for all CHD quality indicators with the exception of beta-blockers (CHD10). With practice postcode assigned deprivation, significant differences between the least and most deprived deciles were found for 2 out 8 indicators, compared to 5 using practice population assigned deprivation. For LLTI differences between the lowest and most deprived deciles increased for all indicators when ill health assigned to the practice population was used. CONCLUSION: We have found, through comparing deprivation and ill health data assigned to either the practice postcode or the practice population postcode in Scotland, that analyses based on practice postcode assigned data under-estimated the relationship between deprivation and ill health for both prevalence and quality care. Given the importance of understanding the effect of deprivation and ill health on a range of determinants related to health care, policy makers should ensure that practice population data are available and used at national level in England and elsewhere where possible."
14616913,"BACKGROUND: In a recent project, commissioned by the European Union, a set of Child Health Indicators were identified and recommended for use in all Member States. In that work, by a group of European experts, children's development was one of the key areas that were reviewed to clarify its role in this set of indicators. This paper deals with neurological (in a broad sense), social and moral aspects of development; other aspects, such as nutrition and physical growth, mental health, quality of life were dealt with in other areas. METHODS: A number of methods are used to monitor children's neurodevelopment, to identify early deviations that could be treated or alleviated. Few tests fulfil basic criteria of screening and quality of evidence. For Child Health Programmes, developmental surveillance is instead recommended. As a proxy to social development, as part of children's process of adaptation into society, education indicators are recommended, such as suggested by OECD and UNICEF. Moral development is discarded as an indicator, because norms and values vary too much between countries. CONCLUSION: For now the Child Health Indicators of Life and Development Project found no ground to recommend any particular method or combination of methods for a general monitoring of children's neurological, intellectual, language and moral development, and for including the results as national indicators of children's health and well-being in EU. For social development, indicators in the educational area seem most promising, as they have been proposed and used by OECD and UNESCO. In an ambitious monitoring programme, these indicators could be included as determinants of children's health and development."
9659409,"The demographic and economic transition that many developing countries are undergoing is producing important changes in diet and lifestyle that greatly impact on disease risks. Among the risk behaviors associated with socioeconomic transition and urbanization are excessive dietary fat intake, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and environmental contamination. Combined with a reduced infant mortality and increased life expectancy, those risk factors lead to an increasing prevalence of chronic disease like non-insulin dependent diabetes and coronary heart disease. This disease. This disease profile is a relatively new phenomenon in developing countries, where health programs have traditionally focused on ""acute"" interventions such as immunization or oral rehydration. A new approach will be needed to address chronic diseases, which frequently demand a life-long and technically complex medical management, and may have significant impact on the quality of life and productivity of the population. Efforts to address this situation should focus on a) expanding the information base on diet, nutritional status and lifestyle changes in populations migrating to urban areas; b) developing and evaluating approaches for improving diet quality in urban populations, including fortification and community-based supplementation programs; c) understanding better the social and behavioral determinants of nutritional status in the urban poor; and d) defining the role of the food industry and of agricultural production for improving the quality of the food supply in urban areas."
12783770,"CONTEXT: Gender discrimination and son preference are key demographic features of South Asia and are well documented for India. However, gender bias and sex preference in Nepal have received little attention. METHODS: 1996 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey data on ever-married women aged 15-49 who did not desire any more children were used to investigate levels of gender bias and sex preference. The level of contraceptive use and the total fertility rate in the absence of sex preference were estimated, and logistic regression was performed to analyze the association between socioeconomic and demographic variables and stopping childbearing after the birth of a son. RESULTS: Commonly used indicators of gender bias, such as sex ratio at birth and sex-specific immunization rates, do not suggest a high level of gender discrimination in Nepal. However, sex preference decreases contraceptive use by 24% and increases the total fertility rate by more than 6%. Women's contraceptive use, exposure to the media, parity, last birth interval, educational level and religion are linked to stopping childbearing after the birth of a boy, as is the ethnic makeup of the local area. CONCLUSIONS: The level of sex preference in Nepal is substantial. Sex preference is an important barrier to the increase of contraceptive use and decline of fertility in the country; its impact will be greater as desired family size declines."
16848259,"BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of preschool children are being referred for specialist dental management in a paediatric hospital. Most cases have severe early childhood caries and require comprehensive management under general anaesthesia. The present study investigated risk factors for disease presence at initial consultation. METHODS: A convenience sample of 125 children under four years of age from the north Brisbane region were examined and caries experience recorded using dmft and dmfs indices. A self-administered questionnaire obtained information regarding social, demographic, birth, neonatal, infant feeding and dental health behaviour variables. The data were analysed using the chi-square and one-way analysis of variance procedures. RESULTS: Ninety-four per cent of referred children had severe ECC with mean dmft of 10.5 +/- 3.8 and mean dmfs of 27.1 +/- 15.1. Prevalence of severe ECC was significantly higher in children allowed a sweetened liquid in the infant feeding bottle (99 per cent) and allowed to sip from an infant feeding bottle during the day (100 per cent). Mean dmfs was significantly higher in children allowed to sleep with a bottle (28.7) and sip from a bottle during the day (29.9), children from a non-Caucasian background (31.8), those children that commenced regular toothbrushing between 6 to 12 months of age (28.1), had no current parental supervision of daily tooth-brushing (34.2) and had not taken daily fluoride supplements (27.8), vitamin supplements (27.8) or prescription medicine previously (27.6). CONCLUSIONS: The behavioural determinants for severe early childhood caries presence in hospital-referred children were similar to those identified in the regional preschool population."
18266107,"This qualitative pilot study explored the mental health needs of visible minority immigrants in St. John's--a small urban center in Atlantic Canada with limited ethnoracial diversity and ethnospecific infrastructure. The study examined the facilitators and barriers to maintaining immigrants' mental health and their perspectives on availability and access to support services and programs that support mental health. Our findings revealed several determinants of the mental health of visible minority immigrants: social support, income, employment, culture, physical environment, coping skills, gender, and availability, accessibility and cultural appropriateness of mental health services. We offer 18 recommendations framed by Health Canada determinants of health that may be of interest to decision-makers in government, health agencies and social services in similar small urban centers."
15629682,"Accidental drug overdose continues to be a substantial cause of mortality for drug users. Characteristics of the neighborhood built environment may be important determinants of the likelihood of drug overdose mortality independent of individual-level factors. Using data from the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, we conducted a multilevel case control study using data on accidental overdose deaths as cases and non-overdose accidental deaths as controls. We used archival data from the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey and the Mayor's Office of Operations to assess characteristics of neighborhood external (e.g. dilapidation of buildings) and internal (e.g. quality of utilities in houses) built environment. Multilevel analyses were used to assess the relations between the neighborhood built environment and the likelihood of overdose death. Six out of the eight characteristics of the external environment studied and three out of the six characteristics of the internal environment studied were significantly associated with the likelihood of fatal drug overdose in multilevel models after adjusting for individual-level (age, race, sex) and neighborhood-level (income, drug use) variables. Deterioration of the built environment, particularly the external environment, is associated with an increased likelihood of fatal accidental drug overdose. Disinvestment in social resources, psychosocial stressors, neighborhood differences in response to a witnessed overdose, and differences in vulnerability to the adverse consequences of drug use in different neighborhoods may explain the observed associations."
15537046,"Socioeconomic inequality and its impact on health is a growing concern in the European public health debate. In many countries, the issue is moving away from description towards the identification of the determinants of inequalities and the development of policies explicitly aimed at reducing inequalities in health. In Italy, ten years after the publication of the first report on inequalities in health, this topic is seldom present on the agenda of public policy makers. The purpose of this report is to update the Italian profile of social variation in health and health care in order to stimulate the debate on ways to tackle inequalities in health that are preventable. In the first section of this book, the threefold objective is to describe the principal mechanisms involved in the generation of social inequalities in health (Introduction); to report Italian data on the distribution and magnitude of this phenomenon in the last decade; and to evaluate policies and interventions in both the social (chapter 1.9, Section I) and the health sector (chapter 2.3, Section I), which are potentially useful to reduce health inequalities. It is intended for anyone who is in a position to contribute t o decision-making that will benefit the health of communities. For this reason, chapters are organized by specific determinants of inequalities on which interentions may have an impact. The methodological approach in the second section focuses on the best methods to monitor social inequalities including recommendations on social indicators, sources of information and study models, based on European guidelines revised for the Italian situation. According to data from national and local studies, mortality increases linearly with social disadvantage for a wide range of indicators at both the individual (education, social class, income, quality of housing) and the geographical level (deprivation indexes computed at different levels of aggregation). This positive correlation is evident for both sexes, with the steepest gradient observed among adults of working age, although differences persist also among the elderly. The causes of death found to be most highly correlated with social inequality, and largely responsible for the increasing inequality over the last decade, are those associated with addiction and exclusion (drug, alcohol and violence related deaths), with smoking (lung cancer) and with safety in the workplace and on the roads (accidents). Similar gradients and trends have been observed with different outcomes, such as self-reported morbidity, disability and cancer incidence (chapter 1.1, Section I). Reproductive outcomes confiirm this picture: compared to women belonging to the upper classes, those women in low conditions experience more spontaneous abortions and their children suffer from higher infant mortality and low birth weight. This is a critical issue since poor infant health, particularly for metabolic and respiratory pathologies, affects health in adult life. There is now substantive evidence showing that also socioeconomic circumstances at birth or during adolescence may have a strong impact on adult health (chapter 1.2, Section I). Differences in harmful lifestyles, such as smoking, heavy drinking, drug use, unhealthy diet, obesity and physical inactivity, have a similar effect. The only exception is smoking among women, which is positively correlated with socioeconomic status; however, since women in the upper classes have a greater tendency to quit smoking, the gradient will soon be reversed (chapter 1.7, Section I). On the other hand, most of these behaviours do not follow from free and conscious individual choice; they are a form of adaptation to chronic stress originating in the work-place (chapter 1.4, Section I), or to particularly unfavourable events and conditions, such as unemployment (chapter 1.5, Section I) or lack of family and social support (chapter 1.6, Section I). Poor socioeconomic circumstances are the threshold of absolute poverty and may lead to social exclusion, a condition with a heavy impact on health, which in Italy includes marginal groups of the native population and broader classes of immigrants (chapter 1.3, Section I). Finally, there is recent and consistent evidence on the existence of a ""contextual"" effect on health, as opposed to the ""compositional"" effect given solely by the aggregation of individual processes. According to this hypothesis, characteristics of the infrastructure, and the physical and socioeconomic environment of an area would have an impact on individual health independent from the cultural and economic resources personally available to people living in that area (chapter 1.8, Section I). With respect to the health care system, various studies are in agreement in demonstrating that poor and less educated people have inadequate access both to primary prevention and early diagnosis (chapter 2.1, Section I), and to early and appropriate care (chapter 2.2, Section I). They also experience higher rates of hospitalization, particularly in emergencies and with advanced levels of severity."
16019275,"The purpose of this study is to examine racial/ethnic differences in the change of psychological distress as measured by CES-D over time and its associated factors between older Korean immigrants and non-Hispanic White elders, based on a social stress perspective. Data come from a two-wave panel survey of 172 older Korean immigrants and 157 non-Hispanic White elders, with a follow-up period of 12 to 15 months. The sample was drawn from a three-stage probability sampling method. Ordinary least square regressions in a hierarchical process and change score method were used to analyze the two-wave panel data. Older Korean immigrants reported higher levels of psychological distress than the non-Hispanic White elderly at both Time 1 and Time 2. Changes in self-assessed health status and functional limitations were significantly associated with change in psychological distress for both ethnic groups. Increased social support significantly decreased psychological distress at Time 2, for older Korean immigrants only. This study discusses practice and policy implications for service and interventions for older immigrants to assist their adjustment to a host society."
15448817,"To investigate the determinants of malnutrition among low-income children, the effects of socioeconomic, environmental, reproductive, morbidity, child care, birthweight and breastfeeding variables on stunting and wasting were studied. All 354 children below two years of age living in two urban slum areas of Pelotas, southern Brazil, were included. The multivariate analyses took into account the hierarchical structure of the risk factors for each type of deficit. Variables selected as significant on a given level of the model were considered as risk factors, even if their statistical significance was subsequently lost when hierarchically inferior variables were included. The final model for stunting included the variables education and presence of the father, maternal education and employment, birthweight and age. For wasting, the variables selected were the number of household appliances, birth interval, housing conditions, borough, birthweight, age, gender and previous hospitalizations."
18194525,"BACKGROUND: Considering the high costs of sick leave and the consequences of sick leave for employees, an early return-to-work of employees with mental disorders is very important. Therefore, a workplace intervention is developed based on a successful return-to-work intervention for employees with low back pain. The objective of this paper is to present the design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the workplace intervention compared with usual care for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. METHODS: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with a follow-up of one year. Employees eligible for this study are on sick leave for 2 to 8 weeks with common mental disorders. The workplace intervention will be compared with usual care. The workplace intervention is a stepwise approach that aims to reach consensus about a return-to-work plan by active participation and strong commitment of both the sick-listed employee and the supervisor. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome of this study is lasting return-to-work, which will be acquired from continuous registration systems of the companies after the follow-up. Secondary outcomes are total number of days of sick leave during the follow-up, severity of common mental disorders, coping style, job content, and attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy determinants. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from the societal perspective. A process evaluation will also be conducted. DISCUSSION: Return-to-work is difficult to discuss in the workplace for sick-listed employees with mental disorders and their supervisors. Therefore, this intervention offers a unique opportunity for the sick-listed employee and the supervisor to discuss barriers for return-to-work. Results of this study will possibly contribute to improvement of disability management for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. Results will become available in 2009. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN92307123."
7946257,"The opioid antagonist naltrexone was administered to 8 adults with severe or profound mental retardation and extensive histories of self-injurious behavior. Five-minute behavioral samples were observed randomly out of every hour from 8 a.m. through 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, for four 2-week phases (baseline, placebo, 50 mg, and 100 mg). During naltrexone administration, there were fewer days with frequent head-banging and self-biting, whereas there were more days on which blows to the head or self-biting were infrequent. Self-injurious participants slept 1.38 hours less per night during baseline, which was unaffected by naltrexone."
16004700,"BACKGROUND: Little work has been published on short-term inpatient treatments combining the virtues of inpatient treatments and short-term psychotherapy. The purposes of this study are to (a) determine the outcomes of short-term psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy from patients' and therapists' perspectives, (b) assess the stability of changes, and (c) identify predictors of long-term outcome. METHODS: 83 consecutive inpatients (76% of those eligible) were assessed at intake, discharge, and 1 year follow-up by standardized questionnaires regarding symptoms (SCL-90R), interpersonal problems (IIP), object relationships (IPO), and the therapeutic relationship (HAQ). Diagnoses and functioning (GAF) were assessed by the therapists. RESULTS: Psychological distress (effect size S = 1.14) and physical complaints (ES = 1.03) decreased strongly from intake to discharge, the majority of patients moving from the pathological to the normal range of the global severity index GSI (SCL-90R). At follow-up, average distress remained at a low level, and the majority of patients, and their therapists and physicians, regarded their well-being as improved. In a multivariate approach, a substantial proportion of variance of the distress at follow-up (42%) was explained by an infantile object relationship pattern (IPO), social avoidance (IIP), negative vocational changes, and a lack of a confidant at follow-up. A delayed start of subsequent ambulatory psychotherapy was another negative outcome predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Attention should be given to maladaptive interpersonal relationship patterns, to vocational reintegration, and a confiding relationship as potential predictors of long-term outcome. Also, patterns of ambulatory after-care following inpatient treatment need further scrutiny."
1434562,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a serious health problem for adolescents, occurring in an estimated one-quarter of sexually active teen-agers. Many of the health problems--including STDs--result from specific risk-taking behaviors. Determinants of STD risks among adolescents include behavioral, psychological, social, biological, institutional factors. Education is an important component in STD control in adolescents. The goal of education is to increase adolescent self-efficiency in practicing STD prevention and risk-reduction. A comprehensive approach including quality, theory-based education, accessible and effective health clinics, and improved social and economic conditions has the most promise of controlling STDs in adolescents."
16397202,"While the role of impaired cognition in accounting for functional outcome in schizophrenia is generally established by now, the overlap is far from complete. Moreover, little is known about the potential mechanisms that bridge between cognition and functional outcome. The aim of this article is to aid in closing this gap by presenting a novel, more ecologically valid approach for neuropsychological assessment. The new approach is motivated by the view that metacognitive processes of self-monitoring and self-regulation are fundamental determinants of competent functioning in the real world. The new approach incorporates experimental psychological concepts and paradigms used to study metacognition into current standard neuropsychological assessment procedures. Preliminary empirical data that support and demonstrate the utility of the new approach for assessment, as well as remediation efforts, in schizophrenia are presented and discussed."
12294784,"""When capital and labor markets are imperfect, choice sets narrow, and parents must choose how to ration available funds and time between their children. One consequence is that children become rivals for household resources. In economies with pro-male bias, such rivalries can yield gains to having relatively more sisters than brothers. Using a rich household survey from Ghana [the 1988-1989 Ghana Living Standards Survey], we find that on average if children had all sisters (and no brothers) they would do roughly 25-40% better on measured health indicators than if they had all brothers (and no sisters)."""
17307955,"This paper advocates that mental health promotion receive appropriate attention within health promotion. It is of great concern that, in practice, mental health promotion is frequently overlooked in health promotion programmes although the WHO definitions of health and the Ottawa Charter describe mental health as an integral part of health. It is suggested that more attention be given to addressing the determinants of mental health in terms of protective and risk factors for both physical and mental conditions, particularly in developing countries. Examples of evidence-based mental health programmes operating in widely diverse settings are presented to demonstrate that well designed interventions can contribute to the well-being of populations. It is advocated that particular attention be given to the intersectorial cooperation needed for this work."
2265661,"Demographic measures, psychosocial variables, and objective and subjective measures of physical impairment were assessed in elderly men twice at intervals of 12 to 18 months. Canonical discriminant function analysis of the relationship between these predictor variables on the first testing and whether participants (a) returned for retesting, (b) did not return because of apparent disinterest, or (c) did not return because of illness or death, revealed two significant canonical variates. The first, characterized by decreased mental and physical capacity, discriminated between the deceased/ill group and the other two groups. The second was characterized by decreased social interaction and life satisfaction, and increased life events, and distinguished between the disinterested group and the other two groups. However, both groups that failed to return for retesting showed evidence of impaired physical health and a general disengagement from social and personal activities, compared to the retested group."
1956905,"When the conceptualization of OR is inappropriate, institutionalization will not take place. For this reason, the discussion here has focused as much on the pitfalls in OR design as on factors that facilitate institutionalization. Research that is inappropriately adapted to the societal or programmatic context will not be institutionalized, nor will OR lead to institutionalized research capabilities if theory is ignored or the research lacks credibility. The institutionalization of credible and scientifically sound OR requires well-trained social scientists who can carry out this task. Career opportunities must persist in OR so that well-trained scientists will find in an attractive and rewarding pursuit. Long-term projects facilitate institutionalization by providing a setting where work teams can be developed and career tracks defined. Academics and universities institutionalize OR by sponsoring training in applied research and developing high-level research leadership. For this reason, institutional linkages and mechanisms that nurture collaboration facilitate the institutionalization of OR. Finally, institutionalization of OR implies that research is being utilized for action by program management and the policy community. There is extensive literature on the determinants of research utilization, much of which is relevant to the question of how OR can be institutionalized."
15704819,"Changes in conduct problems from middle school through early adulthood were examined in a sample of 1191 African American and White males and females. Predictors were selected from a number of ecological contexts to examine the relative contribution of family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors to conduct problems during the 7th, 8th, and 11th grade and across transitions in middle school, into high school, and into young adulthood. Almost all contexts made a unique contribution to conduct problems except for the neighborhood setting. The variables that had the most regular influences during each of these periods were Family Consistent Control, Family Discipline Harshness, and Negative Peers. Positive family and positive peer variables had less consistent relations to outcomes. School variables were more influential in middle school than later. Few gender or race differences were found in the patterning of predictors across time. Studies using only one or two settings as predictors of conduct problems, may provide a misleading picture of their impact by excluding other contextual influences."
11310574,"Although older persons' engagement in postretirement employment has been perceived to foster successful aging, the relationship between postretirement employment and elders' perceived quality of life has not been empirically tested. This article analyzes the effects of postretirement employment on older women's life satisfaction by comparing those who continued to work or (re)entered the labor market with those who did not engage in paid work after the receipt of their first Social Security benefits. The findings show that postretirement employment in itself does not contribute to older women's life satisfaction, but financial resources and especially the older women's concerns about their own financial situation are potent determinants of their life satisfaction. The need to incorporate the role of financial resources and subjective financial satisfaction in the theoretical framework for elders' perceived quality of life is discussed."
17472062,"Health is an axiological category, which does not possess measurable matter parameters. The problem of health is sometimes raised in families, social circles and institutions. Due to the fact that students of special pedagogy have contacts with school children with health deficits, they have to be fully aware of the fact how significant predicator health is in their own development. The target of this study was to show the output of the research aimed at seeking an answer to the following question: What level of knowledge about health and its determinants in their own perception is presented by the students on the grounds of the educational specialty they have chosen? The research comprised 84 students of 1st, 3rd and 5th years of the faculty of special pedagogy (different specialties) aged from 18 to 24. The research material was collected by an interview questionnaire elaborated by themselves and categorized conversation (""a ladder"") concerning three of the following basic questions: 1) the amount of general knowledge about health they possessed; 2) the amount of their knowledge of factors conditioning a human's state of health; 3) the amount of the awareness of the importance of one's care for his or her own health and for that of others. The output received in the research shows a mean degree of satisfaction of special pedagogy students with the level of their knowledge concerning health. Their statements connected with their self-assessment of that level should make one reflect upon the subject in question."
7836655,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare two methods of measuring physical function in subjects with a broad range of abilities and to evaluate the effects of cognitive, social, educational, and age factors on the relationship between the two methods. DESIGN: Multiple regression analysis was used to compare self-perceived (dependent variables) with performance measures (independent variables). Covariates included age, gender, Mini-Mental State Exam score, education, living status, and depression score. SETTING: Five community-dwelling and two nursing home sites. PARTICIPANTS: 417 community-dwelling subjects and 200 nursing home residents aged 62-98 years. MEASUREMENTS: Self-perceived physical function was assessed with the physical dimension summary score of the Sickness Impact Profile, which comprises three subscales: ambulation, mobility, and body care and movement. Physical performance was evaluated by self-selected gait speed, chair-stand time, maximal grip strength, and a balance score. RESULTS: Nursing home residents and community-dwellers were significantly different (P < .0001) in all variables except age and gender. Self-perceived and performance-based measures were moderately correlated, with a range from r = -.194 to r = -.625 (P < .05). Gait speed was the strongest independent predictor of self-perceived physical function in both groups. Symptoms of depression were also an independent predictor of self-perceived function in nursing home residents; subjects who had such symptoms report more self-perceived dysfunction than would be predicted based on performance tests. CONCLUSIONS: Self-selected gait speed is a global indicator of self-perceived physical function over a broad range of abilities. External determinants (depressive symptoms, cognitive function, marital status, etc.) affect self-perceived function in both groups, but gait speed is the greatest single predictor of self-perceived function. In nursing home residents depressive symptomatology is related to self-perceived."
12321105,"""Based on the argument that values and expectations underlie behavioral motives, this study explores the determinants of migration-related values and expectations, and whether they are intervening factors in explaining intentions to move among residents of rural northeast Thailand. Data from the 1992 National Migration Survey of Thailand identify four migration-related value-expectancy dimensions: income, affiliation, stimulation, and comfort. Logistic regression analysis shows that landownership and being married are associated with higher expectations, while a diversified village economy, a village economy development program, and a younger and extended household structure are associated with lower expectations of attaining valued goals in the local rural village. The analysis also shows that value-expectancy concepts are only partial intervening explanations for intentions to move or stay."""

This study documents the associated factors to sexual risk behaviours practices of University of Ibadan, Nigeria freshmen. Eight hundred and forty one (841), freshmen who attended a routine orientation program were asked to respond to a questionnaire. Results showed that 30.8% were sexually active and 47% did not use condom in their last sexual episode. Associated with sexual risk behaviours include: being a male freshman increasing age; lower tendency for violence; increase sexual compulsivity; alcohol abuse; history of rape and a history of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA). Three variables: alcohol abuse; history of CSA and increasing age remained significant in a multiple regression analysis. The paper presents the first evidence of vulnerability of freshmen to sexual risk practices in a Nigerian University."

23008679,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to explore the perception of body weight among students in schools in Jeddah City and identify the main determinants of self-perceived obesity, weight management goals and practices. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected from a sample of Saudi school children of 42 boys' and 42 girls' schools in Jeddah city during the month of April 2000. Personal interviews were conducted to collect data on socio-demographic factors, food choices, perception of body weight, weight management goals and weight management practices, as well as the actual measurement of weight and height. Students were asked about their perception of their body weight [responses included: very underweight (thin), slightly underweight, about right weight, slightly overweight and grossly overweight (obese)]. Proportion, prevalence and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for an attempt to lose weight and weight management practices. RESULTS: The distribution of self-perception of body size was nearly similar to the measured body mass index (BMI) classification except for the overweight students, where 21.3% perceived themselves, as slightly overweight and 5.5% as very overweight although 13.4% were actually overweight and 13.5% were obese by BMI standards. Approximately half the students took at least 3 pieces of fruit or fruit juice servings, and a third ate at least 4 vegetable servings per day. A third of the students managed to lose weight. This coincides with the proportion of those actually overweight and obese. Around 28.0% of the students ate less food, fat or calories, 31.0% took exercise and 17.6% were engaged in vigorous exercise to lose weight or prevent weight gain. Staying for at least 24 hours without food which is a potentially harmful means of weight control was practiced by 10.0% of students. Females were less likely than males to be overweight and obese but more likely to perceive themselves as grossly overweight and more likely to try to lose weight. Factors associated with efforts to lose weight by eating less fat or fewer calories were older age, high social class, being actually obese and perceiving oneself as being obese. Staying for at least 24 hours without eating was mainly practiced by females, older age groups, and the actually obese. Exercise was done mainly by the older age groups, those with educated and highly educated mothers, obese and perceiving oneself as being obese. Vigorous exercise was mainly performed by males, younger age groups, taking < 3 pieces of fruit or fruit juice servings per day, eating < 4 vegetable servings per day, and those perceiving themselves as obese. CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity are prevalent among our youth and not all obese have a correct image of their body size. Highly recommended are intervention programs of education on nutrition starting in childhood through school age to promote and ensure healthy food choices, improve student's awareness of ideal body size and clinical obesity, encourage physical exercise but discourage potentially harmful weight control measures."
1941394,"The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of multiple psychosocial and knowledge-related antecedent factors that may predict sexual and alcohol and drug use behaviors that are associated with the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus infection. Five hundred forty-four ninth-grade urban high school students were surveyed regarding knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to STDs and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Results of multiple regression analyses indicate that higher levels of STD and AIDS knowledge were associated with lower levels of STD and AIDS anxiety (R2 delta = 0.09; p less than 0.001), fewer negative attitudes toward people with AIDS (R2 delta = 0.09; p less than 0.001), stronger perceptions of self-efficacy (R2 delta = 0.03; p less than 0.01), and stronger peer affiliation (R2 delta = 0.02; p less than 0.05). Negative attitudes toward people with AIDS were inversely related to knowledge (R2 delta = 0.08; p less than 0.001), social support (R2 delta = 0.02; p less than 0.01), and perceived self-efficacy (R2 delta = 0.01; p less than 0.05). Predictors of alcohol and drug use included perceived peer norms (R2 delta = 0.08; p less than 0.001) and strong peer affiliation (R2 delta = 0.05; p less than 0.001). The best predictor of sexual risk behavior was alcohol and drug use (R2 delta = 0.07; p less than 0.001). Lower levels of knowledge (R2 delta = 0.14; p less than 0.01) and perceived peer norms (R2 delta = 0.05; p less than 0.05) predicted nonuse of condoms. Our results indicate that several factors relate to adolescent risk for STDs: the connection between peer influence and adolescent risk behaviors, the link between alcohol and drug use and sexual risk behavior, and the role of knowledge in determining nonuse of condoms."
17363221,"PURPOSE: Recent work suggested that psychosis might be expressed at subclinical levels. However, the determinants of subclinical psychotic symptoms, the degree of continuity over the life span, and the impact on functioning remain unclear. Thus we analyzed the prevalence, determinants, patterns and impact of subclinical psychotic symptoms in a community cohort over a 20-year period. METHODS: The Zurich Study - a longitudinal community study - started in 1979 with a sample of 591 participants aged 20/21 years. Follow-up interviews were conducted at age 23, 28, 30, 35 and 41. Symptoms were assessed with a semi-structured interview and the SCL90-R. In this analysis, items of the SCL90-R symptom dimensions ""paranoid ideation"" and ""psychoticism"" were examined. RESULTS: Two distinct symptom dimensions of subclinical psychosis became evident, one representing schizophrenia nuclear symptoms, the other representing schizotypal signs. Cannabis use in adolescence was associated specifically with schizophrenia nuclear symptoms, whereas childhood adversity as well as chronic physical or mental disorders in parents contributed to schizotypal signs. Individuals with a persistently high level of either of the two identified symptom dimensions over 20 years experienced significant deficiencies in social achievement and functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of psychotic symptoms in populations is continuous and characterized by differing levels of severity and persistence. A small group of individuals displays persistence of subclinical psychotic symptoms over a period of 20 years. The causes of and pathways to clinical psychotic disorder can be studied long before the disorder becomes clinically relevant."
12285416,"""The purpose of this paper was to analyse the determinants of the retirement decision of the elderly in Belgium, and, by making some simulations, to find out what would be the financial implications for the government budget of changes in the social security system.... The largest effect on labor supply is caused by changes in pensionable age. Giving a lump-sum pension to part-time workers seems an interesting policy to withdraw individuals from the labor market at a relatively low cost. Introducing flexible retirement also is beneficial for the government budget and has, especially for women, a relatively large positive effect on labor supply."""
8459708,"The contribution of social and economic variables to changes in per capita alcohol consumption occurring between 1950 and 1986 is examined within a multivariate time series analysis framework. Specifically, we consider the net effects of family income, age structure of the population, marital instability, female labor force participation, real alcohol price and daily life routines on total alcohol consumption. Our findings indicate that changes in the population age structure and in daily life routines were associated with predicted changes in consumption over the period studied. They also indicate associations between marital instability and female labor force participation and consumption, although in the direction contrary to our prediction. Unlike a number of previous studies in which economic variables were found to be the major determinants of consumption trends, we find that family income and the price of alcohol play a minor role in the model we estimated. These results indicate that social structural factors have greater utility for our understanding of alcohol consumption patterns, and, by implication, for attempts to reduce alcohol-related social problems, than do economic factors."
9702829,"The relation between marital status, social integration and the mortality from all causes was examined in a population based cohort study. The 5-year-cohort consisted of 1,030 men and 957 women, aged 55-74 years who participated in the second MONICA Survey Augsburg, F.R.G., 1989/90 (MONICA = Monitoring of trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease). They were followed for mortality until 1995. Altogether 120 men and 45 women had died. Social integration was measured by an index of social ties. The index of social ties examined in these analyses includes (a) presence of a spouse, (b) number of close friends and relatives, (c) reported contact with close friends and relatives. Age standardized mortality rates (per 10,000 person years) were computed for men and women. Sex-specific Cox-proportional hazard models were used and hazard rate ratios (HRR) were calculated adjusting for age, hypertension, cigarette smoking, cholesterol, drinking alcohol, number of chronic diseases and self-reported health. Mortality rates were higher for men who were living alone (437.3) than for married men (235.3). Respectively in women the rates were 121.6 compared to 80.7. After controlling for age and self-reported health a HRR of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0-2.4) was observed for single, divorced or widowed men and a HRR of 1.6 (95% CI: 0.8-3.0) for women living alone. Low mortality rates were observed in people with many social ties (men: 180.1, women: 29.9). Mortality rates of people who gave no informations about social ties (men: 349.5, women: 124.9) were similar to those who had only few social ties (men: 321.1, women: 132.5). The findings showed that people with few social ties were more likely to die in the follow-up period than those with more extensive contacts. After adjusting for age and self-reported health the HRR for those with few ties compared to those with many social ties were 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.5) for men and 2.7 (95% CI: 1.1-6.6) for women. Similar results were found for people who gave no informations about their social ties (men: HRR = 1.4, 95% CI: 0.9-2.3; women: HRR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.0-6.9). Social relationships were shown to be important predictors of mortality in elderly women and men. These findings confirm the need for further research, which enables to take steps against high mortality of the social isolated elderly."
15613826,"PURPOSE: A structural equation model was analysed to explore the determinants of health behaviors of university students in Korea. METHOD: Nine hundred sixty nine university students were selected by random cluster sampling from five universities located in the central area of Korea. DATA COLLECTION: The data was collected by questionnaires about demographic characteristics, stressful life events, perceived social support, perceived health status and health behaviors. RESULTS: 1. Gender showed indirect effect on health behaviors. 2. Living together with(out) family had a direct effect on health behaviors: students living with family showed more positive health behaviors. 3. Stressful life events had an indirect effect on health behaviors via perceived health status; a higher score of stressful life events was the predictor for negative health behaviors. 4. A higher score of perceived health status predicted positive health behaviors. RECOMMENDATION: Each university should be encouraged to develop a health behavior control program and health promotion program for their own university students. It would be more effective to develop health programs separately according to the demographic or social characteristics of the students. It is also necessary for the Ministry of Education to reform the School Health Act and school health policy to strengthen a health promotion program for university students. In conclusion, following studies should identify and promote the validity and reliability of perceived health status and health behaviors measurements."
12224661,"Physical activity is a key component of energy balance and is promoted in children and adolescents as a lifelong positive health behavior. Understanding the potential behavioral determinants necessitates understanding influences from three fundamental areas: 1) physiologic and developmental factors, 2) environmental factors, and 3) psychological, social, and demographic factors. The literature to date has generally investigated potential predictors of physical activity in children and adolescents in each of these three general areas, although existing data rely largely on cross-sectional studies in which it is difficult to distinguish a determinant from a correlate. In all likelihood, aspects of each of these three areas interact in a multidimensional way to influence physical activity in youth. This article reviews evidence of potential determinants of physical activity in children and adolescents and provides recommendations for future work."
12971112,"As we move forward in the new century, epidemiologists and public health practitioners are faced with the challenge of reviewing the current direction of epidemiology and its links with public health. While the history of epidemiology has been a successful and productive one, there is a danger that modern epidemiology is becoming too narrow in its scope, concerned primarily with the analysis of risk factors in individuals, while ignoring sociological and ecological perspectives of health. We argue that a theoretical framework to guide the practice of epidemiology is needed which encompasses a role for social determinants of health while simultaneously also acknowledging the importance of behaviour and biology, and the inter-connectedness of all these factors. This paper presents a public health model of social determinants of health, which provides a framework for testing the causal pathways linking social determinant variables with health care system attributes, disease inducing behaviours and health outcomes. This approach provides an improved opportunity to identify and evaluate evidence-based public health interventions, and facilitates stronger links between modern epidemiology and public health practice."
15602147,"PURPOSE: Little is known about the contextual determinants for the maintenance of physical activity after cardiac rehabilitation. This study aimed to examine perceived social, psychological, and health-related barriers to the maintenance of physical activity among phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation graduates. METHODS: Researchers using an open-ended format asked 160 participants (121 men and 39 women) 6 months after rehabilitation to identify perceived barriers to physical activity maintenance. The content of the participant responses was analyzed through categorization and coding of data, with independent review used to assess accuracy and reliability of decision rules. A social ecologic perspective was used for secondary coding and categorization. A chi analysis of categories was conducted to explore differences by gender, ethnicity, education, and employment. RESULTS: Four categories were developed from the coded responses: intrapersonal, interpersonal, environmental, and organizational. In their responses, 93% of the participants reported intrapersonal barriers, with 24% reporting interpersonal barriers, 18% reporting environmental barriers, and 11% reporting organizational barriers. Years of education contributed significantly to acceptance of an inactive lifestyle among those less educated (chi = 32.489; P = .028). Employment status showed significant differences for work as a barrier among those employed full-time (chi = 13.570, P = .004). Barriers to physical activity by gender showed significant differences for interpersonal barriers as a whole (chi = 6.804; P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: The open-ended format provided rich narrative data regarding barriers to the maintenance of physical activity. The acknowledgment of barriers, particularly from a social ecologic perspective, is needed to guide innovative, multilevel interventions for promoting physical activity maintenance among those with diagnosed coronary heart disease."
10784368,"BACKGROUND: This study examined (1) disparities in the proportion of persons who accessed a physician for treatment of a diagnosed mental disorder across 17 health regions in Alberta, Canada, and (2) the extent to which regional disparities in physician access could be explained by differences in regional demographies, population needs, or physician supply. METHODS: The study illustrates the use of ecological comparisons for regional health system performance evaluations. Regional characteristics were aggregated from four sources of data: the health insurance registry file (population denominators and regional demographies), physician claims data (treatment access), census data (social indicators of population need), and the medical directory of the College of Physicians of Surgeons (physician supply). RESULTS: Regional variability in needs-adjusted measures of access to physician-based treatment services were comparatively small (varying by a factor of 1.6). Models containing adjustments for demography, need, and physician supply explained 41% of regional variation in access. Of the total variation explained, physician supply explained a smaller proportion (39%) in comparison to social demography and needs (61%). Few large regional imbalances were noted when needs-adjusted and supply-adjusted estimates were compared. Only two areas appeared to be underserviced in comparison to their local needs, reflecting approximately 6% of the provincial population. CONCLUSIONS: While all three study factors proved important, findings support the broad conclusion that social demography and social risk (a proxy for need) will remain the key determinants predicting access to physician services for treatment of mental disorders in publicly funded health systems."
16228697,"The aim of this was to examine rates and determinants of depressive symptomatology in the immediate postpartum period among Hispanic women in the United States. A total of 3952 Hispanic women who had delivered infants (parturients) were interviewed in postpartum wards in Miami, New York City and San Francisco. Symptoms of depression were regressed onto a series of social, psychological, and socioeconomic variables. Results showed that 42.6% of participants were probable cases of depression (CES-D > or = 16). Depression was negatively associated with perceived level of social support (adjusted OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.53-0.67) and health insurance coverage (adjusted OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.95), but not with the degree of acculturation or immigration status. It was found that depressive symptoms are common among Hispanic parturients. Pregnant Hispanic women should be carefully monitored for signs of depression and appropriate preventive measures are needed."
10681885,"Within societies, health and ill-health follow a social gradient: lower socioeconomic position, worse health. The slope of the gradient has varied over time. It is likely that social and economic circumstances play a role in this changing slope. Within Europe, differences in health between East and West have also varied in magnitude. The advantage in the West increased through the 1970s and 1980s. Although similar in their health trends up to 1989, the countries of central and eastern Europe have diverged quite sharply subsequently. It is again likely that changing social and economic fortunes account for these trends. There is evidence to support the role of psychosocial factors in relating to socioeconomic differences within and between countries."
10189981,"The present study examined gender, race, and binge status differences in alcohol consumption among Caucasian and African-American college students as well as situational differences as qualified by the race of binge drinkers. A confidential questionnaire was voluntarily completed by Caucasians (n = 102) and African-Americans (n = 81) at a medium-sized regional university. The data analysis revealed a significant gender effect on alcohol consumption, with men consuming more alcohol than women. There was no significant main effect of race on alcohol consumption. In addition, Caucasian binge drinkers had significantly higher interpersonal problem behavior scores than did binge-drinking African-Americans, and binge-drinking African-Americans had higher intrapersonal problem behavior scores than did binge-drinking Caucasians."
8265756,"Public service advertisements have been used by many in hopes of ""selling"" good health behaviors. But selling good behavior--even if it could be done more effectively--is not the best goal for using mass media to prevent health problems. Personal behavior is only part of what determines health status. Social conditions and the physical environment are important determinants of health that are usually ignored by health promotion advertising. Public service advertising may be doing more harm than good if it is diverting attention from more effective socially based health promotion strategies. Counter-ads are one communications strategy that could be used to promote a broader responsibility for rectifying health problems. In the tradition of advocacy advertising directly promoting policy rather than products, counter-ads promote views consistent with a public health perspective. Counter-ads set the agenda for health issues, conferring status on policy-oriented strategies for addressing health problems. The primary purpose of counter-ads is to challenge the dominant view that public health problems reflect personal health habits. They are controversial because they place health issues in a social and political context. Advertising strategies for health promotion range over a spectrum from individually oriented public service advertising to socially oriented counter-advertising. The recent anti-tobacco campaign from the California Department of Health Services represents advertisements across the spectrum. Counter-ads that focus on a politically controversial definition for health problems are an appropriate and necessary alternative to public service advertising."
17520162,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the social factors associated with self-reported emotional and behavioral problems among Greek adolescents. METHODS: At age 18, a population-based sample of 3373 Greek adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR) questionnaire. RESULTS: The results from the multivariate analysis indicated that both lack of intimate friendships and not having parental monitoring were independently associated with problem behavior among both male and female adolescents. Engagement in sexual activities was significantly associated with higher YSR scores among both genders. Absence of academic motivation was associated with higher YSR scores in girls only. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that social factors, including negative family functions, lack of academic motivation and not having close friends, were associated with emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents and imply the need to develop a supportive social network for adolescents."
10647902,"Heart rate variability (HRV) measures are associated with coronary heart disease incidence and mortality. Therefore insight into the genetic and environmental determinants of these measures may have clinical relevance. We assessed the role of genetic and environmental factors of time domain and frequency domain HRV indices. Participants were 451 kibbutz members, aged 15 and up, belonging to 80 families. HRV indices were calculated from Holter recordings measured over 5 min. Our data indicate that for the two time- and four frequency domain indices, a mixture of two normal distributions fit the data significantly better than a single normal distribution (P<0.05). We used complex segregation analysis to infer the modes of inheritance of these HRV measures. We found evidence for possible involvement of a recessive major gene in the inheritance of the root mean square of successive differences in RR intervals (RMSSD), which is predominantly vagally mediated. A putative major gene explains 28%-34% of the adjusted inter-individual variability. The SD, determined by a mixture of mechanisms, is influenced by environmental and polygenic effects, but not by a major gene. The findings regarding the heritability of the frequency domain indices were not conclusive. However, the involvement of genetic factors was not rejected. Additional studies in extended families are needed to confirm the involvement of major genes in the determination of the autonomic activity."
16900304,"BACKGROUND: Social network has considerable impact on physical and mental health. Patients experiencing first-episode psychosis early in adult life may experience severe problems concerning development and maintenance of their social network. METHODS: A total of 547 first-episode psychotic patients (18-45) were randomised to standard or integrated treatment, (ACT, social skills training and family intervention), and followed up at 2 years. RESULTS: Service use or psychotic symptom score did not influence the social network size, measured after the first 2 years of treatment. Small network size was associated with long duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), poor premorbid adjustment, male gender and severe negative symptoms. The number of friends at 2-year follow-up was predicted by age, A-level status, negative symptoms and number of friends at entry, while the determinants for number of family contacts were age, gender, disorganised dimension and family contacts at entry. CONCLUSIONS: Premorbid functioning, network size at entry and DUP is closely related to small social network size. The integrated psychosocial treatment programme was not sufficient to address this problem."
17003158,"PURPOSE: A seamless system of social, behavioral, and medical services for the uninsured was created to address the social determinants of disease, reduce health disparities, and foster local economic development in 2 inner-city neighborhoods and 2 rural counties in New Mexico. METHODS: Our family medicine department helped urban and rural communities that had large uninsured, minority populations create Health Commons models. These models of care are characterized by health planning shared by community stakeholders; 1-stop shopping for medical, behavioral, and social services; employment of community health workers bridging the clinic and the community; and job creation. RESULTS: Outcomes of the Health Commons included creation of a Web-based assignment of uninsured emergency department patients to primary care homes, reducing return visits by 31%; creation of a Web-based interface allowing partner organizations with incompatible information systems to share medical information; and creation of a statewide telephone Health Advice Line offering rural and urban uninsured individuals access to health and social service information and referrals 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Health Commons created jobs and has been sustained by attracting local investment and external public and private funding for its products. Our department's role in developing the Health Commons helped the academic health center (AHC) form mutually beneficial community partnerships with surrounding and distant urban and rural communities. CONCLUSIONS: Broad stakeholder participation built trust and investment in the Health Commons, expanding services for the uninsured. This participation also fostered marketable innovations applicable to all Health Commons' sites. Family medicine can promote the Health Commons as a venue for linking complementary strengths of the AHC and the community, while addressing the unique needs of each. Overall, our experience suggests that family medicine can play a leadership role in building collaborative approaches to seemingly intractable health problems among the uninsured, benefiting not only the community, but also the AHC."
9529952,"We have 6.9% of the population who are 65 years and older in June 1996. This figure will increase to 18.4% in 2030. In absolute numbers, the increase will be from 209,700 to 789,600 million in 2030. The majority of these however, will be ambulant and independent. Our important task in the health context is to help ageing persons maintain function and quality of life to achieve the maximum life-span potential. To achieve this, we need to focus on individual preventive efforts to develop the medical profession in the new medicine paradigm, to provide care and we need to develop at the societal level the well network, the activating network and the health & nursing care network as an integrated seamless service. We also need at a societal level, to invest in the determinants of good health and disability-free life, namely, financial independence, acceptance by the family and recognition of the elderly, as valued members of society."
12321166,"""This paper analyses population change in the Belfast Urban Area (BUA) [of Northern Ireland] between 1971 and 1991 in its socio-economic context to understand the nature of urban social change. Although considering religious factors as a cause of population change, the research compares the BUA with other urban areas and relates developments in Belfast to some literature on sociospatial polarisation and the inverted question markunderclass'.... The results suggest that population change is not driven by explicitly religious factors, the relationship between religion and socio-economic well-being has changed, and that changes in religious mixing and segregation occur in many contexts. The BUA is like other urban areas, albeit with unique features arising from the influence of religion."""
10468392,"Most national surveys of health care utilisation capture only self-reported measures of morbidity. If self-reported morbidity is measured with error, then the results of applied work may be misleading. In this paper we propose a model of the relationship between morbidity and health service utilisation which allows for reporting errors and simultaneity. Errors in self-reported morbidity are expressed as a function of person-specific reporting thresholds and recent contact with health services, arising because of better self-evaluation of current health status or a desire to justify consumption of a publicly-provided good. We demonstrate the bias in ignoring the potential problems of reporting errors and simultaneity for a variety of special cases, but in the general case the biases are of ambiguous sign. The empirical nature of these biases is investigated using limiting long-standing illness (LLI) and recent contact with a General Practitioner (GP) in two waves of The UK Health and Lifestyle Survey. Biomedical measures of functioning are used as objective indicators of health status. We find evidence of substantial and significant differences between individuals in reporting thresholds and some evidence that the reporting of LLI may depend on recent visits to a GP. Adjustments for these biases significantly increase the estimated effect of morbidity on utilisation."
10755056,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QOL) has gained importance as a global measure of social and clinical outcome in schizophrenia. AIMS: To identify the clinical correlates of QOL at the time of first presentation with schizophrenia. METHOD: Over two years, consecutive first-episode psychosis patients presenting to a catchment area psychiatric service underwent validated clinical assessments of premorbid adjustment, illness duration, symptoms and QOL. RESULTS: At presentation, subjects already had a diminished QOL. Although independent of gender and age at onset of psychosis, QOL was influenced by premorbid adjustment, duration of untreated psychosis and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the duration of untreated psychosis may have a beneficial effect on the subsequent QOL of patients presenting with schizophrenia. First-episode patients with a protracted duration of untreated psychosis or impaired premorbid adjustment may warrant specific treatment interventions to prevent the development of secondary handicaps."
15652683,"The social determinants of intellectual disability (ID) are poorly understood, particularly in Australia. This study has investigated sociodemographic correlates of ID of unknown cause in Western Australian born children. Using record linkage to the Western Australian Maternal & Child Health Research Database, maternal sociodemographic characteristics of children with ID (of unknown cause) born between 1983 and 1992 (n = 2871) were compared with those of children without ID (n = 236,964). Socioeconomic indices for areas based on the census district of mother's residence were also included in the analysis. Aboriginal mothers (OR = 2.83 [CI: 2.52, 3.18]), teenagers (OR = 2.09 [CI: 1.82, 2.40]) and single mothers (OR = 2.18 [CI: 1.97, 2.42]) were all at increased risk of having a child with mild or moderate ID. Children of mothers in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged 10% had more than five times the risk of mild and moderate ID compared with those in the least disadvantaged 10% (OR = 5.61 [CI: 4.42, 7.12]). Fourth or later born children were also at increased risk (OR = 1.82 [CI: 1.63, 2.02]). The results of the study have implications both for further aetiological investigation as well as service provision for children with ID. Furthermore, many of the sociodemographic correlates identified in this study, particularly in the mild/moderate category of ID, are potentially modifiable, opening up opportunities for primary prevention."
10120999,"Coronary heart disease deaths have declined in New Zealand, as in other Western countries, during the past two decades. This is probably due to a combination of population lifestyle changes and improved treatment of the disease. However, the social class gradient for coronary disease has reversed and it is now more common in lower socio-economic groups who are increasingly disadvantaged in our community. Socioeconomic factors are powerful, primary determinants not only of coronary disease but also of many of the other health problems outlined in the New Zealand Health Charter. Policy making and health services delivery shape societal conditions essential for true health. These factors are considered in relation to the spectrum of human communication and the current transitional changes in our health system."
7920876,"Overweight and obesity are associated with increased mortality and morbidity, and human weight is influenced by multiple factors, both genetically and environmentally determined. We investigated the influence of some socioeconomic, behavioral, dietary and reproductive factors on body mass index (BMI). Data were obtained from a comparison group of a case-control study of gastrointestinal cancers from the four largest teaching and general hospitals in Milan, northern Italy. The subjects were 1,188 men and 832 women admitted between January 1985 and June 1992 to the hospitals under study for diseases other than malignant or digestive and not known or suspected to be related to alcohol or tobacco. The following were measured: BMI (Quetelet's index, weight, kg/height, m2) and the corresponding standard errors (s.e.) in strata of selected variables, linear regression coefficients (beta) and correlation coefficients between BMI and each variable. Mean BMI increased with age until 35-44 years in men and 45-54 years in women. In both sexes BMI was inversely associated with education and social class. Smokers tended to be leaner than non-smokers, but no consistent trend was observed with increasing numbers of cigarettes. Alcohol drinkers had mean BMI similar to non-drinkers, except heavy drinking women who were lighter. BMI was not significantly associated with coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea, bread, vegetable and fruit consumption. No relation was observed between total estimated caloric intake and BMI. In women BMI was directly associated with marriage and number of children, and inversely with oral contraceptive use.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2018460,"We report analyses of data on body fat from a cohort of 34 separated monozygotic twin pairs (MZA) and a matched sample of 38 pairs of monozygotic twins reared together (MZT) originally studied by James Shields. The correlation for MZA pairs was .61 and the correlation for MZT pairs was .75. These correlations did not differ significantly, nor did correlations differ between MZA pairs subclassified as having been raised in relatively more or less similar environments. Our results suggest important roles for both genes and environment in the accumulation of body fat and support other adoption studies in suggesting that adult environments rather than rearing environments are the most important nongenetic determinants of levels of body fat in adults."
9813812,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Previous evaluations of life satisfaction and health have not completely explained the impact of social network, social support, and economics on the oral health-related behavior of elderly patients, particularly in relation to missing teeth. PURPOSE: This study measured the strength of associations between social network/support/class and the use of complete and removable partial dentures in elderly patients living independently. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multiple stepwise logistic regression was used to contrast data from previous studies relating to the subject and to explore the influence of these social variables. RESULTS: The results substantiated the links observed in a previous study between some social features and oral fitness. More frequent use of complete dentures was identified among participants who reported higher incomes and among those who thought their incomes were sufficient for their needs. Unreplaced missing anterior teeth were associated more commonly with subjects less willing or able to leave their homes. CONCLUSIONS: Some salient features of prosthodontic care and oral health status were common to 2, comparable social environments. A minority within the elderly population may not see a need to make use of clinical dental services, regardless of how accessible these services are to them. Social network and social support issues may be important determinants in this perceived need to use clinical services."
9807774,"Social scientists have long been interested in the study of grief and bereavement, but only recently has research focused on the aftereffects of sudden loss. Theory and research alike suggest that grief is multidimensional and that specific grief reactions have a unique set of predictors. The purpose of this study is to examine the relative contribution of risk factors in explaining variations in specific grief reactions following a sudden death. Data for this study come from medical examiners' reports and mail-back surveys of survivors of sudden loss from suicide or accident. The results indicate that several characteristics of the survivor, mode of death, and social support are important determinants of grief symptomatology. This research concludes by directing future theoretical and empirical endeavors to examine more fully the role of relational factors in influencing grief experiences following bereavement."
11092151,"This study was designed to examine the attitudes of student athletes toward the use of painkilling drugs. A total of 563 student athletes at two Division One NCAA universities were surveyed in this study. Twenty-nine percent of the student athletes (n = 165) reported that they felt there is nothing wrong with using painkilling drugs on the day of competition (when injured) to cope with pain. These student athletes reported that they would use painkilling drugs to mask injury in order to continue to participate in their sport. Student athletes' perceptions of societal norms and expectations related to competition, and the degree of control student athletes perceive that they have when deciding to use painkillers, may be important determinants governing the extent to which they may be at risk for abusing these substances. Research on planned behavior and reasoned action against suggests that salient beliefs affect intentions and subsequent behaviors, either through attitudes or subjective norms, or the degree of (perceived) control that an individual feels he/she has over the behavior [1, 2]. This theoretical model was used as a guiding framework for analyzing the attitudes of college athletes toward painkilling drugs. Recommendations are included in this article for coaches, educators, team physicians, team trainers, and administrators who are concerned about controlling the use and abuse of painkilling drugs by student athletes."
12320037,"This study analyses an economic model of pregnancy resolution; that is, a model of the choice by a pregnant woman to abort her fetus or carry it to term. This analysis, using an analytical model derived from the household utility framework, adds to previous research by presenting race- and residence-specific estimates of how individual characteristics, history of abortion, and the community-based factors determine women's choices of giving birth vs. aborting. The main data for estimating the model were drawn from the 1984 vital statistics of all induced abortions and live births in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The major findings indicate that low parental education, high maternal age, previous early abortions, and the availability of abortion providers all significantly reduce the probability of choosing the live birth option. Married status and the availability of family planning clinics significantly increase the probability of the live birth option. The findings also suggest that women's choices between abortion and live birth vary substantially with race (White vs. Black) and residential (urban vs. rural) location."
24394711,"Nutrition rehabilitation of malnourished children remains a challenge for health services. This paper reports the results of an evaluation of the nutrition component of a mother and child health program in Nepal. The treatment of severely malnourished children was very satisfactory: case fatality rate varied from 4 to 9 % between projects. Follow-up, however, was found to be very poor: only one percent of the discharged children came for a follow-up visit after the first two weeks. The perception of malnutrition within the communities was identified as one of the possible determinants for a successful follow-up and small scale qualitative investigations were organized to gain insight in the topic. Results are quite revealing regarding the perception of nutrition problems. If for severe cases (kwashiorkor and marasmus) awareness of malnutrition did exist in the community, chronic malnutrition seems to be considered as a normal state of being. When a problem is perceived (in severe cases) people will seldom think of it as a nutrition related disease. Results show that the aetiology used by the people differs significantly from the western paradigm, and that traditional convictions put the causes at natural, supra-natural or social levels. The striking point is that no relation is established in the traditional framework between malnutrition (either severe or mild) and food intake of the children. Perception of malnutrition and of its causes influences health seeking behaviour in terms of prevention and treatment. Traditional healers play an important curative role and will often be the first to be contacted. The absence of perception of the links between the shape of the body and nutrients is put forward as one of the possible explaining mechanisms for low follow-up rates observed. An implication of this study would be to revise the health messages delivered to the communities in order to make them culturally more appropriate and relevant."
8730232,"The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics of person with alcohol use disorders who sought alcohol treatment with those who did not using data from a nationally representative sample of the United States. Applying an organizing framework from the larger literature on service utilization, a logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the interaction among factors influencing treatment. The results identified unemployment status and lower educational level as barriers to alcohol treatment, but the impact of these factors differed depending on whether the respondent had previous experience with alcohol treatment. The major findings of this study are discussed in terms of consumer satisfaction, minimizing barriers to alcohol treatment services, and the need to examine individual determinants of alcohol treatment within the larger context of organizational and sociopolitical factors."
1949104,"This study explores linkages between the status of women and fertility over time in Tamil Nadu, India, using sample survey data for currently married women aged 35-44 in 1970 and 1980. The effects of individual indicators of the status of women on fertility are decomposed into effects through each of the proximate variables, notably those affecting marriage duration, marital fertility, and contraception. There is considerable variation in the direction and magnitude of the relationships between the status indicators and fertility behavior and in the relationship to the underlying mechanisms at the two points in time. On balance, the evidence suggests improvements in the status of women come to exert an increasingly negative effect on fertility over the course of demographic transition."
7977915,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to identify the determinants of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in a population with full access to medical care. METHODS: Unionized New York City health care workers (n = 1394) with comprehensive medical insurance were screened for hypertension. Union records documenting all physician visits and prescription medications for the year before screening provided the opportunity to relate patterns of treatment to blood pressure outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 409 employees found to have hypertension, 289 (71%) were aware of their condition and 201 (49%) had been treated, but only 51 (12%) had their blood pressure controlled at the recommended level (< 140/90 mm Hg). In a logistic regression model, the only variable of treatment associated with control was days of antihypertensive medication. The total number of physician visits was not associated with control. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that in conventional community settings, even in the absence of financial barriers, treatment for hypertension continues to be characterized by poor outcomes. Improving access to primary care, without changes in the nature of that care, may not substantially improve blood pressure control."
7500175,"International health organizations have recommended exclusive breast-feeding (EBF) (i.e., breast milk as the only source of food) as the optimal infant feeding method during the first 4-6 mo of life. Therefore, it is important to document the determinants of EBF in different populations. Low-income urban women from Brazil (n = 446, 2 maternity wards), Honduras (n = 1582, 3 maternity wards) and Mexico (n = 765, 3 maternity wards) were interviewed at birth and in their homes at 1 mo and 2-4 mo after delivery. Multivariate survival analyses (Cox model) indicated that planned duration of EBF (all 3 countries), having a female infant, and not being employed (Brazil and Honduras), lower socioeconomic status (Honduras and Mexico) and higher birth weight (control hospital in Brazil and Honduras) were positively associated (P < or = 0.10) with EBF. Women who delivered in the maternity wards that had more developed breast-feeding promotion programs were more successful with EBF. The association between maternal education and EBF was modified by the maternity ward in Mexico and Honduras. Being > or = 18 y and having a partner living (Brazil) or not (Mexico) living at home were positively associated with EBF. These findings can contribute toward the design of EBF promotion efforts in Latin America."
10723646,"CONTEXT: Retrospective studies of pregnancy intendedness have revealed some characteristics that can help identify which women are more likely than others to experience an unintended birth. A comparison of these findings with those from a prospective analysis may shed greater light on the characteristics associated with unintended pregnancy. METHODS: Data were taken from the 1988 National Survey of Fertility Growth and a telephone reinterview of respondents conducted in 1990. Separate analyses were conducted of women intending to postpone childbearing for at least three years and of women intending to forgo all future childbearing. Logistic regression models were used to identify the effects of social and demographic characteristics, as well as change in marital status and certainty of intentions, on the odds of experiencing a birth in the interval between interviews. RESULTS: Only 10% of women intending to postpone pregnancy for more than three years and 8% of respondents seeking to forgo future childbearing had a birth in the interval between interviews. (These births, referred to as unpredicted births in this article, are roughly analogous to those labeled unintended in retrospective analyses.) Women with incomes below the poverty level were 2-3 times as likely as women with incomes between 100% and 199% of poverty to experience an unpredicted birth. Race was not a significant factor among women intending to avoid future childbearing, and became nonsignificant among those intending to postpone when change in marital status and contraceptive status were taken into account. Women aged 35 and older who wanted no more children were significantly less likely than women aged 20-29 to have an unpredicted birth. Women aged 30-34 who wanted to postpone childbearing were roughly 70% less likely than women aged 20-29 to experience an unpredicted birth. Overall, women who were at risk for a pregnancy but not practicing contraception were 2-3 times more likely than women using an effective method to have an unpredicted birth. CONCLUSIONS: There are at least two potential explanations for instances where the correlates of unintended births in the prospective analysis differ from those identified in retrospective studies. Certain subgroups of women may be more likely to classify births as wanted when they are asked retrospectively; alternatively, they may be more likely to experience changes in their living conditions that alter their fertility intentions."
8044971,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify determinants of coronary artery reactivity among premenopausal female monkeys. Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal females modulates reactivity of atherosclerotic coronary arteries. However, no studies have evaluated the factors that modulate coronary artery reactivity among premenopausal females. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five adult premenopausal female monkeys were fed an atherogenic diet for 32 months. During this time, monkeys were housed in small social groups and determined to be socially dominant (associated with normal ovarian function) or subordinate (associated with impaired ovarian function). After 32 months, coronary artery vasomotor responses to intracoronary acetylcholine, nitroglycerin, and serotonin were assessed by computer-assisted quantitative coronary angiography. Coronary arteries of dominant monkeys dilated (+9 +/- 2%), whereas those of subordinate monkeys constricted (-6 +/- 2%) in response to acetylcholine (P < .05). There was no effect of social status on vascular response to nitroglycerin or serotonin (P > .10). Vascular responses to acetylcholine were independent of social status effects on plasma lipids, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis extent. The correlation between acetylcholine responses and plasma estradiol concentration measured on the day of angiography was r = .7 (P = < .01). Furthermore, dilation occurred only if plasma estradiol concentrations were greater than 60 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial factors and endogenous estrogen production are important modulators of acetylcholine-mediated dilation of atherosclerotic coronary arteries among premenopausal female monkeys."
10927844,"Community members, service providers, and elected representatives in two Toronto communities were asked to identify community factors influencing the health of community members. Many of the identified barriers to health related to government policies and actions. Cutbacks in federal transfers to provinces and provincial cutbacks in funding for agencies, reductions in social assistance, ending of new social housing, and other policy changes were seen as negatively impacting the health of the community and its members. These perceptions were remarkably consistent with emerging findings concerning the determinants of health. Implications for public health practice were considered."
2255820,"Self-assessed well-being has been shown to be related to earlier medical events and to be a predictor of mortality. 50-year-old men and women (n = 314) in Kungsor were invited to an examination for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and different aspects of self-assessed well-being. The differences between men and women concerning their well-being could not explain the differences in the expected mortality between the sexes. A well-developed social network and physical exercise were the most positive determinants of well-being, while drug intake, angina pectoris, and smoking were the most negative."
12293330,"""While the abortion controversy captured the world's headlines, the real significance of the UN's [1994 International Conference on Population and Development] went largely unnoticed.... After decades of failure, the UN has finally pushed the issue of population control center stage by repackaging it in a blurry concern for the rights of women."" The author argues that the conference's strategy was to target women as both the cause of overpopulation and the locus of the problem's solution."
8218426,"Post-psychotic depression (PPD) is defined as the development of depression during the phase of remission of schizophrenia. Two groups of DSM-III-R schizophrenics, one with PPD and the other without PPD (30 subjects in each group) were compared. Significantly more patients in PPD group belonged to nuclear families, had longer duration of psychotic phase of the illness, were hospitalised more frequently and had more sadness and anxiety-somatisation during florid illness phase. The PPD group also had more past history of depression. Although PPD patients had better premorbid personal-social adjustment in comparison with non-PPD group, they perceived themselves to be lacking in social support and had experienced more stressful life events. For patients in the PPD group, stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed age of onset, sadness during florid psychotic state, premorbid adjustment, social support and life events as significant determinants of severity of depression in the post-psychotic phase."
18447989,"INTRODUCTION: Many factors have been reported as being responsible for starting smoking during school age, but it is still not well known which cognitive determinants may be used as predictive factors of tobacco use. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal, study, including 417 pupils from 12 to 17 years, was carried out over three years in two rural Secondary Education Institutes in Castilla y Leon. The ESFA questionnaire was used, which included scales on attitudes and beliefs, social influences, self-efficacy, intention to smoke in the future and smoker behaviour. RESULTS: Of the 417 pupils studied, 36.7 % were smokers (38.6 % females and 34.4 % males). The mean of starting smoking was 12 years (11.83-12.15). In the initial analysis there was a clear relationship between cognitive determinants and smoker behaviour. The advertising and peer pressure lost predictive value after 3 years. The multivariate analysis showed that the determining factors of tobacco use are, besides age (OR = 3.85; 95 % CI, 1.27-11.64), to have a favourable attitude to smoking, (OR = 4.47; 95 % CI, 2.15-9.32), and the conduct perceived among peers (OR = 5.05; 95 % CI, 2.50-10.19). CONCLUSIONS: The determining factors that demonstrates a clear relationship with smoker behaviour are, age, favourable attitude of pupils towards smoking, and the perceived behaviour by smoker friends. Smoking prevention programs should take these factors into accounts when designing their activities."
8798937,"OBJECTIVES: To study the resuscitation preferences, choice of decision-maker, views on the seeking of patients' wishes and determinants of these of elderly hospital in-patients. DESIGN: Questionnaire administered on admission and prior to discharge. SETTING: Two acute geriatric medicine units (Southampton and Poole). PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and fourteen consecutive consenting mentally competent patients admitted to hospital as emergencies. RESULTS: Resuscitation was wanted by 60%, particularly married and functionally independent patients and those who had not already considered it. Not wanted resuscitation was associated with lack of social contacts. Sixty-seven per cent welcomed enquiry about their preferences and 78% wanted participation in decision, 43% as sole decision-maker. Wishing to choose oneself was associated with not wanting resuscitation, prior knowledge of it, and lack of a spouse. Patients' opinions remained stable during their admission. CONCLUSIONS: Discussion of resuscitation is practical on hospital admission without causing distress and the views expressed endure through the period of hospitalisation. Elderly patients' attitudes depend partly on personal health and social circumstances. This may assist doctors when patients are unable to participate themselves."
19243657,"BACKGROUND: Depression in old age is an important public health problem causing considerable morbidity and disability worldwide. There is a dearth of community studies from India investigating geriatric depression and its associated risk factors. This study aimed to establish the nature, prevalence and factors associated with geriatric depression in a rural south Indian community. METHODS: We recruited 1000 participants aged over 65 years from Kaniyambadi block, Vellore, India. We assessed their socio-demographic profile, psychiatric morbidity, cognitive functioning, anthropometrics and disability status using the following structured assessment tools: Geriatric Mental State, Community Screening Instrument for Dementia, Modified CERAD 10 word list learning task, History and Aetiology Schedule Dementia Diagnosis and Subtype, WHO Disability Assessment Scale II, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory. We adopted a case control framework to study the factors associated with geriatric depression. RESULTS: Prevalence of geriatric depression (ICD-10) within the previous one month was 12.7% (95% CI 10.64-14.76%). Low income (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.08-2.91), experiencing hunger (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.56-4.26), history of cardiac illnesses (OR 4.75; 95% CI 1.96-11.52), transient ischemic attack (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.17-5.05), past head injury (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.36-5.36) and diabetes (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.15-4.72) increased the risk for geriatric depression after adjusting for other determinants using conditional logistic regression. Having more confidants (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.06-0.26) was the significant protective factor. Age, female gender, cognitive impairment and disability status were not significantly associated with geriatric depression. DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression was significantly correlated with experiencing hunger, diabetes, transient ischemic attack, past head injury, more disability and less nourishment; having more friends was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric depression is prevalent in rural south India. Poverty and physical ill health are risk factors for depression among elderly while good social support is protective."
10080364,"Interest in how best to influence the behaviour of clinicians in the interests of both clinical and cost effectiveness has rekindled concern with the social networks of health care professionals. Ever since the seminal work of Coleman et al. [Coleman, J.S., Katz, E., Menzel, H., 1966. Medical Innovation: A Diffusion Study. Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis.], networks have been seen as important in the process by which clinicians adopt (or fail to adopt) new innovations in clinical practice. Yet very little is actually known about the social networks of clinicians in modern health care settings. This paper describes the professional social networks of two groups of health care professionals, clinical directors of medicine and directors of nursing, in hospitals in England. We focus on network density, centrality and centralisation because these characteristics have been linked to access to information, social influence and social control processes. The results show that directors of nursing are more central to their networks than clinical directors of medicine and that their networks are more hierarchical. Clinical directors of medicine tend to be embedded in much more densely connected networks which we describe as cliques. The hypotheses that the networks of directors of nursing are better adapted to gathering and disseminating information than clinical directors of medicine, but that the latter could be more potent instruments for changing, or resisting changes, in clinical behaviour, follow from a number of sociological theories. We conclude that professional socialisation and structural location are important determinants of social networks and that these factors could usefully be considered in the design of strategies to inform and influence clinicians."
9919377,"This inquiry study is part of a comprehensive investigation on the organization and the effect of the education of students with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders in special recovery schools. The aim for conducting the inquiry is to reveal the characteristics of the family and social background which may affect the school adaptation. The investigated group includes 254 students--192 with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders and 62 healthy children of the same age from the settlements where the recovery schools are based. Two types of questionnaires developed by the team are used for investigating the students' family and social status--one designed for the pupils and one--for the teachers and supervisors in the schools. The inquiry for the students contains 15 questions revealing family and school environment (family relations and problems; number of children and sequential number of the problem child; parents' education and employment; school training and curriculum; social contacts in the school; school results). The inquiry, engaging the class teachers, day and night supervisors in recovery schools, contains 19 questions. There are additional questions concerning students' specific learning difficulties as well. The results made it clear that parents' divorce is the most unfavorable family determinant for school maladjustment of students with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders. Many other factors such as the poor educational qualification and social-professional status of the parents, children number, the sequential number of the problematic child additionally impedes the relationship with the parents, thus increasing the risk of school failure and the manifestations of school maladjustment. The determined peculiarities of the family environment of students with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders suggest targeted psychocorrective work of the school psychologist individually with the student as well as with his/her family."
9447725,"In this 2-wave panel study, the decision to have children was examined in the context of Feather's (1982) expectancy-value model among a representative sample of 288 childless Dutch adults aged 18-30 years. The effects of 2 indicators of developmental readiness (age and duration of relationship) were also explored. It was expected that (a) the likelihood of having a baby would increase as a function of intentions, evaluations of being childless, and expected rewards of having children and (b) developmental readiness would be positively related to whether respondents had children at the 2nd wave of the study. Structural equation modeling was used. The results largely supported expectations. Developmental readiness affected fertility both directly and indirectly via the expected rewards of having children."

Issues on which research and intervention studies are needed are identified."
17543712,"BACKGROUND: Drug abuse is a significant public health problem because of its association with numerous negative health and social consequences. Examining the social context of drug use represents a burgeoning avenue of research in drug abuse. This study investigates the effects of neighborhood disadvantage and network factors on current heroin and cocaine use among a predominantly African-American adult sample residing in Baltimore City. METHODS: This study employs a cross-sectional, multilevel design using data from two sources: the SHIELD Study, a network-oriented HIV intervention in Baltimore City and the 1990 U.S. Decennial Census. The sample consisted of 1305 adults from 249 neighborhoods (census block groups) across Baltimore City. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed to examine personal network and neighborhood effects on current heroin and cocaine use. RESULTS: Neighborhood poverty was significantly associated with current heroin and cocaine use (odds ratio [OR]=1.51, confidence interval [CI]=1.06-2.15). Social support (OR=0.80, CI=0.69-0.92) and having ties to employed people (OR=0.47, CI=0.24-0.92) were protective of current drug use, but did not buffer negative effects of neighborhood poverty in the face of negative drug influences in the network (OR=8.62, CI=5.81-12.79). CONCLUSIONS: The contexts of neighborhoods and networks represent key determinants in understanding the social epidemiology of drug abuse. Network attributes have strong influences on drug use, and neighborhood poverty may increase odds of use. Further research is warranted to determine other aspects of neighborhood environments that may put individuals at risk for drug use and abuse."
10573234,"Living conditions in eastern Germany have changed rapidly since unification in 1990 and little is known about how these changes affect the prevalence of atopic diseases. This study describes methods and prevalences of a large epidemiological project investigating determinants of childhood asthma and allergies in eastern (Dresden and Leipzig) and western (Munich) Germany in 1995/1996. Community based random samples of 9-11 yr old children in Dresden (n=3,017) and Munich (n=2,612), and of 5-7 yr old children in Dresden (n=3,300), Leipzig (n=3,167) and Munich (n=2,165) were studied by parental questionnaires, bronchial challenges with hypertonic saline, skin examination, skin-prick tests, and measurements of specific and total serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E using Phase II modules of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). In 9-11 yr old children, the prevalence of physician diagnosed asthma (7.9% versus 10.3%; p<0.01) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (15.7% versus 19.9%; p<0.05) was lower in Dresden than in Munich. No difference between Munich and Dresden was observed in the prevalence of diagnosed hay fever, skin test reactivity to > or = 1 allergen, and increased levels (>0.35 kU x L(-1)) of specific IgE against inhalant and food allergens. Symptoms and visible signs of atopic eczema tended to be more prevalent in Dresden. Similar East-West differences between the three study areas were seen in the younger age group. These findings are in line with recently observed increases in the prevalence of hay fever and atopic sensitization, but not of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, among 9-11 yr old children in Leipzig."
10453246,"This study in Bangladesh found that inter-cluster variation in the use of modern reversible methods of contraception was significantly attributable to the educational levels of the female family planning workers working in the clusters. Women belonging to clusters served by educated workers had a higher probability of being contraceptive users than those whose workers had only completed primary education. At the household level, important determinants of use were socioeconomic status and religion. At the individual level, the woman being the wife of the household head and having some education were positively related to her being a user. The model also found that inter-household variation was significantly greater than inter-cluster variation. Finally, the study concludes that after controlling for various covariates at all three levels, the clusters do not have significantly different levels of use of modern reversible methods of contraception. There are, however, some special areas where contraceptive use is dramatically low, and these contribute significantly to the observed inter-cluster variation."
12556926,"OBJECTIVE: To compare functional, emotional, and academic status of adolescents who had been extremely low birth weight (ELBW) with those who were full term. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six adolescents who were born in 1983 to 1984 at less than 801 g birth weight were compared with 26 adolescents born at term. Adolescent-perceived status was assessed using the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-SR) and the Self-Perception Profile. Parents' perceptions were assessed using BASC Parent Report, Family Impact Questionnaire, and Functional Status Measure. Health status was obtained through written requests to primary care providers and parent interviews. Academic and attendance information was obtained through school records. RESULTS: Compared to the term adolescents, the ELBW group had significantly lower function related to health status, increased need for special education, and tended to score lower on academic performance measures. However, ELBW adolescents' perceptions regarding their scholastic, athletic, or social competencies did not differ from the term group or national normative data. Parents of ELBWs reported lower adaptive skills, but no other behavioral differences from the term group. CONCLUSION: ELBW survivors and their parents perceived outcome at adolescence positively in spite of evident limitations. Mechanisms that ELBW families use to cope may be important determinants for successful, long-term outcome."
8357893,"Public health practice is in a transitory state, expanding considerably beyond medical and behavioural models of health and disease to encompass physical and social environmental health determinants. A new public health practice is emerging, apparent in initiatives like the international healthy cities/communities projects. This new public health practice must integrate the challenge of sustainable development, as defined by the 1987 World Commission on Environment and Development. The holosphere framework locates health as its central metaphor, and defines six interacting environmental spheres: a viable natural environment, a sustainable economic environment, a sufficient economy, an equitable social environment, a convivial community, and a livable built environment. There are five functional roles for local government: policy, legislation, education, partnerships and advocacy. Representative actions from each of the six environmental spheres of the holosphere framework are identified and discussed, using the five functional roles of local government. There is a need for new intersectoral forums to act upon the knowledge generated by integrative models such as the holosphere. Canadian Round Tables on Environment and Economy are encouraging examples of such intersectoralism."
7949803,"Using the prospective Hungarian childhood diabetes register, a nationwide case-control study was carried out to investigate the possible role of various non-genetic factors as risk determinants for type 1 diabetes in childhood. A questionnaire (covering family characteristics, social status, fetal and perinatal events, breast-feeding habits, infectious diseases and stressful life events) was sent by mail to all incident diabetic children in 1990 (n = 163) and to two referent children (for each diabetic child), matched for age, sex and county. Diabetic children had a tendency to have mothers > 35 years of age (odds ratio (OR) = 3.52; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.74-16.79), a lower proportion of their mothers had higher education (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 0.95-3.0) and these children tended to move home more frequently (OR = 1.99; 95% CI 0.97-4.1). Although the duration of exclusive breast feeding was similar in both groups, the proportion of diabetic children who received no breast milk tended to be higher (OR = 1.76; 95% CI 0.91-3.4). A higher proportion of diabetic children reported non-specific infections (OR = 2.94; 95% CI 1.19-7.21) and the number of stressful life events was higher in diabetic children aged 10-14 years (OR = 3.9; 95% CI 1.14-13.27). As the risk determinants for childhood insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus identified in our low-risk population appear to be similar to those detected in the genetically different, high-risk Swedish population, our study strongly supports an etiological role for these non-genetic risk factors in IDDM."
8151500,"We examined several determinants of interjudge agreement on personality traits. The findings, which were cross-validated in two samples, suggest that agreement is a function of four factors: which Big Five content domain the trait represents, how observable relevant behaviors are, how evaluative the trait is, and whether the self is one of the judges. Agreement was highest for traits related to Extraversion and lowest for traits related to Agreeableness. More observable and less evaluative traits elicited higher interjudge agreement. On average, self-peer agreement was lower than peer-peer agreement. However, this effect was limited to evaluative traits; for neutral traits, self-peer agreement was as high as peer-peer agreement. These findings suggest that self- and peer perception proceed through similar processes for neutral traits but not for highly evaluative traits, raising the possibility that self-perceptions become distorted when the trait is affectively charged."
12318543,"""This analysis examines the institutional context of infant mortality in Peru using economic, social, health care, and public health measures as indicators of development and equity. Using linked data from population and economic censuses, government agencies, and health surveys on twenty-four Peruvian provinces, I explore how economic development and institutional contexts influence health outcomes. Regional inequities based on rural population, subsistence activity, women's illiteracy, monthly income, Gross Domestic Product, medical care, and health facilities are compared. Then a cluster analysis identifies institutional contexts that have internal similarities.... My conclusion is that understanding regional inequities--defined in terms of economic development, social institutions, and health services--leads to enhanced explanations of disparities in health outcomes."""
14713671,"Over the past two decades, public health research has emphasized the role of individual risk behaviors, primarily injection and sexual risk behaviors, in the spread of HIV infection. Much less emphasis has been given to understanding the determinants of these risk behaviors. Although individual characteristics are partly responsible for risky injection and sexual behaviors, they do not explain all the interpersonal variability in risk behavior. Contextual factors associated with HIV risk behavior may include structural factors (e.g., availability of services), social norms and attitudes (e.g., social trust), disadvantage (e.g., neighborhood socioeconomic status), and features of the physical environment (e.g., housing quality). This article presents a conceptual framework that incorporates some of the key contextual domains that may affect drug use behavior. It also presents data from a study of street-recruited drug users as an example of the relations between social contextual factors and frequency of injecting drug use, and discusses some methodological challenges in the study of contextual determinants of drug use behavior."
19323024,"Local health determinants, perceived by a local community in Mueang District, Khon Kaen Province, were explored using a qualitative approach during November 2006. Health determinants could be classified into three categories: environmental, individual and family, and institutional factors. Community perspectives on health determinants included flooding, habits of lottery buying, fluctuation of vegetable market prices, and job opportunities. Community participants gave high value to the social determinants of health as opposed to environmental/biomedical factors, considering that such conditions could positively build social cohesion and even lead to better well-being. They prioritized flooding as a major environmental health determinant that affected villagers' physical and mental health, as well as family income. For social health determinants, they also indicated that many villagers were addicted to lottery buying that led to mental and financial problems within families."
12090264,"AIM: To describe the oral health status and the dental service use pattern of a Turkish population in Witten, Germany, and to assess the factors affecting this use pattern. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. PARTICIPANTS: 532 Turkish people older than 12 years. METHODS: The data were obtained through a structured questionnaire and oral examination. The World Health Organisation methodology was followed in assessing the oral health status. RESULTS: Comparison of the study population with German studies showed a similar caries experience in younger groups, but in older groups a lower treatment level. The proportion of regular dental attendees indicated no difference according to age. A person was more likely to use dental services regularly if he had a better level of German language and preferred German services. Perceived oral condition, educational level and sex were also important for care pattern. Regular use of services was negatively associated with the mean number of decayed, missing and periodontally involved teeth, but positively related to the number of filled teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Since factors reflecting the level of adaptation to Germany were also important determinants of the dental utilisation pattern, efforts to improve the utilisation of services should be based on the socio-educational development of Turkish people in Germany."
10723646,"CONTEXT: Retrospective studies of pregnancy intendedness have revealed some characteristics that can help identify which women are more likely than others to experience an unintended birth. A comparison of these findings with those from a prospective analysis may shed greater light on the characteristics associated with unintended pregnancy. METHODS: Data were taken from the 1988 National Survey of Fertility Growth and a telephone reinterview of respondents conducted in 1990. Separate analyses were conducted of women intending to postpone childbearing for at least three years and of women intending to forgo all future childbearing. Logistic regression models were used to identify the effects of social and demographic characteristics, as well as change in marital status and certainty of intentions, on the odds of experiencing a birth in the interval between interviews. RESULTS: Only 10% of women intending to postpone pregnancy for more than three years and 8% of respondents seeking to forgo future childbearing had a birth in the interval between interviews. (These births, referred to as unpredicted births in this article, are roughly analogous to those labeled unintended in retrospective analyses.) Women with incomes below the poverty level were 2-3 times as likely as women with incomes between 100% and 199% of poverty to experience an unpredicted birth. Race was not a significant factor among women intending to avoid future childbearing, and became nonsignificant among those intending to postpone when change in marital status and contraceptive status were taken into account. Women aged 35 and older who wanted no more children were significantly less likely than women aged 20-29 to have an unpredicted birth. Women aged 30-34 who wanted to postpone childbearing were roughly 70% less likely than women aged 20-29 to experience an unpredicted birth. Overall, women who were at risk for a pregnancy but not practicing contraception were 2-3 times more likely than women using an effective method to have an unpredicted birth. CONCLUSIONS: There are at least two potential explanations for instances where the correlates of unintended births in the prospective analysis differ from those identified in retrospective studies. Certain subgroups of women may be more likely to classify births as wanted when they are asked retrospectively; alternatively, they may be more likely to experience changes in their living conditions that alter their fertility intentions."
16521569,"The relationship between fecal corticosterone concentrations and characteristics of the environment and population demography were studied in adult male gerbils (Rhombomys opimus Licht.) at the southern border of Kyzylkum desert (Reserve ""Ecocentre Dzeiran"", Bukhara region, Republic Uzbekistan) in spring and fall seasons from 1999 to 2004. We extracted hormones from air-dried fecal samples and analyzed their concentrations by radioimmunoassay (Gerlinskaya et al., 1993). An analysis for year-specific relationships between hormone concentrations and environmental variables of temperature and precipitation using Pearson's r statistic revealed that corticosterone concentrations correlated positively with total precipitation in January and February and negatively with precipitation during March and April. There was also a significant negative relationship between fecal corticosterone and the number of hot days in March (>20 degrees C). Demographic variables that characterized population densities (percent of burrow systems occupied, mean and maximum number of burrow systems/1 ha, number of females in the burrow system) correlated positively with corticosterone concentrations in feces in the beginning of spring, but these relationships were small compared with mean concentrations of corticosterone for the entire spring season that were strongly and positively correlated with number of gerbils, including all pups emerged, in burrow systems owned by one male (within its home range). In contrast, correlation coefficients of corticosterone concentrations with characteristics of feeding resources in the spring were low and negative. In the long-term perspective (interannual comparison), mortality among adult males was highly negatively correlated with mean corticosterone concentrations in the beginning of spring, which is within the period of maximum reproductive effort and potential stress. Body mass was independent of corticosterone concentrations in males in either the beginning of spring, or during the whole spring. In the fall, mean concentrations of fecal corticosterone in males was positively correlated with the number of days from June to October with mean daily temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C, and with percent of burrow systems where at least one adult, > or = 1 year old gerbil had survived. Mortality from fall to spring of the next year and the fall body mass did not correlate with concentrations of corticosterone in feces collected in the fall. When we analyzed corticosterone concentrations in spring seasons of all years combined using a stepwise regression analysis of a sampling of individual males (we analyzed residuals after withdrawal of year effect) on a set of variables representing habitat resources, distances between nearest neighbor males, and variables representing group demography we found low R2 values not exceeding 0.17. Within the six-year period, concentrations of corticosterone in the spring related negatively with abundance of annual herbs and positively with number of females in a male's social group. When only years of high density were analyzed, fecal corticosterone concentrations in males in the spring were again negatively determined by abundance of herbs, as well as by the nearest neighbor distance, and positively determined by the number of females within a male's home range. At the beginning of spring the only determinants were distance to the nearest neighbor male and number of females. In years of low density none of the variables were found to affect corticosterone levels during the whole spring, while in the beginning of spring only partial regression coefficients of abundance of herbs were negative and significant. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed positive dependence (P = 0.05) of disappearance of adult males during summer drought on concentrations of fecal corticosterone in the spring, but only when burrow systems with at least one adult (male or female) surviving after the summer were considered. Our results provide evidence ground for the assumption that in a desert rodent with non-regular population fluctuations such as the great gerbil, density may be more suppressed by external factors and not by density dependent mortality mediated by stress. Density dependent increases of stress caused by intense reproductive effort occurred when feeding and climatic conditions were favorable to compensate for negative effects on survival. However, in individual gerbils mortality mediated by stress can take place because we found higher stress in the beginning of spring in males, which did not occur in the population after the summer drought."
9538699,"This is a descriptive, exploratory study which aimed at identifying the factors that are associated with pre-eclampsia in teenagers. The study also aimed at assessing the quality of midwifery care during labour in teenagers with pre-eclampsia so that recommendations can be made based on empirical findings. The study was done within Health Region H of KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa. A structured interview schedule was designed to tap information from pre-eclamptic teenagers in an attempt to identify factors associated with pre-eclampsia. A checklist was also designed and administered to assess the care of a pre-eclamptic teenager during labour. The study revealed that factors like age, nulliparity and socio-economic status were associated with pre-eclampsia. In as far as the rest of the factors, there was no relationship as indicated in previous studies. The study also revealed that teenagers affected by pre-eclampsia delayed in attending the antenatal clinic resulting in the control of the disease being difficult. In as far as midwifery care, the study revealed that psychological and social care, as well as the hygienic state of patients was not satisfactory. Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended that health education on prevention of pre-eclampsia should be done on an ongoing process, while carers for teenage mothers should be given inservice education programmes on psychosocial care. The physical environment for maternity units must be improved."
17077411,"We provide a framework for health services-related researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to guide future health disparities research in areas ranging from detecting differences in health and health care to understanding the determinants that underlie disparities to ultimately designing interventions that reduce and eliminate these disparities. To do this, we identified potential selection biases and definitions of vulnerable groups when detecting disparities. The key factors to understanding disparities were multilevel determinants of health disparities, including individual beliefs and preferences, effective patient-provider communication; and the organizational culture of the health care system. We encourage interventions that yield generalizable data on their effectiveness and that promote further engagement of communities, providers, and policymakers to ultimately enhance the application and the impact of health disparities research."
15330403,"OBJECTIVE: Although patients with bipolar disorder have been shown to benefit from psychosocial interventions, the proportion that utilizes these interventions is unknown. We set out to clarify the determinants of psychosocial service utilization in adults with bipolar disorder. METHOD: We investigated psychosocial service utilization among the first 500 patients admitted to the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD). RESULTS: In the 3 months prior to enrollment in STEP-BD, a majority of the patients (54%) were engaged in at least one psychosocial service modality in addition to pharmacotherapy. In order of decreasing frequency, these were therapy with a psychologist, self-help group, therapy with a social worker, and therapy with another type of provider. Bipolar patients with personality disorders (80% vs 20%, p = 0.0002), alcohol/drug abuse disorders (76% vs 24%, p = 0.0022), and anxiety disorders (60% vs 40%, p = 0.0043) received more psychosocial services than those without. Poorer global functioning also increased the likelihood of receiving services, whereas being married decreased service utilization. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial service utilization by outpatients with bipolar disorder is strongly linked to greater severity/complexity of illness. Potential moderators, such as insurance status and availability of care, should be examined in future studies."
19608320,"Research shows that interprofessional collaboration has become an important factor in the implementation of effective healthcare models. To date, the literature has not focused on the collaboration between medical doctors and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) healthcare practitioners, an example of interdisciplinary collaboration called integrative healthcare (IHC). Drawing on in-depth, semi-standardized interviews conducted with 21 practitioners working in Canadian IHC clinics, this paper explored and interpreted how IHC is experienced by those working in Canadian IHC clinics. The interview questions and analysis were guided by the Input, Process, Output conceptual framework drawn from the organizational management theory (McGrath, J. E. (1964). Social psychology: A brief introduction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.) to study collaboration within teams. We found that constructs contributing to collaboration included practitioners' attitudes and educational background, as well as external factors such as the healthcare system and financial pressures. Major processes affecting collaboration included communication, patient referral and power relationships. These determinants of collaboration were found to result in learning opportunities for practitioners, modified burden of work and ultimately, higher affective commitment toward the clinic. These constructs serve as a guide for further investigation of interprofessional collaboration within an IHC clinic. This exploration of interprofessional collaboration in IHC identified a broad array of key factors associated with interprofessional collaboration. These factors are critical to better understand the functioning of IHC clinics, and provide guidance for creation or maintenance of successful clinics."
8771926,"Despite the vast amount of literature on the relationship between social class and health, little work has been done on postretirement populations. Using the 1991 General Social Survey, a sample of respondents (N = 1,943) aged 65 to 99 were selected for analysis. Three social class variables, income adequacy, education and occupation, were used along with several lifestyle variables and demographic controls to predict six different measures of health status. The findings supported a ""condition-specific"" approach to the study of class differences in morbidity. Income adequacy was the most consistent class predictor of these health measures in this sample. As well, 'risky' lifestyle variables were used to test the hypothesis that such factors may mediate the relationship between class and health. This hypothesis was not well supported in these data."
10214232,"This article presents the steps and results of the empirical testing of a theoretical longitudinal model, derived from Roy's nursing conceptual model, of the psychosocial determinants of adaptation in different target groups. The model was elaborated and empirically verified based on the integrated results of four longitudinal studies involving groups vulnerable to mental health problems. By means of structural equation analyses, the cross-sectional model was verified at two points in time. The results showed that the model was relatively stable over time. The model was also tested using longitudinal data. Results showed little consistency in the patterns of relationships across studies. The significant links that emerged from the analyses shed some light on the complexity of the process of adaptation to different types of stressors. They underscore the importance for nursing practice to develop interventions aimed at certain variables: perceived stress, conflicts in the exchange of support, and passive and avoidance coping strategies. The results also highlight the importance of the relationship between perceived stress, passive/avoidance coping strategies and psychological distress."

14978603,"OBJECTIVES: Sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary characteristics were studied to gain insights into determinants of total diet quality and diversity in a weighted sample of 460 participants aged 55-74 (53% female) from the 1990 Enqu te qu b coise sur la nutrition (EQN) dataset. METHODS: Dietary data consisted of an interviewer-administered 24-hour recall and food frequency questionnaire, and a self-administered questionnaire on dietary behaviours, attitudes and perceptions. 24-hour recall data were coded into food groups as described in Canada's Food Guide for Healthy Eating. Diet quality was scored using the categorical Dietary Diversity Score (DDS, range 0-4) and continuous Dietary Adequacy Score (DAS, range 0-18). A second nonconsecutive recall (10% of subjects) permitted correction of food group portions for intraindividual variability and subsequent calculation and validation of usual DDS and DAS. Relationships were examined between the scores and independent variables. Forward leastwise logistic regession (DDS) and stepwise multiple regression (DAS) analyses were conducted with independent variables showing significant bivariate relationships. RESULTS: Among men, breakfast consumption and eating commercially-prepared meals were positively associated with usual DDS, but poor social support and supplement use negatively predicted this score. Eating fewer than 3 meals daily, smoking, and dietary supplement use were negative predictors of usual DAS (r2=0.155). Among women, eating commercial foods was a negative predictor of usual DDS, as was preferring overweight to depriving themselves of favourite foods. Reporting that health concerns influenced food choices and disagreeing with the statement that effort is needed to have a nice body were positive determinants of usual DAS in women. On the other hand, eating fewer than 3 meals daily negatively predicted this dietary index (r2 = 0.162). CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in predictors of diet quality suggest the need to target nutrition health promotion to the needs of older men and women to encourage optimal eating habits."
19849915,"BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY: This study aimed to investigate associations between area-level socioeconomic disadvantage (central heating, car ownership and residents in professional occupations), individual-level socioeconomic position (social class and educational qualifications) and contraception use in the UK for the period 1990-1991. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted on cross-sectional data from the National Survey of Attitudes and Lifestyles of 9793 women, 16-59 years of age, residing in 646 postcode districts throughout the UK. RESULTS: Women with lower levels of formal education were less likely to use contraception than women with higher education [odds ratio (OR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.44-0.57]. Women in the middle and low social class groups were less likely to use contraception than women in the higher social class group (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.97 and OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56-0.79, respectively). The association between social class and contraception use varied significantly across postcode districts (p < 0.001). The contraception use of women in the lowest social class group varied the most geographically. Women in the lowest quintiles of disadvantage were less likely to use contraception than women in the most advantaged quintiles according to all three measures, namely central heating (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.94), car ownership (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.84) and residents in professional occupations (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.93). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Although more information is needed to understand how area and individual socioeconomic characteristics are associated with contraceptive use, this study suggests that policy on contraceptive use needs to be extended beyond individually targeted approaches and needs to take into account socioeconomic determinants of contraceptive use."
20069167,"The 1st National Environmental Health Conference, in December 2009, presents countless challenges to the field of Public Health. It debates key concepts as development, sustainability, production and consumption processes, democracy and public policies; advocating for innovative, interdisciplinary and intersectorial aspects of Environmental Health. The Conference recovers and articulates important themes for the Public Health, and also indicates the need of reflecting the socio-environmental determinants of health at the present time, in order to provide progresses in the construction of guidelines and actions to health surveillance and promotion. This article discusses the characteristics of the Brazilian model of development, its impacts and conflicts within social, environmental and health fields. We use theoretical and empirical contributions from the fields of Ecological Economy and Political Ecology, as well as, experiences of cooperation with the Brazilian Network on Environmental Justice and several social movements. Two cases are discussed in more detail: the first related to agribusiness and the use of pesticides, and the other about the expansion of the iron and steel industry in Brazil. We conclude proposing some elements that could be incorporated by a research agenda committed to the debate about the 'socioenvironmental crisis'."
10212524,"A study was made of stress factors experienced by primary school teachers in Zambia after they had attended a course on stress management and counselling skills. Their pupils were significantly affected by poverty, death and illness of parents, fellow-pupils and teachers, teenage sex and pregnancy, violence in the home and, among girls, low self-esteem. The HIV epidemic had a major bearing on these factors, and there were wide-ranging effects on the teachers' own lives. Despite the training they had been given, many teachers felt that they could not adequately counsel their pupils on these matters. The teachers were in need of continuing support and training to enable them to cope with this aspect of their work."
11962684,"Quality of life (QoL) is estimated from patients scores to items related to everyday life, including rest and activity. The rest-activity rhythm reflects endogenous circadian clock function. The relation between the individual rhythm in activity and QoL was investigated in 200 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients wore a wrist actigraph (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., New York. NY) for 3-5 d before chronotherapy, and completed a QoL questionnaire developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (QLQ-C30) plus the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The rest-activity circadian rhythm was characterized by the mean activity level (m), autocorrelation coefficient at 24h (r24), and the dichotomy index (I < O). a ratio between the amount of activity while in and out of bed. The distribution of the rest-activity cycle parameters and that of QoL scores was independent of sex, age, primary tumor, number of metastatic sites, and prior treatment. Both the 24h rhythm indicators were positively correlated with global QoL score as well as physical, emotional, and social functioning. Negative correlations were found between m, r24, or I < O and fatigue, appetite loss, and nausea. The rest-activity circadian rhythm appeared to be an objective indicator of physical welfare and QoL. This analysis suggests that circadian function may be one of the biological determinants of QoL in cancer patients."
8011220,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the interplay between situational, social and psychological factors in gay men's decisions about HIV risk behaviour, using multiple hypothetical situations. METHOD: The sample included 79 gay men from Sydney recruited through flyers, press advertisements or personal contact at gay venues. Subjects were presented with 20 hypothetical situations graphically on a computer, which included different levels of attraction to partner, intoxication, attractiveness to partner, condom availability, desire for anal sex by subject, insistence of partner on using a condom and time constraints in each situation. Subjects used a computerized graphic rating scale to indicate the likelihood of unprotected anal sex in each situation, the frequency with which they had experienced the hypothetical situation in real life and satisfaction with their response. The probability of having unsafe anal sex in any given situation was the dependent variable. All other variables were predictors. RESULTS: A vector of predictors accounted for 30% of the variance (r = 0.54). Ratings of the probability of anal sex increased with the frequency that subjects had experienced hypothetical situations in real life, attraction to partner, attractiveness to partner and time elapsed since real life experience similar to the hypothetical one. Ratings of the probability of anal sex decreased with condom availability. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that interventions must address the way that individuals interact with their partner and their environment in order to be successful."
12296978,"Little attention has been given to the dietary patterns of new immigrant women in Canada. Research suggests that before migration, many immigrants, especially those from non-Western countries, consume a healthy diet, but this changes on migration. This paper presents information from a recently completed literature review conducted for the Women's Health Council of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. The paper includes a review of the major determinants of food choice and health promotion strategies appropriate to new immigrant women. Our findings suggest that nutrition intervention for new immigrant women must consider the social context of these women's lives, address cultural, linguistic, economic and informational barriers and consider how these change over time. Recommendations are also made on how to best promote healthy eating in this group."
9581450,"The relative contribution of socioeconomic, behavioural and biological factors operating in fetal and infant life, childhood and adulthood to risk for cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases and non-insulin-dependent diabetes in middle age has become an important research issue. All 1142 babies born in Newcastle upon Tyne in May and June 1947 were recruited into a prospective cohort study of child health (the 'Thousand Families' study) and followed in great detail to the age of 15 y, with a brief further follow up at age 22 y. Children from poorer families were at greatest risk of severe respiratory tract infection in infancy. Children from professional and managerial families were on average taller and heavier throughout childhood than those from semi- and unskilled manual social classes. Repeated infections in early childhood greatly increased the risk of developing chronic respiratory disease by age 15 y. This paper outlines a new investigation designed to trace surviving members of this cohort and to chart the relationships between their socioeconomic circumstances, lifestyles, experiences and health from birth through to the present day. Existing data on socioeconomic circumstances and infections in infancy and childhood, infant nutrition, birthweight and physical development to age 22 y will be linked to information gained from a new study. This comprises a postal questionnaire survey of study members' adult health, socioeconomic circumstances and lifestyle, and a hospital based clinical examination including heart and lung function, glucose tolerance, blood lipids and anthropometric measurements at age 49-51 y. Out of a target sample of 979 people for whom sufficient data are available on the first year of life, 866 (88%) have been traced and 649 are still resident in the North of England. Those study members who have been traced are highly representative of the original cohort. The Thousand Families cohort provides a unique opportunity for detailed epidemiological study because of the wealth of data available on infant and childhood socioeconomic and family circumstances, all of which was collected prospectively. In addition, there has been comparatively little loss to follow-up since 1948."
18593800,"The 5-year incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its determinants, in a sample of men and women from Greece, was evaluated. From May 2001 to December 2002, 1514 men and 1528 women (>18 years old) without any clinical evidence of CVD, living in the Attica area, Greece, were enrolled in the ATTICA study. In 2006, a group of experts performed the 5-year follow-up (941 of the 3042 (31%) participants were lost to follow-up). Development of CVD (coronary heart disease, acute coronary syndromes, stroke, or other CVD) during the follow-up period was defined according to WHO-ICD-10 criteria. The 5-year incidence of CVD was 11.0% in men and 6.1% in women (p<0.001); the case fatality rate was 1.6%. Multi-adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that increased age (odds ratio per year=1.09, p=0.04), waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio=5.07, p=0.02), hypertension (odds ratio=4.53, p=0.001), diabetes (odds ratio=4.53, p=0.001) and C-reactive protein levels (odds ratio per 1 mg/dl=1.31, p=0.02) were the most significant baseline bio-clinical predictors of CVD. Furthermore, an increased education level and greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet (among 35-65-year-old individuals) were associated with a lower CVD incidence (odds ratio per 3 years of school difference=0.83, p<0.001 and odds ratio per 1/55 units in diet score=0.94, p<0.001), irrespective of various potential confounders. In conclusion, aging, central fat, hypertension and diabetes, inflammation process, low social status and abstinence from a Mediterranean diet seem to predict CVD events within a 5-year period."
18366252,"BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies."
9000840,"In this study, we developed a reliable scale to measure the quality of life (QOL), which would reflect the cultural characteristics of cancer patients in Turkey. We used the Rolls-Royce model and determined a form with 49 items in eight dimensions such as general well-being, physical symptoms and activity, sleep dysfunctions, appetite, sexual dysfunction, cognitive functions, medical interaction, social participation and work performance. The forms were used for assembling data from 100 subjects (10 physicians, 19 healthy volunteers, 18 patients relatives, 28 patients on chemotherapy, 25 patients off chemotherapy). Half-split reliability and the signal effect were used to demonstrate reliability and responsiveness. After demonstrating the validity of the test, the final form was constructed. When these eight dimensions were factor analysed, it was found that the general well-being and sexual dysfunction were the most important determinants of QOL."
17020496,"BACKGROUND: Profound advances in biomedical science have contributed to increased longevity and improved quality of life for many Americans. Despite this progress, a heavier burden of disease is borne by some population groups in the United States, particularly the poor and underserved. Landmark reports published since 1973 have highlighted these health disparities, explored their causal factors, and outlined strategies to reduce them. More recent research studies underscore the results of these early reports that identify social position, economic status, culture, and environment as critical determinants of who develops and survives cancer and of the quality of life of cancer survivors. METHODS: The Patient Navigation Program was established in Harlem, New York, in 1990 to address the dramatic disparities in breast cancer mortality among minority women in the community. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The success of the Harlem Patient Navigation Program has provided the impetus for the development of many similar patient navigation programs across the country and for federal support for Patient Navigation research to address the critical need for effective interventions to eliminate cancer health disparities, particularly among minorities and the underserved."
17929613,"BACKGROUND: The term Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) has been used since the 1980s. NORCs are defined as communities where people remain or move to when they retire. NORCs develop 'naturally', meaning that seniors tend to remain or move there when they retire, although the residences and physical environment were not constructed for a senior population. The term, Healthy-NORC, has been introduced and is associated with healthy aging. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: We describe how demographic trends will facilitate a dramatic growth in NORCs. Acknowledging the 'Determinants of Health' model, we suggest that some determinants impact people differently at different ages. We also suggest that more attention be focused on the impact of physical/social environments on health, and that some determinants of health are particularly relevant for seniors. We argue that NORCs exist on a spectrum, from NORC to H-NORC, and that health benefits for seniors increase as NORCs adopt additional characteristics associated with improved senior health. We also illustrate H-NORC research methods and policy options for local governments. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Compared to the provision of additional medical and social services, H-NORCs represent a low-cost approach to facilitating healthy aging. Municipal governments can promote healthy aging and should pursue policies that will stimulate H-NORC development."
8454958,"The effect that ratio schedules of reinforcement had upon variability of responding was investigated in college students. Subjects were paid $0.02 contingent upon completion of eight presses, distributed in any combination across two push buttons; 256 different sequences were possible. Sequence emission was reinforced according to fixed- and variable-ratio schedules. Ratio requirements of 1, 2, 4 and 8 were presented in alternate components of a multiple schedule. The variability engendered by variable-ratio schedules was also compared to that engendered by fixed ratios. Variability increased with ratio size, irrespective of whether the schedule requirement was fixed or variable. The data demonstrate the similarity between the determinants of human and nonhuman variability, and they illustrate the role of ratio size in determining variability in operant behavior."
10187592,"While the importance of the private sector in providing health services in developing countries is now widely acknowledged, the paucity of data on numbers and types of providers has prevented systematic cross-country comparisons. Using available published and unpublished sources, we have assembled data on the number of public and private health care providers for approximately 40 countries. This paper presents some results of the analysis of this database, looking particularly at the determinants of the size and structure of the private health sector. We consider two different types of dependent variable: the absolute number of private providers (measured here as physicians and hospital beds), and the public-private composition of provision. We examine the relationship between these variables and income and other socioeconomic characteristics, at the national level. We find that while income level is related to the absolute size of the private sector, the public-private mix does not seem to be related to income. After controlling for income, certain socioeconomic characteristics, such as education, population density, and health status are associated with the size of the private sector, though no causal relationship is posited. Further analysis will require more complete data about the size of the private sector, including the extent of dual practice by government-employed physicians. A richer story of the determinants of private sector growth would incorporate more information about the institutional structure of health systems, including provider payment mechanisms, the level and quality of public services, the regulatory structure, and labour and capital market characteristics. Finally, a normative analysis of the size and growth of the private sector will require a better understanding of its impact on key social welfare outcomes."
9272258,"OBJECTIVE: There has been an accumulation of so-called 'new long-stay' (NLS) patients in psychiatric hospitals. To date, no Australian studies have characterised this patient group. We aimed to study the demography, and clinical and social functioning of the NLS population at Royal Park Hospital (RPH) together with patients' attitudes to treatment and views on future placement. METHOD: All 30 NLS patients at RPH were identified. Twenty-seven consenting patients were assessed using the following standardised instruments: Manchester Scale for psychopathology, Life Skills Profile (LSP), Physical Health Index and Patient Attitude Questionnaire. Information on past psychiatric history, past treatment and current treatment was collected. Insight and compliance were assessed. RESULTS: The majority of patients were single men with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Forty-one percent were detained in hospital involuntarily and 56% were considered dangerous to themselves or others. The patients were characterised by high levels of positive and negative symptoms. They were most impaired with respect to 'social contact' relative to the other subscales of the LSP. While 10 (48%) patients expressed a desire to leave hospital, only one patient considered that anyone would cohabit with them. Over two-thirds considered they had been unwell and that medication had helped. Staff rated one-third as having major problems with compliance. About two-thirds of patients had disability secondary to comorbid physical illnesses. CONCLUSION: Like other NLS patients studied in the United Kingdom and Ireland, this group had significant handicaps secondary to psychiatric illness, concomitant physical illness and disability and behaviour unacceptable in community settings. They were also characterised by significant social isolation. These factors may be important determinants of rehabilitation failure and need to be addressed in the process of de-institutionalisation as well as in longitudinal studies examining these and other factors predicting NLS status."
19750381,"This study analyzes the specific conditions involved in dengue transmission in various areas in Itaipu, a coastal neighborhood in the city of Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, with a focus on socio-environmental determinants and conditioning factors. Four areas were selected with similar dengue incidence rates but different urban planning and socioeconomic patterns. The socio-spatial characteristics of each area were obtained through interviews with key informants and systematic observation. Two distinct factors were identified that may potentially condition the risk of dengue transmission. The first related to the limited water supply and scarce financial resources in a lower-income population. The second was associated with a group having better socioeconomic status, which allowed them to store water in larger tanks. The implementation of a housing infrastructure generated by real estate speculation was a determining factor for the creation of socio-spatial segregation, resulting in different forms of receptiveness and vulnerability to dengue. In this sense, the incomplete and unequal installation of housing infrastructure is a determining factor for the differentiated generation of vector breeding sites and thus for dengue transmission."
2255820,"Self-assessed well-being has been shown to be related to earlier medical events and to be a predictor of mortality. 50-year-old men and women (n = 314) in Kungsor were invited to an examination for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and different aspects of self-assessed well-being. The differences between men and women concerning their well-being could not explain the differences in the expected mortality between the sexes. A well-developed social network and physical exercise were the most positive determinants of well-being, while drug intake, angina pectoris, and smoking were the most negative."
18484442,"While imposing research has been conducted with respect to the biological determinants of painful menstruation, little is known about the psychosocial factors, including work-related stress that might influence menstrual pain. We conducted a study in which we aimed to determine besides the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea whether menstrual pain was associated with job control, co-worker social support, job security and dissatisfaction with the job. Data of 2772 working women aged 18-55 years, participants in the Hungarostudy 2002 nation-wide representative survey was analyzed. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between work stress factors and menstrual pain. Altogether 15.5% of women reported to experience menstrual pain that limits their daily activity. Low job control, low co-worker social support and low job security were found to be associated with a higher risk for menstrual pain even after controlling for the effect of age, educational attainment, parity status, smoking, body-mass index and treatment for gynecological problems. Job dissatisfaction was also related to dysmenorrhoea, albeit not significantly. The relationship between work-related psychosocial factors and painful menstruation deserves further investigation in order to determine the possible pathways of this association."
8909112,"A comprehensive model of family influences on educational resemblance of siblings expands the traditional sibling pair model to a full sibship model in order to investigate how gender, gender composition of sibships, and a measure of ordinal position moderate the effect of social origins on educational attainments of siblings. One common family factor is sufficient to explain the variation of educational attainment among brothers and sisters. Although effects of social origins variables on brothers are larger than on sisters, the relative effects of measured social origins are virtually the same among sisters and brothers. The disparity between educational attainments of brothers and sisters persists across sex composition and family size. Ordinal position does not alter the effects of social origins on educational attainment nor does it directly affect educational attainment. Father's and mother's education are equally important for all siblings regardless of birth order, gender composition, and family size."
2366055,"The need for permanent housing for the chronically mentally ill has received a great deal of attention over the last several years. One response to the problem has been the development of supportive housing, that is, non-facility-based permanent homes with placement based on clients' functional capabilities and preferences. However, little research has focused on assessing the match between clients and environmental requirements. This study begins to identify the social and clinical characteristics of clients that contribute to selection into different types of housing environments. Ninety-one clients were sampled from the supportive housing services of a major provider in two New England states. Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability that clients will be placed into apartments vs. other, more restricted settings, based on their clinical and social characteristics. Findings show that the primary determinants of placement were clinical severity, early family history, and adequacy of family support. The less severely ill and better functioning the client, the more likely that he or she was placed in an apartment. This was mitigated, however, by the availability and adequacy of family support. In addition, clients with early family disruptions were also less likely to be placed in apartments. Findings are discussed in light of their implications for providing permanent housing placements for chronically mentally ill persons and for factors in future research to evaluate the success of placement."
15603114,"Occupational violence is a worldwide, multifaceted problem affecting all industries, including healthcare. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the experiences of 158 allied health professionals, 135 doctors, and 1229 nurses working in a rural area in eastern Australia. Response rates were 72 percent for allied health professionals and 62 percent for general practitioners (GPs) and nurses. Proportionately more nurses experienced occupational violence than did allied health providers and GPs. During the past 12 months (August 2001 to July 2002), 68 percent of nurses, compared with 47 percent of allied health providers and 48 percent of GPs, reported violence. All three professional groups indicated that the most distressing occupational violence was perpetrated by patients, followed by patients' relatives. The most frequent form of occupational violence was verbal abuse, followed by threatening behavior, physical violence, and obscene behavior. No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of violence was found among the different allied health professional disciplines or fields of nursing. Health services management strategies addressing occupational violence need to be comprehensive and multidisciplinary in scope. Strategies to minimize violence need to focus on resource allocation, cultural change, and perseverance. Systems to monitor violence are a priority. Further research into the determinants of this pattern of violence is required."
9465373,"This study researched the effects of cognitive variables on recycling behavior, as well as effects of various media of influence on the cognition and behavior. According to Hirose (1994), the decision making process for recycling consists of two steps. The first leads to goal intention of an ecological lifestyle. The second is related to behavior intention of recycling in line with the goal intention. Mass media, such as newspaper and TV, are thought to influence beliefs about environmental problems, including three determinants of goal intention: perception of seriousness, responsibility, and effectiveness. Personal media, such as personal contacts with pro-environmental activists, are thought to influence evaluation of behavior, including three determinants of behavior intention: evaluation of feasibility, cost and benefits, and social norms. Local media, such as municipal announcement and circular, are hypothesized to have a mixed effect of the two. Path analysis indicated that goal intention affected recycling behavior through behavior intention. Effects of the three media of influence on the cognitive variables were also consistent with the hypothesis."
16094843,"OBJECTIVE: We aim at analysing the increase of CVDs in the Tunisian hospitals in order to assess the burden of NCDs in the transitional context. METHODS: Data are recorded through the Tunisian National Morbidity and Mortality Survey (TNMMS). In order to assess the CVDs (CHDs vs RHDs) trend, two representative samples of Cardiology Departements patients were compared one is selected from the TNMMS and the second from the hospitalisations recorded in 1992. Causes, stay duration, status at the end of the hospitalisation, transfer to another hospital and patients socio-demographic characteristics are recorded and compared for the two periods. All the diagnosis are coded referring to the DMC 10. To analyze the determinant of the epidemiological transition, we have elaborated the CVD causal pattern and we have documented all their determinants. RESULTS: CHD rate has dramatically increased, while RHD has decreased especially on men. In 1992, 39.2% of men and 11.8% of women were admitted for CHD. In 2002, these rate are respectivly 58.8% and 38.2% while RHD rates were, in 1992, 11.8% on men and 25.3% on women vs 4.4% and 11.7% respectively. CONCLUSION: This study has confirmed that so far controlling transmitted diseases seems to be successful, Tunisian people are about to face a new problems as hypertension, obesity, diabetes and tobacco smoking. The new challenge with the burden of diseases requires the implementation of a national strategy relevant to the epidemiological, social and economical transition. Population needs and cost effectiveness of interventions assessment is crucial to set the national priorities."
18573196,"BACKGROUND: Many youth fail to meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity. Walking and cycling, forms of active travel, have the potential to contribute significantly towards overall physical activity levels. Recent research examining the associations between physical activity and the environment has shown that environmental factors play a role in determining behaviour in children and adolescents. However, links between the environment and active travel have received less attention. METHODS: Twenty four studies were identified which examined the associations between the environment (perceived or objectively measured) and active travel among youth aged 5-18 years. Findings were categorised according to the location of the environmental measure examined; attributes of the neighbourhood, destination and the route between home and destination. RESULTS: Results from the reviewed studies indicated that youth active travel is positively associated with social interactions, facilities to assist active travel and urban form in the neighbourhood as well as shorter route length and road safety en-route. A conceptual framework is presented which highlights the associations between active travel behaviours and environmental factors, drawing upon both existing and hypothesised relationships. CONCLUSION: We provide a review of the available literature and present a novel theoretical framework that integrates the environment into the wider decision making process around travel choices for children and adolescents. Further work should explore associations where gaps in understanding have been identified, and account for the main moderators of behaviour so hypothesised associations can be confirmed."
12072146,"OBJECTIVE: Research of the determinants of inpatient aggression indicates that certain environmental hospital variables play a role in triggering aggression in psychiatric hospitals. Yet, how patient, staff and ward variables interact in eliciting aggression is not well understood. METHOD: On the basis of earlier findings, a model was proposed in which psychopathology and distorted cognitions of the patient are combined with environmental and communicational stressors that are specific for psychiatric wards. RESULTS: The proposed model elucidates how certain patient, staff and ward characteristics may interact in causing aggression. The model also emphasizes that repeated inpatient aggression may be the result of a vicious circle, i.e. inpatient violence is often followed by an increase in environmental and/or communication stress on the patient, thereby heightening the risk of a repeated outburst of violence. CONCLUSION: Although tentative, the model may shed light on the mechanisms that lead to (repeated) violence."
8192118,"Proposed and tested a model of the determinants of adolescents' chronic life stressors, consisting of sociodemographic, personal, and contextual stress and coping factors, using baseline and 1-year follow-up data from 259 adolescents who varied in their psychological and physical health. Concurrent regression analyses at Time 1 and at Time 2, and longitudinal regressions that controlled for the levels of chronic stressors 1 year earlier, showed that sociodemographic, personal, and contextual factors each made a significant contribution to predicting adolescents' ongoing stressors with their mother, father, siblings friends and classmates and teachers at school. Personal factors of an emotional temperament and low perceived self-worth, and contextual factors of more negative life events and fewer social resources, were related to more chronic stressors. Suggestions for further development of the model are discussed."
9049796,"This case-control study (n = 100 dental patients, matched for age and sex) investigated the role of life-events in periodontitis. Data collected included life events, tobacco use, oral health behaviours and socio-demographics. The results of conditional simple logistic regression analysis showed that periodontitis was associated with the negative impact of life-events (p < 0.01), the number of negative life-events (p < 0.05), high levels of dental plaque (p < 0.01), tobacco smoking (p < 0.01) and being unemployed (p < 0.05). These associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for oral health behaviour and socio-demographic variables, but not tobacco smoking (p > 0.05). Marital status became statistically significant after adjusting for the other variables (p < 0.05). A model is suggested to explain the pathways through which life events may affect periodontal health. It was concluded that psychosocial factors and oral health risk behaviours cluster together as important determinants of periodontitis."
19504364,"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine, with the use of Berry's acculturation concept (2003), personal self-esteem and collective esteem in the acculturation of young Turks in Germany. Further, it was aimed to examine whether ethnic identity is linked to better mental health. METHOD: Consecutive psychiatric primary care patients with Turkish background were screened with the 5-item Acculturation Questionnaire, adopted from the Latin American Validated Acculturation Scale. The interviewed patients were also assessed for psychiatric disorders according to ICD-10. RESULTS: By using the acculturation questionnaire among 220 patients included to this study, 154 (70%) patients, (88 male- 57,14%, mean age:22,1 sd. +/- 3,26 and 66 female- 42,85%, mean age: 21,73 sd. +/- 1,19) were found to be relatively good adjusted (group 1), and of 66 (30%) patients (44 male- 66,6%, mean age:26,3 sd. +/-3,39 and 22 female- 33,3%, mean age:25,88 sd. +/- 3,41) were found to be relatively poor adjusted (group 2) to the host community. The psychiatric co-morbidity showed in these two groups two distinct patterns (p< 0.001). Endogenous depression and the depression caused by the conflicts in the family-milieu are significantly more common in the group I. Unlike, the depression triggered by the psycho-social maladjustment is clearly more prevalent in the group II. The predictors of good adaptation were shown to be: bilingualism, bicultural identity and Germany as country of birth, whereas poor adaptation was related to: dominance of ethnic culture and language, and being born outside of Germany. CONCLUSION: The research presented provides firm evidence for a bicultural identity through assessments of several domains of acculturation: language spoken most of the time, language thought, ethnic identity, birthplace and the degree of adjustment to the host community. Cultural identity is one of the key determinants of mental health in evaluating adaptation to the host culture among immigrants. It is vital for the mental health professionals to understand the roles, context, and therapeutic consequences that originate from culture."
15263980,"Data from Brazilian national surveys conducted since the 1970s have indicated an increase in the prevalence of overweight/obesity. The two most frequently cited causes of this trend have been dietary changes and reduction in physical activity, characterizing a ""contemporary Western lifestyle"". The objective of this paper is to identify and assess some indicators associated with changes in eating habits and physical activity patterns in the Brazilian population in the last 30 years. Despite the lack of detailed data, the following factors appear to play an important role in the process: internal migration; dining out; increased consumption of fast food; labor changes; transportation; and the use of home appliances. More information on dietary and physical activity patterns in association with anthropometric data on the Brazilian population are needed for a better understanding of each factor's role in these relationships. Meanwhile, inter-sector programs and projects with well-defined targets and outcomes are needed for the population's adherence to a healthier lifestyle, in order to control the increase in overweight/obesity."
16351702,"PURPOSE: To review the current literature about potential determinants of fruit and vegetable intakes and effective intervention strategies to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables among 6-12-year-old children. METHODS: A structured review of literature located in PubMed and Psychinfo electronic literature databases. RESULTS: Of all determinants, the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables and taste preferences were most consistently and most positively related to consumption. There was some evidence that parental fruit and vegetable intakes, knowledge of intake recommendations and skills had a positive association with children's intakes, whereas television viewing, exposure to television advertisement, and having a snack bar at school were associated with lower intakes of fruit and vegetables. Multi-component school-based interventions that combined classroom curriculum, parent and food service components showed the greatest promise for fruit and vegetable promotion among children. School fruit and vegetable subscription programmes, scout-based interventions, and fruit and vegetables education via computer multi-media channels also appear promising. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions should improve the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables to children, and should aim to improve their taste preferences for them. Such interventions should be of a multi-component nature, school-based or use other social channels and may include multi-media channels."
7644605,"The negative priming task is widely used to investigate attentional inhibition. A critical review of the negative priming literature considers various parameters of the task (e.g., time course, relation to interference, level of occurence, and susceptibility to changes in task context). It takes into account life span data and the performance of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. On these bases, the review suggests that negative priming can be produced by 2 mechanisms: memorial and inhibitory. With respect to inhibition, the review suggests that (a) there are 2 systems, one responsible for identity and the other for location information; and (b) inhibition is a flexible, postselection process operating to prevent recently rejected information from quickly regaining access to effectors, thus helping to establish coherence among selected thought and action streams."
16707074,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different classes of antipsychotic drug treatment in people with schizophrenia responding inadequately to, or having unacceptable side-effects from, their current medication. DESIGN: Two pragmatic, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were undertaken. The first RCT (band 1) compared the class of older, inexpensive conventional drugs with the class of new atypical drugs in people with schizophrenic disorders, whose current antipsychotic drug treatment was being changed either because of inadequate clinical response or owing to side-effects. The second RCT (band 2) compared the new (non-clozapine) atypical drugs with clozapine in people whose medication was being changed because of poor clinical response to two or more antipsychotic drugs. Both RCTs were four-centre trials with concealed randomisation and three follow-up assessments over 1 year, blind to treatment. SETTING: Adult mental health settings in England. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 227 participants aged 18-65 years (40% of the planned sample) were randomised to band 1 and 136 (98% of the planned sample) to band 2. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to a class of drug. The managing clinician selected the individual drug within that class, except for the clozapine arm in band 2. The new atypical drugs included risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and amisulpride. The conventional drugs included older drugs, including depot preparations. As in routine practice, clinicians and participants were aware of the identity of the prescribed drug, but clinicians were asked to keep their participating patient on the randomised medication for at least the first 12 weeks. If the medication needed to be changed, the clinician was asked to prescribe another drug within the same class, if possible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Secondary clinical outcomes included symptoms [Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)], side-effects and participant satisfaction. Economic outcomes were costs of health and social care and a utility measure. RESULTS: Recruitment to band 1 was less than anticipated (40%) and diminished over the trial. This appeared largely due to loss of perceived clinical equipoise (clinicians progressively becoming more convinced of the superiority of new atypicals). Good follow-up rates and a higher than expected correlation between QLS score at baseline and at follow-up meant that the sample as recruited had 75% power to detect a difference in QLS score of 5 points between the two treatment arms at 52 weeks. The recruitment to band 2 was approximately as planned. Follow-up assessments were completed at week 52 in 81% of band 1 and 87% of band 2 participants. Band 1 data showed that, on the QLS and symptom measures, those participants in the conventional arm tended towards greater improvements. This suggests that the failure to find the predicted advantage for new atypicals was not due to inadequate recruitment and statistical power in this sample. Participants reported no clear preference for either class of drug. There were no statistically significant differential outcomes for participants entering band 1 for reasons of treatment intolerance to those entering because of broadly defined treatment resistance. Net costs over the year varied widely, with a mean of 18,850 pounds sterling in the conventional drug group and 20,123 pounds sterling in the new atypical group, not a statistically significant difference. Of these costs, 2.1% and 3.8% were due to antipsychotic drug costs in the conventional and atypical group, respectively. There was a trend towards participants in the conventional drug group scoring more highly on the utility measure at 1 year. The results for band 2 showed an advantage for commencing clozapine in quality of life (QLS) at trend level (p = 0.08) and in symptoms (PANSS), which was statistically significant (p = 0.01), at 1 year. Clozapine showed approximately a 5-point advantage on PANSS total score and a trend towards having fewer total extrapyramidal side-effects. Participants reported at 12 weeks that their mental health was significantly better with clozapine than with new atypicals (p < 0.05). Net costs of care varied widely, but were higher than in band 1, with a mean of 33,800 pounds sterling in the clozapine group and 28,400 pounds sterling in the new atypical group. Of these costs, 4.0% and 3.3%, respectively, were due to antipsychotic drug costs. The increased costs in the clozapine group appeared to reflect the licensing requirement for inpatient admission for commencing the drug. There was a trend towards higher mean participant utility scores in the clozapine group. CONCLUSIONS: For band 1, there is no disadvantage in terms of quality of life and symptoms, or associated costs of care, over 1 year in commencing conventional antipsychotic drugs rather than new atypical drugs. Conventional drugs were associated with non-significantly better outcomes and lower costs. Drug costs represented a small proportion of the overall costs of care (<5%). For band 2, there is a statistically significant advantage in terms of symptoms but not quality of life over 1 year in commencing clozapine rather than new atypical drugs, but with increased associated costs of care. The results suggest that conventional antipsychotic drugs, which are substantially cheaper, still have a place in the treatment of patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, current medication. Further analyses of this data set are planned and further research is recommended into areas such as current antipsychotic treatment guidance, valid measures of utility in serious mental illness, low-dose 'conventional' treatment in first episode schizophrenia, QLS validity and determinants of QLS score in schizophrenia, and into the possible financial and other mechanisms of rewarding clinician participation in trials."
12318034,"""This article examines the UN policies encouraging emigration from the Palestinian refugee camps through educating Palestinians and sending them for work abroad. Data show that emigration is more related to certain types of employment, especially skilled labor and white-collar jobs, than to employment per se. The data were collected, through personal interviews, from Dair El Balah refugee camp in Gaza Strip in 1986. There are 291 observations representing individuals who are 19 years old or over. A major conclusion of this study is that the educational policies initiated and operated by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) contributed to the dispersion of about one third of the refugees in the 1960s and the 1970s."""
16530864,"The purpose of this study was to investigate factors related to self-rated health and to mortality among 2490 community-living elderly. Respondents were followed for 7.3 years for all-cause mortality. To compare the relative impact of each variable, we employed logistic regression analysis for self-rated health and Cox hazard analysis for mortality. Cox analysis stratified by gender, follow-up periods, age group, and functional status was also employed. Series of analysis found that factors associated with self-rated health and with mortality were not identical. Psychological factors such as perceived isolation at home or 'ikigai (one aspect of psychological well-being)' were associated with self-rated health only. Age, functional status, and social relations were associated both with self-rated health and mortality after controlling for possible confounders. Illnesses and functional status accounted for 35-40% of variances in the fair/poor self-rated health. Differences by gender and functional status were observed in the factors related to self-rated health. Overall, self-rated health effect on mortality was stronger for people with no functional impairment, for shorter follow-up period, and for young-old age group. Although, illnesses and functional status were major determinants of self-rated health, economical, psychological, and social factors were also related to self-rated health."
18306732,"OBJECTIVES: Substantial inequalities of health in various parts of Slovak Republic (SR) are observed. BACKGROUND: Our aim was to analyse the combination of sociological and medical aspects of these inequalities. METHODS: Sociological and mortality data from all 76 counties of SR were analysed by cluster analysis, ANOVA, multiple regressions, parametric and nonparametric tests. RESULTS: In the sociologically weaker clusters the life expectancy was shorter, male and female premature cardiovascular mortality was higher and the male (not female) cancer mortality was higher than in sociologically better clusters. CONCLUSION: Social and economic conditions--low educational level, poverty, unemployment, social exclusion and poor housing--strongly influence the health of inhabitants in SR (Fig. 3, Ref. 8).

Five-minute behavioral samples were observed randomly out of every hour from 8 a.m. through 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, for four 2-week phases (baseline, placebo, 50 mg, and 100 mg). During naltrexone administration, there were fewer days with frequent head-banging and self-biting, whereas there were more days on which blows to the head or self-biting were infrequent.

10430008,"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and sociodemographics of urinary incontinence (UI) in women in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Women at risk, such as multiparous and climacteric women, were selected from the community (n = 200) and health-care centers (n = 200) and interviewed about inappropriate urine loss in the past 12 months, using a structured and pretested questionnaire. Of these, 81 (20.3%) admitted UI; only 25 of these (30.9%) had sought medical advice. The reasons were embarrassment (38.2%), choice of self-treatment because of low expectations from medical care (38.2%), and preferring to discuss the matter with friends, assuming that UI is normal (23.3%). Sufferers were troubled by their inability to pray (90%) and to have sexual intercourse (33.3%). Perceived causes of UI were paralysis (45%), childbirth (35.4%) and old age or menopause (33.7%). UI is common yet underreported by UAE women because of cultural attitudes and inadequate public knowledge."
15132249,"This article addresses newly emerging concepts regarding the examination of outcomes in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Three important factors have prompted a change toward a broader approach to outcome measurement: (1) the recent endorsement of the World Health Organization classification scheme of functioning, disability, and health; (2) recognition of the importance of the role of child and environmental factors in modifying outcome; and (3) appreciation of the challenges faced at key transitions during development. Comparison of the literature on outcomes in children with CP published in 2002 with studies published 10 years earlier demonstrates an increased number of studies and a wider range of outcome measures used to characterize the functioning of these children. A better understanding of the extent and nature of the outcomes and their determinants is critical to guide clinical decision making and program planning to maximize community integration, social participation, and overall well-being of the child and family."
8091151,"The objective of the study was to assess the role of smoking parents' education, socioeconomic status and knowledge of the child's health as determinants of the child's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home. A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out by mailing a parent-administered questionnaire (response rate 80.3%) to a random sample of children aged 1 to 6 years, in Espoo. The present analyses focused on the 1003 children at whom one or both parents or guardians were currently smokers. A total of 253 children (25.2%) of smoking parents were reported to be exposed to ETS at home at the time when the questionnaire was filled in, while 750 (74.8%) children were not. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for being exposed to ETS were assessed in the logistic regression. The risk of exposure to ETS was significantly higher when the parents had no professional education, compared to university or college education (OR 2.42, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.43-4.11), but socioeconomic status was not associated with exposure. The risk was higher with a single parent or guardian than in families with two parents (2.17, 1.36-3.44). The risk decreased significantly for atopic children (0.61, 0.38-0.98), indicating that knowledge of the child's illness affects the smoking behavior of the parents."
9323619,"OBJECTIVE: To examine determinants of moderate and severe obesity in children at 5 years of age. METHODOLOGY: A prospective cohort of mothers were enrolled at first antenatal visit, and interviewed shortly after delivery, at 6 months and 5 years. Detailed health, psychological and social questionnaires were completed at each phase by mothers, and child health questionnaires at 6 months and 5 years. At 5 years 4062 children were assessed physically, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test administered and mothers completed a modified Child Behaviour Checklist. Moderate obesity was defined as BMI between 85th and 94th percentiles inclusively, and severe obesity as a BMI greater than the 94th percentile. RESULTS: Independent predictors of severe obesity at 5 years were birthweight, female gender, maternal BMI and paternal BMI. Moderate obesity at 5 years was predicted by birthweight, paternal BMI and sleeplessness at 6 months, while small for gestational age (SGA) status and feeding problems at 6 months were protective factors for moderate obesity. Obesity was not associated with problems of language comprehension or behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study suggest that biological rather than psychosocial factors are the major determinants of obesity at 5 years."
2065113,"Vulnerability to substance abuse is an important emerging issue. A critical aspect of this phenomenon is the degree to which individuals who abuse one substance are likely to abuse other substances, alone or in combination with each other. The extent to which several distinct drugs will come to serve as positive reinforcers within genetically defined subjects defines their commonality. Questions in this area are directed at determining whether reinforcement from and abuse of alcohol and other drugs define variations within a single behavioral phenomenon, or whether reinforcement and abuse must be individually defined for each substance involved. Findings related to this commonality issue are now emerging from the areas of pharmacogenetics and operant drug self-administration. Previous studies have shown that ethanol can be readily established as a positive reinforcer in LEWIS rats, as well as C57BL/6J mice. In low ethanol preferring F344 rats, ethanol maintains significant but low levels of responding. Ethanol does not maintain lever pressing behavior in BALB/cJ mice, and is avoided in DBA/2J mice. Initial findings reported in this paper show that these genotypic patterns of reinforcement from ethanol appear to correlate highly with patterns of reinforcement from cocaine and opiates. From these findings it is concluded that (1) there exist important genetic determinants of drug reinforced behavior; and (2) drug seeking behaviors maintained by ethanol, cocaine and opiates may have at least some common biological determinants."
15522793,"Voles of the genus Microtus represent one of the most speciose mammalian genera in the Holarctic. We established a molecular phylogeny for Microtus to resolve contentious issues of systematic relationships and evolutionary history in this genus. A total of 81 specimens representing ten Microtus species endemic to Europe as well as eight Eurasian, six Asian and one Holarctic species were sequenced for the entire cytochrome b gene (1140 bp). A further 25 sequences were retrieved from GenBank, providing data on an additional 23, mainly Nearctic, Microtus species. Phylogenetic analysis of these 48 species generated four well-supported monophyletic lineages. The genus Chionomys, snow voles, formed a distinct and well-supported lineage separate from the genus Microtus. The subgenus Microtus formed the strongest supported lineage with two sublineages displaying a close relationship between the arvalis species group (common voles) and the socialis species group (social voles). Monophyly of the Palearctic pitymyid voles, subgenus Terricola, was supported, and this subgenus was also subdivided into two monophyletic species groups. Together, these groupings clarify long-standing taxonomic uncertainties in Microtus. In addition, the ""Asian"" and the Nearctic lineages reported previously were identified although the latter group was not supported. However, relationships among the main Microtus branches were not resolved, suggesting a rapid and potentially simultaneous radiation of a widespread ancestor early in the history of the genus. This and subsequent radiations discernible in the cytochrome b phylogeny, show the considerable potential of Microtus for analysis of historical and ecological determinants of speciation in small mammals. It is evident that speciation is an ongoing process in the genus and that the molecular data provides a vital insight into current species limits as well as cladogenic events of the past."
18994665,"The reduction of health inequities is an ethical imperative, according to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH). Drawing on detailed multidisciplinary evidence assembled by the Globalization Knowledge Network that supported the CSDH, we define globalisation in mainly economic terms. We consider and reject the presumption that globalisation will yield health benefits as a result of its contribution to rapid economic growth and associated reductions in poverty. Expanding on this point, we describe four disequalising dynamics by which contemporary globalisation causes divergence: the global reorganisation of production and emergence of a global labour-market; the increasing importance of binding trade agreements and processes to resolve disputes; the rapidly increasing mobility of financial capital; and the persistence of debt crises in developing countries. Generic policies designed to reduce health inequities are described with reference to the three Rs of redistribution, regulation, and rights. We conclude with an examination of the interconnected intellectual and institutional challenges to reduction of health inequities that are created by contemporary globalisation."
17658397,"Psoriasis, a papulosquamous skin disease, was originally thought of as a disorder primarily of epidermal keratinocytes, but is now recognised as one of the commonest immune-mediated disorders. Tumour necrosis factor alpha, dendritic cells, and T-cells all contribute substantially to its pathogenesis. In early-onset psoriasis (beginning before age 40 years), carriage of HLA-Cw6 and environmental triggers, such as beta-haemolytic streptococcal infections, are major determinants of disease expression. Moreover, at least nine chromosomal psoriasis susceptibility loci have been identified. Several clinical phenotypes of psoriasis are recognised, with chronic plaque (psoriasis vulgaris) accounting for 90% of cases. Comorbidities of psoriasis are attracting interest, and include impairment of quality of life and associated depressive illness, cardiovascular disease, and a seronegative arthritis known as psoriatic arthritis. A more complete understanding of underlying pathomechanisms is leading to new treatments, which will be discussed in the second part of this Series."
16277821,"This paper discusses possible consequences of energy excess throughout the life cycle. Firstly we consider the effects of foods on hunger, satiety and satiation. Also, the changes in food availability and consumption in relation to changes in social and economic determinants of energy excess. The relationship between physical activity and energy intake (EI) is also considered. Secondly we explore the definition of energy excess and the metabolic effects of macronutrients (mainly in relation to fuel partitioning oxidation/storage) on energy balance. The cellular and molecular regulation determined by specific genes involved in lipogenesis, fuel partitioning and/or in energy dissipation are explored. Thirdly, we examine the main consequences induced by energy excess and positive energy balance, starting with the alterations in glucose utilisation (insulin resistance) leading to type 2 diabetes and the linkage of energy excess with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Biological, social and psychological consequences during perinatal, childhood and adolescence periods are specifically analysed. Fourthly, the transition from energy deficit to excess, under the optic of a developing country is analysed with country examples drawn from Latin America. The possible role of supplementary food programmes in determining positive energy balance is discussed especially in relation to pre-school and school feeding programmes. Fifthly, we deal with the economic costs of energy excess and obesity related diseases. Finally, some areas where further research is needed are described; biological and genetic determinants of individual and population energy requirements, foods and food preparations as actually consumed, consumer education and research needs on social determinants of energy imbalances."
16076786,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of design features and clinical and social cues on the extent of disagreement among participants in a formal consensus development process. METHODS: Factorial design involving 16 groups consisting of 135 general practitioners (GPs) and 42 mental health professionals from England. The groups rated the appropriateness of four mental health interventions for three conditions (chronic back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome) in the context of various clinical and social cues. The groups differed in three design features: provision of a systematic literature review (versus not provided), group composition (mixed versus GP only), and assumptions about the healthcare resources available (realistic versus idealistic). Disagreement was measured using the mean absolute deviation from a group's median rating for a scenario. RESULTS: None of the design features significantly affected the extent of disagreement within groups (all p>0.3). Disagreement did differ between treatments (closer consensus for cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural therapy than for brief psychodynamic intervention therapy and antidepressants) and cues (closer consensus for depressed patients and patients willing to try any treatment). CONCLUSION: In terms of the extent of disagreement in the groups in this study, formal consensus development was a robust technique in that the results were not dependent on the way it was conducted."
19288341,"In this paper, we investigate the intersections of gender, health and human rights in sites of political exclusion. We apply the political theory of Giorgio Agamben on 'states of exception', seeking to better understand how the recent 'war on terror', that seemingly knows no limits of time or space, is driving health outcomes in refugee and Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps. Reproductive health, militarization, and gender-based violence in camps are explored in depth. The evidence presented reveals a number of contradictions of refugee and IDP camps, further highlighting the need for a more rights based humanitarianism. We conclude that foregrounding states of exception, as a way of understanding current gender dynamics in the social determinants of health, is both epidemiologically necessary and conceptually useful. We find that, in these sites of exclusion, the indispensability of a human rights approach to gender and health equity issues is revealed most directly. Furthermore, we are able to make new connections between the 'crisis of humanitarianism', gender, and health."
8488075,"Urbanization involves a physical change in which increasing proportions of populations live in urban settings, however defined. It also implies considerable changes in the ways in which these people live, how they earn their livelihoods, the food which they eat, and the wide range of environmental factors to which they are exposed. There is another underlying assumption that, increasingly, urban populations will be more healthy than their rural counterparts and that higher levels of urbanization will equate with better health status. This paper discusses some of the assumptions underlying this contention. It takes issue with certain of them, particularly the assumption that urbanization affects the health of all residents equally. It is manifestly evident that in many cities, particularly in the developing world, the poor are exposed to greater risks and have much lower health status than their richer neighbours. In addition, whilst urban residents may theoretically have a better access to health care and services than do residents in many rural areas, and whilst many indicators of health do appear better in more highly urbanized societies than ones less so, there are caveats. The paper introduces the concept of epidemiological transition, which suggests that, whilst life expectancy might be higher in many urbanized countries and in certain cities, the inhabitants are often merely suffering from different forms of ill-health, often chronic or degenerative, rather than infective. In certain cities in middle-income countries, residents, particularly the poor, are exposed to a double risk of both infection and chronic degenerative ailments. The paper concludes with a consideration of more general recent statements from the World Health Organization among others, on the impact of urbanization on health. The 'Healthy Cities' project is also discussed. WHO identifies a range of general determinants of urban health: physical, social, cultural and environmental. Many represent the by-products of modernization and especially industrialization. It is emphasized that urbanization, and the concentration of human beings into new areas in particular, can bring exposure to new risk factors for large numbers of people. The growth of infectious and parasitic disease in some urban settings must therefore be recognized, as must the emergence of chronic diseases, with the concomitant need for investment in new types of health and social care. However, a number of constraints militate against the achievement of improved urban health, especially in developing countries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
15963873,"To better understand temporal trends in sexual behavior and their determinants, it is important to look at the demographic and technologic context in which we live; both affect sexual behaviors. Mental disorders and CSA emerge as important correlates of high-risk sexual behaviors. The changing role and expectations of women-the result of major economic and social transformation-transform society further through changes to family and community structures. These changes occur alongside increasing inequality and upheavals in the world, all of which are more visible through increased mobility and communication in the ""global village."" Changes in sexual norms, relationships, abuse, and mental health are better understood in the context of this broad political background."
11697274,"We examined the effect of relation between interferences from distractor and inhibitory mechanism on the occurrence of negative priming, by using a matching paradigm. The ease of perceptual target selection was determined by magnitudes of interference. Stereoscopic depth was used to manipulate the relative position of a target, a distractor and a standard figure. When the ease of perceptual target selection was manipulated by separation of the target from the distractor in depth, positive priming occurred. However, the ease of target selection turned out to be unnecessary in the occurrence of priming effects. When the distractor and the standard figure were displayed at the same depth plane, where the distractor was supposed to interfere with the encoding of a standard figure, negative priming occurred consistently regardless of the ease of perceptual target selection. This study suggests that inhibitory mechanism contributes to the suppression of inappropriate processes by distractor, and inhibitory mechanism actively keeps distractors from interfering with standard figures."
8880401,"PURPOSE: To study the distribution, prevalence, determinants, and association between substance use (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol, and illegal drugs) and eating attitudes and behavior of high school students in the Negev region of Israel in order to provide an improved basis for prevention and health services. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire regarding attitudes and behavior related to substance use and eating (e.g., breakfast before school, a snack or meal during school time, and three meals a day) was answered by 1,513 high school age youth. RESULTS: The study participants were at greater risk of poor eating behavior if they: (1) used cigarettes, alcohol, and/or illicit substances (p < .01); and (2) were female (p < .01). It was found that girls who used cigarettes were more likely than other young people studied not to eat properly and not to know about the relation between proper eating behavior and personal health (p < .05). Regardless whether cigarettes, alcohol, or illicit substances were used or not used, more than 50% of the youth reported not eating breakfast and 30% indicated they did not eat three meals daily. CONCLUSIONS: There are many concerns about the use and abuse of both licit and illicit substances among adolescents. More attention, however, needs to be given to the relationship between substance use and the attitudes and behavior of young people toward their health, including proper eating habits. The results support the need to develop drug prevention and health programs that are more comprehensive in terms of addressing the broad range of factors associated with adolescent growth and development."

9114467,"This pilot study investigated the importance of social, clinical, and discharge factors in predicting extended length of stay (LOS) in a state geropsychiatric hospital. The authors reviewed medical records of all first time admissions during a 22 month period. A total of 272 patients age 60 and older were admitted for the first time during this period. Nine variables comprised of medical, demographic, social, and discharge information were examined in retrospective analysis to assess their relationship to LOS. The mean and standard deviation of days spent in hospital was 392.3 +/- 752.81. The median number of days of hospitalization was 72.0. Single marital status, type of living arrangement, polypharmacy, and limited functional status were predictive of LOS. Our findings underscore the challenge within geropsychiatry of treating patients with coexisting medical conditions who also have significant behavioral, mood, and/or cognitive disturbances."
10181142,"PURPOSE: The study examines associations of five healthy workplace attributes with trade unionism and nine other industrial and sociodemographic factors. The aims were to illustrate the measurement of workplace health promotion indicators in Western Australia and to identify associations leading to a better understanding of determinants of the healthy workplace. DESIGN: Personal and telephone cross-sectional surveys were performed using population-based sampling frames. The overall response rate was 72%. SETTING: Workplaces in Western Australia. SUBJECTS: Random samples of household respondents aged 16 to 69 years in 1992 (n = 1310) and 1994 (n = 1113). MEASURES: Measures of association between healthy workplace attributes and trade unionism were adjusted for workplace location, size, sector, and industrial classification. RESULTS: Trade unionism was strongly associated with healthy catering practices (adjusted OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.30 to 3.23), sun protection practices (2.66; 1.69 to 4.17), disability access (1.47; 1.10 to 1.95), and worksite health promotion programs (2.56; 2.07 to 3.17). A weak and nonsignificant association was observed with restrictive smoking policies (1.21; .95 to 1.55). Generally, healthy workplace attributes were reported less often by respondents working in rural locations, in the private sector, and at small worksites. There was no consistent relationship with sociodemographic factors, including an index of social disadvantage, but members of blue-collar occupations experienced a low prevalence of restrictive smoking policies. CONCLUSIONS: The study raises the hypothesis, but cannot confirm, that trade unions could provide a means for employees to pursue the creation of a health-promoting workplace. Small business represents an excellent target for health promotion activities."
8923653,"The fertility decline that began in Bangladesh in the late 1980s and continues has prompted diverse theories to explain it. In this qualitative analysis of 21 focus-group sessions with rural women ranging in age from the teens to late 40s and living in the villages of the Matlab area, the women's perceptions of their changing society and of the influence of the family planning program are examined. The women's statements reveal their awareness of the social and economic transition they are undergoing and their interest in family-size limitation, which is bolstered by a strong family planning program. Although the shifts in economic and social circumstances are not large, in conjunction with the strong family planning program they constitute a powerful force for change in attitudes, ideas, and behavior among these women."
9806086,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the morbidity produced by mental disorders, to project changes in morbidity likely to be produced by demographic and economic change, and to review the possible role of psychiatry in the health care system. METHODS: Using prevalence data for psychiatric disorders and population projections, this paper presents the likely changes in morbidity over the next 20 years. A review of social and economic information indicates changes in social attitudes and their effects on mental health. This paper examines the determinants of health and how they are likely to change and explores some possible directions for changes in health care delivery. RESULTS: Psychiatric disorders have been greatly underestimated as a cause of disability but account for 5 of the 10 leading causes of disability and 47.2% of all years lived with a disability (YLD) in developed countries. By 2016, there will be significant changes in the distribution and type of psychiatric disorders seen in the population, with cases of dementia almost doubling. Most of the population growth will be in the older age-groups, who will be well informed and will demand high standards of service. The gap between rich and poor will increase, and the results of childhood poverty and abuse will become more apparent. The disadvantaged, including many mentally ill, will suffer deprivation as disability payments decline, but youth unemployment will improve, possibly reducing crime rates. Forced early retirements will decline. Alternative medicine will make inroads into health care. A crisis in subsidized accommodation for the elderly can be anticipated, which perhaps will lead to reopening institutions that are currently being closed or to developing new forms of care. As the baby boomers pass 50 years of age and begin consuming health care services, governments will revise plans and eligibility for services; users will pay for services more directly. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatry is very vulnerable to minor changes in health care schemes and will increasingly be called on to show economic arguments to justify its services. Pressure to support a primary care model by changing practice styles, developing new skills, and training practitioners will probably occur. The major growth area likely will be geriatric psychiatry."
18681817,"BACKGROUND: Gender-sensitive tobacco control policies are being challenged, and new directions are being sought because public health efforts have reduced cigarette consumption more substantially among men than among women. To better target women, it would help to identify the protective cultural factors that promote resiliency in women and discourage them from smoking. Whereas western cultures have generated a great deal of gender-specific research and programs on the prevention of smoking in women, Asian cultures have not. Taking a personal and sociocultural perspective, this study examines the effect of gender on smoking behaviors in Taiwan. METHODS: In a 2004 cross-sectional random-sampled interview survey, 827 adult men and 90 adult women smokers in Taiwan were queried about the time they began smoking, maintenance of their habits, and their readiness to change. RESULTS: The male/female smoking rate ratio was 9.5 (45.7% vs. 4.8%). Men smoked significantly more cigarettes per day than women (18 vs. 11). We found Taiwanese women started smoking around 20 years old, much later than their western counterparts. We also found that whereas the smoking behavior of the men was very sensitive to social environment and structural factors, that of women revolved around their desire to control their weight and handle their emotions. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the smoking behavior of men and women are a result of a different sociocultural environment and the life trajectories and social circumstances embedded within it. Comprehensive tobacco control policies need to be tailored to not just smoking behavior alone or one population alone but to the determinants of smoking behavior in specific groups, for example, women. Even when targeting women, some effort may be needed on targeting women of different ethnicities, for instance, Asian women in whom the prevalence is increasing at alarming rates."
9088057,"OBJECTIVE: Few studies have evaluated the determinants of perceived health in patients with chronic illness. The present study was designed to evaluate the role of biomedical, demographic, and psychosocial influences on global subjective health by means of a structural equation modeling approach. METHOD: A conceptual model of perceived health was tested in a subsample of patients (N = 146) from the multicenter Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) trial. Domain-specific quality of life constructs (emotional status, social support, and physical functioning), were assessed by means of multiple indicators. These latent (mediating) variables, along with six single-indicator biomedical and background variables, were modeled as predictors of a composite index of perceived health. RESULTS: A satisfactory fit was obtained for the proposed model, with practical fit indices ranging from .89 to .95. High levels of perceived health were associated with low levels of emotional distress and high levels of physical functioning. Social support was positively correlated with physical functioning and negatively associated with emotional distress. Among the background variables, no direct associations were observed between any of the single-indicator variables and perceived health. Several background variables (eg, age, income, walk-test scores) had indirect effects via associations with the latent variables of physical functioning and emotional distress. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of a structural modeling approach in assessing determinants of perceived health in patients with congestive heart failure. Further research is needed to evaluate the utility of the model in other patient populations."
7848126,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the evolution of cognitive dysfunction in early-onset multiple sclerosis, to identify clinical predictors of mental decline, and to determine its impact on a patient's everyday life. DESIGN: The cognitive performance of 50 patients with multiple sclerosis on a neuropsychological battery was compared with that of 70 control subjects initially and again after a 4-year interval. Clinical predictors of cognitive impairment and its effect on daily life were analyzed by stepwise linear regression. SETTING: The research clinic of a university department of neurology. PARTICIPANTS: A consecutive sample of 50 inpatients and outpatients with multiple sclerosis (mean disease duration, 1.58 years) and 70 demographically matched healthy control subjects selected from the patients' relatives and friends. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean psychometric test scores of both groups at the initial and follow-up testing. Regression coefficients measuring the relationship between clinical parameters and cognitive capacity and between mental decline and performance of common tasks measured by the Environmental and the Incapacity Status scales. RESULTS: Multiple sclerosis-related deficits in verbal memory and abstract reasoning on initial testing remained more or less stable on the retest, at which time linguistic disturbances on the Set and Token tests also emerged. A patient's initial disability level predicted decreased performance on only four of 13 cognitive variables, and disease duration did so on only two. Extent of intellectual decline on initial testing, initial disability level, and progressive course were independent determinants of handicap in a patient's work and social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and neurological deficits appear not to develop in parallel. Yet cognitive dysfunction proves to be a predictor of handicap in everyday life, even in patients in the incipient phase of multiple sclerosis."
19589479,"Outcome disparity associated with race or ethnicity in the United States has been observed in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The underlying reasons for such disparity are not known. In the United States, an optimal study of health care disparity by race or ethnicity involves consideration of both biologic and psychosocial determinants, which requires an adequately powered, prospective cohort study design. To better characterize the nature and quantify the magnitude of the many impediments relevant to conducting a successful prospective study involving racial or ethnic minorities in HCT, we conducted a feasibility study to help guide planning of a larger scale outcome and disparity study in HCT. The primary questions to be addressed in the study were: (1) can we establish a racially or ethnically diverse patient sample that will respond to a survey focused on sociodemographic, economic, health insurance, cultural, spiritual, and religious well-being, and social support information? (2) What is the retention rate in the study over time? (3) What is the quality of the data collected from the patients over time? The challenges we faced in conducting this multicenter feasibility study are summarized in this report. Despite the difficulty in conducting disparity studies in racial and ethnic minorities, such studies are essential to ensure that people of all ethnic and racial backgrounds have the best chance possible of benefiting from HCT."
9663916,"OBJECTIVE: To define the distribution and determinants of cardiovascular disease events among participants undergoing long-term antihypertensive therapy, and to stratify them into risk groups on the basis of pretreatment clinical profiles. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of participants in a worksite-based antihypertensive treatment program in New York city (1973-1994). PATIENTS: We studied 8690 systematically treated patients who had at least 6 months of follow-up (average of 5.7 years) and, at entry, had had a systolic blood pressure of > or = 160 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of > or = 95 mmHg (after 1992 > or = 140/90 mmHg), or had been being administered antihypertensive medication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure and incidence of morbid and mortal cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Blood pressure control (to 140 +/- 3/87 +/- 7 mmHg) was achieved by the first year and maintained through 18 years of therapy. In nearly 50,000 person-years of follow-up, there were 468 cardiovascular disease events [myocardial infarction including revascularization (282), strokes (93), congestive heart failure (30) and other cardiovascular deaths (63)]. Deaths from cardiovascular disease events accounted for 68% of all deaths. Myocardial infarction was most common throughout, but congestive heart failure incidence surpassed stroke incidence after 10 years. A scheme for risk stratification was constructed after analysis of the independent association of baseline factors and incident cardiovascular events. Upon the basis of ease of ascertainment and their demonstrated associations with occurrence of cardiovascular disease during treatment, we selected five pretreatment factors (history of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, age > or = 55 years and pulse pressure > or = 60 mmHg) to stratify patients into four groups. Those with no risk factor had a low risk (n=2999), those with one had a moderate risk (3042), those with two had a high risk (2237), and those with three or more had a very high risk (412). Overall, the unadjusted rates of incidence of cardiovascular disease events per 1000 person-years for patients in very high and low risk groups differed by factors of six and 14 for men and women, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that long-term control of blood pressure can be achieved in a general population. Nevertheless, cardiovascular disease events still accounted for most morbidity and mortality among these 'recovered' hypertensive patients. At entry, on the basis of readily identifiable characteristics, it was possible to stratify patients according to likelihood of subsequent events occurring despite control of blood pressure. This scheme could provide the basis for targeting more aggressive therapy where the potential for further cardioprotection is greatest."
10984986,"OBJECTIVE: Self-perceived class results from directly questioning subjects about his or her social class. The aim of this investigation was to analyse self-perceived class in relation to other indicator variables of socioeconomic level. METHODS: Data from the 1994 Catalan Health Interview Survey, a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of the non-institutionalised population of Catalonia was used. We conducted a discriminant analysis to compute the degree of right classification when different socioeconomic variables potentially related to self-perceived class were considered. All subjects who directly answered the questionnaire were included (N = 12,245). With the aim of obtaining the discriminant functions in a group of subjects and to validate it in another one, the subjects were divided into two random samples, containing approximately 75% and 25% of subjects (analysis sample, n = 9,248; and validation sample, n = 2,997). RESULTS: The final function for men and women included level of education, social class (based in occupation) and equivalent income. This function correctly classified 40.9% of the subjects in the analysis sample and 39.2% in the validation sample. Two other functions were selected for men and women separately. In men, the function included level of education, professional category, and family income (39.2% of classification in analysis sample and 37.2% in validation sample). In women, the function (level of education, working status, and equivalent income) correctly classified 40.3% of women in analysis sample whereas the percentage was 38.9% in validation sample. The percentages of right classification were higher for the highest and lowest classes. CONCLUSION: These results show the utility of a simple variable to self-position within the social scale. Self-perceived class is related to education, income, and working determinants."
20059894,"In this phase of rapid demographic change and low birth rate , coupled with an increasing life expectancy , the challenge for the future consists of being able to age in good health . European policies should therefore be aimed at promoting healthiness in the elderly and, although some CEE countries have introduced various projects and schemes, the majority are of a national or local nature and do not take into account the European context. The healthPROelderly project, on the other hand , is aimed at collecting information in the countries who participate in the project to pinpoint the best schemes for promoting healthiness in the elderly. This study focuses on the models that have a sustainable approach as far as socio-economical, environmental and lifestyle aspects are concerned. The specific aim of the project is to identify the criteria that have the highest impact on health schemes for the elderly and to establish relative guidelines at local, national and European level."
8450128,"This paper reports on an integrative review of the research literature published between 1983 and 1991 that focused on identifying the determinants of a health-promoting lifestyle. Twenty-three studies were reviewed, six of which were concerned with children and adolescents and the remaining 17 with adults. A meta-analysis of correlations for each study determinant was conducted using the Pandora System. Results indicated that self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of a health-promoting lifestyle, followed by social support, perceived benefits, self-concept, perceived barriers and health definition. The most frequently studied determinants were not the best predictors of a health-promoting lifestyle."
7781734,"The prevalence of antibodies to Chlamydia pneumoniae was examined in a stratified random sample of 581 Jerusalem adult residents between August 1987 and March 1989. IgG and IgA titres were measured by microimmunofluorescence, and associations with smoking and socio-demographic variables were assessed. IgG antibodies were found in 84.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 80.4-87.9) of men and 68.7% (95% CI: 61.6-75.0) of women (P < 0.0001 for sex difference), indicating a very high rate of exposure in this population. IgA antibodies, postulated to represent persistent infection, were present in 45.1% (95% CI: 40.1-50.2) of men and 23% (95% CI: 17.4-29.7) of women (P < 0.0001 for sex difference). Factors associated with IgG seropositivity included family size, education and social class. On the other hand age (in men) and smoking were associated with IgA seropositivity. These findings support the hypothesis that low socioeconomic status and household crowding may be predictive of exposure to or infection with this organism (IgG seropositivity), whereas they do not explain persistence of the infection putatively expressed as IgA seropositivity."
16390363,"OBJECTIVE: Presentations of selective findings coming from the Zurich Adolescent Psychology and Psychopathology Study with two major aims: i) the study of the prevalence, course, and correlates of mental disorders in adolescence, and ii) the study of the determinants and processes of mental disorders in adolescence. METHOD: A representative sample of n = 1964 children and adolescents was studied in the canton of Zurich in 1994. Additional waves of data collection took place in 1997 and 2000/2001. Mean ages at these three assessments were 13, 16, and 20 years. Each wave contained a two-stage procedure of assessment with screening by questionnaires and consecutive interviewing. The main constructs used were general and specific measures of psychopathology, life events, coping styles, self-related cognitions, and quality of the social network. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of any mental disorder in school-age at the time of assessment was 22.5% fitting into a transcultural range of 18-26% based on DSM-III-R criteria. Furthermore, the derivation and validation of a four-group adolescent drinker typology was demonstrated. Additionally, the prevalence and continuity of functional-somatic symptoms from adolescence to young adulthood was shown. Another piece of the research tested for the identification of risk, compensatory, vulnerability, and protective factors influencing behaviour problems and found remarkably different frequencies across the four types of moderating factors. CONCLUSION: The presented findings provide further understanding of the developmental psychology and psychopathology of adolescence and the service, intervention, and prevention needs of this age-group."
20120654,"BACKGROUND: Postherpetic neuralgia is a neuralgia caused by the varicella zoster virus. Its natural history involves slow resolution of the pain syndrome. A subgroup of patients may develop severe, long-lasting pain that does not respond to medical therapy. It also accounts for 11-15% of all referrals to pain clinics but little is known about the quality of life of patients with this condition in our locality Nigeria. METHOD: Fifty three Post herpetic Neuralgia patients aged between 25 and 56 years (mean = 37.47 +/- 8.29 years) receiving antiretroviral therapy/treatment at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Maiduguri, Nigeria participated in this study. The short-form 36 (SF-36) generic health-related Quality of Life questionnaire was used to assess the QoL. Spearman rank correlation procedure was used to evaluate the relationship of HRQoL outcomes with medical and socio-demographic factor. RESULT: Physical functioning), Role limitations due to physical health (LPH), Role limitations due to emotional problems (LEP), Social functioning (SF), General health perceptions (GH) scores were below average (35.59 +/- 19.85, 34.28 +/- 33.16, 33.70 +/- 23.26, 49.07 +/- 17.04, 44.09 +/- 9.72 respectively) while Emotional well being/Mental health (EM) was above average (50.13 +/- 11.56). An average (moderate) symptom scale score was Energy/Fatigue (EF) (51.32 +/- 12.87) while Bodily pain (BP) was severe (31.09 +/- 20.46). Age and sex had no significant influence on any of the functional and symptom scale scores as well as the overall QOL. Inverse relationship was observed between age and each of the LPH, LEP, SF, GH, overall QoL and the entire symptom scales. The overall QoL and each of the symptom scale scores were significantly related (P > 0.05). The functional scale score PF, RPH, REP EM and GH were significantly related to overall QoL while SF was not significantly related (P > 0.01). CONCLUSION: This study has shown that the overall QoL of PHN in HIV positive patients undergoing adjuvant therapy is below average. The predictor factors of the overall QoL of this group of patients have been brought to light. These patients would require ways to improve the QoL, there is the need for health care provider to address the factors uncovered by this study. Four of the determinant factors (PF, LP, BP and EF) are issues that fall within the corridor of physical therapy.

However, studies provide only a partial understanding of this phenomenon and there is currently no nursing model that takes into consideration a combination of factors. This study, based on Pender's preventive health beliefs model, was intended to identify the psychosocial determinants of lithium compliance. A random sample (n = 149) of outpatients at a large Montreal psychiatric hospital was used to measure lithium compliance on the basis of 5 criteria: compliance according to the nurse and according to the patient, appointment compliance, and compliance according to two criteria related to hyperuricemia. Polytomous logistic regression analyses were computed by regressing a composite of these criteria on sociodemographic variables and on the variables of the Pender model: susceptibility, seriousness, control over health, motivation to be healthy, perceived benefits and obstacles, and triggering factors. It appears that being female, being elderly, living with a partner, and perceived treatment benefits and obstacles are determining factors in lithium compliance. These results are all the more important in light of Quebec's newly implemented drug insurance plan, which could increase the obstacles to medication. Nurses will have to be increasingly vigilant with respect to these new obstacles and will have to adjust their interventions accordingly."
20024758,"We developed gender-specific explanatory models for unsafe sexual behavior among unmarried young people living in urban West Africa using a culturally adapted instrument which addresses personal, relational and socio-cognitive factors. Data were collected on condom use and number of sexual partners, and on their potential determinants, using in-person interviews on a heterogeneous sample of in-school and out-of-school young women (n=185) and (n=214) men who reported ever having had sexual intercourse. Recruitment was done at various sites in 21 randomly selected neighborhoods in Bamako. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to identify determinants of lack of condom at last sex and having more than one partner in the last six months and to test for interactions with gender. Similar percentages of men (40%) and women (46%) reported not using a condom at last sex. However, more men (64%) reported multiple partnering in the last six months than women (32%). Our findings suggest that the context of sexual debut, social status, relation to peers and family as well as attitudinal, normative and behavioral control constructs may influence young men and women's sexual behavior, but that pathways leading to unsafe sex are different across genders. Our findings also show that factors associated with condom use and sexual partnering are distinct. Earlier sexual debut seems to be risk-inducing in women while risk-reducing in men. Poor communication with peers and receiving money from sexual partner were associated with lack of condom use in women. High behavioral control was associated with fewer sexual partners in men. Determinants of unsafe sexual behavior were found at the social, interpersonal and individual levels for both men and women, but notable gender differentials existed. These findings underscore the importance of addressing gender as a crucial factor shaping HIV-risk profiles."
18568706,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has damaging impacts on victims and family members' lives and their long-term social integration constitutes a major challenge. PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to document the repercussions of TBI on victims' long-term social integration (10 years post-trauma) and the contribution made by the services received from the point of view of TBI victims and family caregivers. This article examines the determinants of long-term social integration as well as the impact of TBI on family caregivers. METHODS: A qualitative design was used (semi-directed interviews). The sample consisted of 22 individuals who had sustained a moderate or severe TBI and 21 family caregivers. RESULTS: The results show that TBI is an experience that continues to present difficulties, even 10 years after the accident, and that different barriers contribute to this difficulty: not going back to work, depressive episodes, problems in relationships and sequellae. Family caregivers must help TBI victims confront the barriers in their path. IMPLICATIONS: This study adopts a longitudinal perspective to help professionals determine how to intervene with TBI victims and their families. It validates the importance of having clients and family caregivers describe their reality."
8693173,"In this paper, we analyze the factors related to the allocation of home help services, a main component for maintaining elderly at home. The study is based on a random sample of 889 people aged 65 and over, living at home in the areas of Lunel and Pezenas (Herault, France). The factors taken into account were disabilities, income, social support, and subjective health assessed through the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). A logistic model allowed to bring out the factors related to the delivery of home help services. Positive statistical correlations were found for age (OR = 1.6 per 10-year age groups), disabilities for instrumental activities of daily living (OR = 3.8) and for the notion of mobility assessed through the NHP (OR = 3.3); negative statistical correlations were found for the level of income (OR = 0.3), as well as for disabilities for activities of daily living (physical dependency) (OR = 0.5). These results show that the main criterion for allocating home help services is not severe disability and that subjective aspects play an important part. Accordingly, current practices should be modified to obtain a better targeting of home help services for disabled elderly at home."

Ordered probit models are estimated, where the dependent variable is an ordered response on the feeling of national identity. The results show that personal characteristics, the nationality and the family context affect the migrant's integration, while labor market variables appear to be quite unimportant."""
19034049,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variability and determinants of menopause age in two European cohort studies, the European Respiratory Health Survey and the Swiss Air Pollution and Lung Disease in Adults Cohort. METHODS: Age at menopause was estimated in 5,288 women, aged 30 to 60 years, randomly selected in nine European countries between 1998 and 2002. Determinants of natural and surgically induced menopause were investigated by Cox regression and heterogeneity by meta-analysis. Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were assessed in a subsample. RESULTS: A quarter of the women were postmenopausal by age 50.8 years. Median age of natural menopause was 54 years. Hormone levels were within expected ranges for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Surgically induced menopause was highly prevalent (22%-47%), associated with earlier timing of menopause. Determinants of earlier menopause were current smoking (hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.27-1.98), body mass index greater than 30 kg/m (HR, 1.32; 95%, CI, 1.02-1.70), and low physical activity (HR, 1.37; 95%, CI, 1.12-1.67). The determinant for later menopause was multiparity (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89). Predictors were similar for naturally and surgically induced menopause. Oral contraceptive use yielded heterogeneous effects on timing of menopause. Later birth was associated with later menopause (HR, 0.934; 95% CI, 0.91-0.96). This evidence of a secular trend is heterogeneous across countries. CONCLUSIONS: Age at menopause varies across Europe, shifting toward higher ages. This secular trend seems paradoxical because several adult determinants, that is, overweight, smoking, sedentarity, and nulliparity, associated with early menopause are on the rise in Europe. The heterogeneity of the secular trend suggests additional country-specific factors not included in the study, such as improved childhood nutrition and health, that have an influence on reproductive aging."
12162837,"This piece presents evidence that inequities in information are an important determinant of health inequities and that eliminating these inequities in access to information, especially by using new information and communication technologies (ICTs), could represent a significant advance in terms of guaranteeing the right to health for all. The piece reviews the most important international scientific research findings on the determinants of the health of populations, emphasizing the role of socioeconomic inequities and of deteriorating social capital as factors that worsen health conditions. It is noteworthy that Latin America has both socioeconomic inequities and major sectors of the population living in poverty. Among the fundamental strategies for overcoming the inequalities and the poverty are greater participation by the poor in civic life and the strengthening of social capital. The contribution that the new ICTs could make to these strategies is analyzed, and the Virtual Health Library (VHL) is discussed. Coordinated by the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME), the VHL is a contribution by the Pan American Health Organization that takes advantage of the potential of ICTs to democratize information and knowledge and consequently promote equity in health. The ""digital gap"" is discussed as something that can produce inequity itself and also increase other inequities, including ones in health. Prospects are discussed for overcoming this gap, emphasizing the role that governments and international organizations should play in order to expand access to the global public good that information for social development is."
15271082,"Behavioural interactions are often analysed in terms of their costs and benefits to the actors [Hamilton, (1964) J. Theor. Biol.7 1-16; Gadagkar, (1993) Trends Ecol. Evol.8 232-234; Foster et al., (2001) Ann. Zool. Fenn.38 229-238]. Using the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, we wish to distinguish between two possible determinants of interaction behaviour between conspecifics, namely kin-directed behaviour that reflects genetic distance between individuals, or, alternatively, interactions guided by a functional distance between individuals, specifically, with respect to disease susceptibility. We find no relationship between contact rate of individuals and the genetic distance of their respective colonies. Interestingly, we do find a significant negative correlation between contact rate and the distance between the two colonies in susceptibility to a spectrum of parasite strains. This cannot be explained by either of the a priori alternatives so we propose two further testable hypotheses to explain our results."
20107704,"OBJECTIVE: To assess and analyze the associations between adherence to treatment and social position in women living with HIV/AIDS. METHOD: A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study among 269 Colombian women was conducted. Participants completed three questionnaires: a socio-demographic and clinical characteristics survey, a treatment adherence scale, and a social position survey. RESULTS: Women of low social position had a significantly higher probability of low treatment adherence (OR = 5.651, P < 0.0001), and the majority of social position variables measured had a significant effect on adherence. A general model considering the variables 'type of national health care plan' ('contributive,' 'subsidized,' or, in the case of vinculadas or the uninsured, 'none'); 'having HIV-positive children'; and 'level of viral load' was statistically reliable in predicting study participants' treatment adherence. Membership in the subsidized plan or being uninsured had a greater effect on the probability of low adherence than membership in the contributive plan (OR = 3.478, P < 0.0001). Univariate regression analyses confirmed that women with HIV-positive children and a viral load > 400 copies/ml were more likely to have low adherence than women without those characteristics (OR = 2.395, P = 0.0274 and OR = 2.178, P = 0.0050, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Improving women's adherence to HIV/AIDS treatment in Colombia would require eliminating barriers to national health care system and comprehensive health care services and implementing programs that take into account women's role as maternal caregivers The findings underscore the need to integrate variables related to gender inequality and social position in treatment adherence analysis, as advocated in the social determinants of health approach."
2083264,"The application of current health promoting behaviour models for understanding psycho-social determinants of condom use is discussed. It was concluded that their utility is reduced because they are individualistic models and do not take into account interaction between couples, and contextual factors. Systemic AIDS counselling and relapse prevention approaches to invervention may provide a better basis for developing an appropriate methodology for studying condom use because they incorporate contextual factors. Some future directions for research into the determinants of condom use and the implications for health education and counselling are proposed."
12346110,"The purpose of this study is to assess the factors which have influenced the evolution of fertility in Quebec between 1960 and 1990, in order to have a better focus on short and middle term fertility's determining factors. A Whittaker-Henderson filter is applied to various variables presumably linked to the total fertility index in order to retrieve and isolate the trend, which then enables concentration on residuals' co-variations. A regression analysis then enables assessment of the factors' weights and the short term's influence (business cycle). Governmental incentives, notably between 1988 and 1990, appear as having contributed, as well as the overall economic conjuncture, to the observed total fertility index raise in the course of this period."
7993309,"The study of brothers and sisters from adoptive and biologically related families permits unique analyses of the determinants of young adults' educational and occupational achievements. Brothers and sisters come from the same homes, neighborhoods, and usually schools. Many differences among families are controlled by the study of siblings. In addition, adoptive families influence their children only through the environment they provide, whereas biologically related parents transmit their intellectual and personal characteristics to their offspring genetically as well. Thus, the comparison of models of adult achievements for children from adoptive and biologically related families can inform us about the true effects of family environments, apart from genetic transmission (Scarr and Weinberg, 1978, 1980). In this follow-up study of 450 biologically related and adopted young adults (ages 22 to 30 years), we report on the family resemblances in educational and occupational achievements. Parents' reports were obtained on 97% of the original sample (N = 443), and 77% of the young adults participated in the follow-up study themselves; complete educational and occupational data were available on 303 young adults. Results show that biological sons are more influenced by their family backgrounds than daughters, regardless of genetic relatedness. A second finding is that young women's achievements are not as predictable from their own earlier achievements as are those of their brothers. A third finding is that parents invest in their sons' educational futures, regardless of sons' abilities and achievements, in ways they do not invest in their daughters' postsecondary educations. Sibling correlations and natural mother-adopted child correlations suggest that test scores, high school performance, postsecondary education, and even later occupational status can be influenced by genetic variability in personal characteristics that affect such achievements."
8888156,"This paper explores barriers to the use of standard screening and breast cancer treatment that result in systematic differences in health outcomes. We review available data on individual, socioeconomic, and health system determinants of access to standard breast cancer care, including screening, diagnostic, and treatment services. Based on this review, we discuss the combination of factors which result in underservice. We argue that a broad framework which considers health system and social class as well as individual factors is useful for analyzing how structures of health care delivery tend to provide less than standard care to women who are older, have less income, or are less educated, black, or Hispanic. Data collection efforts which do not include structural and socioeconomic variables may result in an incomplete or misleading understanding of the determinants of underservice. These factors also need to be considered in the design and evaluation of public health policies and interventions meant to ameliorate the effects of underservice."

9358295,"PURPOSE: To examine the relationship of reported condom use to specific sociodemographics, psychosocial variables, and perceptions of and motivations for condom use as conceptualized by the Health Belief Model. METHODS: This study performed a cross-sectional survey of 557 adolescents enrolled in a hospital-based pregnancy prevention program in an urban community hospital (Harlem Hospital). Multiple logistic regression analysis examined the combined relationship of the significant psychosocial variables to consistent condom use. RESULTS: Males were less likely than females to report teen-parent conflict and depression and more likely to report support for birth control, participation in community activities, and favorable attitudes toward delaying parenthood. Consistent with the Health Belief Model adjusting for age, the strongest predictors of consistent condom use were partner preference for condoms, perceived benefit of avoidance of pregnancy, male gender, and support for birth control (usually by a parent). CONCLUSIONS: The data on this urban, predominantly African-American sample of adolescents suggest the importance of the influences on specific motivations to use protection--that is, the wish to avoid pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and sexually transmitted diseases, although the mechanisms are still unclear. In addition, gender and the modifying effects of parental and partner support of the use of protection strongly influence the reported use of condoms by adolescents. These factors (in addition to psychosocial factors such as depression) may be important in planning interventions to increase condom use by sexually active teens."
17595548,"Morgan, Zamora and Hindmarsh make a compelling case for a national strategy on chronic disease prevention and management. The truths raised in the lead paper are not particularly inconvenient, but they do raise a number of uncomfortable questions: (1) Why are physicians not taking a more responsible and active role to prevent and manage chronic diseases on behalf of their patients? (Physicians must recognize that it is their professional responsibility and their job to provide their patients with the appropriate level of care for chronic conditions.) (2) Why are non-physician healthcare providers not playing a larger role to prevent and manage chronic diseases? (3) Why is there a greater focus on managing chronic diseases than on preventing or delaying them from happening? (4) Have we forgotten the profound impact of the social determinants of health on illness, life expectancy and death?"
9158292,"The idea that early experiences disproportionately influence adult behaviour has long been a fixture of mainstream developmental theory. Although unambiguous empirical support for this view at the human level is surprisingly sparse, compelling evidence from animal studies abounds. Recent studies with rhesus monkeys have demonstrated dramatic short- and long-term effects of differential early social experiences on both behavioural and physiological functioning. Early social relationships with mothers or other caregivers appear to provide especially powerful determinants of behavioural propensities throughout the lifespan."
11522812,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined factors associated with unmet need for care among persons aged 18 and older who need help with daily living tasks. The analysis focused on two types of unmet need: not enough (or inadequate) help and no help at all. METHODS: The authors used multinomial logistic regression to examine differences between persons with long-term care needs who (a) had all their needs met; (b) received inadequate help; and (c) received no help at all. Data were from the Adult Followback to the National Health Interview Survey on Disability (NHIS-D) for 1994 and 1995. RESULTS: The determinants of inadequate care versus no care differed with respect to age, gender, level of impairment, and insurance status. Whereas age and gender were important in determining inadequate care, insurance coverage and availability of social support were key factors related to a situation of no care. DISCUSSION: The present study demonstrates that the characteristics of groups reporting inadequate care versus no care, and the factors associated with these situations, are quite different. Nevertheless, the most important demographic risk factors for both types of unmet need mirror demographic groups currently on the increase in the U.S. population."
18464286,"I study factors associated with prevalence of obesity among immigrants as the length of their stay in the US becomes longer. Using the National Health Interview Surveys for 1990-2004, I create 'synthetic cohorts' of immigrants that allow controlling for two important determinants of obesity: age at arrival and period of arrival in the US. I find that immigrants with a BA degree did not experience any change in obesity as their stay in the US advanced. Obesity among those without a BA degree, however, increased with duration of stay. Similarly, while some ethnic groups experienced increase in obesity with duration, others did not. For those who experienced increase in obesity with duration, the rise was higher during the first five years of residence than later and greater for those who arrived at a relatively young age."
12027273,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to characterise the epidemiological and nutritional transition and their determinants in Mexico. DESIGN: Age-adjusted standardised mortality rates (SMRs) due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), diabetes mellitus and hypertension were calculated for 1980-1998. Changes in the prevalences of overweight and obesity in women and children and of dietary intake from 1988 to 1999 were also used in the analysis. Quantities of food groups purchased by adult equivalent (AE) and food expenditures away from home between 1984 and 1989 were used to assess trends. All information was analysed at the national and regional levels, and by urban and rural areas. RESULTS: SMR for diabetes, AMI and hypertension increased dramatically parallel to obesity at the national and regional levels. Fat intake in women and the purchase of refined carbohydrates, including soda, also increased. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that obesity is playing a role in the increased SMRs of diabetes, AMI and hypertension in Mexico. Total energy dietary intake and food purchase data could not explain the rise in the prevalence of obesity. The increases in fat intake and the purchase of refined carbohydrates may be risk factors for increased mortality. Information on physical activity was not available. CONCLUSION: SMRs due to diabetes, hypertension and AMI have increased dramatically in parallel with the prevalence of obesity; therefore actions should be taken for the prevention of obesity. Reliable information about food consumption and physical activity is required to assess their specific roles in the aetiology of obesity."
18694188,"Since the widespread use of the Internet, few studies have examined health information seeking in France. A web-based survey was conducted to understand how and why French people use the Internet for health information seeking. SES and psychosocial characteristics, health status, illness perception, and characteristics of web-based searches were assessed and studied using the ehealth literacy concept. We do not demonstrate that Internet is used instead of general practitioner or the healthcare system."
10186847,"For many caregivers, rendering aid to frail parents, grandparents, siblings, and spouses comes at a high price: compromised physical and mental health, disturbed relationships with spouse and children, truncated opportunities for social life, and, for caregivers who are employed, declining job performance. Using the 1982 National Long Term Care Survey's ""Survey of Informal Care-givers,"" this study investigates how the sociodemographic characteristics of caregivers, care requirements, the availability of backup caregivers, and conditions of employment affect the likelihood that caregivers will suffer work constraints. Estimations of both the probability of work constraints and hours of work reveal that proxies for work conditions figure prominently, as do care requirements. In the model of constrained work, ill health, financial burdens, and primary responsibility for care are significant determinants; the estimation of hours of work revealed that low income and competing care demands wielded major influence. Women and white caregivers are employed fewer hours, while spouses are more likely than other informal caregivers to face constrained work. Occupation, as an indicator of work conditions, is shown to be an important addition to the factors considered in investigations of circumstances that affect caregivers' experiencing work constraints."
10881208,"Epidemiologic studies in the general population and those based on the clinical assessment of schizophrenic populations have revealed a high degree of overlap between schizophrenia and addictive disorders. The abuse of psychoactive substances (including alcohol) throughout life is so frequent (50%) that the possibility of a specific link inevitably arises. Various hypotheses have been suggested to explain the high co-morbidity between schizophrenia and addiction: 1) The social-environmental hypothesis has been developed but studies have provided poor evidence to validate it. 2) The possible shared biological vulnerability between schizophrenia and addictions led researchers to explore common genetic determinants and study the involvement of the dopaminergic and opioid systems in the aetiology of both schizophrenia and the abuse of and dependence on psychoactive drugs. 3) Finally, the theory of self-medication suggests that schizophrenics may be attempting to counter the deficit linked to their disorders by using the substances they take or their dependency-type behaviour to cope with their emotional problems. The clinical profile of schizophrenic addicts does seem to display some distinctive features, such as the high level of depressive co-morbidity, very high nicotine and alcohol dependence, with a very poor prognosis. These patients are difficult to manage; the possibility of pharmacologic interactions between the substances they are taking and neuroleptic medication calls for prudence, and their compliance is also poor. Addictive disorders in schizophrenics are currently a topic of active research intended to lead to identifying specific treatments. The early identification of addictive disorders in schizophrenics should make it possible to limit their development and improve the prognosis."
19938924,"Alcohol intoxication is a risk factor for being a perpetrator or victim of sexual coercion. Environmental factors (e.g., misperception of social cues), as well as dispositional factors (e.g., personality, gender), are believed to play an important role in linking alcohol consumption and sexual coercion. Sixty-three participants, chosen on the basis of being high or low on scales of hypermasculinity (men) or hyperfemininity (women), were randomly assigned to either an alcohol or nonalcohol condition. After viewing a video of an ambiguous heterosexual interaction, participants responded to questions assessing their accuracy of recall of cues from the interaction, positive bias in their recall of cues, and expectancies regarding 1) the future sexual behavior of the characters in the video and 2) their own conduct if they were in a similar situation. Alcohol was negatively related to accuracy in recall and positively related to the belief that the characters in the video would engage in sexual intercourse (both volitionally and forced). Gender was also important as women were less accurate in recalling cues and intoxicated women evinced a positive bias for cue recall. Traits of hypermasculinity and hyperfemininity were not robust predictors. Hypermasculine men did, however, endorse a substantially higher likelihood that they would have sexual intercourse if in a similar situation. Findings are placed in the context of potential preventive interventions."
8211537,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Use of condoms is one of the main methods sexually active persons may choose to prevent infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Little is known about patterns of condom use among women in the United States. We provide a conceptualization of patterns of condom use and factors associated with these patterns. GOAL OF THIS STUDY: To examine patterns of condom use and associated characteristics among sexually active, never-married women in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of data from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth, which is a nationally representative sample of women in their childbearing years. RESULTS: Only a minority of sexually active, never-married women report using condoms, and even fewer report using them consistently. Women with characteristics traditionally associated with increased risk of infection with STD and HIV appear to be less likely to report using condoms and to report using them consistently. Women who report use of condoms to prevent STDs are more likely to report consistent condom use; less likely to cease using condoms; and more likely to initiate consistent condom use. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the need for innovative programming targeted for specific sexually active populations to promote both initiation and maintenance of use of condoms."
8754600,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of smoking among young women is of particular concern in most countries as it does not decline as in men. We studied smoking behaviour in Greenlandic and Danish women over a 2 year period to provide information on the social and behavioural determinants of smoking in women. METHODS: In 1986, samples of 800 women aged 20-39 years were drawn at random from Nuuk/Godthab (Greenland) and Nykobing Falster (Denmark). A total of 586 and 661 women were interviewed in Greenland and Denmark, respectively. In 1988, new random samples of 150 women were drawn from the same areas. Totally, 129 Greenlandic and 126 Danish women were included in this study. In 1987, a sample of 732 women aged 20-49 years from Copenhagen was randomly drawn from the computerized Central Population Register. Of these, 623 women completed a questionnaire. RESULTS: Smoking behaviour was almost the same among women in Nykobing Falster and Copenhagen (54% smoked) while a significantly higher percentage of smokers was observed among women in Greenland (88% smoked). Heavy smoking was most prevalent among Danish women and associated with early debut of smoking. Among Danish women, smoking was associated with use of oral contraceptives, early age at first intercourse, and multiple sexual partners. In Greenland, smoking was associated with early sexual debut and multiple sexual partners. In an extended analysis on a subgroup of Danish women, smoking was also associated with low education and infrequent intake of vegetables. The study showed no development in smoking behaviour in any age group over the two year period between the two studies, neither in Nykobing Falster nor in Nuuk. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of moderate smoking among women in Greenland suggests that broad anti-smoking initiatives are urgently needed. The high prevalence of heavy smoking and a social gradient among Danish women may indicate that a strategy focusing on restrictions of smoking may be more relevant than merely continuing a pure anti-smoking information strategy."
10344937,"Based on data from the 1982 Social Security New Beneficiary Survey (NBS), the 1991 New Beneficiary Follow-up (NBF), and Social Security administrative records, this study analyzed determinants of the elderly's Supplemental Security Income (SSI) participation, denied application, and nonapplication. In the analysis, SSI application is conceptualized as an outcome of a complex interaction among financial, sociodemographic, health, and informational factors as well as those indicative of elderly persons' subjective perception of need. The findings indeed confirmed that objective financial need does not automatically lead to SSI application. Sociodemographic and health-related factors mediating the objective financial need are identified, although the subjective perception of need and informational barriers requires further evaluation. Policy implications include continued dissemination of information about SSI and relaxation of the resource test to qualify more low-income elderly."
15598757,"Our understanding of longitudinal patterns of adolescent smoking development and the determinants of these patterns is limited. The present study evaluated adolescent smoking trajectories and characterized these trajectories with social, psychological, and behavioral factors in a cohort of adolescents assessed annually from grades 9 to 12. Complete data (smoking practices, novelty seeking, academic performance, substance use, peer smoking, physical activity and sports participation, and tobacco ad receptivity) were available on 968 participants; data were analyzed using latent class growth modeling. Four adolescent smoking trajectories emerged: never smokers, experimenters, earlier/faster smoking adopters, and later/slower smoking adopters. Early adopters were characterized by their high novelty seeking personality, depressive symptoms, poorer academic performance, and receptivity to tobacco advertising, as well as their exposure to other smokers, and use of other substances. Later adopters were characterized quite similarly to the early adopters, although they tended to perform better in school and to be more involved in sports. Experimenters also shared many of these same risk characteristics but to a lesser degree. Overall, never smokers were the most conventional in their profile. These data suggest that there is significant heterogeneity in the timing, rate, and intensity of smoking progression. Adolescent smoking prevention and intervention programs will need to consider this heterogeneity and tailor or enhance attention to risk and protective factors depending on the subpopulation."
20044965,"OBJECTIVES: Societies that foster socially supportive networks produce healthier populations. Social support is a significant determinant of health among Canada's Inuit population; however, little is known about the characteristics that provide access to social support among Inuit. This exploratory analysis describes how 4 types of social support (namely, positive social interaction, emotional support, tangible support and affection and intimacy) differ in relation to various determinants of health. STUDY DESIGN: Micro-data from the Arctic Supplement of the 2001 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (n = 26,290) was used. METHODS: Cross-tabulations and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine levels (high/low) of the 4 types of social support among the full Inuit sample (n = 26,290) as they relate to age, gender, geographic region, marital status, Aboriginal language use and participation in traditional harvesting activities. RESULTS: Certain subsegments of the Inuit population were less likely to report high levels of social support, including men, the elderly (aged 55+) and the unmarried. Some Inuit-relevant determinants were also found to decrease the odds of reporting high levels of social support, including being unable to speak or understand an Aboriginal language, not participating in traditional harvesting activities and living in Nunavik. CONCLUSIONS: Research that frames Inuit health within the social determinants of health is in its relative infancy; however, evidence from the social epidemiological literature indicates that those with diminished access to social support also suffer poorer health outcomes. Future research should build on the findings of this study to examine how the relationship between various health outcomes (e.g., respiratory disease, suicide attempts, self-rated health) and social support may respond along a social gradient. Such analysis will build on the paucity of literature specific to Inuit health and social conditions and set priorities for policy and programming efforts that will improve the social determinants of Inuit health."
15133693,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess fetal, antenatal, and pregnancy determinants of unexplained antepartum fetal death. METHODS: This is a hospital-based cohort study of 34,394 births weighing 500 g or more from January 1995 to December 2002. Unexplained fetal deaths were defined as fetal deaths occurring before labor, without evidence of significant fetal, maternal or placental pathology. RESULTS: Ninety-eight unexplained antepartum fetal deaths accounted for 27.2% of 360 total fetal deaths. Two-thirds of these deaths occurred after 36 weeks' gestation. The following factors are independently associated with unexplained fetal deaths: primiparity (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.21, 2.86); parity of five or more (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.26, 3.26); low socioeconomic status (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.14, 2.86); maternal age 40 years or more (OR 3.62; 95% CI 1.22, 4.52); maternal age of 18 years or less (OR 1.79; 95% CI 0.82, 2.89); maternal prepregnancy weight greater than 70 kg (OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.85, 3.68); fewer than three antenatal visits in women whose fetuses died at 31 weeks or more (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.08, 2.48); birth weight ratio (defined as ratio of birth weight to mean birth weight for gestational age) between 0.85 and 0.94 (OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.28, 4.18) or over 1.45 (OR 2.92; 95% CI 1.75, 3.21); trimester of first antenatal visit. Previous fetal death, previous abortion, cigarette smoking, fetal sex, low maternal weight, fetal-to-placenta weight, and post date pregnancy were not significantly associated with unexplained fetal deaths. CONCLUSION: Several factors were identified that are associated with an increased risk of unexplained fetal deaths."
11151349,"Work behavior among older men approaching or following retirement has received considerable research attention over the past two decades, but research on older women's work behavior is still in its incipient stage. Based on data from the 1982 New Beneficiary Survey (NBS) and the 1991 New Beneficiary Follow-up (NBF), this study analyzes the extent and determinants of employment among women who received their first Social Security benefits between 1980 and 1981. More than one fourth of the women continued to work or rejoined the labor force following their first Social Security benefit receipt. Financial need was found to be the primary reason for and the most significant determinant of women's continuing work or (re)entry into the labor force. But the level of education, health, spouse's work status, and previous work history were also found to be significant determinants of the likelihood and duration of their employment following Social Security receipt."
15571622,"BACKGROUND: Malnutrition in children can be a consequence of unfavourable socioeconomic conditions. However, some families maintain adequate nutritional status in their children despite living in poverty. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether family-related factors are determinants of stunting in young Mexican children living in extreme poverty, and whether these factors differ between rural or urban contexts. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in one rural and one urban extreme poverty level areas in Mexico. Cases comprised stunted children aged between 6 and 23 months. Controls were well-nourished children. Independent variables were defined in five dimensions: family characteristics; family income; household allocation of resources and family organisation; social networks; and child health care. Information was collected from 108 cases and 139 controls in the rural area and from 198 cases and 211 controls in the urban area. Statistical analysis was carried out separately for each area; unconditional multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to obtain the best explanatory model for stunting. RESULTS: In the rural area, a greater risk of stunting was associated with father's occupation as farmer and the presence of family networks for child care. The greatest protective effect was found in children cared for exclusively by their mothers. In the urban area, risk factors for stunting were father with unstable job, presence of small social networks, low rate of attendance to the Well Child Program activities, breast-feeding longer than six months, and two variables within the family characteristics dimension (longer duration of parents' union and migration from rural to urban area). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the influence of the family on the nutritional status of children under two years of age living in extreme poverty areas. Factors associated with stunting were different in rural and urban communities.Therefore, developing and implementing health programs to tackle malnutrition should take into account such differences that are consequence of the social, economic, and cultural contexts in which the family lives."
16848898,"BACKGROUND: Although there has been concern about the levels of carbon monoxide exposure, particularly among older people, little is known about COHb levels and their determinants in the general population. We examined these issues in a study of older British men. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 4252 men aged 60-79 years selected from one socially representative general practice in each of 24 British towns and who attended for examination between 1998 and 2000. Blood samples were measured for COHb and information on social, household and individual factors assessed by questionnaire. Analyses were based on 3603 men measured in or close to (< 10 miles) their place of residence. RESULTS: The COHb distribution was positively skewed. Geometric mean COHb level was 0.46% and the median 0.50%; 9.2% of men had a COHb level of 2.5% or more and 0.1% of subjects had a level of 7.5% or more. Factors which were independently related to mean COHb level included season (highest in autumn and winter), region (highest in Northern England), gas cooking (slight increase) and central heating (slight decrease) and active smoking, the strongest determinant. Mean COHb levels were more than ten times greater in men smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day (3.29%) compared with non-smokers (0.32%); almost all subjects with COHb levels of 2.5% and above were smokers (93%). Pipe and cigar smoking was associated with more modest increases in COHb level. Passive cigarette smoking exposure had no independent association with COHb after adjustment for other factors. Active smoking accounted for 41% of variance in COHb level and all factors together for 47%. CONCLUSION: An appreciable proportion of men have COHb levels of 2.5% or more at which symptomatic effects may occur, though very high levels are uncommon. The results confirm that smoking (particularly cigarette smoking) is the dominant influence on COHb levels."
15714217,"OBJECTIVE: To outline the rationale, objectives and strategies used in a systematically designed research programmme to study specific weight gain-inducing behaviours, their social-psychological as well as environmental determinants, and the effects of interventions aimed at the prevention of weight gain. DESIGN: The evidence for potential behavioural determinants and strategies to prevent weight gain was reviewed, and the methods applied within the Netherlands Research programme weight gain prevention (NHF-NRG) project were described. The project is designed according to the Intervention Mapping protocol. SETTING: The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: The main target groups are (a) adolescents (12-16 y) in secondary school, (b) young adults (20-40 y) at the workplace and (c) recently retired people (55-65 y) at home. INTERVENTIONS: Each intervention includes an individual component, in which computer-tailored information is provided. Additionally, interventions are aimed at changing environmental components. RESULTS: The short-term results of this project can be expected by the beginning of 2005. Guidelines for nationwide weight gain prevention, based on this research programme, will become available in 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the few interventions that were evaluated to date, no robust conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of obesity prevention. The systematic and multidisciplinary design of the NHF-NRG programme enables the identification of potentially effective methods and strategies for the prevention of weight gain."
12345040,"""The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of socio-cultural organization on both desired and completed fertility of a group of married women in Ezibeleni township in the Transkei. Among the socio-cultural factors examined were religion, education, labour force participation, age, age at marriage, duration of marriage, birth and marriage cohorts etc. We found sufficient evidence to support the contention that childbearing is a fundamentally social behaviour. On the whole, families tend to be large in the township. The higher a woman's socio-economic status, the smaller the size of her family. Contrary to existing findings, age at marriage is positively associated with achieved family size, while the timing of entry into a marital union is negatively associated with desired family size. Finally, fertility desires have been changing over the years with the younger generation of wives desiring smaller family sizes compared to the older generation."" (SUMMARY IN AFR)"
9246691,"This multilevel study of spatial variability in, and determinants of, birthweight was conducted using individual and ecological data in a geographically defined prospective birth cohort for 1986 in northern Finland. The study area comprises three large areas defined by latitude: Northern Lapland (NL), Southern Lapland (SL) and Oulu province (OP), comprising 74 localities with a total study population of 9216 singleton births. The mean birthweight was 3482 g for NL, 3537 g for SL and 3587 g for OP (NL vs. OP and SL vs. OP: P < 0.05). The crude rate for stillbirths was highest in NL. The women in the northernmost area were socially less privileged and the localities less prosperous compared with those in the southernmost area. Significant spatial clustering of mean birthweights was found (P = 0.0016), with highest birthweight in the south-western part of the study area. A variable expressing the wealth of each locality, the financial capacity category (FCC), had its lowest mean value in NL, with a range of one to six for the localities studied here. A multilevel multiple regression model showed that, after allowing for sex, gestational age, mother's age, height and hypertensive disorders, parity, body mass index, previous low birthweight child and smoking as individual determinants of birthweight, part of the residual variation could be explained by the locality wealth parameter. Using the multilevel model, the differences in mean birthweight across the three latitude areas persisted but were reduced (difference OP vs. NL reduced from 105 g to 86.5 g). The relationship between birthweight and FCC was inverse U-shaped with the highest mean birthweight estimated for localities occurring in the middle of the range (FCC = 3). The wealthiest urban localities (FCC = 6) and the most deprived localities (FCC = 1) both had a predicted birthweight about 60 g below the maximum at FCC = 3, if all other factors were held constant. This result, taken together with the spatial clustering of birthweights, suggests that there may be important social and environmental determinants of birthweight that have yet to be identified."
9530898,"The present study examined the correlates of consistent condom use among African-American women and prospectively evaluated the stability of these significant variables to predict consistent condom use at 3-month follow-up. A sample of 128 African-American women, 18-29 years of age completed a baseline interview and 3 months later completed a similar follow-up interview (n = 100). Compared to women who were inconsistent condom users, women who were consistent condom users were more likely to: have high assertive communication skills (OR=13), desire not becoming pregnant (OR=8.6), have high sexual self-control over condom use (OR=7.6), perceive having control over their partners' use of condoms (OR=6.6), be younger (OR=5.8), and report having a partner that was not committed to the relationship (OR=3.3). Prospective analyses identified baseline level of condom use as the best predictor of condom use at 3-month follow-up. Women who were consistent condom users at baseline were 6.3 times as likely to be consistent condom users at 3-month follow-up. In conclusion, HIV prevention programmes for women need to be gender specific and need to be implemented before high-risk behaviours are established and may be more difficult to modify."
10120999,"Coronary heart disease deaths have declined in New Zealand, as in other Western countries, during the past two decades. This is probably due to a combination of population lifestyle changes and improved treatment of the disease. However, the social class gradient for coronary disease has reversed and it is now more common in lower socio-economic groups who are increasingly disadvantaged in our community. Socioeconomic factors are powerful, primary determinants not only of coronary disease but also of many of the other health problems outlined in the New Zealand Health Charter. Policy making and health services delivery shape societal conditions essential for true health. These factors are considered in relation to the spectrum of human communication and the current transitional changes in our health system."
15595508,"Research on the social determinants of health has increasingly sought to understand the relative importance of different features of socioeconomic status. Much of the ensuing debate has wavered between education and income, with recent research leaning increasingly toward income. This research has not, however, consistently explored interactions between different features of socioeconomic status and, in trying to understand the independent effects of different components of socioeconomic status, may have missed important features of socioeconomic position. With an eye toward examining how features of socioeconomic status combine and coalesce, this paper examines variation in the income-health association by level of education. Theories derived both from medical sociology and health economics suggest synergistic interactions between income and education, but they are unclear as to the direction and magnitude of these interactions. Results from two large and nationally representative data sets (the 1996-1997 Community Tracking Study and the 1972-2000 General Social Survey) indicate that the positive relationship between income and health varies substantially in both its strength and shape by level of education. Education improves health, and its effects are larger at lower levels of income. Moreover, education reduces the strength and curvature of the income-health relationship. Consequently, those with more education have better health for all levels of income, and fewer income-based disparities exist among the well educated than among the less well educated. The linear ""gradient"" relationship between income and health is, thus, more characteristic of groups with higher levels of education. Additional analyses indicate that these interactions existed in the United States in each of the last three decades. The results are discussed in light of theory regarding the perpetuation of health disparities, as well as current debates regarding the apparent incompatibility of distributive versus aggregative goals in health policy."
16449588,"In 1975, New York City experienced a fiscal crisis rooted in long-term political and economic changes in the city. Budget and policy decisions designed to alleviate this fiscal crisis contributed to the subsequent epidemics of tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and homicide in New York City. Because these conditions share underlying social determinants, we consider them a syndemic, i.e., all 3 combined to create an excess disease burden on the population. Cuts in services; the dismantling of health, public safety, and social service infrastructures; and the deterioration of living conditions for vulnerable populations contributed to the amplification of these health conditions over 2 decades. We estimate that the costs incurred in controlling these epidemics exceeded 50 billion US dollars (in 2004 dollars); in contrast, the overall budgetary saving during the fiscal crisis was 10 billion US dollars. This history has implications for public health professionals who must respond to current perceptions of local fiscal crises."
17908738,"OBJECTIVES: The differences between child self-reports and parent proxy reports of quality of life in a large population of children with cerebral palsy were studied. We examined whether child characteristics, severity of impairment, socioeconomic factors, and parental stress were associated with parent proxy reports being respectively higher or lower than child self-reports of quality of life. METHODS: This study was conducted in 2004-2005 and assessed child quality of life (using the Kidscreen questionnaire, 10 domains, each scored 0-100) through self-reports and parent proxy reports of 500 children aged 8 to 12 years who had cerebral palsy and were living in 7 countries in Europe. RESULTS: The mean child-reported scores of quality of life were significantly higher than the parent proxy reports in 8 domains, significantly lower for the finances domain, and similar for the emotions domain. The average frequency of disagreement (child-parent difference greater than half an SD of child scores) over all domains was 64%, with parents rating their child's quality of life lower than the children themselves in 29% to 57% of child-parent pairs. We found that high levels of stress in parenting negatively influenced parents' perception of their child's quality of life, whereas the main factor explaining parents' ratings of children's quality of life higher than the children themselves is self-reported severe child pain. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the factors associated with disagreement are different according to the direction of disagreement. In particular, parental well-being and child pain should be taken into account in the interpretation of parent proxy reports, especially when no child self-report of quality of life is available. In the latter cases, it may be advisable to obtain additional proxy reports (from caregivers, teachers, or clinicians) to obtain complementary information on the child's quality of life."
17348755,"Health inequalities are no longer an issue only for developed countries. In recent years there is agreement that all countries present health inequalities regardless of their level of wealth. In low-income countries and especially in sub-Saharan Africa where the majority of the poor people live as well as their children, research on child health inequalities is still scarce. This review of evidence suggests that if Mozambique is to achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs) by 2015 further research on important determinants of disparities in child mortality is urgently needed."
11299268,"An autosomal genomewide search for genes related to body composition and its changes after a 20-wk endurance-exercise training program has been completed in the HERITAGE Family Study. Phenotypes included body mass index (BMI), sum of eight skinfold thicknesses, fat mass (FM), fat-free mass, percent body fat (%Fat), and plasma leptin levels. A maximum of 364 sib-pairs from 99 Caucasian families was studied with the use of 344 markers with single-point and multipoint linkage analyses. Evidence of significant linkage was observed for changes in fat-free mass with the S100A and the insulin-like growth factor I genes (P = 0.0001). Suggestive evidence (2.0 < or = Lod < 3.0; 0.0001 < P < or = 0.001) was also observed for the changes in FM and %Fat at 1q31 and 18q21-q23, in %Fat with the uncoupling protein 2 and 3 genes, and in BMI at 5q14-q21. At baseline, suggestive evidence was observed for BMI at 8q23-q24, 10p15, and 14q11; for FM at 14q11; and for plasma leptin levels with the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene. This is the first genomic scan on genes involved in exercise-training-induced changes in body composition that could provide information on the determinants of weight loss."
10924032,"The future of social medicine is based on 150 years of history and the rapidly evolving context within which medicine functions in modern societies. There are two views of social medicine. One is based on the vision of Guerin and, particularly, Virchow 150 years ago that: ""Doctors are the natural advocates of the poor, and social problems are largely within their jurisdiction."" The New York Academy of Medicine's Institute on Social Medicine 50 years ago reflected this broad view. Medicine, however, enamored of the biomedical paradigm and the advances in knowledge through biomedical research, largely abandoned this broad perspective, even as the knowledge about the social, behavioral, and environmental determinants of health was advancing rapidly. A second view of social medicine, and one that has influenced many in the past 30 years, was defined by McKeown and Lowe: ""Social medicine is concerned with a body of knowledge and methods of obtaining knowledge appropriate to a discipline. This discipline may be said to comprise (a) epidemiology, and (b) the study of the medical needs of society, or in the contemporary short hand medical care."" Social medicine, in my view, includes not only the definition of McKeown and Lowe, but the broader context within which medicine fits in society. The context is changing. The social contract as defined by Bismarck and Beveridge has to be redefined. Just as the New York Academy of Medicine provided the vision of social medicine 50 years ago, the Academy has given us a new vision with the publication of Medicine and Public Health: the Power of Collaboration in 1997. Authored by Dr. Roz Lasker, director of the Academy's Division of Public Health, the book identifies the key changes required by medicine and public health to advance the goals of medicine and public health for the benefit of both individual patients and the population as a whole. The book points the way for the future of social medicine by identifying not only what needs to be done, but also how to do it."
17077436,"BACKGROUND: Despite considerable research investigating the relationship between a long duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and outcomes, there has been much less considering predictors of a long DUP. AIMS: To investigate the clinical and social determinants of DUP in a large sample of patients with a first episode of psychosis. METHOD: All patients with a first episode of psychosis who made contact with psychiatric services over a 2-year period and were living in defined catchment areas in London and Nottingham, UK were included in the AESOP study. Data relating to clinical and social variables and to DUP were collected from patients, relatives and case notes. RESULTS: An insidious mode of onset was associated with a substantially longer DUP compared with an acute onset, independent of other factors. Unemployment had a similar, if less strong, effect. Conversely, family involvement in help-seeking was independently associated with a shorter duration. There was weak evidence that durations were longer in London than in Nottingham. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that DUP is influenced both by aspects of the early clinical course and by the social context."
10220021,"This paper explores aspects of the social production of health by focussing on the ways in which levels of health are shaped by structures of social inequality and behaviors or 'lifestyles'. We address two questions: What is the relative importance of the social, structural and behavioral determinants of health? And, are there gender differences in the determinants of health? These questions are explored using multiple regression analyses of data from the 1994 Canadian National Population Health Survey. Two measures of health are used: subjective health status and the Health Utilities Index (a measure of functional health status). By structural determinants we refer to age, family structure, main activity, education, occupation, income and social support. Behavioral determinants include lifestyle factors related to smoking, drinking, weight and physical activity. Findings indicate that the structures of social inequality are the most important determinants of health acting both independently and through their influence on the behavioral determinants of health. There are very real differences in the factors that predict women's and men's health. For women, social structural factors appear to play a more important role in determining health. Being in the highest income category, working full-time and caring for a family and having social support are more important predictors of good health for women than men. Smoking and alcohol consumption are more important determinants of health status for men than women, while body weight and being physically inactive are more important for women than men. Our findings suggest the value of models which include a wide range of structural and behavioral variables and affirm the importance of looking more closely at gender differences in the determinants of health."
10212524,"A study was made of stress factors experienced by primary school teachers in Zambia after they had attended a course on stress management and counselling skills. Their pupils were significantly affected by poverty, death and illness of parents, fellow-pupils and teachers, teenage sex and pregnancy, violence in the home and, among girls, low self-esteem. The HIV epidemic had a major bearing on these factors, and there were wide-ranging effects on the teachers' own lives. Despite the training they had been given, many teachers felt that they could not adequately counsel their pupils on these matters. The teachers were in need of continuing support and training to enable them to cope with this aspect of their work."
9878916,"This study aimed to describe the amount of (and trends in) violent deaths in the city of Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, and to analyze their determinants. The article presents the spatial distribution of these deaths for the year 1991 and the differences regarding sex, age, and place of occurrence. It also analyzes the potential role of a series of socioeconomic factors, used as indicators of the population's living conditions. An exploratory ecological study was conducted to compare various groups. In 1991 there were a total of 1181 violent deaths in Recife. The study points to an overall mortality rate from external causes of 90.9/ 100,000 inhabitants. The two age groups 10-39 years and 60 years and over were those at highest risk of death. Males showed excess mortality in all age groups. The most important specific causes of death were homicides and traffic accidents, with 51.3% and 23.4%, respectively, of all violent deaths. The authors discuss the differences in the mortality rate from external causes in different social areas, defined according to living conditions and their relationship to the history of the development of Recife."
12718455,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the influence of rates of general practitioner visits on rates of hospitalisations. DESIGN: Ecological cross-sectional study of factors influencing hospitalisation rates. Aggregated data on primary care centre area level. SETTING: The county of Ostergotland, Sweden, with 3 hospital districts and 41 primary health care centres, and the hospital district of Jonkoping in the county of Jonkoping, Sweden, with 11 primary health care centres. OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospitalisation rates. RESULTS: Age and rates of outpatient hospital visits were the most important factors explaining the variation in rates of hospitalisations between the primary health care centre areas. Hospital districts, socioeconomic factors and rates of GP visits also influenced the rates of hospitalisations. CONCLUSION: When evaluating the influence of primary health care on the rates of hospitalisations, both socioeconomic factors and health care structure must be taken into consideration. Doing this, the rates of GP visits correlated negatively with the rates of hospitalisations."
12800890,"The authors examine the prevalence and patterns of perceived discrimination in the U.S. health care system and examine social status variables as determinants, using data from the Commonwealth Fund's Minority Health Survey. The primary social status groups of interest are age, race, ethnicity, social class, sex, and health status. Each social status category placed respondents at greater risk of perceiving discrimination based on the corresponding source of discrimination. That is, younger respondents were more likely to perceive age discrimination than were older respondents. African Americans and Hispanics perceived more race discrimination than whites. Low-income individuals experienced class discrimination, women experienced sex discrimination, and individuals who reported being in poor health were more likely to perceive discrimination based on health or disability status."
17016900,"Caregiving is a demanding responsibility. Because of the de-institutionalization movement, much of the care provided by hospitals has been shifted to the community. Caregivers' issues cannot be overlooked. The purposes of the study are: (a) to understand meaning of caregiving, perceived social support and level of depression of caregivers during the transition phase immediately following a family members' discharge from the hospital to the community; (b) to determine the association between determinants and meaning of caregiving, perceived social support level of depression; (c) to determine the association between meaning of caregiving, perceived social support level of depression. Fifty five caregivers of schizophrenic patients were recruited from a private hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. Certain characteristics of caregivers were found to be associated with lower levels of depression, meaning of caregiving and perceived social support. Perceived social support was shown to be a mediator between the meaning of caregiving and caregivers' level of depression. Despite the small sample size, the findings can serve as a reference for mental health professionals as they develop mental health care program for patients and also for caregivers."

Offering an interpretative synthesis, it emphasizes the way first generation immigrants to the United States fuse together the old and new to create a new kind of family life. The family is seen as a place where there is a dynamic interplay between structure, culture, and agency. New immigrant family patterns are shaped by cultural meanings and social practices immigrants bring with them from their home countries as well as social, economic and cultural forces in the United States."""
9989428,"Primate and human parenting have often been viewed as completely emancipated from neuroendocrine influences and primarily dependent on experience, social and cognitive processes. A review of recent findings of primate research on the neurobiological regulation of parental responsiveness, the causes of variability in parenting styles, and the determinants of infant abuse suggests that primate parenting is more sensitive to neuroendocrine mechanisms than previously thought. The findings of primate research can have important implications for human research and encourage the investigation of biological influences on human parenting."
9243430,"BACKGROUND: The Government's policy of Changing childbirth gives priority to user-oriented outcomes, such as continuity of carer. It has been assumed that the organization (or pattern) of maternity care is the main determinant of continuity, with relatively little attention paid to sociodemographic factors. The aim of this study was to assess the relative contribution of social class, spoken language and pattern of care in determining continuity of carer. METHOD: Postal questionnaires were sent 14 days after delivery to East London and the City Health Authority residents delivering within a three-week period in May 1994. Bilingual interviews were carried out for non-English-speaking women. Pattern of care was assigned by the midwife as either hospital or community (including team based care, 'domino' and home births). The main outcome measure was self-reported continuity of carer in antenatal, delivery and postnatal care. RESULTS: The response rate was 69 per cent (370/533). The community pattern of care affected only antenatal continuity (62 per cent community vs 50 per cent hospital, p < 0.05). Women whose main spoken language was English or whose social class was I-IIIn reported higher levels of continuity at each phase of care, although this effect was largely confined to the community pattern of care. The odds ratios (95 per cent confidence intervals) for the effect of social class (I-IIIn vs other) on antenatal, labour and postnatal continuity within the community pattern of care were 3.64 (1.09-12.18), 3.08 (1.09-8.74) and 4.93 (1.48-16.46), respectively. CONCLUSION: Spoken English and high social class were associated with continuity of carer, although this effect was mainly confined to women with a community pattern of care. Achievement of national targets for continuity of carer may not be possible in east London without explicit consideration of sociodemographic factors."
12867350,"Young adults are often in periods of transition, and lifestyle changes such as a decline in physical activity can occur during this period. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between demographic, biologic, lifestyle, social support index, environmental factors, and physical activity in young adults. The participants were 4,152 young adults from 18 to 30 years of age enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). A moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) score was calculated from responses to nine activities and up to four activities not previously listed. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between MVPA and independent variables separately for men and women. Non-Hispanic Blacks were more active than non-Hispanic White or Mexican American men, whereas, among women, non-Hispanic Whites were more active. Education, social support index, and trying to lose weight were positively associated with MVPA, whereas being married was inversely related in both men and women. Among women, those who were unemployed, in better health, had smaller families, had lower body mass indexes (BMIs), and were not from the South had higher MVPA. Men who were in school during the past 12 months were more active than those who were not in school. The results from this study suggest that demographic and social factors are important determinants of physical activity in young adults and should be considered when planning interventions."
19967219,"This study analyzes meanings that health workers attribute to DOTS and points out alternatives that contribute to its performance. After the Research Ethics Committee approved the project, a semi-structured interview was applied to 15 health workers from the central region of the city of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil between August and December 2004. This study used hermeneutic-dialectic reference and the theory of social determinants of the health-disease process. DOTS contributes to treatment adherence and promotes interfacing in encounters and conversations between workers and users at the institutional and territorial levels, which permits identifying health needs and implementing appropriate interventions. One of the main challenges to its implementation is to become a space that enables grasping, decoding and reconstructing meanings in relation to the health-disease process including the treatment and life projects of patients with tuberculosis."
8263246,"This paper commences by observing that psychiatric nurses tend not to interact with their clients in a therapeutic fashion. It is not clear, however, whether this is due to the nature of psychiatric institutions or to the attitudes of individual nurses. Contrasting social theories which posit either the importance of social structures, or of individual interpretations as determinants of behaviour, are outlined. These are then applied to the problem of psychiatric nursing practice. It is argued that while there are strengths in both theoretical positions, neither on their own can adequately characterize the complexity of the problem. Rather than attempting to explain influences upon psychiatric nursing practice in terms of either structure or action, we should appreciate the importance of, and relationship between, both factors. Given the rapid changes occurring in mental health nursing, research into factors influencing practice will become increasingly important. In order to explain developments adequately, researchers will need to take account of the duality of structure and action."

Pivoting on social, environmental and economic aspects of food chain sustainability, this paper presents the concept of sustainable food safety based on the prevention of risks and burden of poor health for generations to come. Under this respect, the assessment of long-term, transgenerational risks is still hampered by serious scientific uncertainties. Critical issues to the development of a sustainable food safety framework may include: endocrine disrupters as emerging contaminants that specifically target developing organisms; toxicological risks assessment in Countries at the turning point of development; translating knowledge into toxicity indexes to support risk management approaches, such as hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP); the interplay between chemical hazards and social determinants. Efforts towards the comprehensive knowledge and management of key factors of sustainable food safety appear critical to the effectiveness of the overall sustainability policies."
18079335,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Previous studies of neighbourhood effects on ischaemic heart disease (IHD) have used census or administrative data to characterise the residential context, most commonly its socioeconomic level. Using the ecometric approach to define neighbourhood social interaction variables that may be relevant to IHD, neighbourhood social cohesion and safety were examined to see how they related to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality, after adjustment for individual and neighbourhood confounders. DESIGN: To construct social interaction variables, multilevel models were used to aggregate individual perceptions of safety and cohesion at the neighbourhood level. Linking data from the Health Survey in Scania, Sweden, and the Population, Hospital, and Mortality Registers, multilevel survival models were used to investigate determinants of AMI mortality over a three year and nine month period. PARTICIPANTS: 7791 Individuals aged 45 years and over. MAIN RESULTS: The rate of AMI mortality increased with decreasing neighbourhood safety and cohesion. After adjustment for individual health and socioeconomic variables, low neighbourhood cohesion, and to a lesser extent low safety, were associated with higher AMI mortality. Neighbourhood cohesion effects persisted after adjustment for various neighbourhood confounding factors (income, population density, percentage of residents from low-income countries, residential stability) and distance to the hospital. There was some evidence that neighbourhood cohesion effects on AMI mortality were caused by effects on one-day case-fatality, rather than on incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond commonly evoked effects of the physical environment, neighbourhood social interaction patterns may have a decisive influence on IHD, with a particularly strong effect on survival after AMI."
1469676,"The beginning of the 1980s saw the birth of Zimbabwe as a result of a protracted liberation war. It coincided with global interest in primary health care, the concept of universal primary school education and, unfortunately, moves towards economic stabilization and structural adjustment programmes. Economic structural adjustment was adopted by several sub Saharan African countries with dire consequences for the poor and vulnerable. Zimbabwe's commitment to social justice and to equitable distribution of resources demonstrated a practical move away from the culture of rhetoric so characteristic of many governments and non-governmental organisations and agencies. This commitment has been translated into impressive improvements in health and education. Current evidence shows that education has had a positive impact on health and related areas like contraceptive use, child mortality and the nutrition status of children. Conversely nutrition and health conditions among school children are important determinants of educational outcomes. Hitherto Zimbabwe's economy has been sufficiently strong to avoid excessive dependence on the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other foreign financial institutions. Unfortunately, however, the current economic recession together with economic structural adjustment programmes are beginning to have a negative impact on health and education. Will true synergism between health and education weather these structural problems? It seems that the people and government of Zimbabwe have the capacity and resolve to weather such a storm."
10336022,"On the basis of MEDLINE and manual searches, we examined the main papers in the English literature regarding risk factors for spontaneous (i.e. not related to fertility drug use) multiple births. The constant frequency of monozygotic (MZ) pregnancies over time and in different geographical areas suggests that the determination of MZ twins is largely unchanged over time, and that a genetic mechanism may have a role. In contrast, temporal and geographical trends observed in dizygotic (DZ) pregnancies suggest that environmental factors play a role in determining this condition. At present, maternal age and hereditary components are the best-defined determinants for spontaneous multiple births."
16533108,"This article reviews the historical development of population health indicators. We have long known that environmental, socioeconomic, early life conditions, individual actions, and medical care all interact to affect health. Present quantitative reporting on the impact of these factors on population health grew out of Bills of Mortality published in the 1500s. Since then, regular censuses, civil registration of vital statistics, and international classification systems have improved data quality and comparability. Regular national health interview surveys and application of administrative data contributed information on morbidity, health services use, and some social determinants of health. More recently, traditional health databases and datasets on ""nonhealth"" sector determinants have been linked. Statistical methods for map-making, risk adjustment, multilevel analysis, calculating population-attributable risks, and summary measures of population health have further helped to integrate information. Reports on the health of populations remain largely confined to focused areas. This paper suggests a conceptual framework for using indicators to report on all the domains of population health. Future ethical development of indicators will incorporate principles of justice, transparency, and effectiveness."
7898955,"The article analyses the evolution of knowledge and rationale of control of a special case of malaria transmission based on Bromelia-Kerteszia complex. Since bromeliaceae function as a 'host of the carrier' and were previously associated with natural forests, the elucidation of bromeliad malaria historically elicited controversies concerning the imputation of Kertesziae as transmitters as well as over control strategies directed to bromelia eradication (manual removal, herbicides and deforestation), use of insecticides and chemoprophylaxis. Established authority, disciplinary traditions, conceptual premises and contemporary criteria for validating knowledge in the field partly explain the long time gap since Adolpho Lutz announced at the beginning of the century the existence of a new mosquito and breeding site as responsible for a 'forest malaria' epidemic occurring at a high altitude. The article brings attention to how economic, political and institutional determinants played an important role in redefining studies that led both in Trinidad and Brazil to the recognition of the importance of kerteszia transmission, including urban areas, and establishing new approaches to its study, most relevant of all the concurrence of broad ecological research. The article then describes the Brazilian campaign strategies which showed significant short-term results but had to wait four decades to achieve the goal of eradication due to the peculiar characteristics of this pathogenic complex. Finally, it brings attention to the importance of encompassing social values and discourses, in this case, environmental preservation, to understanding historical trends of malaria control programs."
20003516,"Social determinants of health describe the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age and their influence on health. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels, which are themselves influenced by policy choices. Armed conflict and forced displacement are important influences on the social determinants of health. There is limited evidence on the social determinants of health of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have been forced from their homes due to armed conflict but remain within the borders of their country. The aim of this study was to explore the social determinants of overall physical and mental health of IDPs, including the response strategies used by IDPs to support their health needs. Northern Uganda was chosen as a case-study, and 21 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with IDPs were conducted in fifteen IDP camps between November and December 2006.The findings indicated a number of key social determinants. Experiencing traumatic events could cause ""over thinking"" which in turn could lead to ""madness"" and physical ailments. Respondents also attributed ""over thinking"" to the spirit (cen) of a killed person returning to disturb its killer. Other social determinants included overcrowding which affected physical health and contributed to an emotional sense of loss of freedom; and poverty and loss of land which affected physical health from lack of food and income, and mental health because of worry and uncertainty. Respondents also commented on how the conflict and displacement and led to changes in social and cultural norms such as increased ""adultery"", ""defilement"", and ""thieving"". Response strategies included a combination of biopsychosocial health services, traditional practices, religion, family and friends, and isolating.This study supports work exploring the political, environmental, economic, and socio-cultural determinants of health of IDPs. Addressing these determinants is essential to fundamentally improving the overall physical and mental health of IDPs."
1459678,"In 1985-86, 286 underfive deaths occurred among a population of 30,000 in a rural area of Haryana. Two hundred and eighty one were analysed for socio-biological factors related to under five mortality. Females had a higher mortality. About 2/3 of the deaths were in infants, and 90% in first 3 years. Most of the deaths (94%) occurred in the village itself, 58.4% did not seek any medical care during the terminal illness, 80-90% did not receive even a single dose of BCG, DPT or O.P.V., and 36.7% died in the first attack of illness. Though 68% had at least one episode earlier, 31.0% had been admitted in hospitals for an earlier episode of illness. In 42.8% of deaths, the birth order was IV or above. Deaths in socially and economically disadvantaged cases constituted 77.6%. The triad of diarrhea, ARI and malnutrition claimed 56% deaths. In 93% of the deaths, the mothers were illiterate and 96.4% were house wives. There was a sibling death earlier in the family in 78.3%, and 60.1% deaths were of those living in poor housing conditions. About 50% had radio for communication, 85.8% had bicycle for conveyance, and in 66.9% the family had piped water supply. All these findings have been discussed in the study."
18931911,"There are limited validated quantitative assessment methods to measure features of the built and social environment that might form the basis for environmental preventive interventions. This study describes a model approach for epidemiologic assessment of suspected environmental determinants of violence, alcohol and other drug (VAOD) exposure and fills this gap in current research. The investigation sought to test the feasibility of a systematic and longitudinal assessment of residential block characteristics related to physical and social disorder and indicators of VAOD exposure. Planometric data were used to establish a stratified random sample of street segments within defined neighborhoods of an urban metropolitan area. Field rater assessments of these neighborhood street segments were conducted using the Neighborhood Inventory for Environmental Typology (NIfETy). This report provides a detailed description of the NIfETy Method, including metric properties of the NIfETy Instrument and outcomes of training procedures and quality control measures. Also presented are block-level characteristics and estimates of observable signs of VAOD activity. This work is a first step toward developing future community-level environmental preventive interventions geared to reduce community VAOD exposure among youthful urban populations and may prove to be useful to other public health research groups as well."
2185515,"This chapter presents a review and discussion of the dynamic relationship between drug use, especially the use of illicit drugs, and its social covariates from the period of adolescence to young adulthood. The discussion is based primarily on longitudinal studies. In particular, I include a review and discussion of my collaborative studies with Kandel, in which we employ life-course perspectives for the analysis of natural drug and life histories of individuals based on event-history models. Specifically, I discuss five covariates: (1) age, (2) onset age of drug use, (3) historical period, (4) family and work roles, and (5) influence of significant others, with the dynamic interdependence between drug use and family and work roles as the major topic of discussion. The discussion also includes some insights into the issue of causation vs. selection effects regarding the influence of drug use on life-course pattern, and presents a novel aspect of indirect effects in the analysis of the determinants of drug use progression."
8913996,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if alcohol-related measures (per capita consumption, drinking-driving arrest rate, alcohol abuse treatment rate and Alcoholics Anonymous [AA] membership rate) were related to differences between states in traffic fatality rates (total and alcohol-related). METHOD: Fatality rates were regressed onto the alcohol-related variables, using state level data for 1982 and 1990 as well as measures of relative change between the 2 years. RESULTS: Fatality rates demonstrated significant positive relationships with per capita consumption and drinking-driving arrest rates, and significant negative relationships with AA membership rates, for the years 1982 and 1990. Also, changes in per capita consumption were significantly and positively related to changes in both traffic fatality measures. CONCLUSIONS: Per capita alcohol consumption measures were the strongest and most consistent determinants of traffic fatality measures. The negative relationship between AA membership rates and traffic fatality measures for 1982 and 1990 suggests a beneficial impact of AA on these measures at the aggregate level, although other explanations are possible."
8404749,"In an incidence cohort, remission and relapse rates and determinants were studied in 178 patients followed long-term. A comparative study of predictive factors was performed in 40 patients with histories of antiepileptic (AED)-drug-refractory epileptic seizures in the last 10 years of follow-up and compared with the other 138 cohort subjects. The two groups were cross-tabulated with 353 variables of family history, obstetric, developmental and seizure histories, and current medical and social status. Multivariate analyses were applied for control of confounding. Defined or probable remote symptomatic etiology of seizures, abnormal neurologic development/status, high initial seizure frequency, occurrence of status epilepticus, and poor short-term effects of AED therapy were significantly associated with long-term AED refractoriness. On logistic regression analyses, poor short-term outcome of AED therapy [odds ratio (OR) 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-10.4], occurrence of status epilepticus (OR 11.4; 95% CI 3.2-41.0), high initial seizure frequency (OR 4.6; 95% CI 1.1-19.3), and remote symptomatic seizure etiology (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.1-8.2) remained the only independent predictors of seizure intractability. These factors enable early assessment of need for epilepsy surgery."
19068150,"OBJECTIVE: Amidst a hunger-obesity paradox, the purpose of the present study was to examine the grocery shopping behaviour and food stamp usage of low-income women with children to identify factors influencing their food choices on a limited budget. DESIGN: Focus groups, which included questions based on Social Cognitive Theory constructs, examined food choice in the context of personal, behavioural and environmental factors. A quantitative grocery shopping activity required participants to prioritize food purchases from a 177-item list on a budget of $US 50 for a one-week period, an amount chosen based on the average household food stamp allotment in 2005. SUBJECTS: Ninety-two low-income women, with at least one child aged 9-13 years in their household, residing in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 37 years, and 76% were overweight or obese (BMI> or =25.0 kg/m2). Key findings suggest that their food choices and grocery shopping behaviour were shaped by not only individual and family preferences, but also their economic and environmental situation. Transportation and store accessibility were major determinants of shopping frequency, and they used various strategies to make their food dollars stretch (e.g. shopping based on prices, in-store specials). Generally, meat was the most important food group for purchase and consumption, according to both the qualitative and quantitative data. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve food budgeting skills, increase nutrition knowledge, and develop meal preparation strategies involving less meat and more fruits and vegetables, could be valuable in helping low-income families nutritionally make the best use of their food dollars."
19253847,"OBJECTIVE: To undertake a research into the maternal health care services and its determinants in poor regions in Sichuan province. METHODS: Stratified cluster sampling strategy was employed to select the participants who had pregnancy since 1998 to complete the interview administered ""maternal health care questionnaire"". A total of 462 women participated in the study. RESULTS: Of the 462 women, 387 received prenatal care services, the most common maternal health care services. Only 144 women got post-natal visits at least once. Maternal age and education had significant impacts on the use of maternal health care services including prenatal examinations and birth in hospitals (P<0.05). Low-income (< Yen 1000) women used less maternal health care services than the high-income (> Yen 5000) women (P<0.05). The women who were covered by the cooperative medical insurance scheme and poverty alleviation scheme used more prenatal care and post-natal services and were more likely to deliver babies in hospitals than those who paid the services entirely out of pocket (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Poor social and economical situation has a detrimental impact on the use of maternal health care services, which might be associated with poor education and low financial capacities of the women."
26815750,"INTRODUCTION: Due to remarkable improvements in emergency and intensive care medicine in the recent past, the mortality rate for severely injured patients is decreasing. Outcome research therefore should no longer focus only on questions of survival, but also on aspects of the quality of life after severe trauma. This study examined the long-term effect of different sociodemographic, economic, trauma, and hospital-related factors on the health-related quality of life (SF-36) of severely injured patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A written questionnaire was sent to 121 trauma patients who received treatment in two hospitals in Cologne/Northrhine-Westfalia between 1996 and 2001. The inclusion criteria were more than one injury and a sum of abbreviated injury score of the two worst injuries >/= 6. The response rate after using the total-design-method was 77.6% (n = 90). RESULTS: Severely injured patients showed significant reductions for all subscales of the SF-36, on average 4 years after discharge on average, in comparison to a German norm population. Specifically, aspects of the physical-component scale were dramatically reduced. Linear regressions controlling for time after discharge suggested that higher age, lower socioeconomic status, living together with a partner, and the severity of trauma and injury of extremities were significant predictors for a reduced quality of life, while satisfaction with the hospital stay had a positive effect. DISCUSSION: All in all, it is important to identify trauma- patients who will suffer a reduced quality of life. In so doing, it will be possible to take into account the specific circumstances of their recovery during medical treatment, care, and rehabilitation."
12799782,"BACKGROUND: Much has been written about the determinants of psychiatric hospitalisation, chiefly for psychotic patients in an emergency. This paper reports the results of a comparative study between in-patients and pathological subjects from the general population. The aim of this work is to evidence the psycho-social determinants of hospitalisation in a psychiatric department for neurotic disorders. METHODS: This study was conducted on a socially fairly privileged population which was, therefore, also fairly homogeneous. The subjects from the two groups were assessed clinically using standardised instruments both for diagnosis (SCAN) and for psycho-social variables (Stressful Life Events: LEDS; Social Support and Self-esteem: Pearlin checklist; care itinerary). RESULTS: Following the analysis of frequency and a multivariate logistic regression analysis, four risk factors for hospitalisation for neurotic disorders were evidenced, including: severity of neurotic disorders, taking a long time to consult a specialist after first onset of anxiety disorders, poor social support, and having experienced one or more provoking agents (Brown and Harris methodology) in the year previous to hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: The severity of the mental pathology is largely responsible for hospitalisation in neurotic patients as it is in psychotic patients, but it is not the only determinant for hospitalisation."
16078805,"In this article, we present an educational approach uniquely linked to humanitarian and peace-building goals in conflicted regions of the world. We examine the Canada International Scientific Exchange Program and its lead program, the Middle East Association for Managing Hearing Loss, as a case study. Under a Canadian umbrella, continuing medical education and continuous professional development are used to gather academics from regions in conflict for mutually beneficial professional activities. Larger scale international prospects for educational programming, extending beyond the health sector, are ways of addressing the primary determinants of health and creating social capital."
16633494,"It is as futile to ask how much of the phenotype of an organism is due to nature and how much to its nurture as it is to determine how much of the area of a rectangle is due to its length and how much to its height. Phenotype and area are joint products. The spectacular success of genomics, unfortunately, threatens to re-awaken belief in genes as the principal determinants of human behavior. This paper develops the thesis that gene expression is modified by environmental inputs and that the impact of the environment on a given organism is modified by its genome. Genes set the boundaries of the possible; environments parse out the actual."
19961261,"INTRODUCTION: A comprehensive literature review revealed a gap in health research regarding the determinants of good health for rural men in Jamaica. This study seeks to fill this void by examining cross-sectional survey data to model the social determinants of the self-reported good health status of rural men in Jamaica. METHOD: A sample of 5041 males (> or = 15 years) was extracted from a national cross-sectional survey of 25 018 respondents. A stratified random probability sampling technique was used to draw the sample. Data were stored, retrieved and analyzed using SPSS for Windows 16.0 (SPSS; Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to provide pertinent socio-demographic characteristics of the sample, and logistic regression was used to establish a predictive model for good self-reported health status in rural Jamaican males. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of rural men claimed that they had poor health, 4.9% had health insurance, 61.6% visited a healthcare practitioner, 96.0% purchased prescribed medications and 45.3% completed the course of prescribed medications. The social determinants of good health status of rural men in Jamaica are cost of medical care (OR = 0.916, 95% CI = 0.841-0.997); retirement income (OR = 0.0.382, 95% CI = 0.206-0.707); marital status: separated, divorced or widowed with reference to those never married (OR = 0.270, 95% CI = 0.178-0.410), and married with reference to never married men (OR = 0.465, 95% CI = 0.356-0.609); health insurance coverage (OR = 0.041, 95% CI = 0.027-0.063); number of children in household (OR = 1.200, 95% CI = 1.069-1.347); and number of durable goods owned (OR = 1.107, 95% CI = 1.050-1.166). CONCLUSION: Children continue to be not only futuristic assets to parents, but they also currently improve the health status of rural men."
14618012,"To study the pattern and determinants of health perception among Saudi elderly a cross-sectional house-hold survey of 6,139 elderly in Saudi Arabia performed between January 1994 and December 1995. A stratified two stage sampling technique was used to select the elderly subjects (60 years and above). Using a pre-designed, pre-tested questionnaire, the subjects' physical, mental, social and environmental health status and health perception were assessed via personal interviews completed by trained researchers. The poor health perception was predominant among females and more with advanced age (75 years and more). It was also found to be associated with more social and economical underprivileges, and independence as measured by an Activity of Daily Living (ADL) scale. Multivariate analysis revealed the most significant determinants of poor perception of health as follows: inability to perform prayers standing (OR = 3.36; p < 0.0000), and the number of diagnoses (OR = 3.33; p = 0.000). A significant correlation was found between hospital visits, number of diagnoses and health perception. These socio-demographic and socio-medical factors found to be important determinants of health perception among Saudi elderly need to be modified."
14686137,"Although relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient."
11565446,"OBJECTIVES: The negative health effects of cigarette smoking are nowadays well known. An important prerequisite for the implementation of rewarding health promotion campaigns aiming at reducing the tobacco dependency in the general population is the knowledge about smoking prevalences in different social population groups, and specific information about social factors and determinants influencing smoking behaviour. METHODS: In this regard, the Microcensus is a very valuable data source for Germany. Included in the present analysis are persons aged 18 years and older, which are present in the ""Microcensus Public Use File 1995"" and had answered the questions about their smoking behaviour (N = 186,424). The dependent study variable is current cigarette smoking. Independent study variables are sociodemographic factors (age, sex, family status), occupational status, unemployment, socio-economic situation and regional-specific variables (size of community, East vs West Germany). RESULTS: All together, 30.5% of the males and 18.0% of the females were current smokers. Significantly higher smoking rates were observed for persons living in metropolitan areas, persons with low educational achievement and low occupational status, for people being divorced, unemployed, and living on social welfare. In a second step, we analysed the cumulative effect of these social factors for current smoking status. In summary, it was found that the cumulation of social determinants explained a great part of the variance in smoking prevalence. Current smoking was four to six times more prevalent in population groups characterised by several unfavourable social conditions compared to more privilege population groups. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, smoking related prevention activities should be evaluated, among others, regarding their potential to reduce the social polarisation of the smoking epidemic."
10910423,"The authors examined the determinants and consequences of impaired functioning in older schizophrenic persons by adapting a model of impairment developed by Berkman and Gurland. The sample consisted of 117 persons age 55 or older with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia. In logistic-regression analysis, the overall model attained significance in predicting functional impairment, and three predictor variables-abnormal movements, use of antiparkinsonian agents, and negative symptoms-attained independent significance. Functional impairment had a direct effect on two of the seven resultant variables, community activities and self-health, and an indirect effect on two other resultant variables, depression and life satisfaction. Thus, the Berkman-Gurland Model has potential usefulness for exploring functioning impairment among older schizophrenic persons. Moreover, the variables that have the greatest impact on functional impairment are potentially remediable."
18556168,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this exploratory study was to test the applicability of a theoretical model to develop patient-related interventions. In this model knowledge, psychosocial mediators, self-efficacy and behaviour are determinants of patient-related interventions. METHODS: The model was tested on 278 patients with mild or moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recruited in a primary care setting. Hierarchical regression analyses were applied using data from self-reported questionnaires and clinical data from an electronic data registry. RESULTS: Knowledge, psychosocial mediators, self-efficacy and behaviour proved to be, to a moderate degree, predictors of outcomes in COPD care. Moreover, physical activity appeared to be a significant predictor for all clinical and functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: Theoretically expected associations of patient-related interventions are existent in patients with mild or moderate COPD. The application of theoretical models in designing patient-directed interventions in COPD care is therefore feasible. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: More attention should be paid to the patterns of physical activity in patients with mild to moderate COPD. The results of this study are also useful in the development of patient-related interventions. Future interventions should be designed along the lines of theory on behaviour change, such as social cognitive theory."
19923665,"BACKGROUND: Intersectoral action is now widely recognized as an effective approach to addressing the social determinants of health. In particular, collaboration between different sectors of the community has been recommended as a strategy for developing employment opportunities for persons diagnosed with mental illness. However, there is limited evidence on the actual implementation of intersectoral action between the employment and mental health sector. METHODS: Case study methodology was utilized to examine a unique partnership formed under the principles of public health and local development to create a social enterprise. Stakeholders representing organizations from several sectors of the community, including health and employment, partnered to develop work opportunities for a population that is disadvantaged from the mainstream employment market including (but not exclusive to) persons diagnosed with mental illness. The three main methods of inquiry were: semistructured interviews, participant observation and collected documentation. FINDINGS: Stakeholders experienced several kinds of challenges during the implementation process and used different strategies to manage these challenges. The findings suggest barriers and facilitators to successful intersectoral action initiatives, some of which are directly applicable to the context of employment and mental illness. CONCLUSION: Several lessons are drawn from these experiences."
7740827,"Scenarios are a powerful way to bound the uncertainty of the future--to sketch the major pathways that the future might take. This article contains five scenarios depicting the United States health care system in the 21st century. These explore: an extrapolation of the current system; a single-payer driven system; a market-oriented system which forces more choice on the individual: a scenario which traces a transformation in health care; and a fifth scenario focuses on the healing role of health care. These scenarios acknowledge certain changes which relevant in all of them, e.g., by the early 21st century health care providers in the United States will have shifted to predicting likely health conditions, preventing what can be prevented and managing optimally those conditions which do arise (optimal in the sense of cost-effective treatment in light of the best practices of the day applied in ways which recognize and take advantage of the biochemically unique nature of each individual. Developed in 1991, these scenarios have been successful as a tool for identifying a range of likely paths which health care might take. The scenarios did not foresee the assertiveness of the President of the United States towards health care reform, although it did identify the difficulty which the President's and any other reform efforts would face. At their base, however, the scenarios trace the fundamental shift taking place in health care in spite of financing reforms. This fundamental shift is being driven largely by outcome measures; a commitment to accountability; better and more accessible health knowledge; enhanced technology; and a greater willingness on the part of some sectors of the health care system to deal with the broader determinants of health (e.g., community and economic factors)."
15273261,"It is well known that there are social inequalities in health. Following the ecological approach, unemployment has been one of the most used indicators to study social inequalities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between indicators of extreme poverty and social unrest, along with unemployment, and mortality in Barcelona, during the years 1989 to 1993. A cross-sectional ecological study was carried out using Primary Health Care Areas (PHCAs) as the unit of analysis. The study population consisted of residents in Barcelona City. The indicators studied as dependent variables were the age-standardized mortality rates of the following causes of death: total mortality; lung cancer; bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma; cirrhosis; cerebrovascular disease; ischemic heart disease; breast cancer; traffic accidents; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); and drug overdose. Independent variables were male unemployment rate of the primary health care areas and indicators of extreme poverty and social conflict. A descriptive analysis, a bivariate analysis using Spearman correlation coefficients, and a multivariate analysis fitting Poisson regression models were carried out. For the main results, one group of causes of death was associated only with unemployment: bronchitis, emphysema and asthma, cerebrovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease (both men and women); lung cancer (only among men); total mortality and cirrhosis (only among women). Among men, another group of causes of death was associated with extreme poverty and/or social unrest, as well as unemployment: total mortality, cirrhosis, and drug overdose. AIDS in men was only associated with extreme poverty and social unrest. We concluded that we see different types of relationships between deprivation and mortality. Unemployment has been related to mortality because of pathologies with socially accepted risk factors (tobacco and alcohol). Causes of death with risk factors not socially accepted (illegal drug use) have been related to indicators of marginality as well as unemployment."
8582823,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of women's recovery after an acute cardiac event. DESIGN: Grounded theory provided the methodologic basis for qualitative data generation and analysis. SAMPLE: Thirteen women who had experienced an acute cardiac event. The participants' ages ranged from 42 to 78 with a mean age of 58 years. Four participants attended the group sessions after experiencing an acute myocardial infarction; five had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting; and two had undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Two participants had undergone exercise testing that indicated myocardial ischemia. The time after the cardiac event ranged from 8 weeks to 3 years at the initiation of the study, with a mean time after the cardiac event of 8 months. RESULTS: Healing, the basic social process identified from the data, explained women's struggle through the uncertainty surrounding the cardiac event as a way of creating new and positive health patterns. The process of healing consisted of three stages: surviving, originating, and patterning balance. These stages of healing illustrated determinants of individual motivation that guided the initiation and maintenance of risk factor modification efforts in women after the cardiac event. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study provide a basis for the development and evaluation of comprehensive rehabilitative interventions designed to enhance individual recovery after a cardiac event."
25136398,"UNLABELLED: In recent decades the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been adopted by many business sectors, including the pharmaceutical industry. However, in this and other sectors its application remains variable, particularly between mature and developing economies. Its stakeholders include pharmacy and medical students, their attitude to the involvement of companies in socially responsible activities will be important determinants of public response to the industry. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of senior medical and pharmacy students towards the CSR concept in the pharmaceutical sector in mature (Germany) and developing (Russia) markets. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was carried out among senior pharmacy and medical students during the summer semester 2008 in two Russian and one German university. In each country 120 questionnaires were distributed. The response rate was 95% in Russia and 93% in Germany. RESULTS: Although the relevance of CSR was widely acknowledged by the students, very few were aware of CSR practices currently performed by companies. THE REPUTATION OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WAS GENERALLY POOR: less than 15% of respondents gave credence to the information provided in advertisements and fully supported pricing strategies as well as policies towards the developing countries. When choosing an employer more than 90% of respondents consider the policies affecting an employee directly as pivotal. However, for a high proportion of students (59% in Russia and 64% in Germany) socially irresponsible behavior by companies has a significant negative impact. CONCLUSIONS: This paper identifies practices which students believe should be a part of the CSR programmes for the pharmaceutical industry, and also some that should be abandoned. It recommends that corporate communication on CSR should be expanded. Key differences are seen in perceptions of students in Germany and Russia towards the extent of irresponsible actions and the variation between them."
10951443,"We have examined fatigue in myasthenia gravis (MG) by administering a measure of cognitive and physical fatigue to patients and control subjects before and after administration of a lengthy cognitive battery. Subjects also completed a scale that assessed the impact of fatigue on physical, social, and cognitive function. Results of the study revealed that MG patients experience significantly more cognitive and physical fatigue than do control subjects, and the patients' perceptions of both cognitive and physical fatigue increased significantly following completion of demanding cognitive work. Control subjects reported no significant change in fatigue. Furthermore, MG patients reported that fatigue produced mild to moderate effects on cognitive and social function and moderate effects on physical function. Results from this study indicate that cognitive fatigue is an important symptom of MG and that fatigue produces pervasive impairments in important aspects of patients' lives. Additional studies are needed to understand the neurobehavioral determinants of cognitive fatigue in this population."
12479494,"OBJECTIVE: To examine a prevailing conceptual model of health services use (Andersen 1995) and to suggest modifications that may enhance its explanatory power when applied to empirical studies of race/ethnicity and long-term care. STUDY SETTING: Twelve focus groups of African-American (five groups) and white (seven groups) individuals, aged 65 and older, residing in Connecticut during 2000. STUDY DESIGN: Using qualitative analysis, data were coded and analyzed in NUD-IST 4 software to facilitate the reporting of recurrent themes, supporting quotations, and links among the themes for developing the conceptual framework. Specific analysis was conducted to assess distinctions in common themes between African-American and white focus groups. DATA COLLECTION: Data were collected using a standardized discussion guide, augmented by prompts for clarification. Audio taped sessions were transcribed and independently coded by investigators and crosschecked to enhance coding validity. An audit trail was maintained to document analytic decisions during data analysis and interpretation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Psychosocial factors (e.g., attitudes and knowledge, social norms, and perceived control) are identified as determinants of service use, thereby expanding the Andersen model (1995). African-American and white focus group members differed in their reported accessibility of information about long-term care, social norms concerning caregiving expectations and burden, and concerns of privacy and self-determination. CONCLUSIONS: More comprehensive identification of psychosocial factors may enhance our understanding of the complex role of race/ethnicity in long-term care use as well as the effectiveness of policies and programs designed to address disparities in long-term care service use among minority and nonminority groups."
18477747,"BACKGROUND: This paper analyses gender inequalities in health status and in social determinants of health among the elderly in western Europe. METHODS: Data came from the first wave of the ""Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe"" (2004). For the purposes of this study a subsample of community-residing people aged 65-85 years with no paid work was selected (4218 men and 5007 women). Multiple logistic regression models separated by sex and adjusted for age and country were fitted. RESULTS: Women were more likely to report poor health status, limitations in mobility and poor mental health. Whereas in both sexes educational attainment was associated with the three health indicators, household income was only related to poor self-rated health among women. The relationship between living arrangements and health differed by gender and was primarily associated with poor mental health. In both sexes, not living with their partner but living with other people and being the household head was related to poor mental health status (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.14; 95% CI 1.11 to 4.14 for men and aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.72 for women). In addition, women living with their partner and other(s) and those living alone were more likely to report poor mental health status (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.41 and aOR 1.58; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Health inequalities persist among the elderly. Women have poorer health status than men and in both sexes the risk of poor health status increases among those with low educational attainment. Living arrangements are primarily associated with poor mental health status with patterns that differ by gender."
15199000,"While policy makers argue for a greater share of health resources to go to health promotion, action is stalled by, among other things, the perception that little is known about which interventions offer the best health returns. Additionally, what is missing is any sense of what the economic literature in health promotion looks like overall. Where is the economic evidence plentiful and where is it scant? The project described here compiled a census of economic evaluations in health promotion. Studies were classified according to a four-part typology that documented the strategic intent of the intervention, the risk factor being addressed, the population most affected and the setting in which the intervention took place. Since 1990, there have been over 400 economic evaluations of health-promoting interventions in the peer review and grey literatures. Of these, 90% address biological or behavioral determinants of health. Relatively little is known about the economics of population health advocacy or interventions to tackle the social and economic determinants of health. Initiatives are in place to increase the availability of economic evidence. Research is also needed into how to support decision makers' use of imperfect, incomplete and uncertain information."
8203689,"OBJECTIVES: This study addresses the question of whether inequalities in premature mortality related to educational level differ among countries. METHODS: Data on mortality by educational level were obtained from longitudinal studies from nine industrialized countries. The data referred to men between 35 and 64 years of age. The follow-up periods occurred between 1970 and 1982. The size of mortality differences associated with educational level was measured by means of two inequality indices, both based on Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: Inequalities in mortality are relatively small in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway and about two times as large in the United States, France, and Italy. Finland and England and Wales occupy intermediate positions. The large inequalities in mortality in the United States and France can be attributed in part to large inequalities in education in these countries. CONCLUSIONS: The international pattern found in this study was also observed in a comparison that used occupation as the socioeconomic indicator. Differences between countries in levels of inequality in mortality may be partially explained by the countries' different levels of egalitarian social and economic policies."
15704819,"Changes in conduct problems from middle school through early adulthood were examined in a sample of 1191 African American and White males and females. Predictors were selected from a number of ecological contexts to examine the relative contribution of family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors to conduct problems during the 7th, 8th, and 11th grade and across transitions in middle school, into high school, and into young adulthood. Almost all contexts made a unique contribution to conduct problems except for the neighborhood setting. The variables that had the most regular influences during each of these periods were Family Consistent Control, Family Discipline Harshness, and Negative Peers. Positive family and positive peer variables had less consistent relations to outcomes. School variables were more influential in middle school than later. Few gender or race differences were found in the patterning of predictors across time. Studies using only one or two settings as predictors of conduct problems, may provide a misleading picture of their impact by excluding other contextual influences."
19573222,"BACKGROUND: Identification of subpopulations at high risk of overweight and obesity is crucial for prevention and management of obesity in different socioeconomic status (SES) categories. The objective of the study was to describe disparities in the prevalence of overweight and obesity across socioeconomic status (SES) groups in 18-74 year-old French adults. METHODS: Analyses were based on a multistage stratified random sample of non-institutionalized adults aged 18-74-years-old from the French Nutrition and Health Survey (ENNS), a cross-sectional national survey carried out in 2006/2007. Collected data included measured anthropometry (weight, height and waist circumference (WC)), demographic and SES data (occupation, education and frequency of holiday trips as a marker of family income). SES factors associated with overweight (BMI > or = 25) and central obesity (WC above gender-specific references) were identified using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Almost half (49.3%) of French adults were overweight or obese and 16.9% were obese. In men, the risk of overall overweight or obesity was associated with occupation (p < 0.05), whereas the risk of central obesity was independently associated with occupation (p < 0.05) and frequency of holiday trips (p < 0.01). In women, both overall and central overweight and obesity were independently associated with educational level (respectively p < 10(-3) and p < 10(-3)) and frequency of holiday trips (respectively p < 0.05 and p < 10-3). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was found to be similar to that of several neighbouring western European countries, and lower than the UK and eastern Europe. Risk of being overweight or obese varied across SES groups both in men and women, but associations were different between men and women, indicating differing determinants."
8318806,"The aim of this follow-up study was to investigate the effect of birth weight, infant nutrition, past and contemporary social status and anthropometry on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adult subjects. There were 465 boys and girls, originating from three different regions of Croatia, examined in the first three years of life, and again approximately 18 years later. The analyses showed that birth weight was inversely related to systolic blood pressure in adult subjects. The highest systolic pressure was found in subjects with the lowest birth weight and the greatest current body mass index. Relative weight in the first three years of life was also inversely related to systolic blood pressure, but only in adult males. Neither the type of milk given, nor the duration of breast feeding and the time of weaning had any significant influence on blood pressure in adult subjects. According to multivariate regression analyses, the significant predictors of higher systolic and diastolic pressure in adult males were: lower father's height, greater current body mass index, lower birth weight and low original social status. In female subjects, the significant predictors were: lower birth weight, greater current body mass index and lower social class of origin. In conclusion, influences of poor environment acting in early childhood may be important determinants of blood pressure in adulthood."
17961687,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the quality of life of children with cerebral palsy from the parents' and children's perspectives. STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-five children were recruited; a parent, and when feasible, the child also completed the Child Health Questionnaire and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. A range of predictor variables was measured relating to impairments, activity limitations, personal and environmental factors. RESULTS: Mean age was 9.3 +/- 2.1 years; 63.2% were male, and almost half had mild motor impairment (47% Gross Motor Function Classification System level I). Mean physical well-being (Child Health Questionnaire) was 39.6 +/- 16.9 with 50% <40; and mean psychosocial well-being was 43.0 +/- 11.3 with 53.8% <40. Similarly, with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, 61% had summary scores <1 SD. Scores of parents and their children were significantly correlated (physical: r = .59, P < .0001; psychosocial: r = .39, P = .01); however, children rated themselves higher. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that quality of life is highly variable in children with cerebral palsy, with about half experiencing a life quality similar to typically developing children. Motor and other activity limitations are indicators of physical but not psychosocial well-being. Family functioning, behavioral difficulties, and motivation are important predictors of social-emotional adaptation. Determinants of life quality may guide resource allocation and health promotion initiatives to optimize health of the child and family."
19563694,"This paper examines the gender differential in health and its socioeconomic and demographic determinants in the old-age population of India based on the National Sample Survey 60th round data collected in 2004. As in developed countries, older women in India report poorer self-reported health and experience greater immobility compared with men. Stepwise logistic regression analysis shows that the gender differential in health is linked to various socioeconomic and demographic variables and that the gender gap could be narrowed with appropriate policy intervention. Specifically, paying special attention towards improving the socioeconomic status of widowed/separated women could attenuate a substantial portion of the observed gender gap in the health of the old-age population."
15662576,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To date, there have been several prospective cohort studies investigating the workplace experiences of junior physicians, but with limited focus on gender issues. The objective of the present study is to explore the workplace experiences of first-year residents according to gender, type of training hospital, and clinical field. METHODS: Data reported are from the second assessment of the longitudinal Swiss physicians' career development study, begun in 2001. In 2003, 497 residents (54.7% females, 45.3% males) assessed their workplace conditions, social support at work, and effort-reward imbalance. RESULTS: There are few, but relevant, gender related differences in workplace experiences, with female physicians experiencing less mentoring and higher over-commitment, yet more positive social relationships at work. In a multivariate model, significant differences in some workplace variables with regard to type of training hospital and/or clinical field are found: workplace conditions are rated worse in type ""A"" hospitals (university and cantonal hospitals) than in type ""B""/""C""/""D"" hospitals (regional hospitals and highly specialised units), and in surgical fields than in internal medicine. In ""A"" hospitals mentoring is assessed as better, but positive social relationships as worse. Both scales are rated worse in surgical fields than in internal medicine. The effort-reward imbalance (ERI) is rated significantly higher (unfavourable) in ""A"" hospitals than in ""B""/""C""/""D"" hospitals, regardless of gender and clinical field. Significantly more subjects with an ERI quotient above 1 (which is unfavourable) work in ""A"" hospitals, and in surgical fields regardless of hospital type. Of the total sample, 81 subjects (16.3%), 41 males and 40 females, show an ERI quotient above 1. The greater the workload, the worse the rating of workplace conditions, effort-reward imbalance, and over-commitment. CONCLUSION: Institutional determinants are crucial factors for the workplace experiences and first career steps of junior physicians. Medical educators, especially those in ""A"" hospitals, should become more involved in structured residency programs and be aware of potential gender inequalities in the career support of female physicians."
16115285,"Birthweight is used as an indicator of individual and population health and is known to be strongly correlated with adult cardiovascular disease. This paper uses routinely collected maternity discharge data from Scotland between 1980 and 2000 to look at birthweight trends and the changes in the distribution of maternal risk factors for birthweight. We also examine the contributions of each of the risk factors to birthweight trends and investigate whether there has been a reduction in inequality in birthweight over time. Data from 1,282,172 singleton live births were used in the analysis. Both mean birthweight and low birthweight (LBW:<2500 g) were used as outcomes. The risk factors studied were maternal age, parity, maternal height, marital status and occupational social class of the father. The slope and relative indices of inequality were used to measure the change in inequalities over time. Mean birthweight increased from 3320 g in 1980 to 3410 g in 2000, while the percentage LBW decreased slightly from 5.7% in 1980 to 5.4% in 2000. The prevalence of many risk factors changed; there has been an increase in the proportion of older mothers, single mothers, taller mothers and mothers with undetermined social class. Although most risk factors had a significant change in effect over time, the inequalities in birthweight between groups did not appear to diminish over time. Both the slope and relative index of inequality had a quadratic relationship over time, with the inequalities in birthweight being greatest in the early 1980s and late 1990s."
16797813,"Aspects of the social environment, including social conditions (socio-economic status, household situations, chronic illnesses) and social relations (attitude and behaviors of relations) are major determinants of depression among women. This study evaluates the relative power of social relations and social conditions in predicting depression among pregnant women in Pakistan. In the qualitative phase of the study, social environmental determinants were identified through literature search, and experts' opinions from psychologists, psychiatrists, gynecologists, sociologists and researchers. Along with this, 79 in-depth interviews were conducted with pregnant women drawn from six hospitals (public and private) and two communities in Karachi, Pakistan. Identified determinants of depression were grouped into themes of social conditions and social relations and pregnancy-related concerns. In the study's quantitative phase, the relative power of the identified themes and categories, based on their scores for predicting depression (determined by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D scale)), was determined through multivariate linear regression. Social environmental determinants of pregnant women were described under the themes and categories of (1) social relations: involving husband, in-laws and children; (2) social conditions: involving the economy, illness, life events, household work, environmental circumstances and social problems; and (3) pregnancy-related concerns i.e. symptoms of pregnancy, changes during pregnancy, dependency and concern for unborn baby. Multivariate analysis found that among these themes, social relations and pregnancy-related concerns were significantly associated with total CES-D scores. Among the categories besides increasing age and less education, husband, in-laws, household work and pregnancy symptoms were significantly associated with total CES-D scores. The study highlights the importance of social relations compared to social conditions for determining depression in pregnant women."
11202034,"The end of the last millennium witnessed an unprecedented degree of public awareness regarding mental disorder as well as motivation for policy change. Like Sartorius, we contend that the continued stigmatization of mental illness may well be the central issue facing the field, as nearly all attendant issues (e.g., standards of care, funding for basic and applied research efforts) emanate from professional, societal, and personal attitudes towards persons with aberrant behavior. We discuss empirical and narrative evidence for stigmatization as well as historical trends regarding conceptualizations of mental illness, including the field's increasing focus on genetic and neurobiological causes and determinants of mental disorder. We next define stigma explicitly, noting both the multiple levels (community, societal, familial, individual) through which stigma operates to dehumanize and delegitimize individuals with mental disorders and the impact of stigma across development. Key developmental psychopathology principles are salient in this regard. We express concern over the recent oversimplification of mental illness as ""brain disorder,"" supporting instead transactional models which account for the dynamic interplay of genes, neurobiology, environment, and self across development and which are consistent with both compassion and societal responsibility. Finally, we consider educational and policy-related initiatives regarding the destigmatization of mental disorder. We conclude that attitudes and policy regarding mental disorder reflect, in microcosmic form, two crucial issues for the next century and millennium: (a) tolerance for diversity (vs. pressure for conformity) and (b) intentional direction of our species' evolution, given fast-breaking genetic advances."
7964331,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To identify geographical differences in coronary heart disease (CHD) attack rates in a small urban area and to relate these to indicators of socioeconomic class. DESIGN: CHD attack rates were calculated from data of the Ghent MONICA myocardial infarct register for the period 1983-87. The city of Ghent is subdivided into 201 sectors based on morphological, and socioeconomic characteristics. During the national census of 1981, the main determinants of residential differentiation were measured. These sector variables were linked with the CHD attack rates. PATIENTS: All residents of the city aged 25-69 years are prospectively followed with regard to heart attacks. Between 1982 and 1987, 1728 suffered an acute heart attack according to MONICA criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Significant (p < 0.05) differences in age and sex standarised attack rates were observed between city sectors. These differences were related to an index of socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: Within a small urban area, significant geographical differences occur in CHD attack rates and these are related to socioeconomic status."
2401672,"Data for a sample of 50 developing countries are analysed to investigate the social correlates of the teenage birth rate. Of five major factors considered as predictors of national birth rates (socioeconomic development, family planning programmes, women's status, the sex ratio, and marriage patterns), regression analyses reveal that only the average age at marriage for women has a significant effect on the teenage birth rate. In contrast, all variables except the sex ratio and the average age at marriage for women have a significant effect on the total fertility rate."
15155587,"In this study, determinants of tobacco use among Gambian youths were examined. A cross-sectional school-based survey was conducted among 282 students, aged 14-18. The potential determinants were derived from the core constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the ASE model. Moreover, various measures of knowledge and media influence were added to the research model. The results show that free cigarette offers by representatives of tobacco companies were mostly responsible for the difference between smokers and non-smokers. Other variables associated with smoking behavior were greater intention to smoke in the future, lower self-efficacy expectations regarding emotional situations, smoking behavior of the respondent's best friend, the mother having a job and the absence of other family members living in the house. Our study supports current efforts to prohibit tobacco advertising and promotions in The Gambia, especially the distribution of free samples. Additionally, we recommend prevention activities in schools and communities to aim at making children less vulnerable to 'sampling', increasing their self-efficacy expectations regarding emotional situations and making them aware of the influence of their best friend."
12293836,"""This paper uses the 1983 Census of Israel to analyze Hebrew speaking skills and the effects of Hebrew fluency on the earnings of adult male immigrants. Hebrew fluency increases with a longer duration in Israel, the presence of children in the household, marrying after immigration, living in an area in which a smaller proportion speak one's mother tongue, a younger age at migration, a higher level of schooling and varies by country of birth. Earnings increase monotonically with the use of Hebrew. Speaking English as a second language is associated with higher earnings, even when country of origin is held constant."""
12608097,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research study carried-out in 1999 was to assess the impact of various forms of activity (physical, pro-social and intellectual-mental) on health status of the group of people aged 65 and more. METHODS: A tool used to conduct the research was anonymous questionnaire. After a preliminary assessment of 2072 questionnaires for a further analysis, 1910 questionnaires (92.6%) have been selected. Health status has been assessed on the basis of the following epidemiological parameters: information on illness and health problems, hospitalisation, disability, mobility, and body weight, depression, limited life enthusiasm, assessment of satisfaction resulting from contacts with other persons, identification of problems connected with ageing. Activity has been assessed on the basis of responses to the open and closed questions. The statistic tests: Chi 2, logistic regression, Pearson's correlation were used. RESULTS: Active persons assessed their health condition more positively, they suffered from fewer CVD's and their health condition was more stable, many had a better psycho-social status, and they less often used medical services (hospitalisation). Legal and biological disability, except 1st disability category and persons who were immobile did not constitute any barrier to become active. Similarly, diseases didn't exclude activity, except very severe pathologies. In the group of active persons overweight subjects constituted a minority, while no active person was obese. Majority of respondents has admitted that their health condition has deteriorated drastically at the age of 63-64. CONCLUSION: Activity of persons over 65 year old is one of many independent determinants and indicators of positive ageing."
19288207,"BACKGROUND: Work-related health research has traditionally focused on identifying risks rather than determinants of good health. Our knowledge of variation in ill health is thus greater than our understanding of such variations in good health. PURPOSE: In this study, the associations between work-environment exposures and good health are examined. We are especially interested in contrasting our indices of ill health with a narrow measure of good health. Moreover, the salutary effect of sense of coherence (SOC) is explored, focusing particularly on its moderating role. METHOD: Data stem from the panel of Swedish level of living surveys for 1991 and 2000. The analysis is based on a sample of 2,334 employed men and women. Logistic regressions are used. RESULTS: Assessed work-environment factors are to a large extent related, in a mirrored way, to good health and ill health. The models' fit are, however, generally better for the latter. Our findings also indicate that SOC has a protective role for individuals exposed to work risks such as stress and high physical demands. CONCLUSION: To improve our understanding of what promotes good health, research needs to focus on salutary factors. One such salutary factor explored in this paper is sense of coherence."
18834016,"Migration is a growing phenomenon throughout the world, including in the UK and elsewhere in the EU. This massive movement of peoples has implications for the health of individuals and groups, and therefore for healthcare professionals. Migrants are not a homogeneous group, and their health is affected more by the conditions under which they travel and the social conditions in which they live in the receiving country. The wider determinants of their health are often different from those of the settled community and require a different approach from healthcare professionals. An understanding of the background of migrants is essential in order to seek out and attempt to effectively address health needs."
9248239,"A factorial survey was conducted to identify social situations that inhibit or promote college students' sex-refusal skills. Respondents evaluated five different situations in which sexual intercourse might occur and ranked each according to how certain the respondent would be to refuse to have sexual intercourse in that context. Regression analysis of the survey data showed that knowing the other person well, being with one's boyfriend or girlfriend, having condoms available, wanting to have sex, and both persons' wanting to have sex reduced the probability of refusal. On the other hand, having no condoms and the presence of drugs in the situation increased the probability the individual would refuse to have sex. In addition, men, individuals with previous sexual experience, and drinkers displayed diminished ability to refuse sex. However, the lack of condoms, when combined with these three respondent characteristics, acted to increase the ability to refuse sex."
7983098,"This paper examines the effects of a child's place of birth, mother's education, region of residence and rural and urban residence on infant mortality in Nigeria between 1965 and 1979, using data from the 1981/82 Nigeria Fertility Survey. Infant mortality rates declined in all regions between 1965 and 1979. Children born in modern health facilities, irrespective of their mothers' place of residence, experienced significantly lower rates of infant mortality than those born elsewhere. Logistic regression analysis showed that all other variables tested were also significant, although some to a lesser degree. Efforts to reduce infant mortality in Nigeria should include policies that rectify rural and urban differentials in the distribution of health facilities and encourage their use."
24616603,"The development of expertise in sport is the result of successful interaction of biological, psychological, and sociological constraints. This review examines the training and environmental factors that influence the acquisition of sport expertise. Research examining the quality and quantity of training indicate that these two elements are crucial predictors of attainment. In addition, the possession of resources such as parental support and adequate coaching are essential. Social factors such as cultural influences and the relative age effect are also considered as determinants of sport expertise. Although it is evident that environmental factors are essential to the acquisition of high levels of sport development, further research is clearly required."
11811637,"Using a longitudinal field design, this study tested the dynamics of an integrative model of social identity theory (SIT) and relative deprivation theory (RDT) with regard to relations between perceived socio-structural characteristics, perceived in-group identification, perceived fraternal deprivation (i.e., resentment) and identity-management-strategy preference. Trait-state analyses revealed that the dynamic relationship among constructs in the model can best be explained in terms of trait-dependent variation rather than sequentially ordered processing. The trait components of the variables replicate previous findings concerning SIT and RDT. However. stable functional relations between variables and their traitlike character contradict the notion that their underlying processes are linear and sequential. Rather, variables and their relations can be regarded as the product of parallel processes. The authors discuss the results as a challenge to core assumptions of SIT."
1558698,"Older adults' life satisfaction can be better understood in light of their personal goals. This study of 179 elders examined (a) how goals correlate with satisfaction, (b) whether elders maintain satisfaction by accommodating goals to past losses, and (c) how correlations between satisfaction and key predictors differ among groups with different goals. Satisfaction was related positively to social maintenance and energetic life-style goals and negatively to concerns for improvement, disengagement, stability, and reduced activity. Past losses were correlated with current goals but not with satisfaction, consistent with the notion of accommodation. A cluster analysis identified 5 patterns of goals: high demand, age prescribed, self-focused, socially engaged, and low demand. Correlations between satisfaction and other predictors differed by cluster, suggesting that the determinants of elders' satisfaction depend on personal goals."
16153480,"OBJECTIVE: The social stigma of tuberculosis is much less studied than those of other diseases such as AIDS or mental problems. However, it has important implications on the affected person's well being and on the epidemic's control. Our study aims at exploring this social stigma in five local health systems of Nicaragua, prior to implementing interventions to reduce it. METHODS: Through in-depth interviews and focus groups involving stakeholders in the care of people affected by tuberculosis (PATBs), we analysed interactions between PATBs and family members, first line government health services' personnel, and community members. RESULTS: According to our results, the interaction between stakeholders and PATBs can be described as the intersection between two sets of contradictory feelings and attitudes: (a) feelings of affection and supportive attitudes toward PATBs opposed to the fear of being infected or that PATBs will infect others and, (b) confidence in PATBs considered to be unlucky opposed to mistrust of PATBs considered to be negligent. PATBs react against this mainly by hiding their condition which leads them to a, loss of confidence and depression. This intricate group of feelings and attitudes is influenced by two sets of determinants related to domination and power between stakeholders and issues of knowledge and information. CONCLUSION: Analysing tuberculosis-related social stigma as a social process enabled us to better understand some key social structural factors of health care system's organisation and identify locally acceptable interventions to reduce such stigma. The fact of analysing, in a more thorough study, some interventions in the currently changing social structural context of health care systems in Nicaragua will give us a better insight into the relevance of our analysis and the interventions' effectiveness in reducing the social stigma of tuberculosis."
8827145,"A theoretical model was used to examine the influence of relationship factors, pregnancy intentions, contraceptive behavior and other psychosocial characteristics on stages of behavior change in condom use among heterosexual black women of reproductive age. Data from an inner-city street survey compared women who were not contemplating condom use, women who were attempting to use condoms or had used them consistently for short periods of time, and those who had achieved long-term consistent use. Women's relationship with their main partner appears to be an important factor in understanding their use of condoms both with main partners and with other partners. For condom use with the main partner, factors such as emotional closeness and partner support were significant predictors of the likelihood that women would be attempting to use condoms rather than not contemplating use. Cohabitation and the belief that condom use builds trust were significant predictors of long-term consistent condom use. Having a regular or main partner was strongly associated with intentions to use condoms with other partners. Women who wanted to become pregnant were much less likely to intend to use condoms with their main partner, and women using oral contraceptives were less likely to be long-term consistent condom users."
8319857,"This paper presents a theoretical framework for investigating psychosocial determinants of delayed prenatal care among disadvantaged women. This framework is based on the Health Belief Model (HBM), which postulates that beliefs concerning prenatal care are modified by psychological and social attributes and may predispose one to delay prenatal care enrollment. The HBM has a number of advantages for family medicine researchers in comparison to other models; its use in future investigations can provide the understanding necessary for overcoming psychosocial deterrents to entry into prenatal care."
19346779,"Community-based approaches have been the mainstay of interventions to address the problem of child malnutrition in developing societies. Many programs have been in operation in several countries for decades and originated largely as social welfare, food security and poverty eradication programs. Increasingly conceptual frameworks to guide this activity have been developed as our understanding of the complex nature of the determinants of undernutrition improves. Alongside this evolution, is the accumulation of evidence on the types of interventions in the community that are effective, practical and sustainable. The changing environment is probably determining the altering scenario of child nutrition in developing societies, with rapid developmental transition and urbanization being responsible for the emerging problems of obesity and other metabolic disorders that are largely the result of the now well-recognized linkages between child undernutrition and early onset adult chronic diseases. This dramatic change is contributing to the double burden of malnutrition in developing countries. Community interventions hence need to be integrated and joined up to reduce both aspects of malnutrition in societies. The evidence that community-based nutrition interventions can have a positive impact on pregnancy outcomes and child undernutrition needs to be evaluated to enable programs to prioritize and incorporate the interventions that work in the community. Programs that are operational and successful also need to be evaluated and disseminated in order to enable countries to generate their own programs tailored to tackling the changing nutritional problems of the children in their society."
12822692,"Data from the Health and Retirement Study, 1992-1994, were used to analyze (1) the prevalence and incidence of self-reported work disability among older working-age populations over a two-year period, and (2) the effect of the stability/changes in physical and functional health conditions, controlling for socioeconomic and occupational characteristics, on the stability/changes in self-reported work ability/disability. Findings show a high rate of transitions into and out of work-disabled status over the two-year period. Findings also show that, although objective physical and functional health problems and low self-ratings of health at wave 1 were significant determinants of self-reported work disability at wave 1, most subsequent changes in objective physical and functional health conditions over the two-year period were not significantly associated with the changes in self-report of work disability between wave 1 and wave 2. Especially, improved health conditions were not significantly associated with regained work ability between the two waves. Of the demographic variables, female gender significantly increased the likelihood of reporting work disability at wave 2, and being Black or Hispanic significantly decreased the likelihood of reporting regained work ability at wave 2. Research and policy implications of the findings are discussed."
2408154,"The most important aim of diabetes education is to alter the self-care behaviour of patients with diabetes. In order to change their behaviour its determinants must be known. The pretest of a multicentre evaluation study with 558 participating insulin treated patients with diabetes was analysed to test the usefulness of the attitude-behaviour theory of Fishbein & Ajzen in explaining and possibly changing diabetes related active self-care behaviour. The theory of Fishbein & Ajzen is based on the assumption that human behaviour is reasoned behaviour. The theory views a person's intention as the immediate determinant of action. Determinants of intention are attitude and social norm. The results showed that the attitude was the most important determinant of active self-care, while a sufficient level of knowledge and a low orientation on the powerful others health locus of control scale were prerequisites for a positive attitude. The influence of the social environment was detrimental; although people tried to motivate patients to active self-care, they could not provide any real help in performing this desired behaviour. According to the results of this study, diabetes education should first aim at improving the level of knowledge and the health locus of control of the patients and second, at a positive attitude to active self-care. It is necessary to educate the social environment to create a more supportive atmosphere for the patient with diabetes."
10703183,"The ability of epidemiology to determine the relationships between health and environmental insults has become exceedingly difficult. The multifactorial nature of disease and the diversity of the insults, which include biologic, physical, social and cultural factors, combined with genetic susceptibility, suggest the need to develop better models of multidisciplinary epidemiologic investigation. This paper highlights the needs of an environmental epidemiologic team, discusses ways to incorporate new ideas across disciplines and to integrate constructs and paradigms of social, ecological, cultural and population determinants with individual-based exposure assessments. Innovation will be the key to the survival and increasing importance of epidemiology in addressing the public health needs of the future, but what are the ways to enhance and encourage creativity in environmental epidemiology? The process of self-renewal and continuing education will be highlighted. Additionally, the complexity of the problems and the need for clear supervision and control of multidisciplinary research efforts require a forum of communication and an 'information-processing approach' beyond those in traditional epidemiologic studies. New approaches in data management and medical informatics must be incorporated into the epidemiologic investigative framework. Methods to be included should focus on opportunities for computer-supported sharing of ideas. Such capabilities minimise the geographic distances and the disparate knowledge and training of the investigators and bring the team closer to the objectives and functions inherent in multidisciplinary investigation."
10960532,"BACKGROUND: Health policymakers are concerned about the proportion of people who say they are unwilling to receive a blood transfusion. This article examines how social, cultural, and political factors affect the perceived risk of transfusions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected as part of a large national telephone survey of 1204 people conducted in the United States in 1997 and 1998. The survey elicited images associated with blood transfusions and contained questions about the perceived risk of the blood supply, sensitivity to stigma, world views, trust, and demographics. RESULTS: The results showed that a substantial proportion of people do not consider the US blood supply to be safe and say they would not accept blood if hospitalized. The images evoked most frequently by the stimulus phrase ""blood transfusions"" were related to AIDS or HIV. The people who tend to perceive the greatest personal and public risk from blood transfusions are female, nonwhite, and less educated, and they have not previously received a transfusion. Sensitivity to stigma, mistrust, one's perceived inability to control hazardous activities and technologies, and fatalistic and egalitarian world views tend to be associated with heightened concern about the risk of blood transfusions. CONCLUSION: Risk perceptions need to be monitored to anticipate and deal with problems of public acceptance. Risk management strategies should be tailored to the specific characteristics of individuals that are important determinants of the perceived risk of transfusions."

Focusing on less developed countries, this article explores why some host governments respond in relatively generous ways, while other governments act more restrictively. The policy alternatives available to receiving governments are classified, and a set of factors influencing refugee policy formation is explored. These factors include: the costs and benefits of accepting international assistance, relations with the sending country, political calculations about the local community's absorption capacity, and national security considerations."""
9526760,"The mental health of 63 refugee children, with a mean age of 5.9 years, from Chile and the Middle East, were studied during the first 18 months of exile in Stockholm, Sweden. 46% of the children were rated as having poor mental health five months after resettlement in symptom interviews with parents based on the structured questionnaire developed by Cederblad, and 44% thirteen months later. Political violence in the home country and stress in the family sphere in exile were identified as the major determinants of poor mental health in this context."
16326068,"This study explored the factorial structure of the Italian version of the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders questionnaire (SCARED), and investigated the contributions of genetic and environmental influences of individual variation of anxiety dimensions as reported in the SCARED. Three hundred and seventy-eight twin pairs aged 8-17 from the Italian Twin Registry filled in the SCARED through a mail survey. Four, distinct empirical factors, that corresponded closely to the original SCARED subscales of Generalized Anxiety (GAD), Panic (PD), Social Phobia (SP), and Separation Anxiety (SAD) disorder emerged from Exploratory Factor Analysis. The empirically derived scores were analyzed by structural equation modeling; moderate-to-high heritability, without age or sex differences, emerged for all dimensions with the exception of GAD, for which an age effect was found. The DSM-IV anxiety dimensions identified by the SCARED have a psychometric structure that can be replicated in the Italian culture, and are influenced at different extents by genetic and nonshared environmental determinants."
1459678,"In 1985-86, 286 underfive deaths occurred among a population of 30,000 in a rural area of Haryana. Two hundred and eighty one were analysed for socio-biological factors related to under five mortality. Females had a higher mortality. About 2/3 of the deaths were in infants, and 90% in first 3 years. Most of the deaths (94%) occurred in the village itself, 58.4% did not seek any medical care during the terminal illness, 80-90% did not receive even a single dose of BCG, DPT or O.P.V., and 36.7% died in the first attack of illness. Though 68% had at least one episode earlier, 31.0% had been admitted in hospitals for an earlier episode of illness. In 42.8% of deaths, the birth order was IV or above. Deaths in socially and economically disadvantaged cases constituted 77.6%. The triad of diarrhea, ARI and malnutrition claimed 56% deaths. In 93% of the deaths, the mothers were illiterate and 96.4% were house wives. There was a sibling death earlier in the family in 78.3%, and 60.1% deaths were of those living in poor housing conditions. About 50% had radio for communication, 85.8% had bicycle for conveyance, and in 66.9% the family had piped water supply. All these findings have been discussed in the study."
15222847,"Research bearing on several popular conceptions of the major determinants of anger arousal indicates that the particular appraisals often identified as causes of anger frequently only serve to affect the intensity of the anger that is generated. Research into effects of physical pain or other physically unpleasant conditions or involving social stresses suggests that decidedly aversive conditions are a major spur to anger. Experiments are also reviewed showing that anger-related muscular movements can also lead to anger-related feelings, memories, cognitions, and autonomic responses. Alternative explanations for the findings are discussed. The authors urge emotion theorists to widen their methodology and analyses so that they give careful, detailed attention to the many different factors that can influence anger."
8454958,"The effect that ratio schedules of reinforcement had upon variability of responding was investigated in college students. Subjects were paid $0.02 contingent upon completion of eight presses, distributed in any combination across two push buttons; 256 different sequences were possible. Sequence emission was reinforced according to fixed- and variable-ratio schedules. Ratio requirements of 1, 2, 4 and 8 were presented in alternate components of a multiple schedule. The variability engendered by variable-ratio schedules was also compared to that engendered by fixed ratios. Variability increased with ratio size, irrespective of whether the schedule requirement was fixed or variable. The data demonstrate the similarity between the determinants of human and nonhuman variability, and they illustrate the role of ratio size in determining variability in operant behavior."

16432486,"Heterosexual transmission of HIV in the United States appears to be following the epidemiologic pattern of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as syphilis and gonorrhea, disproportionately affecting blacks in the Southeastern region. Nationwide, rates of syphilis and gonorrhea are nearly 30 times higher in blacks than in whites, and this racial disparity underlies most of the regional and county-level differences in rates. The racial disparity cannot be explained by traditional measures of socioeconomic differences, and it cannot be explained by individual-level determinants of sexual behavior, but rather reflects deeper group-level social and environmental factors for which race is a marker. A theoretical model based on previous ecologic studies is proposed to explain the relationship between racial discrimination and elevated rates of STDs in blacks. Key factors in the model include: 1) chronic joblessness, 2) drug and alcohol marketing, 3) social disorganization (or social capital), and 4) male incarceration."
17905053,"OBJECTIVES: Sickness absence is a major occupational health problem, but evidence for associations between potentially modifiable psychosocial work factors and sickness absence is still scarce. We studied the impact of relational justice and effort-reward imbalance on subsequent rates of sickness absence. METHODS: The Whitehall II prospective cohort study of British civil servants, 10,308 men and women, was established between 1985 and 1988. Indicators of effort-reward imbalance and the relational component of organizational justice were constructed from questions included at baseline. Participants were classified into three groups (low, intermediate, and high) for both effort-reward imbalance and relational justice. Short (< or =7 days) and long (>7 days) spells of sickness absence during 1985-1989 and 1991-1995 were used to study immediate and longer term effects of work characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, employment grade, and baseline health, men and women with low relational justice had increased risks of long spells of sickness absence of 14% and 28% in comparison to men and women experiencing high levels of justice. Similar effect sizes (25% and 21%) were found for high vs. low effort-reward imbalance. Both work measures also predicted short spells of sickness absence. Effort-reward imbalance (men and women) and relational justice (women only) each predicted long spells of sickness absence independently of the other. CONCLUSIONS: Both relational justice and effort-reward imbalance are important determinants of sickness absence. Workplace interventions to improve these aspects of working conditions have the potential to reduce levels of sickness absence."
18266845,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of self-efficacy on depression and to consider the mediating effect of self-care behaviour. BACKGROUND: Depression is a problem for kidney transplant recipients and can compromise their quality of life. From other studies on chronic illnesses, self-efficacy and self-care behaviour have been considered to be potential determinants for depressive symptoms. However, none of these previous studies have investigated the relationships among these variables in kidney transplantation recipients. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey employing correlation design and purposive sampling was used. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven persons who had received a kidney transplant participated. A self-administrated questionnaire and a medical record audit were used to collect data. The data were analysed using correlation and hierarchical linear regression methods. RESULTS: The average score of depressive symptoms was 8.61 SD 7.64. Among the participants in the study, 32.8% had scores of depressive symptoms higher than 11 (indicating mild to severe symptoms of depression). Self-efficacy and self-care behaviour had direct negative effects on depressive symptoms. Self-care behaviour had partial mediating effect on the relationship between self-efficacy and depression. Total variance explained was 23%. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms are still a problem that need to be addressed among kidney transplantation patients. Patients who have higher self-efficacy and higher self-care behaviour will have lower depressive symptoms. Our results support that self-efficacy is the significant predictor of depressive symptoms. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Self-efficacy is a powerful and modifiable determinant of depressive symptoms. We should design interventions that focus not only on the skill aspects of self-care behaviour but also on those that have a strong connection with self-efficacy. We could incorporate the self-efficacy-enhanced strategies as proposed by social cognitive theory into the kidney transplantation care programme."
20531266,"Within nursing, cultural competency is seen as an important mechanism for reducing racial and ethnic health disparities; however, after years of attempted implementation of ""cultural competence,"" minimal evidence exists demonstrating a relationship between culturally competent interventions and improved health outcomes or reduced disparities. We examine how cultural competency as an intervention for tackling health disparities is undertheorized and misguided, and deflects attention and efforts needed to address broader social determinants of health. We provide a historical overview of cultural competency, critiques of the concept, and recommendations for moving beyond cultural competency as a means of diminishing health disparities."

Female emigration patterns play a significant role in affecting the divorce rate. Population increase and net household income are also important predictors of the Japanese divorce rate and urbanization has a great influence in modern Japan. Demographic and aggregate variables such as migration, urbanization, and socioeconomic factors are useful when organized under a social integration model."
8693173,"In this paper, we analyze the factors related to the allocation of home help services, a main component for maintaining elderly at home. The study is based on a random sample of 889 people aged 65 and over, living at home in the areas of Lunel and Pezenas (Herault, France). The factors taken into account were disabilities, income, social support, and subjective health assessed through the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). A logistic model allowed to bring out the factors related to the delivery of home help services. Positive statistical correlations were found for age (OR = 1.6 per 10-year age groups), disabilities for instrumental activities of daily living (OR = 3.8) and for the notion of mobility assessed through the NHP (OR = 3.3); negative statistical correlations were found for the level of income (OR = 0.3), as well as for disabilities for activities of daily living (physical dependency) (OR = 0.5). These results show that the main criterion for allocating home help services is not severe disability and that subjective aspects play an important part. Accordingly, current practices should be modified to obtain a better targeting of home help services for disabled elderly at home."
9780811,"The significance of a western woman's social supports to postnatal depression is well documented. We examine which deficits in components of their social support network are associated with postnatal depression in women from a non-English-speaking background. The social support network and postnatal mood of 105 Anglo-Celtic, 113 Vietnamese and 98 Arabic women were assessed at 6 weeks postpartum. The role of social supports in determining scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was analysed using multiple regressions. For Anglo-Celtic women, low postnatal mood was associated with perceived need for more emotional support from partners and mothers. For Vietnamese women, low postnatal mood was associated with poor quality of relationship with the partner and a perceived need for more practical help from him. For Arabic women, low postnatal mood was associated with perceived need for more emotional support from partners. We conclude that cultural factors mediate the relation between social supports and postnatal depression more likely to become clinically depressed (Lovestone and Kumar 1993) and infants may have adverse cognitive, behavioural and emotional outcomes, which can be linked to the postnatal depression (Murray and Cooper 1996)."
9707954,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relative contribution of two work-related pressures, workload and perceived normative beliefs of significant others, to community pharmacists' clinical decision making behavior. DESIGN: Systematic random sample design. SETTING: A large southeastern city. PARTICIPANTS: 450 independent and chain community pharmacists identified from the state board of pharmacy list of licensed community pharmacists. INTERVENTIONS: A mailed questionnaire asking about community pharmacists' workload pressures and the perceived beliefs of their patients and employers (significant others) approving or disapproving of them providing pharmaceutical care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical decision making behavior, as measured using a subset of the Behavioral Pharmaceutical Care Scale. RESULTS: Response rate was 31.8%. Workload was not significantly related to clinical decision making. After controlling for social desirability and workload, perceived normative beliefs of significant others was highly significant; it accounted for 7.6% of the variance associated with clinical decision making behavior. CONCLUSION: Workload pressures did not appear to influence the provision of pharmaceutical care. Community pharmacists' perceived normative beliefs about their patients' and employer's approval or disapproval of the provision of pharmaceutical care should be further examined within the larger context of the pharmacy organization's climate."
18000134,"International research on the social determinants of health has increasingly started to integrate a welfare state regimes perspective. Although this is to be welcomed, to date there has been an over-reliance on Esping-Andersen's The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology (1990). This is despite the fact that it has been subjected to extensive criticism and that there are in fact a number of competing welfare state typologies within the comparative social policy literature. The purpose of this paper is to provide public health researchers with an up-to-date overview of the welfare state regime literature so that it can be reflected more accurately in future research. It outlines The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology, and it presents the criticisms it received and an overview of alternative welfare state typologies. It concludes by suggesting new avenues of study in public health that could be explored by drawing upon this broader welfare state regimes literature."
9819707,"The present study was undertaken to characterize the variables that influence parental perception of metabolic disorders and their genetic origin before and after genetic counselling, the effect of counselling on parental attitudes towards prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination, and the factors affecting parental coping with burden. Parents of children with metabolic diseases from 32 Arab-Muslim families were interviewed, answering a pre-structured questionnaire. These interviews indicate the following. (1) Traditional belief and religious commitment are more important determinants than education in parental perception of inherited metabolic diseases. (2) The number of affected children has a greater impact on parental evaluation of the burden than the number of healthy children. The social component, i.e. the way families are viewed by society, is the most significant factor of the burden. (3) Parents use different techniques to divide responsibility regarding reproduction. Having a healthy child and the availability of prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination were the two most important factors in parental reproductive decision making. In the absence of a healthy child and when the burden was perceived as too heavy, parents tended 'not to decide'. (4) Parental attitude to pregnancy termination was dependent on two factors: religious commitment (leading to objection) and severity of disease (leading to flexibility and approval). (5) In almost all families, genetic counselling altered parental perception of the disease and its hereditary origin. We conclude that genetic counselling and population education may be helpful in the prevention of consanguineous marriages and in family planning, even in a society that values traditional beliefs very highly."
9184786,"A total of 361 consecutive admissions to hospital with acute stroke were followed up to examine the determinants of handicap 1 year and 2-3 years later. Handicap was measured using the London Handicap Scale, and data were collected on initial stroke severity, disability, mood and sociodemographic variables. Ninety-five of 170 survivors returned handicap questionnaires at 1 year, 102 of 149 survivors at 2-3 years, and 58 on both occasions. Mean handicap score decreased slightly between 1 and 2-3 years (45-48 on a 0-100 scale, 95% confidence interval for difference -1 to +7, p = 0.09). At both 1 and 2-3 years handicap was associated with pre-stroke disability, 1-year score disability, initial stroke severity and mood. Age and sex were associated at 1 year but not at 2-3 years. In multivariate analyses disability, stroke severity and mood were independently associated with handicap. None of the variables examined predicted change in handicap score. The study demonstrates the overriding importance of stroke severity (impairment) and disability in determining handicap. In comparison, social variables were less important."
9080569,"This is an analysis of system integration, social stratification and work for health status and health care in East and West Germany. It is based on aggregate data and representative survey data of random samples of 2554 adults in both subsystems. Findings show that there were marked differences in life-expectancy prior to unification. The integration of the two systems, which occurred almost totally with regard to terms of West German health care organization, shows adjustment problems in the East for the public Health-Care-Funds and few if any for ambulatory care. The work situation has an impact on health, but there are no significant differences for East versus West. Social stratification variables show an influence on subjective health status for education (East) and for income, social status (West), while physician utilization (despite a preference of specialists by those with higher status) is not significantly determined by stratification variables in either East or West Germany. Beyond the central focus on work and stratification determinants a major finding pertains to a comparatively worse health situation for the aged and for women in what was the former East Germany. System models of Capitalism versus Socialism fit the results and recent history of the two systems to only a limited degree, as the West German corporate health system shows clear limits in following free market principles. The East German system, regardless of its centralized organization and move towards a socialist system, never fully abandoned the traditional model of German health care. Unlike the East German health system, that of West Germany, with its general expansion to 92% of the population, shows an increasing effect for social redistribution. The latter may be a reason why standard indicators of social stratification show less of an impact on health and health care than expected, while conditions at work clearly determine the health of people-the latter being the case in both the former East and West Germany."

The findings...suggest that there are direct effects of demographic, assimilation, and socioeconomic variables beyond those mediated by the variables in each of these sets. Further, regardless of the model, the effect of the clusters of demographic characteristics is most apparent.

9919629,"Northern Nigeria has a maternal mortality ratio greater than 1,000 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Serious maternal morbidity (for example, vesico-vaginal fistula) is also common. Among the most important factors contributing to this tragic situation are: an Islamic culture that undervalues women; a perceived social need for women's reproductive capacities to be under strict male control; the practice of purdah (wife seclusion), which restricts women's access to medical care; almost universal female illiteracy; marriage at an early age and pregnancy often occurring before maternal pelvic growth is complete; a high rate of obstructed labor; directly harmful traditional medical beliefs and practices; inadequate facilities to deal with obstetric emergencies; a deteriorating economy; and a political culture marked by rampant corruption and inefficiency. The convergence of all of these factors has resulted in one of the worst records of female reproductive health existing anywhere in the world."
17880688,"BACKGROUND: Given the increasing importance of obesity in China, prevention interventions encouraging physical activity by middle school students are needed. The purpose of this study is to illustrate how a rapid elicitation method can be used to identify salient consequences, referents, and circumstances about physical activity as perceived by middle school students and to provide suggestions for interventions and quantitative research. METHOD: A theory-based qualitative study using a self-completion elicitation was conducted with 155 students from two middle schools in Beijing, China. Following the Theory of Planned Behavior, six open-ended questions asked students for their perceptions about performing physical activity at least 60 minutes each day: advantages of participating in physical activity; disadvantages of doing so; people who approve of participation; people who disapprove; things that make it easy; and things that make it hard. Content analysis revealed categories of salient consequences, reference groups, and circumstances. RESULTS: While the three most frequently mentioned advantages elicited from the students were physical health consequences (e.g., will strengthen my body (58.7%)), four of the salient advantages were not (e.g., will improve my grades (12.2%)). Parents were the most frequently mentioned social referent (42.6% as approving; 27.7% as disapproving) when students were asked who might approve or disapprove of their participation. Circumstances perceived to hinder daily physical activity included having too many assignments and not having enough time. CONCLUSION: While many of the beliefs about physical activity elicited from this study were similar to those found with students from England and the US, several were unique to these students from Beijing. The results of this qualitative research suggest that interventions to encourage physical activity among middle school students should address: perceived consequences of physical activity on academic achievement and other factors beyond physical health; barriers of not having enough time and having too many assignments perceived to hinder frequent physical activity; and parental approval. More rigorous research on psychosocial determinants with close-ended items developed from these open-ended data and with larger sample sizes of students is necessary. Research with parents and school staff will be needed to understand the perceptions of these stakeholder groups key to creating the students' social environment."

9624723,"AIMS: This is the third of a set of three papers evaluating drinking status and mortality risk. Analysis of three general population surveys of women evaluated all-cause mortality rates by drinking pattern. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Raw data from three studies of adult women were evaluated. Logistic regression models controlled for confounding characteristics. Meta-analysis combined study results. MEASUREMENTS: Drinking pattern was alternatively defined by quantity, frequency and volume of drinking. Final models included drinking pattern (including long-term abstainers and former drinkers) as well as age and other confounding variables. Models also evaluated interactions of age and, respectively, long-term abstinence and former drinking. FINDINGS: In models in which age was controlled, odds of death for long-term abstainers and former drinkers (defined by volume or quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers; odds of death for moderate and heavy drinkers (defined by quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers. When other psychosocial attributes were controlled, odds of death were similar for abstainers and light drinkers. When other psychosocial attributes were controlled, odds of death for heavy drinkers (defined by volume and quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers. When interactions of age and the two forms of abstinence were introduced, one study showed a significant effect of age and former drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Results were consistent with the hypothesis that characteristics of abstainers other than their non-use of alcohol may account for their higher mortality risk. With the exception of former drinkers compared to light drinkers, when interactions were introduced into models (for measures of quantity and frequency) findings were homogeneous across studies, lending generalizability to results."
12971112,"As we move forward in the new century, epidemiologists and public health practitioners are faced with the challenge of reviewing the current direction of epidemiology and its links with public health. While the history of epidemiology has been a successful and productive one, there is a danger that modern epidemiology is becoming too narrow in its scope, concerned primarily with the analysis of risk factors in individuals, while ignoring sociological and ecological perspectives of health. We argue that a theoretical framework to guide the practice of epidemiology is needed which encompasses a role for social determinants of health while simultaneously also acknowledging the importance of behaviour and biology, and the inter-connectedness of all these factors. This paper presents a public health model of social determinants of health, which provides a framework for testing the causal pathways linking social determinant variables with health care system attributes, disease inducing behaviours and health outcomes. This approach provides an improved opportunity to identify and evaluate evidence-based public health interventions, and facilitates stronger links between modern epidemiology and public health practice."
9600005,"The aim of this study was to identify factors influencing high-risk illness behaviour in patients with bronchial asthma. High-risk illness behaviour was defined as 1. non-compliance with antiasthmatic medication and 2. delaying or avoiding medical help when facing airways deterioration or severe attacks. 150 patients with bronchial asthma were investigated; 60 of them had participated in the structured Asthma Treatment and Teaching Programme (ATTP), 90 had not taken part in such a programme by then. Using structural equation models, lack of emotional support by a key figure, poor doctor-patient relationship, and a negative cortisone image were identified as predictors of high-risk illness behaviour in patients who had attended ATTP, while in patients without participation in a treatment and teaching programme, only a negative cortisone image was predictive of this criterion."
12347150,"""A number of hypotheses concerning remittances from foreign emigrants are developed and tested using questionnaire survey data from Lala, a Lebanese village. According to the theory, a rural family engages in an implicit insurance-type contract with the potential migrant because both are averse to risk.... Results from testing the hypotheses are somewhat consistent with the proposition that, after a period of adjustment, migrants do begin to remit, thereby providing their families with an insurance against the uncertainties of life in the country of origin. However, the level of remittances does not appear to depend on the potential to inherit from a family's wealth. Moreover, families do not seem to invest in their migrants so as to improve their farm lands and to undertake risky agricultural techniques. The long-term remittance commitment of migrants to their residual families suggests that migrants' altruism may be a more significant motivating factor than self-interest."" (SUMMARY IN FRE)"
9323619,"OBJECTIVE: To examine determinants of moderate and severe obesity in children at 5 years of age. METHODOLOGY: A prospective cohort of mothers were enrolled at first antenatal visit, and interviewed shortly after delivery, at 6 months and 5 years. Detailed health, psychological and social questionnaires were completed at each phase by mothers, and child health questionnaires at 6 months and 5 years. At 5 years 4062 children were assessed physically, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test administered and mothers completed a modified Child Behaviour Checklist. Moderate obesity was defined as BMI between 85th and 94th percentiles inclusively, and severe obesity as a BMI greater than the 94th percentile. RESULTS: Independent predictors of severe obesity at 5 years were birthweight, female gender, maternal BMI and paternal BMI. Moderate obesity at 5 years was predicted by birthweight, paternal BMI and sleeplessness at 6 months, while small for gestational age (SGA) status and feeding problems at 6 months were protective factors for moderate obesity. Obesity was not associated with problems of language comprehension or behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study suggest that biological rather than psychosocial factors are the major determinants of obesity at 5 years."
15326465,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the major risk factors of overweight and obesity in prepubertal children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: In all, 32 primary schools in Kiel (248 000 inhabitants), northwest Germany. SUBJECTS: A total of 2631 5-7-y-old German children and their parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight status, socio-economic status (SES), parental overweight, dietary intake, activity, inactivity and further determinants (birth weight, breast feeding, nutritional status of siblings) of the children. RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight (>/=90th BMI percentile of reference) was 9.2% in boys and 11.2% in girls, respectively. Considered univariately, family-, environment- and development-related determinants showed some relations to overweight and obesity. In multivariate analyses parental overweight, a low SES as well as a high birth weight were the strongest independent risk factors of overweight and obesity in children. Additionally, there were sex-specific risk factors: parental smoking and single households were risk factors in boys, whereas a low activity was associated with obesity in girls. Birth weight was associated with obesity, but not with overweight. The prevalence of obesity reached 29.2% in boys and 33.4% in girls with all the three main risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight families of low SES have the highest risk of overweight and obese children. Future prevention programmes must also take into account sex-specific risk factors."
8336571,"A community interview scheme was designed to provide preclinical medical students with an opportunity to investigate the role of social and psychological variables in patient care and gain insight into interpersonal aspects of the interview process. Evaluation of the scheme showed that students and community interviewees found their participation valuable. Eighty per cent of interviewees were willing to take part in the scheme in the following year. The strongest predictor of willingness to participate was interviewees' rating of the extent to which they had enjoyed the experience. Students valued the opportunity to meet 'real people', to explore social and psychological determinants of health and illness and to develop communication skills. A significant positive change in perceived interviewing competence was observed. It is suggested that the scheme might be further developed by using feedback from interviewees to provide students with evidence of both their own skill development and the benefits of self-disclosure to the patients involved."
16848898,"BACKGROUND: Although there has been concern about the levels of carbon monoxide exposure, particularly among older people, little is known about COHb levels and their determinants in the general population. We examined these issues in a study of older British men. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 4252 men aged 60-79 years selected from one socially representative general practice in each of 24 British towns and who attended for examination between 1998 and 2000. Blood samples were measured for COHb and information on social, household and individual factors assessed by questionnaire. Analyses were based on 3603 men measured in or close to (< 10 miles) their place of residence. RESULTS: The COHb distribution was positively skewed. Geometric mean COHb level was 0.46% and the median 0.50%; 9.2% of men had a COHb level of 2.5% or more and 0.1% of subjects had a level of 7.5% or more. Factors which were independently related to mean COHb level included season (highest in autumn and winter), region (highest in Northern England), gas cooking (slight increase) and central heating (slight decrease) and active smoking, the strongest determinant. Mean COHb levels were more than ten times greater in men smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day (3.29%) compared with non-smokers (0.32%); almost all subjects with COHb levels of 2.5% and above were smokers (93%). Pipe and cigar smoking was associated with more modest increases in COHb level. Passive cigarette smoking exposure had no independent association with COHb after adjustment for other factors. Active smoking accounted for 41% of variance in COHb level and all factors together for 47%. CONCLUSION: An appreciable proportion of men have COHb levels of 2.5% or more at which symptomatic effects may occur, though very high levels are uncommon. The results confirm that smoking (particularly cigarette smoking) is the dominant influence on COHb levels."
